(Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)Nearly four months after President Joseph Savoie stepped down, the University of Louisiana at Lafayette has begun organizing the search to replace him. The UL System will convene a search committee in January and present finalists in late February, the system board announced Thursday.
The committee’s roster is in development but not final, UL System President Mark Romero told The Acadiana Advocate Thursday. The job will be officially posted in January and marketed nationally. The system published a website for the search last week.
UL Lafayette is currently led by Interim President Ramesh Kolluru, who replaced Provost Jaimie Hebert as interim last month. The system board was reportedly ready to forego a search and name Kolluru to the permanent post at last month’s meeting. Facing backlash, the board committed to a search.
Meanwhile, the university continues to hack its way through a substantial budget deficit revealed earlier this year. Kolluru told faculty and staff this week that further austerity is needed to close what remains of a $50 million gap.
After taking over as interim, Kolluru eliminated the positions of three top administrators and this week announced a leadership reorganization, elevating key staffers from his research division.
A longtime ULL employee and “honorary Cajun,” Kolluru has made no secret that he wants the permanent job.

The “Sound of Church” tour began in Vicksburg on Nov. 23. Services across the state are scheduled through Dec. 21.
Jerry Mannery, the choir’s executive director, said that the tour is an opportunity to spread the Gospel to the communities where its members grew up and lived. 
“We understand that we are first and foremost ambassadors for Christ, and secondly we are ambassadors for the state of Mississippi as well,” he said.
Lillian Lilly of Belhaven is a lead singer, a soprano and one of the original members. She said she felt the Holy Spirit directing her to join the choir.
Lilly said the choir is like a big extended family. She is one of several members whose biological relatives – her son, daughter and granddaughter – are also in the choir.
“It’s a real spiritual experience to sing in church,” she said.
“We’ve had a wonderful time.”
Yolanda Clay-Moore is the choir’s marketing director and soprano singer. She has performed with the choir since 2012. She moved to Brandon when she was 10, and the Mississippi Mass Choir’s music was a major part of her church experience growing up. 
Clay-Moore considers it an honor to be part of the choir and still considers herself a fan.
When asked what she hopes audiences will take away from the services, she said, “The number one goal is always to bring someone to Christ, or to reunite them with Christ.” 
Gospel singer Frank Williams founded the Mississippi Mass Choir in 1988. Today, the choir has 214 members, has released 13 albums and has numerous achievements, including four Grammy nominations and a Stellar Gospel Music Lifetime Achievement Award.
Mannery has been the choir’s executive director since Williams’ death in 1993. 
“Right now this is a very difficult time to live in, and people are really under a lot of pressure, and people are bound by a lot of things that are outside of their control,” Mannery said. 
“But we know that when the spirit of the Lord shows up through our songs, that it sets people free,” he added.
The remaining Sound of Church tour dates currently scheduled across the state are Dec. 14 at Jerusalem Temple Church in Philadelphia. and Dec. 21 at White Hill MB Church in Tupelo.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/05111856/DSC_8035.jpg,,,2025-12-13 09:57:33.666625

Mike Rogers (R-White Lake) and former Michigan GOP Co-Chair Bernadette SmithEstablishment Republicans in Michigan and nationally are counting out former state GOP co-chair Bernadette Smith in her bid to steal away votes, and maybe the nomination, from party favorite Mike Rogers. 
But sharp differences between the two on the Affordable Care Act, as the issue flares again in Washington, D.C., could give voters a clearer contrast in the race.
Rogers, a former mid-Michigan congressman who now lives in White Lake, is the frontrunner in the race for the Republican U.S. Senate nomination. Up until recently, he was the only big name politician worth pulling for in the race, but Smith’s exit from state party leadership to run against Rogers in the August primary has set up a challenge. 
Bernadette Smith makes her U.S. Senate bid against Rogers official

Republicans in Michigan doubt that Smith can gather enough signatures to make it to the ballot in Michigan, but if she does, and raises enough money to compete with Rogers, it could place a few speed bumps on his path to an easy party nomination.
Despite those challenges for Smith, she’s already tying herself to positions that Rogers opposes. That appears to now include the renewed fight on Capitol Hill over the Affordable Care Act’s expiring premium credits and subsidies.
Politico noted on Friday the policy difference between Rogers and Smith as Republicans fail to unify on a plan to either let them expire and offer a new plan, which focuses on the creation of health savings accounts; or to save the subsidies in the short term as the GOP works to maintain power for another cycle. 
That plan could buy the party some time to craft a suitable replacement to the government marketplace insurance program that has come to be known as Obamacare, which lawmakers have tried but failed mightily to replace with a new program since its inception.
That fight has created rifts in the GOP caucus and primary contenders, Politico reported, putting vulnerable incumbents at risk heading into the 2026 midterm elections.
Rogers, who has been endorsed by President Donald Trump, has advocated for a wholly new marketplace health care system. Meanwhile, Smith has advocated for the two-year extension to buy that time.
Gutting the Affordable Care Act, by killing the program altogether or chipping away at its core pieces to make the rest of the system unworkable, has proved unpopular with voters over the past nearly two decades, all in the face of repeated Republican attempts to do so.
Smith could be angling to catch independent-minded Republicans or those unopposed to the marketplace health care system, potentially pulling them away from Rogers who has taken a stance more in line with Trump and GOP leadership who again have the Affordable Care Act in their sights for repeal.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_1194-1024x579.jpg,,,2025-12-13 07:57:01.262305

(Photo by William Mancebo/Getty Images)The Washington State University football coach is one of the highest-paid public employees in the state. Yet WSU is bringing aboard its fourth head coach since 2020.
The Pullman school announced Friday that it was hiring Kirby Moore away from Missouri to replace Jimmy Rogers, who lasted less than a year.
The question now is whether Moore’s tenure will be different and usher in a new era of stability.
Moore, 35, has been the offensive coordinator at Missouri for the past three seasons.  
He grew up in the Yakima Valley town of Prosser, and is the younger brother of New Orleans Saints head coach Kellen Moore.
Kirby Moore was a wide receiver at Boise State from 2009-2013, then started his coaching career at the College of Idaho in 2014. Moore spent the next two seasons at the University of Washington, working as a graduate assistant and offensive assistant.
A press conference introducing Moore will be held next Tuesday. Terms of his contract were not disclosed.
“Coach Moore is the real deal, and exactly who we needed to propel us to the top of the new Pac-12,” WSU President Elizabeth Cantwell said Friday. “Our student-athletes have lucked out.”
Moore said in a statement that, “Becoming a first-time head coach at a special place like Washington State is a dream come true for my family and I.”  
WSU’s football coach is paid well over $1 million a year. Despite that salary, the position has seen recent turnover due to a combination of the pandemic and two ambitious coaches using WSU as a stepping stone.
The coaching turmoil comes as WSU seeks to stanch dropping enrollment while remaining relevant in the turbulent college football landscape. 
Cantwell has said repeatedly that a successful football program is key to reversing an enrollment decline of some 6,000 students at WSU in recent years. That starts with the right coach as Washington State University transitions to the new-look Pac-12 next season.
The highest-paid employees of the state of Washington are almost always the football and men’s basketball coaches at the University of Washington and WSU, each making well over $1 million per year. By contrast, Gov. Bob Ferguson makes about $230,000 annually.
Rogers was hired away from South Dakota State last winter for a salary of $1.57 million per year. He led the Cougars to a 6-6 record, and shortly after announced he was leaving for his dream job as head coach at Iowa State.
Prior to Rogers, Jake Dickert spent just over three years leading the Cougars, making about $2.5 million per year, before jumping ship last year for Wake Forest.
Dickert’s predecessor, Nick Rolovich, was hired in 2020 to replace the legendary Mike Leach. Rolovich coached during the COVID-shortened 2020 campaign, and was fired early in the 2021 season for refusing the state’s order that he get a COVID vaccination. Rolovich sued the state for $25 million, but lost in federal court.

The last football coach to spend any real time in Pullman was Leach, who was at one time the state’s highest-paid employee at $3 million per year. Leach led the Cougars to six bowl games in eight seasons before leaving after the 2019 season for Mississippi State, part of the powerful SEC. Leach died in 2022.
‘A job that coaches can have success at’
To be sure, the WSU job comes with some disadvantages. Pullman is a town of about 35,000 people located 75 miles south of Spokane in wheat farming country. It is far from the glitz of big cities, and recruiting top athletes there can be a challenge. Now that top players are demanding millions of dollars in “name, image, likeness” money to sign with a team, those difficulties are magnified.
Rogers this week insisted he did not intend to leave Pullman after one season, but could not turn down a job he had wanted for years.
“I didn’t take the Washington State job and move across the country to abandon it in one year. I didn’t,” Rogers said at his introduction Monday at Iowa State. “I took that jump because I believed in that product and what I could produce there.”
Rogers said that he would have liked to coach the Cougars in the Idaho Potato Bowl against Utah State on Dec. 22, but the administration decided an assistant coach would do that instead.
Complicating the problems at Washington State is that Athletic Director Anne McCoy was unceremoniously fired a few weeks ago by Cantwell for not raising enough in donations to the athletic department. 
For all the coaching changes, WSU’s football team has remained pretty good. The Cougars will go to their ninth bowl game in ten years this season, unprecedented success for the program.
“Washington State has proven time and again that it can be a job that coaches can have success at,” broadcaster and former Washington State quarterback Alex Brink said.
Cantwell has said the dramatic changes in the college football world that left Washington State behind require a coach who views name, image, likeness money and the transfer portal as strategic tools, not impediments.
Cantwell has also worked this year to improve the football fan experience in Pullman. That includes funding for a new scoreboard and other upgrades inside 33,000-seat Martin Stadium, in an effort to boost tepid attendance.
“We’ve got alcohol in the stands. We’ve got a whole plethora of things happening right outside the stadium,” Cantwell said. “Keep an eye on us. It’s getting better and better and better every game.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/WSU-cougars-football-1024x691.jpg,,,2025-12-13 07:57:01.262305

For more than two decades, Denise Lugo has worked as a home care worker in Fayetteville, North Carolina, caring for elderly clients in their homes.
Workers like Lugo provide intimate care for seniors and people with disabilities who cannot care for themselves. For what’s often grueling work, Lugo makes $15 an hour caring for two clients, juggling everything from light housekeeping to household errands to bathing, dressing and exercising.
But Lugo’s livelihood and that of 3 million home care workers across the country is now in peril under a proposal by the Trump administration to end their rights to federal minimum wage and overtime.
“Without my income from caregiving, I would be in the streets,” Lugo, who organizes with the National Domestic Workers Alliance’s We Dream in Black North Carolina chapter, wrote to the Department of Labor in an official comment on the proposed rule. “What would you do if one of your family members needed a home health aid and you can’t get one because you are not paying us enough?” she asked.
Workers like Lugo have been mobilizing against the Trump administration proposal, which reopens a loophole allowing employers to broadly classify care workers as “companions” who can be paid less than minimum wage and are not eligible for overtime pay. The fight has also energized workers’ efforts to push state and federal lawmakers to strengthen their rights even as federal ones are taken away.

Today, home care work is ubiquitous, with at least 9.8 million older adults and people with disabilities relying on care workers in order to stay out of institutional care. Indeed, home health and personal care work is one of the fastest-growing occupations in the country, projected to add nearly 740,000 workers between 2024 and 2034 — a jump of 17%. But without a federally mandated right to minimum wage and overtime, workers’ wages — and how easily employers can cut them — will vary depending on which state they are in.
“[T]his is going to create a patchwork of [state] laws,” said Anamaria Segura, an attorney at Getman, Sweeney & Dunn, a Kingston, New York-based firm that fights wage theft on behalf of workers nationwide, including home care aides.
At least one-quarter of all home care workers will lose their right to minimum wage and overtime under the Trump administration proposal because they live in states that have no additional wage protections for home care workers. Rights for the rest vary widely. In Pennsylvania, for example, state law guarantees minimum wage and overtime for the 94% of home care workers employed by agencies, but not the 6% directly employed by their client. Meanwhile, home care workers in New York have been entitled to minimum wage since 2010, when the state passed the first state-level Domestic Workers Bill of Rights.
If Lugo’s agency decides to classify her as a companion, it could legally pay her even less than the state minimum wage, which matches the federal rate of $7.25 an hour. She’ll be left with two options: take the lower wage — or quit.
The change, part of a suite of 63 deregulatory actions by the U.S. Department of Labor, is already effectively being implemented, said Mimi Whittaker, a legal fellow at the National Employment Law Project. Rulemaking is still in process, but leadership at the Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour Division instructed staff in July to immediately refrain from investigating home care agencies that had been charged with misclassifying workers as companions, and to drop any cases currently being considered.
The agency is “currently reviewing and considering the more than 5,500 comments received in the department’s proposal,” a Labor Department official said in an email.

Home care employers, particularly for-profit agencies, often exploited a “companionship” loophole that existed from 1974 to 2015, said Eileen Appelbaum, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. In 1974, the Labor Department extended wage and overtime protections to care workers unless they were “companions.” In 2013, regulators restricted the companionship definition and closed the loophole as of 2015.
Prior to the 1974 change, care workers had no rights to minimum wage or overtime pay, because Congress had excluded jobs primarily held by Black workers from the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. Today, the field is 84% female and 67% nonwhite.
The move to reopen the companionship loophole was “a handout to big corporations, the home care agencies, [which are a] powerful industry [with] a lot of private equity investment,” said Whittaker. The majority of home care agencies are for-profit, and an increasing share of them are run by private equity groups.
The Home Care Association of America, an industry group, “lobbied DOL extensively” for the rule change, according to an August newsletter for the roughly 3,500 home care agencies in its membership.
The association also provided members with a comment template that said the 2013 rule extending labor protections to home care workers “limited access to affordable home care by increasing costs and administrative burdens for home care agencies.”
The Home Care Association of America did not respond to requests for comment.
Home care industry experts expect the rule to be finalized soon. In September, before the government shutdown, attorney Angelo Spinola with the Polsinelli Law Firm told home care and hospice agencies that his “best guess” was that the rule would become effective in January.
Home care workers have pushed back against the proposed rule, the latest battle in a long fight to improve working conditions.
As soon as public comments opened for the July proposal, the National Domestic Workers Alliance, a worker advocacy group, coordinated 2,206 public comments from members and allies. The group also pushed to extend the comment period. On Aug. 25, the agency declined that request. The comment period closed on Sept. 2, with more than 5,500 comments submitted.
In a Sept. 2 letter to the labor secretary, Rep. Pramila Jayapal and more than 100 other Democratic representatives argued that the proposal would “jeopardize our nation’s care economy [and] destabilize an already underpaid workforce.”
Labor officials and attorneys general in Democratic-controlled states have also weighed in with comments, arguing that the proposal would put a greater burden on states to police wage theft.
The proposal has also energized existing fights for stronger federal and state protections.
At the federal level, 114 Democratic representatives have co-sponsored a National Domestic Worker Bill of Rights introduced by Rep. Jayapal in June. The legislation would guarantee care workers’ minimum wage, overtime and anti-discrimination protections through amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs wages and overtime, and the Civil Rights Act. Every House Republican and 98 Democrats have so far declined to co-sponsor.
Even if the bill doesn’t advance, said Whittaker, the effort can help build momentum in campaigns to expand state labor protections. That effort is further along in some states than others. Currently, about half of U.S. states have protections that at least partially close the loophole, although details vary widely.
In September, after a lobbying push by California’s United Domestic Workers and other caregivers, California passed a bill codifying home care workers’ overtime protections into state law. (Disclosure: UDW is a financial supporter of Capital & Main.)
Meanwhile, existing home care workers’ fights have taken on new urgency, whether with unions or worker centers.
In Washington State, home care workers with Service Employees International Union 775 advocated for a successful ballot resolution this election that backers say will increase funding for long-term care and, therefore, job security for care workers. (Disclosure: SEIU is a financial supporter of Capital & Main.) In Illinois, home care workers with SEIU Healthcare Illinois have demanded progressive taxation to fund senior home care threatened by Medicaid cuts in the Republican-backed federal tax law. In Michigan, 32,000 home care workers unionized with SEIU Healthcare Michigan this past October. And in Pennsylvania, home care workers with SEIU helped push the state legislature to pass a 2026 budget in November that includes $21 million to raise wages for care workers hired directly by their clients — the same workers left without protections thanks to the federal loophole.
And in Georgia, workers with that state’s We Dream in Black chapter have advocated for a bill requiring Medicaid-funded home care agencies to share data on wages, benefits, vacancies, and workforce demographics.

Angela Engram, a home care worker in Pittsburgh, worries the change could put an end to overtime pay she needs.
Engram works more than 60 hours per week caring for an elderly client who hires her directly. For doing “everything” for the woman she cares for, Engram said — grocery shopping, housekeeping, helping her get dressed, coordinating doctor visits and showing up at night if something is wrong — she makes $13.53 per hour. Thanks to overtime protections, she usually earns around $20.30 for every hour above 40 each week.
“I basically live off my overtime pay,” she said. But if she’s classified as a companion rather than a worker, she could lose it.
“I wouldn’t be able to eat without it, pay my bills without it,” Engram said. Her husband is disabled and unable to work. She gets health insurance through a subsidized plan on the Affordable Care Act marketplace. In October, she started requesting 90-day prescriptions, expecting that they will become unaffordable if Congress allows the subsidies to expire.
“Without the overtime, my goodness, there’s no way I can live off of $13.53 an hour,” Engram said. “I’m barely doing it now.

When I fire up the tractor before sunrise in Campbell, the hum of the engine takes me back to a different kind of power — the kind that used to surge through the aluminum cells at Magnitude 7 Metals in Marston before it closed its doors almost two years ago.
Back then, I worked nights surrounded by sparks and heat, helping turn raw ore into the lightweight metal that keeps America running. These days, I work the same Bootheel land at my neighbors farm, but the story hasn’t changed much: whether you’re smelting or farming, you’re fighting the same battle for affordable energy, steady pay and a future worth passing on.
When the Magnitude 7 Metals smelter closed nearly two years ago for the second time, hundreds of good-paying union jobs vanished overnight. Those were jobs that kept local diners open, hardware stores busy, and families rooted in this corner of Missouri.
I thought tariffs would keep us safe — after all, that’s what we were told in 2018 when President Donald Trump imposed Section 232 tariffs to bring our industry back from the brink. For a while, it felt like that might happen. The former Noranda plant restarted. Paychecks flowed back into our towns. But without addressing the root problem — sky-high electricity costs driven by our reliance on the aging New Madrid coal plant — tariffs, though helpful, are only a temporary patch.
Without investment in affordable, reliable power, tariffs won’t cut it. That’s why the gates at Magnitude 7 are still closed today.
The truth is, Missouri’s economy runs on the same current: whether you’re melting metal or tending crops, you need dependable electricity at a fair price. Down here in the Bootheel, farmers are struggling with the same energy problem that sank the smelter. High power costs drive up grain drying bills, squeeze irrigation budgets, and eat away at razor-thin margins. And most of that power still comes from the New Madrid coal plant, a costly system that’s left both industry and agriculture in a tough spot.
We’ve got what it takes to fix this. Missouri is rich in natural and human resources: flat land, steady wind, strong sun, and hardworking people ready to make a living. If we invested in renewable energy right here — from solar arrays outside Sikeston to wind projects across the state — we could lower costs, strengthen the grid, and give towns like Marston and Campbell a second chance.
Coal is still essential in the short term, since we lack the infrastructure to switch fully to renewables right away, but the transition has to start somewhere and coal won’t be around forever. Cleaner, cheaper power could help farms grow and maybe even bring primary aluminum production back to life.
America still needs aluminum, and it’ll need a lot more of it in the coming years. Every tractor, truck, and transmission line depends on it. And Missouri can play a bigger role in meeting that need, not by relying on quick political fixes like tariffs, but by giving workers and farmers the tools to compete with cleaner, more efficient energy.
Across America, data centers are booming, and billions in new investments are being proposed right here in Missouri. But for all that growth, these massive facilities won’t create anywhere near the number of steady jobs a smelter once did. What they will do is compete for the same limited supply of electricity — driving up demand and making it even harder for industries like aluminum and agriculture to afford the power they need to survive
Let’s stop pretending tariffs will rebuild our economy. The people who power Missouri — on the factory floor and in the fields — know what we really need: investment in affordable, modern energy that lets us work hard, earn fair, and stay rooted right here at home.
It’s been almost two years since the smelter closed, but I still think of the job and people I worked with every day. Every time I do, I think about how connected our struggles are in this part of the state. The lesson is clear: if we want to rebuild Southeast Missouri, we have to invest in energy that works for everyone — from the aluminum cell to the plow.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/smelter-1024x587.png,,,2025-12-13 06:56:20.327469

(MoMo Productions/DigitalVision via Getty Images)It’s a rare occasion when my worlds of biomedical informatics and serialized lesbian melodrama fandom collide.
But that’s exactly what happened earlier this summer when two of my favorite actresses appeared on a popular podcast. I was excited to hear them talk about their new book and their history of working together, so I was confused but delighted when their conversation took a turn toward my area of expertise — electronic health records.
One actress noted that on a recent trip to the optometrist, she was asked about her ethnicity. “And I was like, what difference does it make?” she said.
The host chimed in with her experience of being asked similarly personal questions before a mammogram. “Like, it doesn’t matter if I’m married or not. It doesn’t matter if I’m white or Asian, you know?” she remarked.
Listening to the host and actresses question a process that, to me, seems straightforward and purposeful served as a stark reminder of the chasm that often exists between how researchers like me use patient data and a patient’s actual experience of clinical data collection.
For those of us who use demographic data collected during health care encounters to conduct research and design interventions, it does matter whether patients answer their doctor’s demographic questions. But as a patient myself, I can see how these questions might seem unnecessary and even invasive.
So it may help to understand why your doctors collect this data, how researchers use it and what medical discoveries might be possible when we know more about who patients are.
 
Why your data matters
When you answer the demographic questions your doctor logs in your electronic health record, you’re doing more than disclosing personal information. You’re adding one small piece to a giant puzzle of data that allows researchers like me to see a bigger picture.
Your health information can help us understand who gets sick and why. It might even be used to design real health interventions.
As a researcher focused on improving health and health care for moms and their babies, I consider myself lucky to live in Indiana, a state with one of the nation’s most comprehensive health information exchanges. These exchanges are interconnected networks of hospital system electronic health record databases from all over the state that allow researchers like me to learn about how individuals and groups experience health and medical care.
For example, my colleagues and I in the Indiana University Better AI for a Strong Rural Maternal and Child Health Environment Lab use this data to train machine learning models that predict preeclampsia, a life-threatening condition of high blood pressure during pregnancy, before a mom gets really sick.
We could use only clinical data: diagnoses, labs and vital readings like blood pressure that contribute to the outcome of preeclampsia. But for conditions like preeclampsia, Black moms are diagnosed at higher rates than their white counterparts. Research shows that race and racism can be major contributing factors to this disparity.
In order to predict preeclampsia accurately and use these predictions to help doctors monitor, diagnose and treat the condition, my team needs to factor in other information that can illuminate these different outcomes, called social determinants of health.
Social determinants of health are the parts of ourselves and our environments that drive our health status. Race itself isn’t a social determinant of health, but racism is. This includes structural racism, like a ZIP code’s history of school segregation or redlining. If available, we also include information you might have given at your doctor’s visit, like if you haven’t had enough food to eat in the past month, or if you have a history of intimate partner violence or homelessness.
Because there is more variation within races than between them, race alone actually tells us very little. Including social determinants of health in our datasets provides added context as to how you move about the world, what resources you have access to and how your environment might shape your health.
 
Putting the pieces together

This is why your cardiologist asks about your marital status. Your response might help researchers understand why single moms are more likely to have cardiovascular disease than their married counterparts. And telling your optometrist your race is one of the only ways to learn what role race might play in patients using weight loss drugs experiencing vision loss.
Other researchers have used data from electronic records to determine how many people in a geographic area or of a certain demographic group have diabetes, to predict dementia and even to track gum disease.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers used data from electronic health records to determine what types of people were getting sick. They investigated COVID-19 patients’ race, geography and insurance status. Researchers continue to use this data to track long COVID, a condition that health professionals still don’t completely understand.
 
Honoring patient privacy
Of course, these health information exchanges are careful about how and with whom they share patient data. The data is tailored to the needs of the study and shared in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA.
For instance, for my most recent preeclampsia study, the health care system sent a dataset that contained limited pieces of personal information, like the baby’s birth date, the mom’s birth date — since we often need to know how old she was when she gave birth — and their ZIP code so we can see trends in preeclampsia across geographic areas.
The data wasn’t allowed out of the health system’s virtual private network, so the data remains within our firewall. This ensures that the data remains safe. And all of this must be approved by our university’s institutional review board, a rigorous process that ensures our research can’t harm participants.
 
Improving health care for everyone — including you
All of this research drives innovation and serves as a basis for the programs, protocols and policies that improve health — from you as an individual all the way to the national and even global level.
Your doctor can use the information you provide to recommend services or therapies for you. For instance, if your doctor finds out through check-in questioning that you haven’t had enough food in the past month, they can refer you to a nutrition program, sometimes run by the hospital system itself. If you were married at your last appointment but now list your marital status as “separated,” your doctor can check in with you to see if you need any additional mental health or social services.
While it’s normal for these personal questions to feel a little uncomfortable, it helps to remember that there is a good reason your doctor is asking them. Your data can help move medical research forward.

(Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Maryland’s revenue outlook for the coming fiscal year improved slightly in recent months, but nowhere near enough to stave off the “hard choices” lawmakers will face in the 2026 legislative session when they are dealing with a $1.5 billion budget shortfall.
State analysts told the Board of Revenue Estimates Friday that projected general fund revenues for fiscal 2027 inched up from $27.102 billion in September’s estimates to $27.111 billion in December — an increase of just $9.1 million
Board of Revenue Estimates Executive Secretary Robert Rehrmann said the updated forecast remains in line with September projections “despite the headwinds we face in Washington, D.C., … federal cutbacks, and also this general uncertainty about the economy.” He described the December update as “a kind of recalibration” of the state’s major revenue sources.
The new projection includes a modest increase in personal income taxes. Half of that is from capital gains, a volatile and difficult-to-project revenue stream. That increase is offset by reductions in sales and corporate income taxes.

The result is a $45 million increase for the current fiscal year and less than $10 million for the coming year.
Rehrmann warned of continued economic uncertainty including federal cutbacks — the extent of which will likely remain unknown until the next estimate in March — as well as signs of economic slowing that could be a possible recession.
Comptroller Brooke Lierman (D), who chairs the three-member board, called the forecast “positive news” but cautioned the revenue numbers “don’t tell the whole story of how our economy is functioning, and can obscure the realities that some of our friends and neighbors are facing as they struggle to afford basic necessities.”
“Maryland is certainly currently meeting its revenue expectations, but it’s important to acknowledge that those expectations, as I mentioned, were lowered due in part to challenges created by our own federal government,” she said.
Lierman noted that Maryland’s median annual income — more than $102,000 — stands “well above” the national average at the same time that nearly 40% of state residents are considered unable to afford basic necessities.
“These are families that are earning above the poverty line but still unable to afford essentials like housing, food, child care and health care,” Lierman said.
Credit card debt is higher in Maryland than the national average. Restaurants without beer and wine licenses are seeing declines, and supermarkets are reporting reduced sales of taxable goods, such as prepared meals.
The result is what Lierman called a K-shaped economy, where higher-income families do well and those on the margins struggle.
“Our general fund revenues remain steady, buoyed in part … by capital gains, and these trends reflect the reality of the K-shaped economy in Maryland,” Lierman said. “But instability among middle-income families will eventually impact our broader revenue stream — sales and use taxes, withholding revenue and other sources — that support our budget, because the K-shaped economy is simply not sustainable for our economy or society, and the work of government must reflect the lived experiences of Marylanders, not just our balance sheets.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Lawmakers return to Annapolis on Jan. 14 for a 2026 General Assembly with a very different budget outlook than the one they imagined at the end of the last session in April. Instead of the $300 million surplus forecast then, lawmakers will to close a $1.5 billion structural budget gap.
In a speech Thursday evening to the Maryland Association of Counties winter meeting in Cambridge, Gov. Wes Moore (D) took tax increases off the table for fiscal 2027. Acting state Budget Secretary Yaakov “Jake” Weissmann, a member of the revenue board, said Friday that means “the choices in front of us are difficult.”
House Majority Leader Del. David Moon (D-Montgomery), speaking Friday morning at the MACo conference, also said tax increases are unlikely in the upcoming session, the last session before the 2026 elections.
Moon and others have also said using the state’s rainy day fund could damage the state’s bond rating, making it more expensive for the state to borrow money.
“The bond rating agencies are breathing down our shoulders, threatening to raise our borrowing costs,” Moon said. “I would think we can’t be raiding rainy day funds and the like.”
But Treasurer Dereck Davis, the third member of the revenue board, said during the afternoon meeting that those rating agencies have little to worry about.
“Of course, the bills will be consistently paid,” Davis said. “So, for those from Wall Street who are worried about that, don’t. The bills will be paid, and they will be paid on time.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC_6425-1024x681.jpeg,,,2025-12-13 00:56:56.180001

Doug Jones kicked off his 2026 gubernatorial campaign Friday, mixing promises to protect health care and voting rights with attacks on likely GOP gubernatorial nominee Tommy Tuberville.
Speaking to more than 1,000 people on the eighth anniversary of his victory in the 2017 special U.S. Senate election, Jones, referencing a song by the country group The Highwomen, said he wanted to make Alabama a “crowded table” where everybody is welcome.
“It’s a powerful song about community, bringing people together despite their differences,” Jones said. “It is much like our victory in 2017, an anthem about finding strength in unity and ensuring that everyone has a place at the table and a sense of belonging. That, folks, is my vision for Alabama.”

Campaign promises

In a 45-minute speech, Jones pledged to invest in mental health to improve the state’s prison system; make it easier to vote and to protect in-vitro fertilization (IVF) and contraception.
“Make no mistake, folks, the people that work to try to control Montgomery every day, that’s what they’re coming for next,” Jones said. “It started with abortion, but they’re coming for IVF, and they’re coming for contraception.”
Jones’ reproductive health campaign promises stem from a greater promise to expand Medicaid, which he said is the backbone of the health care system. 
Jones attacked Tuberville over his support of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) and vote against extending tax credits for the Affordable Care Act, the loss of which could cause 130,000 Alabamians to lose health insurance. Jones also brought up questions of Tuberville’s residency in the state, which have dogged the senator for years. 
“Tuberville with this Donald Trump first and Alabama afterthought mindset, his blind support of what I call the anything but beautiful bill. Tuberville has been slamming the door on Medicaid expansion,” Jones said. “He doesn’t care about the health of Alabama families. He just cares more about what’s going on on the beach down to Santa Rosa.”
A message seeking comment from Tuberville’s campaign was left Friday afternoon.
If elected, Jones said he would expand Medicaid with an executive order if the Legislature does not do so. 
“We’re going to do everything in our power, everything to get health care to every Alabamian,” he said. “If that means expanding Medicaid with a stroke of the governor’s pen, I am damn sure going to do it.”
The governor can expand Medicaid by order, but the Legislature would have to approve funding for it. 
Jones also invoked his work as U.S. attorney, where he secured convictions against Thomas Edwin Blanton Jr. in 2001 and Bobby Frank Cherry in 2002 for the murder of four little girls in the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in 1963. Both men were sentenced to life in prison.
Jones criticized the state’s overcrowded prisons, saying some incarcerated people need mental health care instead.
“We talk a good game about mental health, but then we just warehouse folks in prison,” he said.
He also vowed to end straight ticket voting and to advocate for early voting. Democrats in the Legislature have tried for years to pass an early voting law, but are denied due to Republican critiques of voter fraud and operating costs. 
“What do you think they’re scared of? Are they scared that the wrong people are going to vote?” Jones asked the crowd. “Probably so, because that’s why they would rather suppress those votes rather than compete for those votes.”
Jones critiqued the state’s straight ticket voting system. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, the method allows voters to choose a party’s entire slate of candidates with a single ballot mark. Alabama is one of five states that uses the voting system.
“We have got to stop clinging to an antiquated, rigged system of outdated, straight ticket voting,” he said. “Straight ticket voting, which we know is nothing more than a rigged system to keep powerful people in power, even as they fail us every dang year.”

A lively crowd

Jones was preceded by DJ Slim Robb who energized the crowd with songs like “Bad to the Bone” by George Thorogood, “24K Magic” by Bruno Mars and “Sweet Home Alabama” by Lynyrd Skynyrd.
Singer-songwriter Jason Isbell, an Alabama native, played a three-song set before introducing Jones’ wife Louise as “the most important person” on the campaign. 
“I think if everybody who was running for this office was a good, honest person, I think Doug would still be a great candidate,” Isbell said.
Louise teased her husband on their 33rd wedding anniversary and his listening skills that she said he only puts to use at work.
“Even when the issues are hard and the stakes are high, he’s always believed that our state is strongest when every community has a voice,” she said. “Leaders put people ahead of politics.”
Three young supporters also spoke, saying they felt hopeful with Jones’ candidacy. Robert Gaines, Jr., a freshman at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, said that even when he was a child when Jones won the Senate seat in 2017, he could tell something important was happening.
“It means hope for greater transparency so the public is not left in the dark. It means hope for a real seat at the table for people like me. It means hope for me and my peers, who are often spoken about but not represented,” Gaines said of why he supports Jones.
Gaines’ mother, Marilyn Yelder, said in an interview after the event that Jones’ platform applies to her family. She said Gaines has Type 1 Diabetes and will soon lose their current health care coverage. 
“When it comes to Medicaid expansion, he will eventually age out of some of these benefits, which could leave us uninsured within the next year,” Yelder said. “This time next year, if something does not change, my son may not even be able to afford necessary medications that are needed to keep him alive.”
Caleb Rotton, a 37-year-old Homewood resident and longtime Jones supporter, said he was proud of Alabama representation for the first time when Jones was in the Senate and feels inspired again.
“I was just proud, for once, for one of our politicians to serve the people instead of themselves,” Rotten said in an interview.

An uphill battle
Democrats face a tough battle for statewide office in Alabama. Jones, who was the first Democrat to win election to the U.S. Senate in 25 years, is the only Democrat to win a statewide vote for a political office since 2008, when former Public Service Commission President Lucy Baxley narrowly won election to the PSC. The last Democrat to win the governor’s mansion was Don Siegelman in 1998. Siegelman served a single term.
Tuberville defeated Jones for U.S. Senate in 2020 despite Jones outspending Tuberville 3-to-1.
Rotton acknowledged the uphill battle for any Democrat in Alabama, but believes that Jones can appeal to voters who may not be enthusiastic about voting for Tuberville.
“I think Doug can appeal to that voter, which is, in my mind, the only way that I think a Democrat could probably win in the state,” Rotton said.
Rep. Philip Ensler, D-Montgomery, attended the event and said in an interview he felt the excitement in the room and for himself.
“Look, people are energized. As he said, it’s bigger than Democrat or Republican,” Ensler said. “Whatever people’s political background, I think they really are feeling frustrated with the status quo. They want something that’s going to be forward thinking. And I’m excited.”
Senate Minority Leader Bobby Singleton, D-Montgomery, also attended the event.
“Doug and I go way back. We’ve known each other for a long time. I support Doug,” Singleton said in an interview.

Primary landscape

Jones joins Will Boyd and Chad “Chig” Martin in the Democratic primary, which is on May 19. Throughout the event, Jones focused more on the general election in November. However, Jones said in an interview after the event that he is going to run an aggressive campaign in the primary and the general.
“I want people to compare my record of service to the people of Alabama, to all sections of the people of Alabama, versus the service that may or may not exist with my opponents,” Jones said.
Martin is a first time candidate and Boyd has run for several state offices but has not won. In an interview Friday afternoon, Martin said having Jones in the race is good for voters.
“The more competition the better. I think that’s better for the citizens in Alabama,” Martin said.
A message seeking comment from Boyd was left Friday afternoon.
“On that election day in 2017 we gave the people, not just in Alabama, but across this country, something even more significant. We gave them hope for a stronger democracy,” Jones said. “And today, eight years later, we’re rekindling that hope, that optimism, that enthusiasm. Let’s face it, there is a greater urgency for hope today than there was in 2017.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC_0848-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-12 23:56:39.160535

(Screenshot)Aaron Christian Peterson is one step closer to becoming Alaska’s next federal judge.
In a party-line vote on Thursday, the U.S. Senate’s judiciary committee voted 14-8 to advance Peterson’s nomination to a vote of the full U.S. Senate.
Unlike Alaska, where prospective state judges are nominated by a nonpartisan panel based on merit, federal judges are nominated by the president and subject to confirmation by the U.S. Senate in a heavily politicized process.
Because the U.S. Senate is controlled by a Republican majority, Peterson’s confirmation process is not expected to be significantly contested.
Peterson, selected by President Donald Trump in October after being vetted by U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, was among seven prospective judges and federal prosecutors considered by the committee on Thursday.
Peterson is a former attorney with the Alaska Department of Law’s natural resource division and has served as a prosecutor. He is a U.S. Air Force veteran, registered Republican and a member of the Federalist Society, whose members generally follow Republican legal principles and support President Donald Trump..
Much of the discussion in the committee hearing focused on other nominees; Peterson was rarely mentioned and did not face any particular opposition, similar to his uneventful confirmation hearing last month. 
Alaska has three federal judgeships; two are currently vacant. One of those vacancies was caused in 2024 when former judge Joshua Kindred resigned amid a sex-and-misconduct scandal after being appointed during Trump’s first term. 
No one has yet been nominated for Alaska’s other vacant judgeship.
Speaking generally, the judiciary committee chair, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said on Thursday, “I’d like to process even more judicial nominations, but I’m waiting on the president to get those nominations up here.”
Peterson’s final confirmation vote is expected before the end of the year.

Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan joined Senate Democrats and a handful of other Republicans on Thursday in voting to extend federal subsidies that would have prevented a major spike in health care prices at the end of the year.
Sixty votes were needed to advance a bill containing the extension, but the vote failed 51-48. An alternative Republican-backed bill, which would have offered marginal help to offset the cost increases, also failed despite support from Murkowski and Sullivan.
Barring additional action before Jan. 1, thousands of Alaskans and millions of Americans who buy health insurance through the federal marketplace will pay significantly more for health care next year.
“I would just suggest that we have failed,” Murkowski said in a floor speech following the votes.
Sullivan, in a written statement, said in part that “there is little doubt that a lot of hard-working Alaskans, families, entrepreneurs and small business owners will be negatively impacted if these enhanced premium tax credits expire.”
Both Murkowski and Sullivan said they would continue working to try to find a compromise before the end of the year.
The failed Democratic proposal would have offered a flat three-year extension of subsidies that were put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic emergency and extended during the Biden administration.
Most Republican senators opposed a flat extension and emphasized instances of fraud and abuse, saying that further changes were needed to the program. 
Even with those changes, the Republican-backed proposal offered only a small cash payment and didn’t extend the subsidies; many Americans and Alaskans would still face large cost increases.
“Now that both the Republican and Democrat proposals failed to advance, I will redouble my efforts to develop a compromise solution. In the longer-term, we need to focus on getting federal government health care dollars out of the hands of insurance companies and into the hands of the people,” Sullivan said in his statement.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-12-at-11.07.51 AM-1024x602.png,,,2025-12-12 20:56:36.966618

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota Ethics Commission member Murray Sagsveen has withdrawn his application for another term after a selection committee deadlocked over his reappointment. 
Sagsveen withdrew in a Thursday letter to Gov. Kelly Armstrong, obtained by the North Dakota Monitor. However, Sagsveen says he’ll continue serving until his seat is filled.
Armstrong, part of a three-person Ethics Commission Selection Committee, had refused to reappoint Sagsveen. The other two committee members, the Senate majority and minority leaders, want Sagsveen to remain on the commission. The positions are required to be filled by a unanimous consensus, leading to a stalemate.
“It has dragged on for several months and it’s in the best interest of the Ethics Commission that a person be appointed for a full four-year term,” Sagsveen said in an interview Friday. “It was obvious to me that it was an impasse.”
Ethics commissioner does not have the support to keep serving, governor argues

The governor sent Sagsveen a letter on Nov. 19 that did not directly ask Sagsveen to resign, but said his service “is no longer necessary” because the Ethics Commission now has enough members to operate without him. Armstrong told Sagsveen he no longer has “consensus to continue serving past your expired term.”
Sagsveen’s term ended Aug. 31 but he has continued to serve while the commission had three vacancies.
Sagsveen requested an opinion from the Ethics Commission’s general counsel, Logan Carpenter, on whether it was legal to continue serving until he is reappointed or a successor was named. Carpenter concluded it was. 
“I was following the guidance of the Ethics Commission’s general counsel,” Sagsveen said. “However, after September, October, November and into December, with no resolution and it appeared there would not be a resolution, that’s when I decided to withdraw my application.”
He said he is hopeful ongoing conflicts between the Ethics Commission and the executive branch can be solved through better communication between the various stakeholders. 
“There should be continuing dialogue among everyone,” Sagsveen said. “The legislative branch, executive branch, the governor, the attorney general.”
Armstrong has said the Ethics Commission needs a “general reset.” Armstrong said he strongly disagrees with a response Sagsveen gave during the selection process in which Sagsveen said the North Dakota Legislature has passed laws to limit the commission’s authority, in violation of the state constitution. The governor also has said a recent Ethics Commission advisory opinion encroached on the authority of the legislative and executive branches. 
Sagsveen, a Bismarck attorney with extensive government experience, notes in his letter that his public service to North Dakota began in January 1973. He was appointed to the Ethics Commission in September 2024 to fill the remainder of a term for a member who retired. 
The legislative leaders supported Sagsveen to promote continuity on the commission, with Senate Majority Leader David Hogue identifying Sagsveen as his “top pick.”
The Ethics Commission Selection Committee has one vacancy left to fill and is set to meet Tuesday afternoon. The next meeting of the Ethics Commission is Wednesday.
The committee also recently appointed former Office of Management and Budget Director Pam Sharp and Fargo attorney Mark Western to positions on the Ethics Commission.

(Photo: Nevada Department of Conservation and Natural Resources)State officials are offering no explanation for why Nevada State Engineer Adam Sullivan, who was appointed as the state’s top water regulator in 2021, is suddenly leaving his role at the Nevada Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR).
Sullivan, who also served as administrator of the Department’s Division of Water Resources, was responsible for managing Nevada’s limited water resources as the state engineer, including settling disputes over water claims and issuing permits for housing developments.
Former deputy administrator Chris Thorson will serve as the new acting administrator for the Division of Water Resources, according to a spokesperson for the DCNR.
Spokesperson Jenny Jackson did not provide further details about the reason for Sullivan’s departure or clarify when exactly Sullivan left his role.
“The Department is now focused on strengthening Nevada’s water management and ensuring a smooth leadership transition,” Jackson said.
Gov. Joe Lombardo’s office did not respond to a request for comment Friday. 
Sullivan was named Acting State Engineer in November 2020 under former Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak, when the previous state engineer, Tim Wilson, retired after 25 years of state service.
Sullivan has worked on water policy in Nevada for more than 20 years and served various roles within the Division of Water Resources since 2009.
He played a pivotal role in a Nevada Supreme Court case last year that affirmed the state’s right to manage interconnected sources of water as a single source in order to protect senior water rights and wildlife.
The consequential Nevada Supreme Court case – Sullivan v. Lincoln County – determined the state engineer had the statutory authority to merge multiple water basins into one superbasin, a decision that will likely have a profound impact on the way groundwater is managed in the state going forward.
Sullivan said the case would have sweeping ramifications for Nevada, but that full implementation of the ruling may take some time.
Lawmakers expressed concern about the implications of the case on the state economy. Last year, state lawmakers introduced Assembly Bill 387, a bill that would have clarified the state’s authority to deny water permits based on the potential for conflict between surface water rights and groundwater rights. 
But large water users — including real estate developers and mining companies — pushed back on the bill, arguing the state was attempting to exceed its authority and curtail water rights.
The Nevada Supreme Court ruling essentially does the same thing the bill would have accomplished, Sullivan told lawmakers in the months following the ruling.

“While these requests may seem like normal oversight, the federal government is using its power to try to intimidate states and influence how states administer elections ahead of the 2026 cycle,” Aguilar said.
“It’s my duty to follow Nevada law and protect the best interests of Nevadans, which includes protecting their sensitive information and access to the ballot,” Aguilar said, adding “the Constitution makes it clear: elections are run by the states.” 
The DOJ announced Friday that it was suing Nevada, along with Colorado, Hawaii, and Massachusetts, bringing the total number of states the administration has sued to obtain voter data to 18.
Trump’s Department of Justice has been pestering Nevada and several other states over much of the year seeking unfettered access to private information about voters, including drivers’ license numbers, addresses, and the last four digits of Social Security numbers.
In March, Trump issued an executive order requiring states to turn over their voter rolls to the Department of Justice, ostensibly in an effort to expose those registered in multiple states. 
In July, responding to a DOJ letter, Nevada provided a version of its statewide voter registration list that is generally available to the public. In August, the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division again requested full access to Nevada’s complete statewide voter registration list, including sensitive personal information.
In August, Nevada responded that it would conduct an analysis of the legal authority for the government’s request. In September, Aguilar refused to share the complete voter registration list, contending the DOJ request was unjustified. 
In November, federal officials acknowledged that the DOJ shared voter information with the Department of Homeland Security to search it for noncitizens as a way to “scrub aliens from voter rolls.”
Later in the month, Aguilar joined a group of Democratic secretaries of state sending a letter to the DOJ saying they were concerned the administration misled them about how it would use voter data collected from their states, and seeking clarification of the DOJ’s motives.
Aguilar said his office hadn’t been served the suit as of Friday, adding his office and that of the Nevada attorney general “are working together to evaluate this litigation from the federal government.”
The Trump administration’s “full access to unredacted voter data will not only violate privacy laws”, said All Voting is Local Nevada State Director Kerry Durmick in a statement Friday. It would also “enable large-scale voter challenges, false claims of fraud, and new attempts to impose proof-of-citizenship and other burdensome requirements that could disenfranchise millions of eligible voters nationwide, including hundreds of thousands of Nevadans.”
“These tactics have long been used to suppress participation, particularly among communities of color, students, and working-class voters, Durmick said. “This lawsuit is an obvious weaponization of our institutions against everyday Americans, and Nevadans will not stand for it.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Voting_053024rc_014-1024x697.jpg,,,2025-12-12 19:57:49.401122

(Photo by jackyenjoy photography/Getty Stock Image)Transportation options impact our everyday life. They affect how we plan our day, what time we leave our homes, what time we’ll be back and how much time we have for other things. What we often overlook is how transportation infrastructure, and the way our communities are designed, impacts our health (both physical and mental).
Although many Marylanders rely on our highway system to get around, the way we traditionally plan highway projects comes with many externalities – indirect costs not accounted for when budgeting the project – such as more pollution, increased vehicle crashes and lack of affordable mobility choices.
Vehicles are a major contributor to ozone pollution and the largest source of carbon emissions, which in turn fuels climate change. Additionally, dust from brake pads and tires releases particulate matter pollution (including soot). Air pollution triggers asthma symptoms, diminishes lung function, triggers heart attacks, causes adverse birth outcomes and increases the risk of cancer as well as premature death.
I’ve seen firsthand how this impacts urban communities like Baltimore City, where my daughter grew up and had to frequently carry an inhaler with her. In several places I’ve lived and worked in the city, it was common to see a layer of black dust on furniture due to particles in the air.

Visits to emergency departments for asthma are much higher in locations that are in violation of federal air quality standards for ozone, including Baltimore City and Baltimore County. Additionally these emergency department visits for asthma are much more frequent — nearly five times higher — among Black children aged 2-17 years compared to white children. When we build projects intended to increase driving, we often fail to account for the costs of dealing with these health impacts, especially for communities located near highways.
Not only does how we design highway projects impact our health, it also impacts our safety.
Last year there were 571 people, including 159 pedestrians or cyclists, who were tragically killed in a car crash in Maryland. Encouraging more driving and car-dependent infrastructure increases the risk of such crashes. When a four-lane highway becomes a six-lane highway, a pedestrian has to cross a wider distance with more cars, more noise and more car exhaust.
Luckily, policies like the Transportation and Climate Alignment Act (TCA) that will be introduced again next year by Del. Mark Edelson (D-Baltimore City) and Sen. Shelly Hettleman (D-Baltimore County) can help combat these issues. The Transportation and Climate Alignment would require that Maryland mitigate the harmful pollution from new highway expansion projects by investing in transit, pedestrian and cycling infrastructure as part of the project itself, or prioritize these investments in the area where the project is located.
Spending time in Bruges, Belgium, I recently got to see firsthand what a car-free downtown looks like – vibrant with people walking and biking everywhere. My daughter and I took a city shuttle, a train, the subway, bikes and a bus, only opting for cars (which were electric) twice.
If we focus on helping people get to destinations safely and conveniently rather than cars moving as quickly as possible, then we can start to solve the real problem – whether that is a jobs-to-housing imbalance or lack of amenities (grocery stores, parks, health care, etc.) near where people live.
All communities benefit from infrastructure that helps people walk, bike or take transit. Each Maryland county (including Baltimore City) annually sends a “priority letter” of key projects to fund. Nearly every county has been requesting transit, bike or pedestrian options – whether that is a Southern Maryland Rapid Transit project in Charles County or the implementation of a first fixed-route transit service in Garrett County.
These investments boost our physical and mental health, making it easier to get physical activity and improving access to nature and social activities. They are also good for our pocketbooks given that gas prices and car maintenance cost people thousands of dollars each year. In fact, transportation is the second-largest household cost after the cost of housing in Maryland.
We can plan better and healthier by building infrastructure and policies. Legislation like the Transportation and Climate Alignment Act help steer us in the right direction.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2165387463-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-12 19:57:49.401122

In June 2025, the Iowa Board of Nursing charged Jodi Lynne Kneisel of Mason City with practicing nursing while under the influence or while impaired by the use of legitimately prescribed drugs; with engaging in behavior that is contradictory to professional decorum; and with pleading guilty to, or being convicted of, a crime related to the profession of nursing or a crime would impact the licensee’s ability to practice.
When the board filed the charges against Kneisel, it alleged she was working at a care and rehabilitation center in Mason City during the period when the violations were alleged to have occurred.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
However, in the board’s written settlement agreement of the case, the board states that Kneisel, a registered nurse, was working as a travel nurse and was on assignment in Council Bluffs, Cedar Falls and Norfolk, Nebraska, in 2023 when the alleged incidents took place.
According to the settlement agreement, Kneisel had worked three shifts at Methodist Jennie Edmundson Hospital in Council Bluffs in August 2023 before she was fired. On each of her three shifts, she was alleged to have been found sleeping, the board said.
In one instance, Kneisel’s colleagues allegedly had to wake her up after she’d been found sleeping on duty for more than an hour. In another instance, she was allegedly found sleeping in a bed inside a room designated for patients, and later that same shift was found asleep in a hallway.
In December 2024, the board alleges, Kneisel “admitted to having a couple prior to a nursing shift in Norfolk, Nebraska.” The board documents don’t indicate what Kneisel admitted to having consumed.
Also in 2024, the board alleges, Kneisel was accused of being impaired “during a nursing assignment” somewhere in Cedar Falls.
In April 2025, the board alleges, Kneisel pleaded guilty to a drunken driving charge in Decatur County and was placed on probation and awarded a deferred judgment in the case.
As a result of the settlement with Kneisel that the board agreed to in November 2025, Kneisel has been issued a warning indicating that engaging in such conduct in the future could lead to sanctions. As part of that same settlement, Kneisel has agreed to enroll in the Iowa Practitioner Health Program for professionals with substance-abuse issues.
The board imposed no restrictions on Kneisel’s ability to practice nursing in Iowa.
Two more arrests this year
Although the board’s settlement agreement makes no mention of it, court records indicate Kneisel was arrested two more times after receiving the deferred judgment on the drunken driving charge.
Court records show the first of those two arrests was on May 8, 2025, when Kneisel was charged by the Osceola Police Department with driving while her license was revoked. Court records indicate Kneisel acknowledged the offense and agreed to a 48-hour jail sentence for contempt of court.
Two weeks after that arrest, on May 23, 2025, Kneisel was arrested in Holt County, Missouri, and charged with driving while revoked, driving while intoxicated and failure to drive on the proper side of the roadway.
Court records show a Holt County officer fielded a report of a driver who was “swerving all over the roadway, almost striking vehicles.”  The officer pulled over the driver, who he identified as Kneisel.
According to a probation officer’s subsequent report of the incident, Kneisel’s blood-alcohol level was above the legal limit, and while en route to jail she admitted to police she had been drinking alcohol for breakfast that morning.
Kneisel’s probation officer has recommended to the court that if the allegations surrounding the May 23 arrest are proven, Kneisel’s probation should be revoked and she should be sentenced to jail.
A hearing on the matter is scheduled for Jan. 9, 2026.
Court records indicate that as of October 2025, Kneisel was still working as a hospital nurse.

A spokesperson for Verizon said Friday the company plans to fix cell service for East Glacier as soon as weather allows, estimated to be Monday or sooner, after an outage of nearly a week.

The site on top of Mt. Baldy to the south of East Glacier has been impacted due to extreme weather, the spokesperson said.

“The site went off air on Sunday, and we have been attempting to reach the site for repair throughout the week, but the weather conditions have made it unsafe to do so,” said Aimee Knox with Verizon in an email.

Friday, the National Weather Service was forecasting rain, snow and freezing rain, along with wind gusts as high as 29 mph. The chance of precipitation was 70% with 1 to 3 inches of snow possible.

The weekend is forecast to be “breezy,” also with high wind gusts up to 55 mph on Sunday night. However, Monday is expected to be partly sunny, although rain is forecast after 11 a.m. and wind is expected in the afternoon.


“Currently, our only access to the site for repair is via helicopter, and the winds and ice have made it unsafe for the helicopter to fly,” Knox said in an email. “We have the equipment and material in hand to restore service, and we will repair during any break in weather possible, currently targeting Monday. If the weather cooperates, we will accelerate into this weekend, if at all possible.”

Impacted customers are able to connect via WiFi calling and satellite, with satellite-capable devices, according to Verizon.

“911 calls continue to go through as we have back-up measures in place to ensure customers have access to emergency services,” Knox said. “We appreciate your patience as we look to restore service as soon as it is safe to do so.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1309931930-1024x705.jpg,,,2025-12-12 19:57:49.401122

(Daniel Montaño/KUNM)A New Mexico agency’s request to the Legislature for the upcoming legislative session seeks $2.9 million plus funding for additional caseworkers to reduce the high number of mistakes it makes administering a federal food assistance program on which roughly one in five New Mexicans rely.
The funding for more caseworkers and new technology is necessary, officials say, to catch errors the Income Support Division makes in overseeing roughly $1 billion a year in federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits. The state’s administration of SNAP is facing renewed scrutiny from Republicans, who recently convinced majority Democrats in the Legislature to approve an audit for fraud in the program. Preliminary results of that audit are expected in January.
But even if the Legislature fully funds the Income Support Division’s request, state officials don’t plan to immediately implement a plan to fix all those mistakes. That’s because the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” President Donald Trump signed in July would effectively penalize the state for doing so, Division Director Niki Kozlowski told Source New Mexico on Friday.
Trump’s signature spending bill contains penalties for states that don’t lower their SNAP “error rates.” That’s a calculation of the number of SNAP over- or underpayments the state makes. New Mexico’s rate is 14.6%, among the nation’s highest. 
Niki Kozlowski, director of the Income Support Division at New Mexico’s Health Care Authority, said Dec. 12, 2025 that she has to perform a “balancing act” to reduce the SNAP error rate significantly, but not before October of 2026. (Courtesy HCA)
Under the law, states with high error rates are required to pay a portion of the total SNAP benefits they receive. That marks a huge change and cost for the program that the federal government usually fully funds. 
Kozlowski’s “first order of business to attack” when she took the helm at ISD in May 2024 was lowering the rate. Heading into 2025, she said she was making steady progress and had identified a number of reforms, putting the agency on track to bring the error rate to under 10% by 2026. 
That’s come to a halt due to a unique provision in the federal spending bill. Any state with an error rate above 13.3% — New Mexico is one of eight — has until Oct. 1, 2026 to lower their rates. But if New Mexico lowers its rate before then to below 13.3% but above 6%, it will no longer qualify for additional time and could face as much as $153 million in penalties.
Kozlowski and her staff refer to the provision as the “Alaska range” based on national reporting that Alaska’s U.S. senators only agreed to support the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” if their state — which has the nation’s highest error rate — received additional time to address the situation. The “Alaska carveout,” as Kozlowski calls it, ended up applying to all the nation’s highest error-rate states, including New Mexico.
“It doesn’t feel, I don’t know, comfortable,” Kozlowski said about the new holding pattern. “It feels like we should still be working on it. So I think my status is that we are still working on it, but we’re taking a more strategic, streamlined approach.”
NM food banks say they will struggle to provide meals for those who lose federal benefits

According to the HCA, about 93% of all the errors are overpayments; the rest are underpayments. Roughly one third of those errors are “agency caused,” like a miscalculation of a benefit or use of outdated client information. The rest are “client caused,” like failing to report a change in household size or income level.
There’s also little room for error in the error rate, Kozlowski said: Incorrect payments are counted even if they’re only a dollar too much or too little.
New Mexico’s high rate error rate, officials say, also results partially from the COVID-19 pandemic, during which the federal government waived client interview requirements, as well as six-month check-ins, during a crush of new applications. Those requirements have been back in effect since October of 2024. 
Caseworkers also largely lack experience, Kozlowski said, and are tasked with determining eligibility for households’ seeking Medicaid, utility assistance and SNAP, among other federal programs, all at once. 
That makes for a complicated process for half of New Mexico’s caseworkers who have been employed at HCA for fewer than three years, Kozlowski said.
Finally, the state has a long-standing practice, at least since the pandemic, of accepting “self-attestation” from households regarding their costs for rent, utilities and childcare, Kozlowski said. All those costs are factored into SNAP and other benefit offers. “Self-attestation” makes for a simpler process, but errors are more likely, Kozlowski said.
Food banks see sharp increase in demand amid federal SNAP uncertainty

So next October, when the Health Care Authority tries to stick the landing of its long-planned “balancing act,” Kozlowski said the biggest error-rate reduction will result from more verification of documents from recipients who “self-attest,” along with technological improvements. 
The division is seeking about $28 million during the upcoming legislative session to hire more caseworkers and pay for a new IT system.
If the Legislature funds it, caseworkers will have access to a much-improved information technology system that assists them in interviews, ensures they check all the right boxes, and monitors the number of mistakes an employee makes, according to the HCA. Caseworkers who make too many mistakes will be identified for repeat training, Kozlowski said. 
IT upgrades and a boosted workforce, Kozlowski said, are two of the ingredients she needs to drastically reduce SNAP payment mistakes. The third is a culture that ensures caseworkers take accuracy seriously. 
“It comes down to that personal accountability culture of, ‘Am I being thorough in everything that I do?’” she said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/download-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-12 19:57:49.401122

Long-anticipated raises for thousands of Minnesota nursing home workers will be delayed because the Minnesota Department of Human Services failed to complete the necessary steps to receive approval and funding from the federal government.
Nursing home workers expected to see their pay increase around $2 per hour on average on Jan. 1, as approved by the state’s new Nursing Home Workforce Standards Board more than a year-and-a-half ago.
The board, which was created in 2023 by the Democratic-controlled Legislature, voted in April 2024 to approve four hourly minimum wages to take effect 2026: $22.50 for certified nursing assistants; $23.50 for trained medication aides; $27 for licensed practical nurses; and $19 for all other nursing home workers. The board also voted to raise minimum hourly wages an additional $1.50 in 2027.
It’s not clear when workers will receive those raises but it will be at least three months.
“We weren’t fully aware of the state rule that required approval by Dec. 1 in order for the new wages to be enforceable,” said Kristy Graume, director of state government relations at DHS at a meeting of the board on Thursday. “We certainly share in your frustration and we apologize.”
DHS started the process of securing federal approval on Monday. The agency posted notice of the proposed changes to Medicaid reimbursement rates that will fund the raises, which starts a 30-day public comment period. After that, the agency can submit its request to the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which has at least 90 days to review the application. After federal approval, the higher reimbursement rates funding the raises can start 30 days later.
That means workers are looking at April at the soonest for raises to kick in.
Graume said federal officials assured her they don’t foresee any problems securing approval, although she acknowledged “anything is possible.”
DHS plans to pay nursing homes the higher reimbursement rate retroactive to Jan. 1. The Minnesota Legislature already appropriated an additional $37 million to fund the raises in its 2024 health and human services budget bill.
Jamie Gulley, a board member representing workers and president of SEIU Healthcare Minnesota & Iowa, said he hopes nursing homes will then retroactively pay workers the higher rate, although it would be voluntary.
Gulley said during Thursday’s meeting that the Jan. 1 date was always a target, and their work has been delayed before.
“We’re doing a big complicated thing to improve the industry, raise wages, try to get some stability in the workforce,” Gulley said. “It’s regrettable, but some patience is in order.”
The board also mandated 11 paid holidays for nursing home workers which took effect this year and survived a legal challenge from the nursing home industry.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/senior-man-wheelchair-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-12-12 18:58:15.898922

Among superintendents across Vermont and the establishment in Montpelier, the drumbeat against Burr & Burton Academy in Manchester is becoming more strident and punitive. The chorus demands that the school become a public institution and misleads Vermonters with fallacious charges. There are yowls from that establishment that Burr & Burton costs more.  Nonsense. The tuition rate is the average of all Vermont high schools for the many sending towns surrounding it, according to a letter distributed by the school to its community. And guess what? On top of that, no taxes are levied for capital improvements as said admiring residents consistently contribute enough to cover them. Why does the establishment do that, and what are they afraid of? 
In one word – success.  Burr & Burton is beloved by parents, students and residents. It provides a great education, introduces innovative programs and graduates students with a path to whatever direction they and their families choose that best suites them. Burr & Burton is also the major economic driver for the area as parents from elsewhere move to the area specifically to send their children to it. 
It’s telling that those who can’t compete have set out to diminish Vermont’s premier secondary schools.  This is a power grab. Don’t fall for it.

ICE says it has agreements with eight Minnesota sheriff’s offices — called “287(g) agreements” — to assist with immigration enforcement. It’s unclear how many of those agreements have been approved by county boards. 
The Crow Wing County Board did not approve the agreement between its sheriff’s office and ICE, Capt. Adam Kronstedt from the Crow Wing County Sheriff’s Office told the Reformer on Friday. 
Rick Haaland, chair of the Cass County Board of Commissioners, told the Reformer that the County Board had not approved the 287(g) “that I know of” and referred the Reformer to the county administrator for more information. The county administrator did not immediately return a message Friday. 
Staff in the six other counties with ICE agreements were unable to immediately answer whether their county sheriff had sought board approval.
Brian Evans, press secretary for the Attorney General’s Office, said the new legal guidance calls into question the existing 287(g) agreements that have not received county board approval, but did not respond to a question about what the impact would be on counties with such agreements. 
“I cannot comment on individual agreements,” Evans said.
Ramsey County Attorney John Choi requested the attorney general’s opinion in November.  
While ICE can delegate state and local law enforcement agencies the authority to perform certain immigration enforcement tasks, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said in a February legal opinion that they may not detain people solely on an ICE request, called a “detainer.” That’s true even in counties that have 287(g) agreements, Ellison’s office clarified Friday.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/NN250603_0080-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-12 18:58:15.898922

Theo Wells-Spackman is a Report for America corps member who reports for VTDigger.
Beta Technologies has added 300 staff members to its Vermont-based workforce in recent months, and plans to add roughly 1,000 more in the next 18 months, company CEO Kyle Clark told reporters Friday.
The announcement comes a month after the electric-aircraft company debuted on the New York Stock Exchange, raising over $1 billion. The projected surge in recruitment for the company would roughly double its Vermont workforce since earlier this year, a company spokesperson confirmed.

“We intend to continue to grow in Vermont,” Clark said. “The nucleus will stay here.”
In June, Beta employed roughly 900 people in total, according to company filings. As the company’s workforce rapidly expands, Clark said he expects about 90% of his staff to remain based in Vermont.
So far, Beta’s Vermont-focused manufacturing plans have also involved purchasing some technical materials like circuit boards or composite materials for aircraft from locally based businesses, Clark said. 
Clark cautioned that the projected expansions are potentially subject to change as the company moves forward. Last month, in the midst of the company’s initial public offering, he predicted that Beta’s Vermont footprint would eventually “hit a limit.”
“We have to grow responsibly,” Clark said Friday.

Right now, though, there is more demand than the company can meet, he said. Earlier this month, Beta signed a supply contract with electric-aircraft developer Eve Air Mobility that could last up to 10 years and be worth up to $1 billion.
At Friday’s press conference, Clark said he had seen a number of young Vermonters who had initially left the state for work applying to job openings at Beta.
“They come back,” he said. “That’s a trend that we’re seeing.”
Last month, the company held a career day in South Burlington for local young professionals and students, which was attended by hundreds.
Information about how much of the company’s current in-state workforce had been recruited locally was not immediately available, the spokesperson said. Clark noted that employees hired through Beta’s internship program — roughly 90 people — are about 40% Vermont residents and 40% University of Vermont attendees or graduates. 
For new hires who are moving to Vermont, Clark said the company offers temporary residences to offset the difficulties of the state’s housing market.
At present, openings on the Beta website range from a workforce coordinator role with a salary of roughly $60,000 to a “Technical Support Lead” job with compensation up to $185,000.
Clark said the company had taken steps to make the company attractive to young professionals. Beyond paying employees “well,” he said, all staff hold some equity in the company and have access to significant upward mobility through promotions. The expansive South Burlington campus also features complimentary meals, onsite medical services and a tire-change facility.
The company is also advertising for a new director at a proprietary “Beta Kids” child care center.
“We want the best people,” Clark said.

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)LINCOLN – Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen said Friday that the state is reviewing the impacts of a recent executive order by President Donald Trump that seeks to stop states from regulating artificial intelligence and to limit related legislation in the future.

Trump signed the order late Thursday, saying it’s to keep the U.S. competitive with China in the race for dominance in the burgeoning AI industry.  The order instead favors a federal framework for the technology. 
 “It’s got to be one source. They can’t go to 50 different sources,” Trump said during a signing ceremony. 
Some policy experts question the legality of the order, which also establishes a federal task force to monitor state AI laws and challenge them in court as well as directing the Commerce secretary to complete a review of state laws approved within the past three months.
Nebraska, this past legislative session, passed two laws: one that bans AI-generated child pornography and another that provides civil liability for sharing AI-generated or computer-generated intimate images without the depicted person’s consent. 
State Sen. Brian Hardin of Gering was behind the bill, now turned into law, that bans AI-generated child pornography. It passed 46-3 as part of Legislative Bill 383. The law that provides civil liability was championed by State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Omaha and passed 49-0. 
DeBoer said she doesn’t see a conflict with the executive order and her legislation, and hopes the state law can stay in place.
“I welcome any conversation about common sense protections we can provide our constituents and hope the executive order leads to a national framework ensuring protection for children and individuals’ privacy,” she said.

The executive order said the federal framework “would ensure that children are protected, censorship is prevented, copyrights are respected, and communities are safeguarded.” When the Examiner asked Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers if the two recently-passed state laws would be under that federal framework, his office said it didn’t have a comment on the matter. 
Other proposals focusing on AI consumer protection and banning political deepfakes are still in statehouse committees. Democratic State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha, who proposed regulations on deepfakes, said Trump’s “ban on states regulating AI only serves billionaire tech CEOs.” 
“Here is yet another example of how he’s only looking out for his own interests and those of his cronies, while working people, democracy, and trust in government, pay the price,” said Cavanaugh, who is running for U.S. Congress in a crowded Democratic primary field for the 2nd District.
Pillen, a Republican, shared different thoughts, saying he appreciates the president’s approach as the order “does not appear to be as sweeping or disruptive as some had feared…this order specifically protects measures by states, including Nebraska, to ban AI-generated child porn.”
Pillen was one of the 17 Republican governors who opposed a congressional AI moratorium on state-based AI laws pushed by Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. That proposal was removed from Trump’s budget and tax bill earlier this year. It would have prohibited states from regulating artificial intelligence for the next decade.
All 50 states and territories have introduced AI legislation, and 38 states have adopted about 100 laws this year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The move by the Trump administration has been characterized as a win for tech companies that have lobbied against regulating the booming technology sector.

However, emergency managers told Gov. Greg Gianforte they were not aware of any lost structures.

Friday, the National Weather Service said moderate to heavy rain is in the forecast for western Montana early next week with a risk of more flooding and rock and landslides.
It said some rain, sun, cloud and fog are forecast this weekend.
Monday through Wednesday, the Weather Service said rainfall could total up to 1 to 2 inches for Lincoln, Mineral, and Sanders counties, and 2 to 3 inches in the mountains.
“Due to already saturated ground, particularly in northwest Montana, this rainfall increases the risk of rock and landslides, stream and river rises, and minor flooding,” the update said. “Continue to monitor the latest forecast updates as this system approaches.”
Thursday, Gianforte issued an executive order declaring a flooding disaster in northwestern Montana. The order means general fund money can be spent to meet needs from the floods.
A news release Friday about the briefing said since Dec. 8, the Fisher and Yaak rivers have experienced “significant rises due to historic rainfall and snowmelt.” It said by Thursday afternoon, the Yaak River had risen roughly five feet, “putting it above the eight-foot flood stage,” and the Fisher River was nearing minor flood stage.
Montana Disaster and Emergency Services Northwest District Field Officer Ed Greiberis, Lincoln County Sheriff Darren Short, and incident public information officer Zach Sherbo offered the update, the news release said.
The Farm to Market Road Bridge over Libby Creek sustained damage that resulted in its failure, the news release said. The Montana Department of Transportation said the bridge approach has eroded by 200 feet, and inspection will take place after water recedes.
In a social media post, American Red Cross of Montana said it is operating a shelter at Wilkinson Hall, part of the Libby Assembly of God Church, for people who are flooded out.
“Red Cross volunteers and supplies are on site and ready to support anyone who needs assistance. Red Cross services are free and available to all,” the Red Cross said. “People who need to evacuate large animals can take them to the rodeo grounds at J. Neils Memorial Park on Montana Highway 37 in Libby.”
A boil order remains in place in Libby for water used for drinking, brushing teeth, cooking and dish washing.
In an update Friday, Lincoln County Emergency Management officials reminded people to avoid flooded roads — even if water looks shallow —  and to stay away from riverbanks and give emergency responders space to work.
The news release from the Governor’s Office said Gianforte had planned to attend the briefing in person, but he attended remotely because of inclement weather.
“I appreciate the swift response of our State Emergency Coordination Center and local incident management teams and thank those working around the clock to respond and recover,” Gianforte said. “The state stands ready to help.”

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)Agriculture and construction industry representatives on Friday backed a proposed federal rule limiting federal authority over wetlands, ditches and groundwater, while others said protecting those areas is essential. 
The Trump administration is proposing a narrower definition of Waters of the U.S., a term that has proven slippery to pin down where federal authority over waterways ends. It is key to the Environmental Protection Agency’s enforcement of the Clean Water Act, passed in 1972. 
The EPA listening session was in North Dakota at Bismarck State College, hosted by Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., and the EPA. Cramer said the proposed rule provides clarity, prevents federal government overreach, and is in line with the most recent Supreme Court decision on the issue, Sackett v. EPA in 2023.  
“I’m really grateful that this administration, and (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin, unlike the Biden administration, has crafted a rule within the confines of the law,” Cramer said.  
Property developers said the broad rules under the Biden and Obama administrations delayed the permitting process and added to the cost of projects.
Several comments on Waters of the U.S., or WOTUS, centered around the prairie pothole region of central North Dakota. 
Cramer and other supporters of the new rule said landowners should not have to worry about needing EPA approval to farm land that might only have standing water in the spring. 
Gary Krapu, a wildlife researcher who also owns a farm in North Dakota, lamented the loss of wetlands in the state. He said shallow wetlands are the most critical habitat for waterfowl but are the most in danger of being drained. 
“The proposed regulation will be most threatening to the many migratory birds that either breed in the northern Great Plains or pass through in migration,” Krapu said.

Ron Henke, director of the North Dakota Department of Transportation, said road construction would benefit from the final EPA rules including a “broad and clear exclusion of roadside ditches” from being under federal jurisdiction. 
He said he expects transportation departments in neighboring states to join North Dakota in filing comments asking the EPA to make that clear. 
Michelle Emmons, co-executive director of the Willamette Riverkeeper group in Oregon, gave an opposing view. 
“Roadside ditches function as rapid delivery pollution pipelines,” said Emmons, one of several people from other states who provided comments remotely. 
While some comments said the rule would protect personal property rights, Dean Wilson of Louisiana said his state is concerned about protecting people and the environment from the actions of others in the Mississippi River basin. 
He cited pollution from agriculture and the draining of wetlands that contribute to flooding and hurt wildlife habitat. If upstream actions harm the Port of South Louisiana, it affects the whole country, he said. 
“Our freedom ends where the freedom for our neighbors starts,” Wilson said.
Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., said the proposed rule would “empower states and local communities to effectively manage local water resources while protecting property rights, ensuring economic growth and fostering environmental stewardship.”
The listening session was the first of three for the proposed rule. Another listening session is planned for Monday in Pittsburgh and a virtual session planned for Tuesday. 
Comments also can be submitted at regulations.gov or by email to CWAwotus@epa.gov.
The comment period ends Jan. 5. 
North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong said he’d rather see the environmental regulation handled at the state level.
“We know how to do this,” Armstrong said. 
Dave Glatt, director of the Department of Environmental Quality, also spoke in favor of the change, saying that state law covers areas that the EPA has not.

Debra Mays-Jackson, former vice president and chief of staff at Jackson State University, alleges that despite being qualified to lead the historically Black university, she was passed over in 2023 in favor of a man with less experience. IHL trustees had claimed qualified immunity, a legal protection from liability for government officials, in an effort to dismiss the case. 
In its ruling Wednesday, the 5th U.S. Court of Appeals affirmed a U.S. district court’s previous decision that Mays-Jackson had adequately pleaded an equal protection violation. The federal appeals court ruling affirms that the lawsuit can continue, and not whether any discrimination occurred. 
John Sewell, a spokesman for the IHL board, said trustees do not comment on pending litigation. Lisa Ross, Mays-Jackson’s attorney, told Mississippi Today she had no further comment. 
For now, Mays-Jackson’s case will return to the federal district court, where it will proceed discovery, summary judgement or trial. The 5th Circuit judges will not weigh in on the final ruling or decision of the case.

VERNON — On a chilly November afternoon, people representing organizations across Windham County filed through the door to Vernon’s Governor Hunt House Community Center. Inside, staff of the Good Energy Collective, a think tank and research organization based in Sacramento, California, greeted participants who had come to help researchers answer a question: “Can siting for nuclear waste facilities truly be community-centric?”
As the participants headed toward a table filled with coffee and sandwiches, they paused to read flyers tacked to bulletin boards about present-day Vernon: yoga classes, bone builders and Bingo night. Outside, a steady rhythm of clangs and bangs from heavy equipment echoed from the former Vermont Yankee nuclear power station as contractors carried on decommissioning the dormant plant.

Entergy, Vermont Yankee’s former owner, donated the historic Governor Hunt House, previously used as office space for the plant, to the community as a parting gift in 2020 when it sold Vermont Yankee to NorthStar for decommissioning. One workshop participant noted that the Governor Hunt House felt to her like the only tangible community asset left from the 40-plus years the plant was operational.
On Nov. 20 and 21, two cohorts of community members attended the workshops, part of an initiative of the U.S. Department of Energy, which has contracted with 12 consortia to conduct the research on designing an effective process for communities interested in hosting a site for spent nuclear fuel.
The DOE says it is developing a set of evidence-based guidelines for “a collaborative process that would enable the successful siting of a federal consolidated storage facility (CSF) for spent nuclear fuel.” In a news release in 2024, the federal agency said a CSF would initially store 15,000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel.
Describing itself as “making the progressive case for nuclear energy in a just, climate-friendly future,” the organization takes the position that “nuclear energy has a vital role to play in a just energy transition.” The organization believes that key to the nuclear waste issue is fostering partnership and collaboration between a potential host community and the DOE.

“At GEC, we put communities at the center of our research and policy work because understanding local perspectives is essential to advancing nuclear energy thoughtfully and effectively,” the organization wrote.
Yucca Mountain repository site in limbo
The DOE, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and other federal agencies have been sued over the government’s failure to fulfill its obligation to take nuclear waste.
A site at Yucca Mountain in Nevada was proposed in 1987 and approved by Congress in 2002. But with development of the country’s single centralized spent-fuel storage site having reached a standstill, the DOE has shifted its focus to the creation of one or more CSFs, explained GEC’s executive director, Erik Funkhouser.
The shift came after a 2012 Blue Ribbon Commission recommended that the U.S. seek a site to replace Yucca Mountain and apply a collaborative-based siting model to the process. Rather than identify a site and seize the property for a top-down development, the commission urged what the DOE calls a “consent-based process” — for communities, industry, government agencies and nongovernmental organizations to work together in the process to develop a solution with far less rancor.
Currently, 70 temporary storage sites host spent nuclear fuel in the country, he added, but managing the waste is “unwieldy” and raises national security concerns. On day 1 of the workshop, participants answered survey questions that gauged their thoughts and feelings about nuclear issues. They also discussed the risks and benefits of hosting a CSF and what participating in a siting process might entail for the potential host community. The groups ended the day outlining principles and guidelines to steer a siting process.
Day 2 included a dive into community engagement issues, including effective trust-building and information-sharing methods. Participants worked through an ideal governance structure and a model to gauge a community’s interest in hosting a CSF. As the workshop progressed, participants also dove into what structure a potential siting should take and the types of information that communities would need to make a decision.
Participants looked at the DOE’s process outline and shared thoughts on what steps they thought it missed and what groups — federal, state, community, consultants — should take responsibility for different tasks.
As these conversations unfolded, participants raised concerns — like how to ensure that all community members are heard. Some people may not trust that the federal or state governments will treat local communities fairly, they pointed out, and some members may outright reject nuclear power and its waste. Still others may care only about what deal they can get for their town, they said.
Participants suggested that the community and its trusted partners — for example, consultants, planning commissions and the state — have the most input at the beginning and end of the vetting process. Technical issues such as conducting environmental impact studies, preparing technical outlines, or conducting economic studies should fall under the purview of the federal or state government, the groups concluded.
With a waste product like spent fuel, which has a half-life of thousands of years, workshop participants said the community engagement should not stop at the yes-no decision of becoming a host community. The process also needed to allow for communities to renegotiate their agreement with the DOE. As nuclear technology improves, host communities should be able to receive upgrades at their spent fuel pads, the participants concluded.
Another suggestion from Vernon’s workshop participants was to fund an ombudsperson to represent the community. One participant said he felt the outlined process would push communities to say yes.
Viewing nuclear power as ‘essential’
Since its founding in 2020, GEC has received multiple grants related to nuclear energy and climate change, including a $600,000 grant from the MacArthur Foundation to address nuclear issues.
Given the scope of issues around the energy grid and climate resilience, why is GEC putting all its ducks behind nuclear?
The first reason, Funkhouser said, is that “there’s a lot of eyes on the other areas, and not enough people watching the till for nuclear.”
After the workshop ended, he added that GEC wants to see nuclear done safely. He said the organization defines itself as progressive and wants to responsibly decarbonize the energy grid without leaving communities behind. “We also think that some of the affordability and responsibility around decarbonization itself were really overlooked — or have been until probably recently,” he said.
He believes that core marginalized communities in the U.S. and abroad are especially vulnerable “when it comes to increasing power prices, increasing risks in the grid.”

Funkhouser has written that “nuclear energy is essential to decarbonizing the power sector, and meaningful community buy-in is indispensable — and achievable. We believe firmly that the United States can do both.” 
In his opinion, nuclear is one of only a few energy sources — such as geothermal, hydro and total carbon capture natural gas — that are clean sources that can be accessed anytime they are needed to meet demand. Funkhouser added that he believes that ensuring a steady baseload power source is one of the necessary ways to avoid “one of the biggest social problems in the energy transition itself.”
“Renewables are doing well, but we have to have base load until we can get seasonal storage figured out,” he added.
According to Funkhouser, GEC and the other 12 members of the consortia have agreed to different scopes of work with the DOE. GEC has undergone a “piloting” phase of its work with the department, where “we were making sure that the ideas we had for how to bring these insights out were going to be robust in practice.”
The workshops represent “the end of the final stage of that,” he said. GEC went through a few steps to find workshop participants.
For the first cohort of the day, the organization recruited people it learned about during the piloting phase. For the second group, staff used what Funkhouser described as a “spatial map” to identify potential participants from throughout the area based on randomized addresses in towns whose ZIP codes fall within a 10-mile radius of Brattleboro.
From there, GEC invited a small sample group. Attendees were compensated $540 for participation in the workshop.
Small community, big memories
Vernon’s nuclear history filtered through the conversations. The plant may be closed, but some residents shared their memories as a host community. Participants listed some positive memories — the money the plant invested into the community, time spent with neighbors who worked at VY and how the plant gave the town an identity.
Negative memories also emerged: weathering the opinions and ire of people who did not even live in Vernon; what they characterized as the meddling of state and federal officials with their own agendas; and municipal decisions arrived at after deep study — say, by the planning commission — but which went ignored by “everyone else.”
For people not at the workshops, Funkhouser said, it’s important to understand that the sessions served solely to gather information and not as part of a DOE process to select or vet prospective communities for storing nuclear waste as a CSF.
In fact, the town already hosts the spent fuel left from the Vermont Yankee operation, he pointed out.
Funkhouser also hoped the Vernon community understands that it is unique: For most areas with current or former nuclear plants, those operations have large footprints and are located near other institutions — such as a naval base. They generally are found within communities of 600,000 people.
The Vermont Yankee region is small in comparison — between 45,000 and 50,000 people live in all of Windham County, according to U.S. census estimates. Yet Vernon and the surrounding communities are highly organized in their knowledge and attitudes toward nuclear power, Funkhouser said.
As the workshop wrapped at the end of the second day, he commented that it was a pleasure working with everyone and he appreciated the local depth of knowledge of nuclear issues and appreciated how seriously participants took the process, as well as their insight into what a community-based process would look like.

In Bloomfield, the Davis County Community School District closed schools Friday after there was a confirmed case of whooping cough at one of the district’s elementary schools.
The school district’s administrative and health team said in a social media post Friday schools will reopen Monday as the district has worked with local and state health officials “to address exposure to whooping cough within our schools.”

Staff and students identified as potentially having close contact or exposure to the disease in the school district have been notified, according to the post.
“Everyone identified has been contacted and provided guidance from local and state Health and Human Services,” the social media post stated. “Please monitor your household for the symptoms listed in the previous letter and follow the recommended steps if anyone becomes ill.”
Whooping cough, also known as pertussis, is a highly contagious illness that can resemble a common cold but leave an infected person with a cough that lasts weeks or months, according to the Centers for Disease Control. The CDC recommends vaccination to prevent whooping cough, in addition to treating the illness with antibiotics to prevent serious infections.
In Moulton, the Moulton-Udell School District canceled classes on Dec. 9 and 10 “due to an extremely high percentage of students and staff out with illness,” according to a social media post from the district. KCCI reported roughly 30% of the district’s students and staff were absent, many of whom contracted influenza A, a strain of the flu.
Flu shots are still currently available at many pharmacies and health care providers, and are formulated to provide protections against Influenza Type A and B viruses, according to the CDC.
These are not the only schools experiencing high rates of illnesses in Iowa. The state Department of Health and Human Services reported in its weekly Iowa Respiratory Virus Surveillance Report from Nov. 30 through Dec. 6, there were four schools with at least 10% illness rates in Iowa, calculated using daily student absences and sentinel school weekly illness totals. Two schools in Appanoose County, one in Johnson County and another in Scott County reached this 10% threshold to be included in the report.
After the first flu death of the year in November, an older adult from southwest Iowa, Iowa HHS advised Iowans to consider vaccinations and other precautionary measures like good hygiene practice and keeping children home from daycare or school if they have symptoms like a fever, cough, congestion, runny nose, or sore throat.
According to Iowa HHS data, roughly 26.7% of Iowans have received flu vaccines for the 2025-2026 flu season.
As people gather to celebrate holidays, State Medical Director Dr. Robert Kruse said in a statement that Iowans should take steps to keep themselves and loved ones healthy this winter.
“To keep those celebrations, our workplaces and our communities safe and healthy, I encourage everyone to stay home when feeling sick and to talk with your healthcare provider about vaccination,” Kruse said.

Environmental group’s public records request shows few residents took the initiative to respond, and those who did were critical and 'embarrassed' by the Trump administration’s effort.
The post Interior Secretary Burgum asked public land users to flag ‘negative’ depictions of American history. Wyoming criticized the effort instead. appeared first on WyoFil[...]","During the opening weeks of the Trump administration, the president issued an executive order vowing to restore “truth and sanity to American history.”
Trump sought to undo what he contended was the Biden administration’s “revisionist movement” that “fosters a sense of national shame” and casts “founding principles and historical milestones in a negative light.” Critics panned the controversial decree as an effort to whitewash and turn a blind eye to the lesson-worthy realities of American history, like slavery, segregation and the conquest of Indigenous people and land. 
The U.S. Department of the Interior complied two months later, with Secretary Doug Burgum putting out his own more specific order. He directed the agencies he oversees to: “ensure that all public monuments, memorials, statues, markers, or similar properties within the Department’s jurisdiction do not contain descriptions, depictions, or other content that inappropriately disparage Americans past or living … and instead focus on the greatness of the achievements and progress of the American people.”

Burgum required the National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management and other agencies to post signage with QR codes allowing the public to assist in “compliance with this Order.”
Some of the responses have recently been revealed. Through a Freedom of Information Act request, the Sierra Club acquired public comments submitted to the Bureau of Reclamation and Bureau of Land Management.  The environmental group posted those remarks online. (BuRec comments here; BLM comments here.)  
A review of submissions disclosed so far shows that no comments submitted in Wyoming aimed to help Trump and Burgum. Instead, they used the opportunity to bash the administration’s efforts.
More than one response to a Bureau of Reclamation placard came to the defense of the Heart Mountain Interpretive Center, which memorializes the camp outside of Cody where Japanese Americans were interned against their will during World War II. 
How awful that our own federal administration is so sensitive to be afraid of truth.” Public comment
“The center does a remarkable job of upkeeping the grounds and providing accurate information,” one respondent to a Wyoming sign wrote. “The only thing embarrassing are these signs you keep putting up. How awful that our own federal administration is so sensitive to be afraid of truth.” 
Another passerby, who came across a Heart Mountain placard, took time to air similar grievances. 
“The Interpretive Center is excellent; it stands as a memorial to those wronged, and as a reminder to the damage that hate and discrimination can cause,” the commenter wrote. “This sign and form, however, are an embarrassment.”

The commenter questioned the motivation behind the effort. 
“Are you so insecure that you can’t admit that wrongs have been committed?” the commenter continued. “The US is far from a perfect country, and trying to sweep our wrongdoings under the rug and deny they happened is a disservice to every citizen. You should be ashamed.” 
At Pilot Butte Reservoir, near the site of a recent history-rich tribal land dispute, a commenter made a more mundane observation: “Someone stuffed trash into the grill at the picnic table.” 
The only other comment submitted at a Bureau of Reclamation site also concerned upkeep and amenities at the federally owned, but Wyoming-administered Keyhole State Park: “This park needs a dedicated kayak/paddle board launching area,” the remark stated. “And a better maintained and cleaned beach area.”
At Wyoming’s Bureau of Land Management sites, the public wasn’t any more accommodating of the Trump administration’s desires to purge ignoble portrayals of American history. 
Another respondent took time to weigh in using a QR code posted at the BLM’s Poison Creek area and suggested the administration ought to cut it out: “All signs in Wyoming recreation sites should stay historically accurate and the BLM deserves the funding and resources to maintain all sites,” the person wrote.

At Warren Bridge, near the Green River headwaters, a seemingly glib comment urged the Trump administration to better fund crippled federal agencies at a time when the government was doing the opposite and laying off scores of federal workers.
“ITS INCREDIBLE!” the commenter wrote. “Everything is positive about past and living Americans but they need more money here for upkeep and conservation. More money!!!”
Only one other person took the time to share thoughts via the QR codes posted on BLM land in Wyoming. The submission came at Boulder Lake, along the west slope of the Wind River Range, and praised how nature and industry coexist. 
“We’ve seen lots of different wild animals, along with horses and cattle,” the commenter wrote. “I think this is what makes America great … that small farmers and ranchers can prosper while partnering with the BLM and NFS and preserve nature and recreation for all Americans!!”

Statewide, no comments released so far suggested respondents agreed with the Trump administration’s approach to “restoring truth and sanity to American history.” The remarks submitted in the Equality State largely aligned with those the Interior Department received nationwide, according to a Sierra Club statement.
“These responses show that Americans overwhelmingly reject the Trump administration’s attempt to sanitize history on public lands,” said Gerry James, deputy director for the organization’s Outdoors For All campaign. “Public lands belong to all of us, and the stories they tell must reflect the full story of our shared past.” 
The Sierra Club is still awaiting public records from the National Park Service, Bureau of Indian Affairs and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Those Freedom of Information Act requests were submitted in July, according to Deputy Press Secretary Ginny Roscamp.

Also visible are, from left, Dan Satterlee, director of the state Division of Criminal Investigation, and Sam Olson, Minneapolis field office director for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. (John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)A state-funded campaign that’s put dozens of extra state troopers on city streets this fall put 75 people in jail during patrols in Huron, Belle Fourche and Yankton, the South Dakota Highway Patrol said Friday.  
Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden announced the “Operation Prairie Thunder” in July as a two-pronged initiative that he said would improve public safety. 
One piece of the operation involved the expansion of cooperation with federal immigration officials, in part by signing additional agreements between U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the state’s Highway Patrol and Department of Corrections. South Dakota National Guard troops were also assigned to process ICE paperwork in Sioux Falls and Rapid City.
The other prong of Rhoden’s campaign was framed as an effort to target drug trafficking in the Sioux Falls area, a move welcomed by city officials during a July press conference, but that put pressure on the Minnehaha County Jail and the county public defender’s office through a crush of arrests. The first operation forced the jail to transport ICE detainees to other facilities to make space for suspected drug offenders.

The state patrol also misstated its arrest numbers in its initial reporting on its work in Sioux Falls, conflating arrests with citations, referring to the latter as arrests even when the person cited was never transported to jail. The patrol pledged to separate the figures in future reports on the operation.
Troopers have conducted six saturation patrols in Sioux Falls since Rhoden’s July announcement.
In a press release Friday, the Highway Patrol announced that it  concluded another set of saturation patrols in Huron, Yankton and Belle Fourche on Dec. 5.
Troopers jailed 75 people in total across the two operations, according to the release — 42 on drug charges and 33 on non-drug charges — and 19 people were charged with drug offenses but not detained.
The patrol interviewed 25 people on behalf of ICE, the release said, 21 of whom were held for the federal agency. 
Huron patrols generate concern
In a statement, Rhoden said the saturation patrols “are getting drugs off the streets and putting criminals behind bars – first in Sioux Falls, and now we’re protecting even more communities.”
The state did not announce in advance plans to shift its focus from Sioux Falls to other cities. 
In Huron, among  South Dakota’s most diverse cities on a per-capita basis, the November patrols raised concerns for the city’s Hispanic community, according to Republican state Rep.Kevin Van Diepen, who’s also a former police chief.
He said many residents believed that ICE — not state law enforcement — was behind the saturation patrols in the city of 14,000.

“There were a lot of (social media) posts telling people to stay home,” Van Diepen said of the November patrols. “If they stop somebody and they get arrested on drugs, people are going to assume that it’s ICE.”
ICE representatives have not responded to inquires from South Dakota Searchlight on operations in Huron. 
Mayor Mark Robish told Searchlight “there were no ICE agents in town.”
“It was all Highway Patrol,” the mayor said.
Spokespeople for the Rhoden administration and highway patrol did not immediately respond to questions about when and why it moved the patrols out of Sioux Falls, if there are plans to target other communities, and what the total cost for the patrols has been so far.
The city of Brookings, meanwhile, posted a news release on the city website warning residents that Operation Prairie Thunder would arrive in that city on Dec. 17. 
“The City of Brookings will not be participating in these operations,” the release said.

Free.,US House GOP preps health care bill for vote before new year,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-gop-preps-health-care-bill-vote-new-year,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. House Republicans released a health care bill Friday evening they hope will help curb rising costs, though the measure doesn’t have the level of Democratic support needed to get through the Senate. The 111-page bill will likely move to the House floor next week, where Speaker Mike Johnson will need nearly every one of his members to vote to pass the legislation, an uphill battle given the vastly different views among centrists and far-right members of the party on health care issues. The Louisiana Republican said in a statement the bill offers “clear, responsible alternatives that will lower premium costs and increase access and health care options for all Americans.”Democrats have been pressing for a three-year extension of the enhanced tax credits for people who purchase their insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. So far, House and Senate Republican leadership hasn’t gotten on board with any extension of those subsidies, arguing they have led to a sharp rise in the cost of health insurance. GOP lawmakers have instead pursued their own legislation, but without at least some backing from Democrats, no bill will make it through the Senate’s 60-vote procedural hurdles. Senate Republicans tried to advance a bill earlier this week from Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy and Idaho Sen. Mike Crapo but fell short of the votes needed. Democrats were also unsuccessful trying to move their bill to extend the ACA marketplace tax credits for three years. The House Republican bill, sponsored by Iowa Republican Mariannette Miller-Meeks, is unlikely to break the logjam in Congress over the rising cost of health insurance and health care, potentially leaving the issue as one the parties can debate leading up to next year’s midterm elections. Targeting ‘real drivers’ of cost increasesJohnson rebuked Democrats in his statement for enacting the Affordable Care Act during President Barack Obama’s first term, saying the law hasn’t made health care cost less. House Republicans’ new legislation, Johnson said, will address “the real drivers of health care costs to provide affordable care, increase access and choice, and restore integrity to our nation’s health care system for all Americans.”The bill would require Pharmacy Benefit Managers “to provide employers with detailed data on prescription drug spending, rebates, spread pricing, and formulary decisions—empowering plans and workers with the transparency they deserve,” according to a summary in Johnson’s release. Starting in 2027, the legislation would appropriate funding for cost sharing reduction payments that the summary said would reduce health insurance premiums and stabilize the individual market. The House Rules Committee is scheduled to prepare the bill for floor debate on Tuesday by considering whether to allow any amendments to be considered on the floor. The full House will then debate the legislation later in the week before departing for the two-week holiday break.",,,,2025-12-12 17:57:55.968408

The new season of “Alaska State Troopers” will be available Jan. 7 at 8 p.m. PT on A&E, according to a news release. Ten episodes will be available, A&E officials said in an email.
“In America’s largest and wildest state, just 400 Alaska State Troopers are responsible for patrolling hundreds of miles in Fairbanks and the Mat-Su Valley and serve more than 230 remote villages only reachable by boat or plane,” a promotion in the press release states.
“From the endless light of summer to the deep freeze of winter, each one-hour episode captures these men and women as they patrol the vast frontier by land, sea and air. Alaska is the final stop for fugitives on the run, where danger is vast, distances are brutal, and backup can be hours away. From multi-agency criminal takedowns to life-saving search-and-rescue missions, the series showcases a range of calls Alaska State Troopers face that are as immense and unpredictable as the state itself.”

Film crews spent several months with troopers around the state, Alaska public safety officials said in an email Monday. That included the Mat-Su, where filming took place in July and August.
The show, now in its ninth season, returns to streaming with a new slate of producers. The project is the first for Anusia Films and executive producer Anna Rodzinski, according to the release. Rodzinski worked as a writer on the show’s initial run, according to the Internet Movie Database.
“Alaska State Troopers” last filmed in 2014, with a final episode airing on National Geographic in 2015, according to the database.
Public safety officials said they agreed to the new season in part to help with trooper recruitment, which continues to be a challenge statewide.
“Ultimately, this new series is a strategic partnership we hope will build understanding, reinforce public trust and highlight the vital role that troopers have in every corner of our great state,” Alaska Department of Public Safety spokesman Austin McDaniel said in July.

(Photo by Cami Koons for Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Prairie Band Potawatomi Tribe’s chairman compared immigrant detention to Indian reservations in an online video address Friday, and declared the tribe’s intention to jettison a recently secured contract to design detention centers.
“We know our Indian reservations were the government’s first attempts at detention centers,” said Joseph Rupnick, chairman of the Tribal Council. “We were placed here because we were treated as prisoners of war. So we must ask ourselves why we would ever participate in something that mirrors the harm and trauma once done to our people.”
A company affiliated with the tribe’s business arm signed a year-long, $29.9 million contract with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security on Nov. 29. The contract requested the recipient, KPB Services, which is affiliated with Prairie Band LLC, design warehouse structures on behalf of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to house detainees, according to a public federal contract database. Before KPB Services signed the contract, the federal government upped the dollar amount.
The Tribal Council fired members of Prairie Band LLC’s leadership Tuesday after Topeka TV station KSNT made news of the contract public the day before.
Rupnick, in a nearly 3-minute video address, said the tribe is “working on canceling this contract and fully disassociating the nation from it.”
He said the tribe risks losing future government contract awards in its efforts to extract itself from this one, but he said the tribe’s values must come first.
“I am sick to my stomach and frankly heartbroken that members of our nation put economic development — though it is sorely needed — above our moral obligations to other persecuted people,” Rupnick said.
The Tribe owns Prairie Band LLC, and Rupnick said it was created to secure employment and economic opportunities, “but it is also why we cannot compromise our values and seek to profit off the backs of our brothers and sisters in struggle.”
The second Trump administration has targeted immigrants, sometimes regardless of citizenship status or criminal history, detaining more than 65,000 people as of Nov. 16, according to ICE data analyzed by TRAC, a nonprofit data research project. Most of those people, nearly 48,000 did not have a criminal conviction. 
Kansas has three facilities that house detainees and the potential for one more. Authorities at the Chase County jail in Cottonwood Falls, the Finney County jail in Garden City and the federal penitentiary in Leavenworth detain a combined average of 175 people on a given day.

Ron DeSantis and state Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo to repeal some of the state’s vaccine requirements for public schools and day care kicked off Friday with a lengthy and contentious hearing held in a hotel in Florida’s Panhandle.
Ladapo made the call to get rid of all vaccine mandates contained in both state rule and state law even though many of those mandates have been considered a public health success.
About 90 people attended the Department of Health three-hour public meeting on the proposed changes to Rule 64D-3.046, specifically removing the requirements for children to receive the hepatitis B, varicella (chicken pox), and haemophilus influenza B or Hib vaccine. The proposal would remove those vaccines, along with the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, for admission to a licensed day care facility.
Emma Spencer, DOH division director for public health statistics and performance management, and facilitator of the meeting, described the workshop as an opportunity for “public input” as “part of an ongoing efforts to ensure the health and safety of Florida students and communities.”
And there was lots of input, ranging from medical professionals to parental rights advocates to those who questioned whether a measles outbreak is underway in South Carolina. More than 280 people are in quarantine there for measles after a significant influx in cases following the Thanksgiving holiday, Phoenix affiliate South Carolina Daily Gazette reports.
Susan Sweeten, chief marketing officer for the National Vaccine Information Center and a Florida resident, was first to testify. The center’s website says the group is “dedicated to preventing vaccine injuries and deaths through public education and advocating for informed consent protections in medical policies and public health laws.“
Sweeten said her son, just five hours old, was injured when he was given a hepatitis B vaccine in the hospital. 
“When I questioned it, she said, ‘If you don’t give your baby the vaccine, your pediatrician won’t see him, and you won’t know if he’s deaf, dumb, or blind,’” Sweeten told the DOH panel. “This is not informed consent. That is coercion. Vaccines should never be tied to a child’s education. Nothing that pierces the skin should ever be used as leverage over a child’s opportunity to education and to learn,” she said.
Doctors who showed up insisted vaccines work and that elimination of the mandates would lead to a resurgence of controllable childhood diseases.
“As a pediatric infectious disease physician, I cared for children before the varicella vaccine and saw ‘simple chickenpox’ turn into pneumonia, encephalitis, and needless hospitalizations — outcomes we can now prevent because of vaccines,” said Dr. Nectar Aintablian, a pediatric infectious disease specialist in Tallahassee. “Vaccines are victims of their own success; because they work, we forget the suffering they avert.”
Rick Frye, another Florida resident, said he’s been beseeching people not to vaccinate their children for about the past 20 years.
“Now, any pediatrician in this room who tells you that a kid needs 80 shots shouldn’t be trusted to put a band aid on a kid’s knee,” he said. “It’s obviously about freedom, but it’s also about the children these pediatricians damage because they get paid to to vaccinate these kids.”
More hearings coming
The meeting was the first one held on the proposed changes, but likely won’t be the last given the administrative rulemaking process and the requirements for public input.
The department did not say when the next meeting will occur, only that it would be announced in advance in the Florida Administrative Register.
DOH staff asked that public comment on the proposed rule changes be sent to the DOH at vaccinerule@flhealth.gov by Dec. 22, although Spencer acknowledged comments would remain open as the state works on the proposed changes.
The League of Women Voters of Florida didn’t focus on the science behind the vaccines, adverse reactions to vaccines, or parental rights. LWV representative Mary Winn focused her testimony instead on how the proposed changes conflict with the DOH’s statutory mission.
“This rule could probably be updated to reflect current practice and the responsibilities of the state, the Department of Health, private-practicing medical professionals, parents, and the public at large. But any changes must be consistent with the public health mission of the Department of Health as stated in Florida law,” she said. 
Winn noted that statutes require the DOH to conduct a communicable disease prevention and control program, which includes school immunization programs. The agency is charged by statute to ensure that “all children in this state” are immunized against vaccine-preventable diseases, she said.
“Eliminating the mandatory requirement will result in lower levels of immunization, which is contrary to that law stating that you are responsible for all of the children to be vaccinated in the state,” she said.

‘Tremendous damage’
Dr. Frederick Southwick testified that he has been an infectious disease specialist for 45 years. Although he worked with adult populations for much of his career, Southwick recalled helping cover pediatric infectious diseases in 1983 and 1984, before introduction of the Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) bacteria, which would be eliminated under the DOH proposal.
“What did I see?” he asked. 
 Before the Hib vaccine, “I saw cases of orbital cellulitis, infections that went from the sinus causing bulging-eye blindness. I saw severe cases of pneumonia. I saw severe cases of otitis media. I saw bone infections, osteomyelitis that damaged the growth plate of the children so their bones could no longer grow. I saw sepsis, where patients got hypotension and died,” Southwick said. 
“And the most feared was bacterial meningitis, and that had carried a 20% mortality. And this was the leading cause of deafness before the HiB vaccine. In 1985, the Hib vaccine came in, we went from 20,000 hospitalizations to 30, and today we don’t see any of those diseases. You are ending that vaccine. It’s going to cause tremendous damage.”
The proposed rule would change the existing religious exemption people can claim to refuse vaccines, removing language prohibiting exemptions based on personal or philosophical reasons.
Additionally, the proposed rule would allow parents, guardians, and college and university applicants aged 18-23 to decline to participate in documenting their vaccination status in the Florida SHOTS program, which is how the state collects vaccination data.
DeSantis and Ladapo made national headlines in September when they announced they’d like to eliminate all vaccine mandates from Florida statutes and rules, a move that could affect schoolchildren but also college students and even nursing home residents.
DeSantis administration pushes to eliminate all vaccine mandates in Florida

Ladapo said at the time that mandates drip “with disdain and slavery.” 
The proposed rule only removes the vaccines the DOH has authorized through its rules. The proposal cannot eliminate the school vaccines mandated by statute. 
The Legisalture’s reaction
To date there’s been no legislation filed on behalf of the DeSantis administration to eliminate vaccine mandates from Florida statutes. Even Republican U.S. Sen. Rick Scott distanced himself from the idea. 
Meanwhile, Senate President Ben Albritton told reporters this week that he’s a believer in what he called “the vaccines of old,” but that he has never gotten an mRNA vaccine — used during the COVID-19 epidemic — because “he doesn’t trust the technology.”
He said he and his wife support parental rights.
“Missy and I believe we’re going to separate the mRNA stuff from the traditional stuff. And let’s be thoughtful about what works and what we know.”
Sen. Carlos Guillermo Smith, a Democrat from Orlando, is pushing a proposal (SB 626) to amend statutes to require the vaccines (hepatitis B, chickenpox, haemophilus influenzae type b, and pneumococcal disease) Ladapo is trying to eliminate via rule.
SB 626 has been referred to the Senate Health Policy, Education Pre-K – 12, and Rules committees.

(Photo by Deborah Yetter/For Kentucky Lantern)The Kentucky board that licenses and regulates optometrists met Friday amid growing controversy about waivers it granted some candidates in recent years who hadn’t met all requirements for licensure.
But the Board of Optometric Examiners  made no public mention of the matter. Rather, it met in closed session for about 30 minutes to discuss “proposed litigation regarding board waivers,” some of which were granted during the COVID-19 pandemic.
It then adjourned without taking any action and Dr. Karoline Munson, the board vice-president, declined to answer questions.
“I don’t have any comment,” said Munson, a Frankfort optometrist who ran Friday’s meeting after the abrupt resignation of former president Dr. Joe Ellis, of Benton. “But have a Merry Christmas.”
Outside groups are urging the board to resolve questions about the situation to assure that public safety is protected and that eye care providers are duly licensed and qualified.
On Thursday, the Kentucky Optometric Association released a statement calling on the board to “move quickly” to establish a “comprehensive corrective plan.”
Also, Thursday, the Kentucky Academy of Eye Physicians and Surgeons, which represents ophthalmologists, released a statement urging board action.
“We hope for transparency and strong patient safety protections for everyone across the commonwealth,” it said.
Optometrists are eye care providers with a four-year doctorate of optometry degree. Ophthalmologists are medical doctors with an additional residency in eye care and surgery.
Ellis resigned on Wednesday, a day before the Kentucky Lantern reported that the board in recent years had relaxed licensing standards for 21 optometry graduates between 2020 and 2023, exempting them from parts of a national standardized exam required for licensure. Among the candidates who received an optometrist’s license without passing “one or more” parts of the exam was his daughter, Hannah Ellis, according to a May 2025 letter to the state board from the National Board of Examiners in Optometry, or NBEO.
“NBEO is trying to understand how this could have happened,” the letter said.
The board has not replied to the letter.
Friday’s meeting comes as the board continued to grapple with how to respond to an Oct. 1 state attorney general’s opinion that found it had circumvented state law in waiving requirements for licensure.
While the board has the power to change licensure standards, it must do so through enacting new state regulations rather than by adopting changes at board meetings, the opinion said.
On Oct. 10, the board held a special meeting to begin formulating a response to the opinion and how to correct any problems it identified, with Ellis, then president, saying he hoped to have a response as soon as possible.
But Friday, the board made no mention of that and Munson, the vice-president, declined to answer questions about when a response might be forthcoming.
The attorney general identified two instances in which the board improperly waived requirements for passing part of a three-part national exam for licensure, citing restrictions of the COVID-19 pandemic.
But an investigation by the Kentucky Lantern found the board acted on at least six occasions to waive part of the exam between 2020 and 2023, at least one after the pandemic state of emergency had ended.
While most dealt with waiving Part 3, an in-person test of a candidate’s clinical skills, one appeared to involve waiving Part 1 of the national exam, a written test on scientific and medical knowledge–one the board has acknowledged some optometry graduates in Kentucky had trouble passing.
Earlier this year, the board enacted new regulations that allow candidates to take an easier Canadian version of Part 1 of the exam, making Kentucky the only state to do so.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/OPTO-BOARD-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-12 17:57:55.968408

Dylan Collins of Weston was wounded in the strike, which also killed one of his colleagues. Numerous investigations have found that the attack could be a war crime.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Peter Welch, Becca Balint call for greater scrutiny into Israeli military’s attack on Vermont journalist.","U.S. Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., holds up a letter he sent to the U.S. State Department on Thursday pressing officials for more information about an Israeli military strike on a group of journalists including Dylan Collins of Weston. He spoke at a press conference outside the U.S. Capitol on Thursday alongside Collins (right) and U.S. Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt. Screenshot
Vermont’s Democratic U.S. Sen. Peter Welch and Rep. Becca Balint say that both the Israeli and U.S. governments have stonewalled their inquiries into a deadly attack on a group of journalists by Israel’s military in 2023, which injured a reporter from Vermont.
Dylan Collins, a video journalist for Agence France-Presse, was reporting in Lebanon near the Israeli border on Oct. 13, 2023. He and six other journalists were suddenly struck by two shells, fired 37 seconds apart, from an Israeli tank, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, an international press freedom organization. 
The attack left Collins, who is from Weston, with shrapnel injuries. It severely wounded his Lebanese colleague at AFP, Christina Assi, to the point her right leg had to be amputated. Issam Abdallah, a Lebanese journalist working at Reuters, was killed. 
The strikes marked the first time Israel’s military targeted journalists in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks on that country by Hamas, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. In the two-plus years since then, the organization has found, Israeli forces have killed at least 246 total journalists and other media workers in Gaza, Lebanon, Iran and Yemen.
Over that same time, Israel’s ground and air campaign against Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip has killed more than 67,000 people, according to local health authorities. Israeli strikes have destroyed vast swaths of buildings and other infrastructure in the enclave. The United Nations has declared a famine there, saying more than half a million people face “starvation, destitution and death” as a result of Israel’s war. 
An independent U.N. commission determined earlier this year that Israel has committed four “genocidal acts” in Gaza since October 2023. The Hamas attacks on Oct. 7 that prompted the campaign killed about 1,200 people and led to 250 taken hostage.
Welch held a press conference Thursday outside the U.S. Capitol, along with Balint and Collins, to call for greater scrutiny of the strikes on Oct. 13, 2023. Welch and Balint said their offices, along with that of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., have tried to get details on why Israel struck the journalists and how the attack was authorized, to little avail.
Sanders was not at the press conference Thursday but met with Collins that day, according to his social media feeds. Vermont’s congressional delegation have been some of the first members of Congress to publicly call Israel’s war a “genocide.”
The Vermont lawmakers on Thursday sent what they said was an eighth letter to the U.S. State Department since May 2024 asking what it knew about the attack. When posing questions to both former President Joe Biden’s and President Donald Trump’s administrations, “we’ve been stonewalled at every single turn,” Welch told reporters Thursday. 
Collins stood behind him, nodding as the senator spoke.
“I thought that when an American citizen is wounded and attacked — carried out by the U.S.’s greatest ally in the Middle East — that we would be able to get some answers,” Collins said. “But for two years, I’ve been met by deafening silence.”
In June, the Israeli government told Welch’s office it had reviewed the attack and found that no soldiers violated their instructions or the country’s military’s rules of engagement, according to a press release from Welch’s office. But Welch said Thursday he did not believe the investigation was legitimate because Israeli officials have not interviewed Collins or, seemingly, requested any forensic evidence collected by reporters on the scene or the independent human rights investigators who reviewed the incident afterward.  
“It’s clear that the IDF never had serious intentions to investigate this attack,” the senator said, using the acronym for the Israeli military.
Both Welch and Balint said they believed Israel’s strikes on the journalists violated human rights laws because Collins and his colleagues were wearing marked press equipment, and a van parked near them was labeled with “press,” too. A deliberate attack on civilians is a war crime under international law.
Investigations by AFP, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Reuters and the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon have concluded Israel’s strike on Oct. 13, 2023, was “an apparently deliberate attack on a group of clearly identifiable members of the media,” according to Welch’s office.
Elizabeth Rghebi, an advocacy director for Amnesty International USA, said Thursday that outside investigators had determined Israeli military aircraft were circling over the group of reporters for about 40 minutes before the tank strikes, which she said shows the military must have seen the group’s “press” markings. Collins also recalled a drone flying overhead.
Balint said at Thursday’s press conference she had little doubt the attack was a war crime.
“Let’s call it what it is,” she said.

Rural Roots Louisiana and the Louisiana Bucket Brigade, which advocate for environmental justice causes, filed a pair of lawsuits Wednesday against Ascension Parish government and the Ascension Economic Development Corp., a nonprofit organization that is funded primarily with parish tax dollars. 
The lawsuits, filed in the 23rd Judicial District Court in Ascension Parish, allege violations of Louisiana laws on open meetings and public records and raise a number of questions about the depth of secrecy shrouding negotiations between local governments and businesses vying for public dollars or special incentives. 
“It’s like feeling around in the dark,” said attorney Pam Spees, who represents the plaintiffs. “You don’t know where it’s coming from next.” 
In the first lawsuit, the plaintiffs argue that the Ascension Parish Council violated the state’s Open Meetings Law by signing and executing nondisclosure agreements behind closed doors without notifying the public and holding a formal vote. They also argue the council violated the Louisiana Public Records Law by refusing to provide a copy of the agreement when the plaintiffs requested it. 
In their second suit, the groups claim the Ascension Economic Development Corp. violated the public records law by refusing to disclose, among other documents, any cooperative endeavor agreements it signed with Hyundai Steel, Ascension Parish or the state. 
The economic development organization claims it is not subject to the public records law.
The cases stem from a nondisclosure agreement the Louisiana Economic Development agency executed last year with at least one member of the Ascension Parish Council that prevented him from publicly discussing certain “business interests.” 
The two environmental groups held a protest last week outside the state building in Baton Rouge where the state agency holds its meetings. Its focus was the government’s use of nondisclosure agreements to conceal negotiations on industrial expansion deals. 
The nondisclosure agreement with the council member, Chase Melancon, was attached to the lawsuit. It contained no details about the nature of the business interests. However, Spees said they likely pertain to deals the state and parish have struck for industrial projects at the RiverPlex MegaPark in Modeste. They include the Hyundai Steel plant and a CF Industries ammonia facility, which officials have widely touted. When the topic of those projects came up in parish council meetings, some council members said they were restricted from talking about them, Spees said.  
Neither the Ascension Parish Council nor the Ascension Economic Development Corp. would comment for this report, citing policies of not discussing pending litigation.
In a phone interview Thursday, Spees said the use of nondisclosure agreements affords the public less time and opportunity to learn about and voice concerns over projects that impact their neighborhoods. Even if word leaks that a nondisclosure agreement was signed, the officials who signed it often aren’t even willing to acknowledge it, she said.
Spees said nondisclosure agreements are becoming more prevalent at the local level, so concerned citizens and environmental groups might not learn about a particular project until a local government publishes a zoning notice or even later, she said. In some cases, it can be too late for the public to raise effective challenges, she said. 
“The secrecy, it allows for all the momentum to build up around a particular project,” Spees said. 
In an interview last week, Louisiana Economic Development Secretary Susan Bourgeois said the use of nondisclosure agreements is a common practice at her agency whenever a company requests confidentiality.
Anne Rolfes, the Bucket Brigade’s executive director, questioned Bourgeois’ claim and said she believes the state and local governments are ramping up their use of confidential negotiations as a way to approve projects without much public scrutiny. 
“They’re trying to normalize it,” Rolfes said. “They say this is the normal way of doing business…and if this is business as usual, then there’s a problem with that.”
Louisiana’s secret business negotiations need to stop, critics say

Clay Garside, an environmental litigator with the New Orleans-based Waltzer, Wiygul & Garside law firm, said he’s never had to contend with governments using nondisclosure agreements and hopes it doesn’t turn into a trend. Garside is not involved in either of the lawsuits but represents clients with similar missions, such as the Sierra Club and the Louisiana Environmental Action Network.
In September, Rural Roots and the Bucket Brigade filed a public records request with Ascension Parish for copies of all its nondisclosure agreements The parish denied the request, citing a controversial state law approved in 2024 that gave new secrecy protections to records related to local and parish economic development projects.
That law allows a mayor, parish president or top local government official to declare almost any records confidential if they determine their public release could jeopardize an active business negotiation for a large project. However, the law requires the official to make that determination in an open meeting with an affirmative vote of the local governing authority such as a parish council.
When the environmental groups asked Ascension Parish for a copy of any meeting minutes showing such a vote was held, officials admitted no such minutes existed, the lawsuit states. 
“NDAs are not the kind of record that is exempt [under the 2024 confidentiality law],” Spees said in a phone interview. “Even if they were, the parish didn’t follow the procedures of the law … They’re supposed to give the public some notice.”
Scott Sternberg, a First Amendment attorney who represents several Louisiana news organizations and reviewed the lawsuits, said the 2024 law has had a detrimental effect on government transparency at the local level. He lobbied against its passage during the 2024 legislative session, but it cleared the Senate by a razor-thin margin after receiving ample support in the House. 
“A lot of times in the legislature, we hear from Republicans and Democrats about how transparency can prevent government from getting a good deal,” Sternberg said. “I think most people want that [good deal], but those opponents to that bill originally saw it as a significant expansion of government secrecy. And in the two years since it’s been in effect, I think that more people regret its passage than applaud it.” 
The economic development group claimed that as a private, nonprofit entity, it was not subject to the Louisiana Public Records Law, which applies mostly to government bodies. The lawsuit points to a state statute under Title 33 that says certain private, nonprofit economic development corporations are subject to the public records and open meetings laws if they receive at least $10,000 in public funds in a calendar year.
Minutes from an Ascension Parish Council meeting on Oct. 17, 2024, indicate the council approved funding the corporation with more than $322,000 in public money last year.  
Aside from the statute at issue in the lawsuits, state laws don’t explicitly say whether economic development groups are subject to state transparency laws, but Sternberg said the answer can be found in Louisiana Supreme Court case law.
The Bucket Brigade’s lawsuit is similar to one state justices decided in 2016, he said. The ruling established a test of characteristics to determine whether a private economic development organization must follow the public records and open meetings laws. The court held such organizations are subject to those laws if they meet certain characteristics such as being at least 50% publicly funded, being managed by officers hired or appointed with the input of a public agency or official, or having employees who receive state benefits, Sternberg explained.
Some economic development organizations say they’re free to conduct business negotiations behind closed doors. 
Katie Harris, marketing director for the Greater Baton Rouge Economic Development Partnership, wrote in an email that her organization is private and not subject to state public records or open meetings laws. 
Molly Lockwood, president of the Livingston Parish Economic Development Council, made a similar statement when reached by phone Thursday. Her organization receives public money but has never been subject to the state’s transparency laws, she said.
The first hearing for the court case against the Ascension Economic Development Corp. is scheduled for Tuesday.

The 15 tons of products seized in the investigation, nicknamed “Ganjapreneur,” involved the search of six warehouses, six homes, one business and two storage units.
Bill seeks to rein in sales of THC-infused drinks and edibles in SC

In all, it was about “eight U-Hauls worth” of products, Attorney General Alan Wilson told reporters.
The announcement comes as the legality of products containing delta-9 THC is debated nationwide.
In South Carolina, marijuana remains illegal.
But hemp products infused with THC — the compound in cannabis that gets people high — have proliferated in vape shops and gas stations across the state in a legal gray area. The products, which include drinks and gummies, can be legal if the THC concentration is low enough. Proving they’re illegal requires testing the products.
The investigation focused on distributors and wholesalers of products sold openly in stores. Testing showed they contained illegal levels of THC regardless of what their packaging claimed, Wilson said.
“These people were knowingly selling something that they knew was illegal here in South Carolina with the intent of profiting from it, and they were targeting minor children,” said the Republican attorney general, who is also running for governor.
The 12 people indicted by the State Grand Jury are accused of being wholesale distributors of the illegal products. They’re collectively indicted on 40 narcotics charges, which include trafficking between 10 and 100 pounds of marijuana and possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance, according to the indictments unsealed Thursday.
Hemp growers, retailers targeted in section of government shutdown legislation

In hearings Thursday at the Richland County Courthouse, their bonds were set between $50,000 and $120,000.
Hemp is often used to make rope or clothing and naturally contains very low concentrations of THC. The 2018 federal farm bill legalized hemp containing less than 0.3% of THC. People soon took advantage of that law to sell hemp products infused with enough THC to intoxicate users.
A last-minute addition to the stopgap spending law that ended the federal government shutdown in November may close that loophole late next year.
On Friday, Rep. Chris Wooten of Lexington said legislators need to act before then to curb the sale of intoxicating hemp-derived THC products in South Carolina.
He sponsored a bill in February that sought to ban anyone under 21 from buying a “consumable hemp product.” That legislation received near-unanimous House support in April but has yet to get a hearing in the Senate. Senators could take it up when the legislative session resumes in January.
Wilson and other law enforcement officials at the conference said they wanted to warn parents about the sale of dangerously potent THC products being marketed to children.
“Just because you have something in a fluorescent rainbow packaging with a cartoon character on it, and it looks and sounds like it’s a child edible or a child beverage, does not mean that it is,” Wilson said.  “These things can be deadly.”
During the news conference, the South Carolina Healthy Alternatives Association released an unsigned statement criticizing the investigation and calling for regulation of hemp-derived products.
Wilson dismissed the group’s concerns, saying it’s not familiar with the government’s evidence.
Various law enforcement agencies involved in the investigation included the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, the FBI, the sheriff’s departments in Richland and Lexington counties, and the University of South Carolina police.

New England fishermen, especially those from Maine, used to catch millions of pounds of small pink shrimp in the winter, but the business has been under a fishing moratorium since 2014. Rising temperatures have created an inhospitable environment for the shrimp, and their population is too low to fish sustainably, scientists have said.
An arm of the regulatory Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission voted Thursday to shut down the fishery for at least another three years. Abundance of the shrimp remained “poor” this year despite slightly improved environmental conditions, the Atlantic States said in documents.
The decision came after shrimp harvesters were allowed to catch a small number of shrimp as part of an industry-funded sampling and data collection program. The fishermen, who battled some rough weather, caught only 70 shrimp totaling less than 3 pounds.

However, “even with the bad weather, exceptionally low catch levels observed throughout the program reinforce concerns about the viability of the northern shrimp stock in the Gulf of Maine,” the documents state.
New England shrimp were a winter delicacy when the fishery was active, and fishermen sometimes caught more than 10 million pounds (4,536 kilograms) of them in a year. The small pink shrimp were a small part of the country’s large wild caught shrimp industry, which catches some of the most valuable seafood in the world.
Maine’s catch of shrimp cratered in 2013, when fishermen caught less than 600,000 pounds (272,155 kilograms) of the crustaceans after hauling more than eight times that the previous year. Fishing groups have sometimes lobbied for the shrimping industry to be reopened on a smaller scale basis, but most former Maine shrimpers have moved on to other species.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25345566224477-1024x686.jpg,,,2025-12-12 17:57:55.968408

According to various state records, Raleigh lives in Washington state, but provides telehealth services to patients remotely, is licensed to practice medicine in 21 states, and is credentialed in roughly 460 hospitals.
Records from the Kentucky Board of Medical Licensure indicate that in September 2024, the board entered into a settlement agreement with Raleigh stemming from his May 2023 arrest in Bellingham, Washington, on a charge of drunken driving.
According to the Kentucky board, police records show Raleigh struck another vehicle and then drove away from the scene of the accident at a speed of more than 100 mph.
Raleigh is alleged to have later refused the board’s request that he undergo an evaluation through the Kentucky Physicians’ Health Foundation. He subsequently enrolled in two treatment programs, relapsed and was diagnosed with severe alcohol use disorder, according to the board.
Raleigh was eventually convicted of drunken driving, the board alleges, and he enrolled in the Washington Physicians’ Health Program. In July 2024, the Kentucky board’s inquiry panel concluded Raleigh suffered from a condition that included a physical deterioration that might impede his ability to practice medicine in a competent manner. The board then ordered Raleigh to submit to an evaluation. According to the board, Raleigh failed to comply with that order.
Board documents indicate that in order to avoid an emergency suspension of his Kentucky license, Raleigh agreed to a settlement that restricted his license in that state and barred him from working in telehealth or in any other setting without a workplace monitor.  The settlement also called for him to submit to periodic, unannounced tests for alcohol and drug use.

Greg Gianforte, as well as the four members of Montana’s federal delegation, signed a letter asking Burgum to “assess this matter further.” The Interior Department did not return a request for comment asking why Burgum took up the matter, and if the letter had anything to do with the decision.
The Governor’s Office did not return a request for comment either. 
The September letter stated American Prairie was trying to remove “vast swaths” of land from agricultural production. And there has been a fear from some ranchers that their land was going to be turned into a National Park.
The venom, though, appears to have dissipated somewhat over the years, and American Prairie has also pointed to the economic impact their work has created. The organization also leases much of its land to cattle producers, the organization has said. The September letter argued the opposite was true.
“The claim that American Prairie ‘threatens the economic vitality’ of the state, is on its face absurd,” American Prairie spokesperson Pete Geddes said in October. 
American Prairie has insisted what they’re doing is legal, that federal law doesn’t prohibit conservation grazing, and even if it did, their bison are livestock. American Prairie is also suing the state Department of Natural Resources and Conservation over a state grazing permit adjacent to federal land that’s part of the appeals Burgum is now in charge of. 
In a statement, American Prairie said they welcomed the move. 
“We’re looking forward to the secretary making a decision in this case after more than three years of it being tied up in administrative court,” American Prairie spokesperson Beth Saboe said Friday in an email. “Since the beginning, our position has been simple: We’re only asking to be treated the same as any other agricultural producer with grazing privileges in Montana. We look forward to the secretary’s decision and remain eager to move this process forward quickly and fairly.”
The time it has taken for the appeals process “undermines the integrity for everyone,” Saboe added. Saboe also said they’re not asking to expand any agency’s authority, nor are they trying to establish new precedent.
“It is a slippery slope when agencies begin altering or complicating routine public-lands grazing requests,” Saboe wrote. “The entire system depends on consistent, lawful, and predictable application of existing standards. When normal processes are stretched or stalled, every producer who relies on public-lands grazing is put at risk.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/American-Prairie_73-Ranch_1-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-12-12 17:57:55.968408

The Council on Criminal Justice, a nonpartisan think tank, on Thursday released the first comprehensive national analysis of arrests since federal authorities stopped publishing detailed arrest statistics in 2020.
Arrests plunged during the first year of the pandemic and have remained low, according to the analysis. The national arrest rate in 2024 was 30% below the 2019 level and 71% lower than the peak in 1994. 
Why ‘clearance rates’ don’t tell the whole story about solving crimes

Drug arrests have fallen even faster, with adult and juvenile drug-offense arrest rates dropping to about half of what they were in 2019.
In 1980, juveniles made up nearly a fifth of arrests nationwide, but by 2018, their share had fallen to 7%. While adult arrest rates declined 7% between 2020 and 2024, juvenile rates rose 14% over the same period.
Gender patterns have shifted as well. With arrests of men falling more steeply over time, women now account for a larger portion of arrests. Adult women’s share nearly doubled between 1980 and 2020, rising from 14% to about 27%. Girls’ share of juvenile arrests grew from 18% to roughly 31%.
Between 2020 and 2024, arrest rates for Black and Asian juveniles surged 48% and 45%, respectively, compared with an 11% increase among white youth. Rates for American Indian and Alaska Native juveniles fell 4%. 
Among adults, arrest rates increased by 12% for Black people and 18% for Asian people, but declined by 10% for white adults and 17% for American Indian and Alaska Native adults.

Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran immigrant and Maryland resident, appeared early Friday for a check-in at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in Baltimore, less than day after a federal district judge ordered him released from ICE detention in Pennsylvania.
At his last ICE check-in, in August, Abrego Garcia walked in but didn’t walk out: Authorities detained him and held him until Thursday. But Friday, Abrego Garcia walked out of the building to cheers and chants, led by members of the immigrant rights group CASA to a black car that took him to rejoin his family in Prince George’s County.
Before Abrego-Garcia walked inside the building Friday, he thanked his supporters who rallied there, talked about spending the holidays with his family and offered advice for others suffering similar legal battles against the Trump administration.
“I stand before you as a free man, and I want you to remember me this way with my head held up high,” Abrego Garica said in Spanish, through a CASA translator.
“I stand here today with my head held up high, and I will continue to fight and stand firm against all of the injustices this government has done upon me,” Abrego Garcia said. “Regardless of this administration, I believe this is a country of laws, and I believe that this injustice will come to its end. Keep fighting. Do not give up. I wish all of you love and justice. Keep going.”

One of his attorneys, Simon Y. Sandoval-Moshenberg, told reporters and a few dozen protesters outside the field office that the federal judge who ordered Abrego Garcia freed Thursday said Friday that he could not be detained by ICE at his latest check-in.
Based on a temporary restraining order filed by his attorneys, Sandoval-Moshenberg said the judge will schedule a hearing at U.S. District Court in Greenbelt that Abrego Garcia will be able to attend.
“The legal fight is far from over,” Sandoval-Moshenberg said. “I wish I could say that with this, the government is going to leave well enough alone. This man has suffered enough.”
Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin called the judge’s decision to let Abrego Garcia free “naked judicial activism.”
“This order lacks any valid legal basis and we will continue to fight this tooth and nail in the courts,” McLaughlin said in an email Friday morning that repeated her statement from the day before.
Abrego Garcia’s return to the Baltimore ICE office came one day after U.S. District Court of Maryland Judge Paul Xinis ordered the Trump administration to release him from the Moshannon Valley Processing Center in Pennsylvania, where he had been held since September. He was released Thursday evening and spent the night at his home in Beltsville.
Since he was first detained by immigration officials in March and wrongly deported to his home county of El Salvador, Abrego Garcia’s case has shone a spotlight on the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown.
Abrego Garcia was originally deported to a brutal prison in El Salvador, despite a previous court ruling that prohibited his transfer there because of fear of violence by Salvadoran gangs.
Months later — and months after the U.S. Supreme Court’s April order that the Trump administration “facilitate” Abrego Garcia’s return –he was brought back to the U.S. on June 6, only to face charges of human smuggling in Tennessee. The judge in that case eventually ordered Abrego Garcia released to home detention while his claim of vindictive prosecution in the Tennessee case proceeded.
Xinis, who got involved in the case when Abrego Garcia was first deported, issued a ruling Thurday that was highly critical of the administration’s actions in the case. She found that Abrego Garcia’s latest detention, since his August ICE check-in, was “again without lawful authority,” because the Trump administration has been holding him for deportation but has not made an effort to remove him to a third country.

The government’s “conduct over the past months belie that his detention has been for the basic purpose of effectuating removal, lending further support that Abrego Garcia should be held no longer,” Xinis wrote in her opinion.
Costa Rica has agreed to accept Abrego Garcia as a refugee, but Justice Department lawyers could not give Xinis a clear explanation of why the Trump administration would not send him there. Instead, the administration has proposed deporting Abrego Garcia to several countries in Africa.
Back in Baltimore on Friday morning, dozens of supporters braved the cold to hold up signs, chant and then clap and cheer when Abrego Garcia walked back outside the ICE building a free man, chanting “todos somos Kilmar,” or “we are all Kilmar.”
“It’s definitely a good day, but it is a good day to know that he’ll be able to spend the holidays with his family, “said Baltimore City Councilmember Odette Ramos, who attended the rally.
“He and his family have been so brave to go through all of this and to have their story really symbolize, frankly, what so many others are going through,” she said. “The fight’s not over.”

(Kevin Mohatt for Colorado Newsline)President Donald Trump’s pardon of Tina Peters applies to her state criminal case, Peter Ticktin, her Florida-based attorney, said Friday.
Presidential pardons have universally been understood to apply only to federal crimes, not state crimes. Reports about Trump’s claim to have pardoned Peters, announced on social media Thursday, characterized it as empty or “symbolic.”
“Trump’s pardon has no legal impact on her state conviction and incarceration,” according to CNN.
But Ticktin says the pardon is the tool he needs to compel Colorado to free Peters.
“She didn’t commit any federal offenses,” Ticktin said in an interview with Newsline. “The only thing that she could be pardoned on are state offenses, because that’s all that are out there.”

Ticktin expects to receive formal pardon documents as soon as Friday from the U.S. Office of the Pardon Attorney.
“I understand it’s been signed,” Ticktin said, adding that he received that information from U.S. Pardon Attorney Ed Martin on Friday morning.
Peters, 70, is incarcerated at La Vista Correctional Facility in Pueblo. The Republican was convicted by a Mesa County jury for her role in a 2021 security breach of her own election equipment that was part of an effort to find evidence that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. She was sentenced in October 2024.
Claims that the election was fraudulent or compromised have been debunked by elections officials, experts, media investigations, law enforcement, the courts and Trump’s own campaign and administration officials.
Ticktin applied to the Trump administration last month for a pardon. He followed up last week with a letter to Trump in which he detailed his argument that Trump has the power to pardon Peters. He says the Constitution’s references to the United States apply to the individual states as well as the country as a whole, concluding that the president “has the power to grant a pardon in any of the states of the United States.”
Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, said Thursday the state will abide by whatever courts order concerning the pardon. But he said Trump lacks pardon power in Peters’ case.
“Tina Peters was convicted by a jury of her peers, prosecuted by a Republican District Attorney, and found guilty of violating Colorado state laws, including criminal impersonation,” he said in a statement. “No President has jurisdiction over state law nor the power to pardon a person for state convictions.”
Ticktin expects the Trump administration to submit the pardon to the Colorado Department of Corrections, which is likely to refuse to release Peters, he said. The pardon then might have bearing in the Colorado Court of Appeals, where Peters has appealed her conviction.
“If the pardon counts, the appeal has to stop,” Ticktin said. “The appeal’s over. It becomes moot.”
Ultimately he expects the matter to reach the U.S. Supreme Court, where a 6-3 conservative majority has sided with Trump at an unusually high rate.

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)Members of the Alabama Commission on Higher Education (ACHE) expressed concerns Friday about rising health care costs and the impact it could have on public college and universities’ budgets.
ACHE officials said shortfalls in  the Public Education Employees’ Health Insurance Plan (PEEHIP), which provides health insurance for employees of the Alabama Community College System and three state universities, have forced the allocation of additional dollars to a fund that pays for mandatory retirement and health insurance benefits at the expense of other funding priorities.
“If PEEHIP wasn’t an issue this year, we would have probably would not put as many funds into the Mandatory Funds, we probably put have more funds into the some of these other fund groups,” said Jim Hood, deputy director of financial and information systems for the Alabama Commission on Higher Education, in an interview after the meeting.

Board members Friday requested a $148 million increase to its budget from the Governor’s Office for the coming fiscal year that will be spread across four of its spending priorities: personnel and salaries, weighted credit hours, mandatory funds and inflationary costs.
Both PEEHIP and the State Employees Insurance Board (SEIB) are trying to address increased expenses in their insurance plans next year as health care costs increase around the country. PEEHIP has requested an additional $380 million from the state to avoid premium increases for teachers and state employees. SEIB in September withdrew funds from a reserve and authorized some cost increases to address a deficit.
Gov. Kay Ivey will submit her budget proposal to the Alabama Legislature at the start of the 2026 regular session next month. The Legislature has the final say on budgets for each state department.
According to a presentation from Hood, staff recommended increasing personnel and salaries by 1.55% over the current fiscal year; a 1.35% increase for weighted credit hours and a 1.25% increase for inflationary costs.
The recommended budget request included a 1.6% increase to the Mandatory Funds priority.
Officials said they would have recommended larger increases in those categories without the strain of health insurance expenses.
“I think all of them identified personnel and salaries as something,” said Jim Purcell, executive director of the Alabama Commission on Higher Education. “A lot of times, when their insurance changes, there is also a match that the employee pays, so they were trying to address that. And then, the mandatory fund is significant for all of them because it involves pensions. Those are the two big ones.”
PEEHIP provides health insurance for K-12 education employees. The Alabama Community College System; Alabama A&M University; Athens State University and Jacksonville State University also have employees enrolled in PEEHIP.
Hood said the universities are already starting to experience the consequences.
“You can see that their rate increases are just a little bit higher than their neighbors,” Hood said of the percent increase in the budget requests of the universities affected by PEEHIP. “That is where we have tried to address their PEEHIP needs through the recommendation. Their bump up is just a little bit more than everybody else because of PEEHIP.”
Jacksonville State University is seeking a budget increase of almost 9%, from almost $62 million to almost $67.5 million. Alabama A&M University is seeking an increase of almost 7%, from $61 million to $65 million. Athens State University is seeking an increase of almost 7% also, from $23.5 million to $25.1 million.
“While PEEHIP is specific to these campuses, the rate increases will impact the funds available for other budget needs in higher education,” Purcell said in a statement. “This issue is a statewide issue that affects all entities supported by the Education Trust Fund, including K-12 public education employers, colleges and universities, local boards, systems, and other education entities.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Jim-Purcell-Feb-5-2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-12 16:59:26.495656

At a Judicial Committee hearing, two accused Darin Smith of making false claims about Capitol riot, Liz Cheney, Kamala Harris.
The post Senators blast Wyoming’s U.S. attorney as unqualified MAGA loyalist, Jan. 6 supporter appeared first on WyoFile .","Two U.S. Senators blasted the Trump administration’s nominee to be the federal attorney for Wyoming, calling Darin Smith unqualified and alleging he made false claims about the Jan. 6 insurrection he attended.
Sens. Dick Durbin and Peter Welch, Democrats from Illinois and Vermont, respectively, urged their colleagues to vote against Smith’s nomination at a meeting of the Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
“There’s got to be some standard of qualification to give this kind of power to an individual who has no background, none whatsoever, when it comes to criminal or federal court experience,” Durbin said. “Mr. Smith … is not remotely qualified to be a U.S. Attorney.”
“His words in support of Jan. 6 are disqualifying for him to serve as U.S. attorney.” Sen. Peter Welch
Welch weighed in too. “His words in support of Jan. 6 are disqualifying for him to serve as U.S. attorney,” the Vermont senator said. “I mean, seriously, what are we doing?”
The committee voted 12-10 along party lines to forward Smith’s nomination to the full Senate. “The Senate is expected to confirm his nomination this month,” Smith’s spokesperson, Lori Hogan, wrote in an email Wednesday. In a second email from his office Thursday, Smith declined to comment further on the nomination.
Wyoming’s delegation, all Republicans, cheered Smith when Attorney General Pam Bondi nominated him earlier this year. Sen. John Barrasso called Smith “well-qualified.”
Sen. Cynthia Lummis said Smith had the experience and values for the role and Rep. Harriet Hageman endorsed him as well, saying, “I trust that he will uphold the rule of law, defend Wyoming values, and work tirelessly to keep our communities safe.”
Withering criticism
Smith is an attorney who ran unsuccessfully in the 2021 GOP primary against U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney. He was then elected in 2024 to the Wyoming Senate, representing Platte and parts of Laramie counties. He resigned that seat after Bondi appointed him as interim U.S. Attorney. Taft Love replaced him in the Wyoming Senate.
“I am honored to serve as the U.S. Attorney for the District of Wyoming and thank Attorney General Bondi for placing her trust in me,” he said in a statement when he was appointed. “It is a privilege to lead this great office, and I look forward to working with our federal, state, and local partners to protect the public and defend the interests of the United States.”
Smith’s nomination came up against withering criticism Thursday at the Judiciary Committee meeting. Durbin called his nomination “a mockery of the nomination process.
“Apparently, his only qualification is his loyalty to MAGA orthodoxy,” Durbin said. “He has no criminal or Federal Court experience, nor has he ever tried a case to verdict, judgment or final decision.
“We asked him to list significant legislation he’d been involved in,” Durbin continued. “He left it blank.”

Durbin criticized Smith further, alleging he “just happened to be on the Capitol grounds on Jan. 6,” when “a violent mob assaulted police officers, destroyed government property and attempted to thwart our democratic process.”
Durbin did not accuse Smith of rioting.
Durbin continued, alleging Smith “baselessly claimed that hundreds of Capitol police officers who risked their lives that day were guilty of ‘massive incompetence.’” He alleged that Smith claimed rioters who breached the Capitol were “the victims of entrapment” and that Smith supported the pardoning of Jan. 6 rioters.
False claims?
Durbin also said Smith falsely claimed that FBI agents who interviewed him about Jan. 6 were sent by “Liz Cheney and her goons” and that Smith “baselessly accused Vice President Harris of being a murderer.” Durbin also had trouble with Smith’s alleged criticism of LGBTQ protections, constitutional due-process protection for non-citizens and other things.
Welch, too, was particularly upset with Smith’s appearance at the Capitol on Jan. 6 and his support of rioters there. “I categorically reject that cop beaters should be pardoned,” Welch said.
The committee had already rejected the nomination of Ed Martin to serve as U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia “due to his ties to Jan. 6 and other things,” Welch said.
“It’s really shocking to me that we’re in the process of forgetting that 150 officers were injured that day,” Welch said. “We’re rewriting history about Jan. 6.
“People attacked police officers, and now we’re considering the nomination of an individual who was involved in the activities of that day,” Welch continued, “not that I’m accusing him of being one of the assailants … he didn’t go into the Capitol, but he was here in support.”
Welch said Smith claimed the rioters were entrapped — a statement supported by an interview Smith gave in 2024.
“So he’s blaming the police officers for what the assailants did,” Welch said. “Every one of us, [in] my view, should condemn that language.”
Interim appointment
Smith is representing the government in litigation involving the United States in Wyoming, including criminal prosecutions, civil suits and other actions. He earned a B.S. from the University of Wyoming in 1996 and a J.D. from the University of Wyoming College of Law in 2000, according to information he provided upon his appointment.
Bondi appointed Smith as interim attorney in August and he swore his oath of office on Aug. 11, according to information from the Department of Justice. His interim appointment was valid for 120 days and expired Dec. 9.
Wyoming’s Chief U.S. Judge Kelly Rankin on Dec. 4 extended Smith’s appointment as allowed under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998. That extension allows Smith to serve “until the vacancy is filled.”
Rankin’s judicial appointment clears Smith of potential entanglements similar to those that dogged another interim appointment by Bondi — that of Alina Habba to be the U.S. Attorney in New Jersey. She resigned Dec. 8 after two lawsuits brought by criminal defendants alleged Habba was serving unlawfully.
“Habba is not eligible to serve as acting U.S. attorney,” the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit ruled on Dec. 1. Judges said the Trump administration cannot sidestep the Federal Vacancies Reform Act as it attempted to do by appointing Habba to serve beyond the act’s time limits.

Kelly Ayotte in August, requires absentee voters to provide identification each time they vote. (Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)A Rockingham Superior Court judge dismissed a lawsuit Friday against new, stricter identification requirements for New Hampshire absentee voters, ruling that the law is constitutional and treats absentee voters with the same scrutiny as in-person voters.
The lawsuit, brought by three visually impaired residents against Secretary of State Dave Scanlan, sought to strike down the law created by Senate Bill 287. That law, signed by Gov. Kelly Ayotte in August, requires absentee voters to provide identification each time they vote. 
Under the new law, absentee voters can do that by providing a photocopy of the ID with their mail-in ballot, getting a notary to sign the ballot, or going in person to their town or city clerk and presenting their ID.
The plaintiffs, Adele Robertson, Daniel Frye, and Regina Wilson, argued the new law discriminates against people with disabilities because it requires them to either have access to printers, scanners, and other machines, hire a notary, or get transportation to their town hall in order to vote. That creates a burden to voting that violates the New Hampshire Constitution, they said.
At issue in the case was whether the new ID requirements impose “severe restrictions” on voters or nondiscriminatory and reasonable ones.
In a nine-page opinion, Judge David Ruoff ruled that the restrictions are not severe. “Burdens are generally deemed severe when they outright exclude voters from the process,” Ruoff wrote. “Here, the identification requirements impose ordinary burdens on all absentee voters, and the possibility that it may cause additional burden on a subset of absentee voters does not render the entire statute unconstitutional.” 
Ruoff noted that the statute provides multiple options for absentee voters who might lack the means to take one particular approach. And he reasoned that voting always includes some effort, and that before the new law, absentee voters “were already required to mail or provide their application to the secretary of state or town or city clerk.”
In his decision, Ruoff agreed with the New Hampshire Attorney General’s argument that the new law — and any burdens it creates — serves the state’s legitimate interest in preventing voting fraud, a key test that must be met for a voting restriction law to be deemed constitutional. 
“The Court concludes that this is a sufficient justification for the identification requirements to establish that an absentee voter is who they claim to be and ensure the legitimacy of elections,” Ruoff wrote.
It is not clear whether the plaintiffs will appeal the ruling to the state Supreme Court. 
The state court decision comes as lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union of New Hampshire and other groups are suing New Hampshire in federal court over a different state law that imposes new restrictions on voting: House Bill 1569, signed by Gov. Chris Sununu in 2024. That law requires new registrants in New Hampshire to provide hard-copy proof of their citizenship through a birth certificate, passport, or other document or be turned away from voting.

In an interview with WRKF, Nungesser said he’s all for criminals being apprehended, but those with proper documentation to work in the country and who haven’t committed any crimes shouldn’t have to live in fear. He also said the Department of Homeland Security’s lack of transparency is responsible for fearmongering.
“Is going door to door, pulling people out of their houses and cars, is that the right way to do this?” Nungesser said. “I hope to God it’s not arresting people to reach a quota. And if it’s not, they need to say that because it’s been said in the past that they gotta arrest 5,000 people in the New Orleans area or in Louisiana. “I hope that’s not the fact because that has put the fear of God in a lot of people.”

– Lt. Gov. Billy Nungesser


Nungesser, who oversees state tourism, said many hotels could be faced with cancelling reservations due to the lack of employees showing up for work for fear of being detained. He said the sweeps are hurting other sectors as well.
“I’ve got hotel owners calling me, saying they can’t get the rooms clean because nobody is coming to work. Restaurant staff are not showing up, and these people building buildings can’t complete their projects because nobody’s coming to work,” he said. “We gotta fix that, and I don’t know how to fix it.”
When asked if images and reports of CBP detainments are hurting tourism, he said he’s sure it is, but isn’t sure to what degree.
“We won’t know until after the season, but common sense tells you if you see all this going on on TV, especially if you’re a foreigner, living here or coming here, it would make you have second thoughts,” he said. “I think the images on TV do not help tourism of people wanting to come to a city where this is going on.”

Nungesser said he’s heard from a woman in north Louisiana whose immigration attorney told her not to leave her home.
“I spoke to one lady in Shreveport who has a date to become a citizen. It’s a long process, and people have been waiting many years,” he said. “Well, if you’ve been on this process and they pick you up and deport you, you have to start all over again. That’s not right.”
Nungesser’s comments have put him at odds with Republican Gov. Jeff Landry, who’s been vocally supportive of the DHS immigration sweep. On Thursday, Landry spokeswoman Kate Kelly told NOLA.com that Nungesser’s comments were ‘disappointing’ and accused him of prioritizing non-native criminals over U.S. citizens.
Nungesser insists that he and Landry have a good work relationship. In his interview with NOLA.com, he said the newspaper asked if he had discussed his thoughts on “Catahoula Crunch” with the governor, to which he said no.
“They (NOLA.com) said, ‘Well, do you plan to?’ I said, ‘Well, I’ve been trying to get a meeting for the last several months to discuss a lot of things,’” said Nungesser. “It wasn’t a dig at the governor, so unfortunately, to slap back at me for just a normal comment is what breeds this crazy political world we’re in today. And I’m being eaten up on the radio today as wanting the criminals to be here and everything else. And I think the far left and the far right have to take a chill pill.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Nungesser said he understands the governor is extremely busy, but he does want to meet with him in person.
“ I’m very brutal and honest about everything,” he said. “I want to discuss a lot of things with the governor that I don’t discuss in public, that I think need attention, and so I absolutely want to discuss this and many things with him, and we just haven’t been able to get together for several months.”
The Republican said he’s reached out to U.S. House Majority Leader and Louisiana Congressman Steve Scalise for clarification on the mission of Catahoula Crunch and the reported goal of 5,000 arrests.
“ I don’t know if it’s a quota we’re trying to reach or we’re trying to deport so many people to show what a bad job the past president did at letting people in, but some of these people, I just think there’s a better way to handle it,” said Nungesser.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Nungesser-1024x820.jpg,,,2025-12-12 16:59:26.495656

One of […]","Flint families meet Dr. Mona Hanna and Luke Shaefer at a July 31, 2023 press conference announcing $16.5 million in funding for the Rx Kids initiative. | Photo courtesy of the Charles Stewart Mott Department of Public Health at Michigan State UniversityThe abrupt cuts approved Wednesday to state agency work project spending have been called everything from cruel to wholly unorthodox, but for the organizations that would have relied on the slashed $645 million in negotiated funding to fulfill vital services for Michigan residents, the move feels like an outright devaluation of their work.
One of those organizations is the Lansing-based Small Talk Children’s Advocacy Center, a nonprofit that helps children receive coordinated services during child sexual and violent abuse investigations across mid-Michigan. Their work includes offering no-cost therapy services for children to address the trauma they’ve experienced, as well as adult prevention education and other programs.
In an interview with Michigan Advance, Alex Brace, the organization’s executive director, news of the slashed funding brought confusion, distrust and a feeling like their important work didn’t matter to a select set of leaders in the state Legislature.
“There was a time when organizations like ours did not exist and weren’t here to serve kids who needed help when they have been exposed to sexual and physical violence,” Brace said. “To know that this is being cast aside is quite frustrating, to say the least. … I feel like there was a devaluing of the work that we do, that we know is critical and incredibly important to our community and to the children that we serve.”
GOP members of the House Appropriations Committee, who control the majority, voted along party lines to employ a little-used provision in the Management and Budget Act that allows either House or Senate appropriators to disapprove any newly requested work projects. The vote allowed the committee, chaired by state Rep. Ann Bollin (R-Brighton Township), to cut more than a half-billion dollars in current work project spending already approved by the Legislature for the 2025-26 fiscal year budget, which was signed by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.
Agency work projects have long been a target for Bollin, but especially Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township), who began threatening the funding early in the budget negotiations that ended in October after a temporary government shutdown.
Hall, Bollin defend vote halting $645M in spending as Democrats decry ‘untransparent’ process

One major point of controversy, aside from the size of the cuts and their impacts, was the fact that the House committee did not debate or hear testimony prior to voting. Members of the the House Democratic Caucus, and some members of the House Republican Caucus, spent the last few days sounding off on Hall and Bollin for pulling the rug out from pre-negotiated legislative spending and before some of the organizations could be allocated or reimbursed with the funding.
There was an open question on Thursday about whether Whitmer opposed Hall and Bollin’s actions due to the silence from the governor and her office after the vote took place on Wednesday. On late Thursday afternoon, Whitmer’s office issued a statement denouncing the cuts.
“The actions taken by House Republicans will kill jobs and raise costs for Michigan families – just days before the Christmas holiday,” Whitmer press secretary Stacey LaRouche told Gongwer News Service, a Lansing-based political newsletter. “Even Ebenezer Scrooge wouldn’t dream of such cruel cuts, like eliminating support for students in Flint impacted by the water crisis and survivors of child sexual assault.”
Yet, as Gongwer noted, Whitmer herself did not issue a direct statement. Still, the governor laid the blame at the feet of Hall and his caucus.
“In contrast, Senate Democrats are working to solve problems by passing legislation that makes it easier for workers to find jobs and for companies to invest and build in Michigan,” LaRouche said in a statement. “Our administration will continue to review the full impact of these cuts, but Michiganders deserve to know who is responsible: Matt Hall and his caucus.”
Michigan Dems say $645M work project cuts are ‘cruel’; GOP’s Rylee Linting also calls foul

Blame notwithstanding, the sheer lack of transparency in the process to gut a half-trillion dollars in agreed upon spending and doing so to service nonprofit organizations, some of which focus on the well-being of children, was seen as an affront the legislative process and the two-way trust between government officials and their constituents.
In the case of Small Talk Children’s Advocacy Center, the organization was appropriated $1.5 million covering a period of four years, money initially planned for an expansion into a physical space that was later redetermined to be better used on staffing and maintaining programs, Brace said.
The organization had up until 2029 to spend the money, which was to be distributed as reimbursements over the life of the legislative grant.
Brace said the organization only spent up to $90,000 to $100,000 of that money before the House’s decision earlier this week.
Democrats in both chambers of the Legislature were still trying to understand if the affected organizations would be able to keep the money they already spent or if the House GOP leadership intended to initiate clawback mechanisms.
Brace said it was his understanding that the money reimbursed to them would remain, it was just the other portion of the $1.5 million that was now in jeopardy.
He also said that no one from the House Appropriations Committee contacted Small Talk Children’s Advocacy Center before pulling the plug on the funding.
Now, the organization is looking at a potential reduction of services.
“We will have to regroup, and we’ll have to really look at our budget and see what kind of things we can live without,” Brace said. “Staffing is sort of the last thing on that list. In order for us to do the quality work that we need to do for these kids, who absolutely deserve to heal from the trauma of the sexual and physical abuse, we need to have the people to do it so. Keeping them is always going to be the priority.”
What could be on the chopping block is possibly a reduction in training services and supplies, but all of those things were important to the work, as well, Brace said.
“That’s a really terrible position to be in, because all of it is essential,” Brace added. “Our budget is really tight, and it’s made so that we can give kids the absolute best quality services.”
Another organization that will feel the crunch from the cuts is the RxKids program, a service of the Michigan State University Public Health Initiative, which aims to improve the life of children and families with direct cash support during pregnancy and child infancy. 
It was founded by Dr. Mona Hanna, the pediatrician and researcher who helped expose the Flint water crisis. Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids) was a big proponent in getting funding for RxKids during the legislative budget process earlier this year and championed the funding when it was delivered in the state budget – money that is now being slashed. 
In a statement, the organization denounced the cuts, noting that the House Appropriations Committee slashed $18.5 million in funding for RxKids.
“This was not new money, it had been allocated by the Legislature and signed into law to support Rx Kids expansion to moms and babies in 19 Michigan communities,” the organization said in a news release. “We have already heard from many of you expressing deep concern, and we share the seriousness of this moment, especially this close to the holidays.”
Without the funding, RxKids said there was a significant risk of a pause in the program, or outright halting it altogether.
“In the (fiscal year 2025-26) state budget, which was just passed two months ago, Michigan made a historic bipartisan commitment to expand Rx Kids to even more families,” the organization said. “However, (the) funding is not yet available, as contracts are not in place. We are working around the clock with state leaders, budget officials, and community and philanthropic partners to understand what options remain.”
Several lawmakers on Thursday said Hall’s and Bollin’s maneuvering with work projects has and will continue to erode constituent trust in their leaders and in the institutions that serve them. 
Brace said news of the cuts certainly puts that trust into question.
“To know that something that felt like about as sure a thing as possible could be ripped away is discouraging,” Brace said. “I don’t think it stops me from wanting to engage with the government. … This is and should be a nonpartisan issue; it shouldn’t be something that anybody is willing to tolerate or accept. We need our government to be partners with us on this, and that trust has to cut both ways.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/53084676258_239b554335_k-683x1024.jpg,,,2025-12-12 16:59:26.495656

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)A Massachusetts judge ruled that the Trump administration must continue a program meant to protect communities from natural disasters following a lawsuit from Colorado and other Democratic-led states. 
The Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program provides states with funding to proactively make their community infrastructure more defensible against natural disasters. Twenty states in July sued the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency for shutting down the BRIC program. Phil Weiser, the Colorado attorney general, is one of the plaintiffs.
U.S. District Court Judge Richard Stearns ordered FEMA to continue to program and restore funding that helps communities protect critical infrastructure. Funding from the BRIC supported the Gold Hill Pipeline Project west of Greeley to address water supply disruptions that could arise from wildfires, floods and other natural disasters.

Weiser’s office cited a study that found every dollar FEMA spends on pre-disaster mitigation efforts saves an average of $6 in post-disaster costs. 
“Natural disasters are not random occurrences in Colorado. We must prepare for them, and do everything we can to protect our communities,” Weiser, a Democrat who is running for governor in 2026, said in a statement. “This funding saves lives. It’s as simple as that. The Trump administration’s withholding of such critical funding is both illegal and immoral, and that’s why we sued to stop this action and ensure we received the funds.”
The federal government declining to provide funds puts the continued existence of state projects at risk, Stearns said, therefore adding additional risk of severe destruction from natural disasters. He said Homeland Security can recommend that Congress abolish the program, but because it was put in place by Congress, the Trump administration does not have the authority to abruptly stop it.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)State lawmakers of both parties said they plan to keep passing laws regulating artificial intelligence despite President Donald Trump’s efforts to stop them.
Trump signed an executive order Thursday evening that aims to override state artificial intelligence laws. He said his administration must work with Congress to develop a national AI policy, but that in the meantime, it will crack down on state laws.
The order comes after several other Trump administration efforts to rein in state AI laws and loosen restrictions for developers and technology companies.
But despite those moves, state lawmakers are continuing to prefile legislation related to artificial intelligence in preparation for their 2026 legislative sessions. Opponents are also skeptical about — and likely to sue over — Trump’s proposed national framework and his ability to restrict states from passing legislation.
As the Trump administration loosens AI rules, states look to regulate the technology

“I agree on not overregulating, but I don’t believe the federal government has the right to take away my right to protect my constituents if there’s an issue with AI,” said South Carolina Republican state Rep. Brandon Guffey, who penned a letter to Congress opposing legislation that would curtail state AI laws.
The letter, signed by 280 state lawmakers from across the country, shows that state legislators from both parties want to retain their ability to craft their own AI legislation, said South Dakota Democratic state Sen. Liz Larson, who co-wrote the letter.
Earlier this year, South Dakota Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden signed the state’s first artificial intelligence law, authored by Larson, prohibiting the use of a deepfake — a digitally altered photo or video that can make someone appear to be doing just about anything — to influence an election.
South Dakota and other states with more comprehensive AI laws, such as California and Colorado, would see their efforts overruled by Trump’s order, Larson said.
“To take away all of this work in a heartbeat and then prevent states from learning those lessons, without providing any alternative framework at the federal level, is just irresponsible,” she said. “It takes power away from the states.”
Trump’s efforts
Thursday’s executive order will establish an AI Litigation Task Force to bring court challenges against states with AI-related laws, with exceptions for a few issues such as child safety protections and data center infrastructure.
The order also directs the secretary of commerce to notify states that they could lose certain funds under the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program if their laws conflict with national AI policy priorities.
Trump said the order would help the United States beat China in dominating the burgeoning AI industry, adding that Chinese President Xi Jinping did not have similar restraints.
“This will not be successful unless they have one source of approval or disapproval,” he said. “It’s got to be one source. They can’t go to 50 different sources.”
In July, the Trump administration released the AI Action Plan, an initiative aimed at reducing regulatory barriers and accelerating the growth of AI infrastructure, including data centers. Trump also has revoked Biden-era AI safety and anti-discrimination policies.
Trump signs order intended to block states from regulating AI

The tech industry had lobbied for Trump’s order.
“This executive order is an important step towards ensuring that smart, unified federal policy — not bureaucratic red tape — secures America’s AI dominance for generations to come,” said Amy Bos, vice president of government affairs for NetChoice, a technology trade association, in a statement to Stateline.
As the administration looks to address increasing threats to national defense and cybersecurity, a centralized, national approach to AI policy is best, said Paul Lekas, the executive vice president for global public policy and government affairs at the Software & Information Industry Association.
“The White House is very motivated to ensure that there aren’t barriers to innovation and that we can continue to move forward,” he said. “And the White House is concerned that there is state legislation that may be purporting to regulate interstate commerce. We would be creating a patchwork that would be very hard for innovation.”
Congressional Republicans tried twice this year to pass moratoriums on state AI laws, but both efforts failed.
In the absence of a comprehensive federal artificial intelligence policy, state lawmakers have worked to regulate the rapid development of AI systems and protect consumers from potential harms.
Trump’s executive order could cause concern among lawmakers who fear possible blowback from the administration for their efforts, said Travis Hall, the director for state engagement at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit that advocates for digital rights and freedom of expression.
“I can’t imagine that state legislators aren’t going to continue to try to engage with these technologies in order to help protect and respond to the concerns of their constituents,” Hall said. “However, there’s no doubt that the intent of this executive order is to chill any actual oversight, accountability or regulation.”
State rules
This year, 38 states adopted or enacted measures related to artificial intelligence, according to a National Conference of State Legislatures database. Numerous state lawmakers have also prefiled legislation for 2026.
But tensions have grown over the past few months as Trump has pushed for deregulation and states have continued to create guardrails.










It doesn't hold any water and it doesn't have any teeth because the president doesn't have the authority to supersede state law.


– Colorado Democratic state Rep. Brianna Titone


In 2024, Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis signed the nation’s first comprehensive artificial intelligence framework into law. Under the law, developers of AI systems will be required to protect consumers from potential algorithmic discrimination.
But implementation of the law was postponed a few months until June 2026 after negotiations stalled during a special legislative session this summer aiming to ensure the law did not hinder technological innovation. And a spokesperson for Polis told Bloomberg in May that the governor supported a U.S. House GOP proposal that would impose a moratorium on state AI laws.
Trump’s executive order, which mentions the Colorado law as an example of legislation the administration may challenge, has caused uncertainty among some state lawmakers focused on regulating AI. But Colorado state Rep. Brianna Titone and state Sen. Robert Rodriguez, Democratic sponsors of the law, said they will continue their work.
Unless Congress passes legislation to restrict states from passing AI laws, Trump’s executive order can easily be challenged and overturned in court, she said.
“This is just a bunch of hot air,” Titone said. “It doesn’t hold any water and it doesn’t have any teeth because the president doesn’t have the authority to supersede state law. We will continue to do what we need to do for the people in our state, just like we always have, unless there is an actual preemption in federal law.”
Lawmakers fear AI data centers will drive up residents’ power bills

California and Illinois also have been at the forefront of artificial intelligence legislation over the past few years. In September, California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed the nation’s first law establishing a comprehensive legal framework for developers of the most advanced, large-scale artificial intelligence models, known as frontier artificial intelligence models. Those efforts are aimed at preventing AI models from causing catastrophic harm involving dozens of casualties or billion-dollar damages.
California officials have said they are considering a legal challenge over Trump’s order, and other states and groups are likely to sue as well.
Republican officials and GOP-led states, including some Trump allies, also are pushing forward with AI regulations. Efforts to protect consumers from AI harms are being proposed in Missouri, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas and Utah.
Earlier this month, Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis also unveiled a proposal for an AI Bill of Rights. The proposal aims to strengthen consumer protections related to AI and to address the growing impact data centers are having on local communities.
In South Carolina, Guffey said he plans to introduce a bill in January that would place rules on AI chatbots. Chatbots that use artificial intelligence are able to simulate conversations with users, but raise privacy and safety concerns.
Artificial intelligence is developing fast, Guffey noted. State lawmakers have been working on making sure the technology is safe to use — and they’ll keep doing that to protect their constituents, he said.
“The problem is that it’s not treated like a product — it’s treated like a service,” Guffey said. “If it was treated like a product, we have consumer protection laws where things could be recalled and adjusted and then put back out there once they’re safe. But that is not the case with any of this technology.”

Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran immigrant and Maryland resident, appeared early Friday for a check-in at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in Baltimore, less than day after a federal district judge ordered him released from ICE detention in Pennsylvania.
At his last ICE check-in, in August, Abrego Garcia walked in but didn’t walk out: Authorities detained him and held him until Thursday. But Friday, Abrego Garcia walked out of the building to cheers and chants, led by members of the immigrant rights group CASA to a black car that took him to rejoin his family in Prince George’s County.
Before Abrego-Garcia walked inside the building Friday, he thanked his supporters who rallied there, talked about spending the holidays with his family and offered advice for others suffering similar legal battles against the Trump administration.
“I stand before you as a free man, and I want you to remember me this way with my head held up high,” Abrego Garica said in Spanish, through a CASA translator.
“I stand here today with my head held up high, and I will continue to fight and stand firm against all of the injustices this government has done upon me,” Abrego Garcia said. “Regardless of this administration, I believe this is a country of laws, and I believe that this injustice will come to its end. Keep fighting. Do not give up. I wish all of you love and justice. Keep going.”

One of his attorneys, Simon Y. Sandoval-Moshenberg, told reporters and a few dozen protesters outside the field office that the federal judge who ordered Abrego Garcia freed Thursday said Friday that he could not be detained by ICE at his latest check-in.
Based on a temporary restraining order filed by his attorneys, Sandoval-Moshenberg said the judge will schedule a hearing at U.S. District Court in Greenbelt that Abrego Garcia will be able to attend.
“The legal fight is far from over,” Sandoval-Moshenberg said. “I wish I could say that with this, the government is going to leave well enough alone. This man has suffered enough.”
Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin called the judge’s decision to let Abrego Garcia free “naked judicial activism.”
“This order lacks any valid legal basis and we will continue to fight this tooth and nail in the courts,” McLaughlin said in an email Friday morning that repeated her statement from the day before.
Abrego Garcia’s return to the Baltimore ICE office came one day after U.S. District Court of Maryland Judge Paul Xinis ordered the Trump administration to release him from the Moshannon Valley Processing Center in Pennsylvania, where he had been held since September. He was released Thursday evening and spent the night at his home in Beltsville.
Since he was first detained by immigration officials in March and wrongly deported to his home county of El Salvador, Abrego Garcia’s case has shone a spotlight on the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown.
Abrego Garcia was originally deported to a brutal prison in El Salvador, despite a previous court ruling that prohibited his transfer there because of fear of violence by Salvadoran gangs.
Months later — and months after the U.S. Supreme Court’s April order that the Trump administration “facilitate” Abrego Garcia’s return –he was brought back to the U.S. on June 6, only to face charges of human smuggling in Tennessee. The judge in that case eventually ordered Abrego Garcia released to home detention while his claim of vindictive prosecution in the Tennessee case proceeded.
Xinis, who got involved in the case when Abrego Garcia was first deported, issued a ruling Thurday that was highly critical of the administration’s actions in the case. She found that Abrego Garcia’s latest detention, since his August ICE check-in, was “again without lawful authority,” because the Trump administration has been holding him for deportation but has not made an effort to remove him to a third country.

The government’s “conduct over the past months belie that his detention has been for the basic purpose of effectuating removal, lending further support that Abrego Garcia should be held no longer,” Xinis wrote in her opinion.
Costa Rica has agreed to accept Abrego Garcia as a refugee, but Justice Department lawyers could not give Xinis a clear explanation of why the Trump administration would not send him there. Instead, the administration has proposed deporting Abrego Garcia to several countries in Africa.
Back in Baltimore on Friday morning, dozens of supporters braved the cold to hold up signs, chant and then clap and cheer when Abrego Garcia walked back outside the ICE building a free man, chanting “todos somos Kilmar,” or “we are all Kilmar.”
“It’s definitely a good day, but it is a good day to know that he’ll be able to spend the holidays with his family, “said Baltimore City Councilmember Odette Ramos, who attended the rally.
“He and his family have been so brave to go through all of this and to have their story really symbolize, frankly, what so many others are going through,” she said. “The fight’s not over.”

(Photo by Alyssa Chen/Minnesota Reformer.) Gov. Tim Walz announced a new role aimed at preventing fraud in state-run human services programs on Friday following years of widespread abuse that has siphoned away hundreds of millions of dollars intended to help vulnerable populations and created a crisis of confidence in his administration.
Tim O’Malley, a former superintendent of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension under Republican Gov. Tim Pawlenty, will be the state’s new Director of Program Integrity starting next month.
“I’m honored that Governor Walz has asked me to assist in combating fraud here,” O’Malley said at a news conference. “I’m not here to serve any individual, and I’m not here to serve a political party. I’m here to serve Minnesotans.”
He added that the governor had privately assured him that “all of us have the freedom and the autonomy to act to do whatever is necessary to solve this.”
Minnesota Republican lawmakers criticized the appointment as too little, too late.
Rep. Kristin Robbins, a Republican gubernatorial challenger to Walz and chair of the House fraud prevention committee, said in a statement, “The Walz fraud prevention program should be his resignation.”
O’Malley will begin the new role once he finishes his current role as interim chief judge of the Court of Administrative Hearings.
O’Malley said he doesn’t have specifics on what the work will entail, though he said, “I believe we’re well positioned to address this.”
Walz also announced a new contract with WayPoint, a firm based in White Bear Lake owned by Josiah Lamb, to develop a “toolkit” of procedures for state agencies to better prevent and address fraud. The contract is currently for up to $200,000, said Bureau of Criminal Apprehension Superintendent Drew Evans.
O’Malley worked at the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension from 1989 to 2010. He has also been an FBI SWAT team member and sniper. In 2014, O’Malley was hired by the St. Paul-Minneapolis Archdiocese to oversee its response to clergy sex abuse.
Fraud in Minnesota’s human services has become a high-profile political issue, drawing attention from President Donald Trump, who has used the issue to attack Minnesota’s Somali-American community.
Federal authorities have already charged scores of people for allegedly defrauding a pandemic-era child nutrition program, an autism treatment program and Housing Stabilization Services. Former acting U.S. Attorney for the District of Minnesota Joe Thompson estimated the total amount in fraud in state programs could exceed $1 billion.
Meanwhile, Minnesota’s Department of Human Services has started addressing fraud in other services, pausing payments in a service called Integrated Community Supports starting in September and implementing a prepayment review process for 14 programs, including ICS, starting in December.
Integrated Community Supports is a Medicaid-funded service that helps people with disabilities live independently in the community rather than in an institution. In a statement late November, DHS confirmed that there were 50 active payment withholds affecting 17 ICS providers, citing credible allegations of fraud.
A repeated refrain of the press conference was that there are active investigations into human services fraud, which officials said limited what information they could openly discuss. Walz also referenced “a Medicaid program” where much of the fraud, in terms of money, is coming up.
Evans said to expect “additional prosecutions related to some of these Medicaid programs.”
“The bulk of what I would consider the most egregious and legitimate tips and referrals coming through that portal were absolutely related to this Medicaid program, which is not news to the state,” Evans added.
Neither Evans nor Walz returned questions clarifying whether they were referring to a particular Medicaid service or Medicaid programs as a whole.
DHS Temporary Commissioner Shireen Gandhi said that the Office of the Inspector General has more than 1,300 open cases and has identified over $50 million for recovery over the past 5 years. She said that DHS Inspector General James Clark, who was not present Friday, told her that “fraud schemes are evolving and DHS needs to do more to get ahead of criminals.”
“If you get caught stealing from Minnesota’s most vulnerable people, I hope you go to prison,” Gandhi said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0679-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-12 16:59:26.495656

(Photo by simpson33 via iStock / Getty Images Plus)A Woodbury County jail inmate is suing the federal government, alleging she’s being unlawfully detained by ICE and faces a year of confinement while being denied her due process rights.
The case is one of hundreds of similar lawsuits filed around that nation against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the U.S. Department of Justice.
Rosaura Genchi Garcia alleges the federal government is “attempting to circumvent immigration law and rewrite the Immigration and Nationality Act” by detaining her and others and denying them due process by refusing to let them appear in court and argue for release on bond while their immigration cases are pending.

The Trump administration’s position is that contrary to decades of past precedent, longstanding federal law requires mandatory detention without the possibility of release on bond for all individuals who are suspected of unauthorized entry to the United States.
In the past, mandatory detention was limited to those individuals who were apprehended while attempting to enter the country. Individuals who were taken into custody after being in the United States for months, years or decades, were normally given the opportunity to argue for their release on bond while their immigration case was pending.
As with other detainees, Garcia is seeking relief from a federal judge in U.S. District Court, arguing that the bond-hearing decisions made by immigration judges in the separate legal arena of Immigration Court are unconstitutional.
While virtually every district court judge has sided with the detainees in finding that they are entitled to a bond hearing, ICE and Homeland Security have maintained their stance that, under the Trump administration’s new interpretation of federal law, detention is mandatory. As a result, hundreds of Immigration Court cases have stalled while the individual detainees hire lawyers to file lawsuits on their behalf in U.S. District Court.
In their response to Garcia’s lawsuit, lawyers for Homeland Security have argued that mandatory detention is lawful and that the U.S.  Supreme Court “has long recognized Congress’s broad power and immunity from judicial control to expel aliens from the country and to detain them while doing so.”
According to court records, Garcia came to the United States from Mexico in 2004 and was arrested in June 2025 for working under an alias. In September 2025, after completing her sentence in that case, Garcia was detained by ICE and held for potential deportation.
In early October, she requested a bond hearing but was denied by an immigration court judge, who cited the legal theory that he lacked jurisdiction to even consider such a request.
Garcia’s attorneys argue the Department of Justice, Homeland Security and others are ignoring binding federal regulations, past court rulings and the plain language of the law, all in an effort to “further a political agenda by the current presidential administration.”
In their lawsuit, they note that the deportation decisions rendered by immigration judges are not final unless the individual being detained chooses not to file an appeal. As such, it may be at least a year before Garcia’s case reaches the stage of a final decision, which means she is likely to be jailed for at least another 12 months, they say.
They point out that processing time in some immigration cases ranges from 14 months to 48 months, and the increasing number of appeals filed as a result of the Trump administration’s stance is creating a backlog of cases at the Board of Immigration Appeals.
In their petition to district court, lawyers for Garcia argue that while the actions of the Trump administration “will not hold up in Federal Appeals Court, it will take time to get decisions from every single circuit court — and in the meantime the government is stripping immigrants of their constitutional rights.”
In addition to DHS, ICE and the DOJ, Garcia’s lawsuit names as defendants Greg London, the sheriff in Sarpy County, Nebraska; Sarpy County Jail Director Jo Martin; U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi; and Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem.
The Sarpy County officials are named as defendants in the case because, when the lawsuit was initially filed several weeks ago, Garcia was being held in the Sarpy County Jail. Since then, Garcia has been transferred to Iowa’s Woodbury County Jail, which has resulted in the lawsuit being transferred from U.S. District Court for the District of Nebraska to U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa.

Patrick Morrisey announces on Thursday, Sept. 18, 2025, that he is asking for West Virginians’ input on the state’s application for the federal Rural Health Transformation Program. On Friday, Dec. 12, he released the application to the public. (Photo courtesy of the West Virginia Office of Gov. Patrick Morrisey)Schools, libraries and other community institutions in rural West Virginia would be outfitted for use in telemedicine under the state’s proposal for funding from the federal Rural Health Transformation Program. 
“Those same institutions will become locations for community clinics, where health care providers go on a regular basis to meet patients where they are, in person,” the application says. 
The governor’s office released the application Friday afternoon. Morrisey’s office submitted it to the federal government last month. 
“West Virginia is ready to lead the nation in rural health innovation,” Morrisey said in a news release Friday. “By releasing this application to the public, communities and stakeholders can see firsthand how they can participate in this historic investment to shape the future of health care in our state.”
West Virginia is eligible for more than $100 million per year over five years from the federal program, which was a part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act President Donald Trump signed into law this summer. The program aims to “transform the existing rural health care infrastructure and build sustainable health care systems that expand access, enhance quality of care, and improve outcomes for patients,” according to the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid.
The application outlines seven “flagship” initiatives for which the state would use the funding, including a “Connected Caregrid,” meant to help West Virginians who struggle to find care because physicians are too far away. 
Overall, the state seeks to use the federal funding to “revolutionize rural health care in West Virginia.” State officials expect to hear from the federal government about their funding award by the end of the year. 
In addition to expanding telehealth access, the state would use the funding to address the state’s health care worker shortage by recruiting West Virginia high school students to health care careers, adding health care faculty at regional and technical colleges and using financial incentives to attract and keep providers in rural areas. 
Another of the initiatives, the Rural Health Link, would provide patients access to transportation to medical appointments using public buses, rideshare services and volunteer drivers.  
As part of the application, 41 “stakeholders” from around the state signed on to a letter of support. They include health systems, universities, state agencies, insurance companies and more. 
“For West Virginians to thrive, we must prioritize and transform rural health care,” Jason Landers, president of Highmark Health Options West Virginia, said in the letter. “Success will depend on a coordinated, determined and multifaceted approach uniting public and private sectors. Highmark Health Options West Virginia is proud to be an active, engaged and collaborative partner in these efforts, profoundly invested in our West Virginia neighbors, and committed to our mission of improving lives through better health.”
The state’s complete application and supporting documents are available on Morrisey’s website, https://governor.wv.gov/rht.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-12 21:16:31+00:00,CT Mirror,"Defense bill will boost CT contractors, including Electric Boat",Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/12/ndaa-connecticut-electric-boat-submarines-pratt-whitney-sikorsky/,"The National Defense Authorization Act will bolster CT's big three defense companies — Electric Boat, Sikorsky and Pratt & Whitney.","Connecticut defense contractors are poised to benefit from the yearly boosts in Congress’ defense policy bill, including funding to address budget shortfalls for submarine programs predominantly built by Groton-based Electric Boat.
Similar to past years, the National Defense Authorization Act will bolster the state’s big three defense companies — General Dynamics Electric Boat, Sikorsky and Pratt & Whitney — and the suppliers that work with them, as well as the country’s shipbuilding needs as it deals with rising costs and production backlogs.
That includes additional funding for the Virginia-class submarine program to maintain its two-per-year build rate, as well as new contracting authority for the Columbia-class program. U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-2nd District, said that will help address gaps that were left in other pieces of federal legislation.
The U.S. House easily passed the $901 billion fiscal year 2026 NDAA this week after lawmakers in both chambers negotiated a compromise over the past couple of months. The U.S. Senate will take it up next week, and once it fully clears Congress, President Donald Trump is expected to sign it into law. The policy bill only authorizes funding, since Congress approves the money through its spending bills.
In addition to Connecticut’s defense priorities, the NDAA also authorizes a 3.8% pay raise for service members and reasserts Congress’ authority over military matters, along with repealing the 1991 and 2002 Authorizations for Use of Military Force against Iraq.
The bill also provides a rare — and bipartisan — moment of congressional oversight of Trump’s administration and the Pentagon. It withholds some of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s travel budget until he releases videos of strikes against alleged drug boats in the Caribbean. And it requires the administration to notify Congress and provide a reason about the removal or transfer of members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, combatant commanders and Judge Advocates General.
“Nearly one year into the Trump Administration, the House and Senate majorities have rarely acted as a check and balance on the President’s agenda,” Courtney said in a statement. “Passage of these bipartisan oversight measures and modifications of the Trump budget is a refreshingly healthy moment in the 119th Congress.”
Connecticut’s entire House delegation voted in support of the NDAA, with the exception of U.S. Rep. Jahana Hayes, D-5th District. She said the price tag on the defense policy bill was more money than what was originally requested, something she took issue with as domestic programs and social services get hit by funding cuts.
“At a time when President Trump is scrutinizing every federal dollar for critical domestic programs, we continue to increase the defense budget without proper oversight or reform,” Hayes said in a statement. “I acknowledge the wins that were achieved in this legislation, but there comes a point where we have to demand reform of our defense appropriations.”
While others in the delegation voted for the bill, they expressed disappointment with the omission of other provisions in the final NDAA.
U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-3rd District, praised the inclusion of the outbound investment screening requirements, which the bill says gives the president the authority to “prevent countries of concern from exploiting United States capital to undermine United States national security and foreign policy interests.”
But DeLauro was frustrated that Republican leaders stripped out certain measures like the expansion of military families’ health insurance to cover fertility treatments including in vitro fertilization, also known as IVF. 
“This bill is better than prior years,” DeLauro said in a statement, “but I am frustrated that Speaker [Mike] Johnson has continued his practice of making 11th hour unilateral decisions that undermine bipartisan progress on other areas, including the inclusion of riders that seek to discriminate against LGBTQI+ servicemembers, and restricting families’ access to IVF.”
On submarine funding, the NDAA authorizes an additional $1.9 billion for the nuclear-powered Virginia-class program. A billion of that came from a Courtney amendment that he said was meant to address “glaring shortfalls” in funding for the program.
On top of that, the defense policy bill also authorizes an additional $615 million for advanced procurement for the program, which he said also helps with the wage boosts for shipyard workers that were part of the new labor contract agreements in the spring.  
Courtney, the ranking member of the Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee, had attributed the shortfall to the administration’s two-pronged approach to funding the procurement of two Virginia-class for the new fiscal year: paying for one boat through the standard budget process and covering the other through the budget reconciliation process used to pass Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”
His eastern Connecticut district includes Electric Boat’s Groton shipyard and many of the suppliers that work with the General Dynamics company. Electric Boat locations in Groton and Quonset Point, R.I., handle much of the Virginia-class program, along with Huntington Ingalls Industries’ Newport News Shipbuilding in Virginia.
Electric Boat is also the lead contractor on the Columbia-class program, the nuclear-powered ballistic missile vessels that will replace its Ohio-class submarines. It is similarly working with Newport News Shipbuilding on the construction.
The NDAA also authorizes incremental funding for the Columbia-class program, new contracting authority for five new submarines and an additional $700 million for advanced procurement. 
Courtney had been frustrated about the lack of funding for the Columbia program in last month’s spending package that reopened the government after a 43-day shutdown.
Those authorizations could help Electric Boat and others address the growing costs of materials and backlogs in production as the submarine industry tries to meet the long-term goals of both the Navy and a U.S. submarine deal with Australia.
“With a continued two-per-year for Virginia-class submarines, alongside the Columbia-class now in full production, submarine shipyards are reaching all-time high tonnage output,” Courtney said. “The investments in this bill for workforce hiring and retention, facilities and supply chains will drive growth of a new generation of shipbuilders to meet our nation’s call.”
The NDAA also includes multiyear procurement and authorizations for the modernization of Black Hawk helicopters, as well as the procurement of CH-53K heavy lift helicopters, which are both constructed at Sikorsky in Stratford. And it authorizes funding for F-35 fighter jets, which uses F135 engines solely produced by Pratt & Whitney.  
There’s also a couple of U.S. Coast Guard provisions, including the ability to use existing funds to help complete the construction of the National Coast Guard Museum in New London, which until now wasn’t allowed to get funding from the service.
The NDAA also includes a safe-to-report policy that Courtney has been pushing for years and has inserted in other legislation. The measure offers protections for cadets who report instances of sexual assault or harassment to ensure they are not punished for minor violations under the Uniform Code of Military Justice that might have been committed when the crime took place. Such incidents include underage drinking, substance abuse, violations of curfew or being in areas that are off limits.
These protections have been in place at other military academies after Congress passed a defense policy bill in 2021. But the Coast Guard and its service academy were excluded because of jurisdiction issues. Unlike other military branches covered under the Pentagon, the Coast Guard reports to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
The U.S. Coast Guard Academy adopted its own safe-to-report policy, which protects someone reporting sexual assault — as well as a bystander trying to prevent it from occurring — from “minor collateral violations” including underage drinking, violating barracks rules and prohibited relationships. That policy was adopted in response to the news that the Coast Guard had concealed an investigation known as “Operation Fouled Anchor” that looked into sexual assault claims made between 1988 and 2006 at the New London service academy.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AP25108024071749-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-12 16:59:26.495656

On Monday, the Reformer reported the DFL party was standing by 8th District DFL Chair Cyndy Martin despite the charge.
Local congressional district parties aren’t controlled by the state party, but state officials declined to use their influence to pressure Martin to resign. DFL Chair Richard Carlbom, who previously said he would wait for “due process to play out,” thanked Martin for her service in a Friday statement to the Reformer.
​​“We appreciate Cyndy Martin’s years of service to the party and will be providing the necessary support as local units work to fill the open leadership roles. Our focus right now is to work with the people of Northern Minnesota to build electoral strength for 2026,” Carlbom said.
On the evening of July 3, 2024, police in Itasca County responded to a report of a person lying in the lane of Highway 169, near Nashwauk. They discovered the body of 19-year-old Carter Haithcock, who was pronounced dead at the scene.
Martin the next morning called 911 and said that she may have been involved in a collision near Nashwauk the night before. Four months later, prosecutors charged Martin with a felony count of criminal vehicular homicide.
Martin last month pleaded not guilty to the charge, and she faces up to 10 years in prison.
According to court documents, Martin told police she didn’t stop after the July 2024 collision.
“She believed she struck an owl or a turkey. (Martin) stated she did not stop, and continued home,” the criminal complaint reads.
The incident split Democrats between those who believed due process should play out for the accused and those who think a personal scandal will derail the goals of northern Minnesota Democrats.
Martin was one of the most influential DFL figures in northern Minnesota. In addition to chairing the 8th District party, she sat on the DFL’s Constitution, Bylaws and Rules Committee. She was also a successful fundraiser and has connections with statewide elected officials.
Martin’s resignation comes one day before the DFL’s State Central Committee is scheduled to meet.

The state has come close to making it illegal to sell gummies, drinks, and other products with hemp-derived THC to kids. The N.C. House and Senate have passed bills back and forth, but have yet to agree on the details.
The task force voted to recommend restrictions on hemp consumables after hearing from Dabney Ferris, who said she became addicted to THC products when she was 15 and is now sober. 
“Had there been laws in place, had they been harder to get, I may never have become addicted,” she told the task force Tuesday. 
Ferris spoke at a press conference at the Legislative Building earlier this year in support of a new law. 
The federal ban is set to begin in November 2026. Nevertheless, the task force decided to renew its recommendation for age restrictions because the ban won’t kick in for months — leaving kids, as one member said, “in limbo.”
The Child Fatality Task Force votes each year on legislative recommendations, and several approved Tuesday are repeats of requests from previous years.
The group will continue to support making it illegal to sell tobacco products, including vapes, to people younger than 21. Raising the age from 18 to 21 would align the state with federal law. 
The task force also voted to continue its long-time support for stronger child passenger safety laws, Recommendations include requiring children younger than 8 to sit in the rear seat when the vehicle has a passenger-side front air bag. The current cut-off is age 5. The updated law should also clarify that infants and toddlers must ride in rear-facing car seats, the recommendation says. 
In another holdover from previous years, the task force voted to support hiring more school social workers, counselors, nurses, and psychologists. 
The task force voted to endorse the efforts of other groups working to restrict social media companies’ use of minors’ data. The intent is to make targeting less effective and reduce the potential for addiction. 
The task force will meet again in February to consider more recommendations before finalizing its annual legislative report.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screen-Shot-2025-04-09-at-11.05.45-AM-1024x547.png,,,2025-12-12 16:59:26.495656

The virus has impacted more than 184 million commercial and backyard poultry birds and more than 1,000 head of dairy cattle since February 2022, 
The letter comes as detections of the bird flu have increased over the winter months in states across the country, according to reporting from the USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.

A case of bird flu was detected in Iowa Dec. 2, in a Hamilton County commercial turkey flock, and as recently as Tuesday in flocks in Indiana, North Dakota, Minnesota and Washington. 
The bipartisan letter, which included Iowa Republicans Joni Ernst and Chuck Grassley, said a “thoughtful and comprehensive vaccine strategy” would “strengthen” the nation’s ability to fight the bird flu, as it prepares for a “resurgence.”
U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins launched a $1 billion plan in February to combat the ongoing outbreak of the H5N1 virus. Part of that plan included $100 million for research into a bird flu vaccine and other potential treatments. 
The letter said USDA has a “draft proposal of an avian flu vaccine strategy for poultry” that is “currently under review” and the signed senators urged the department to advance the process with “speed and diligence.” 
A draft proposal for a bird flu vaccine strategy had not been filed in the Federal Register as of Friday. In June, Reuters reported USDA was “considering” a plan to vaccinate poultry for HPAI and expected the plan would be completed in July. 
USDA did not respond Friday to a request for comment and for additional information on the vaccination plan. 
Members of the Congressional Chicken Caucus, representing the interests of poultry producing states, submitted a letter to Rollins in February, noting they were wary of a vaccine, as it might interrupt export markets. 
While the December letter from senators urged the advancement of the vaccine process, it also asked for “proactive consultation with affected stakeholders.” 
“Any finalized vaccine strategy must take into account feedback from animal health stakeholders, industry experts, and be grounded in sound science,” the letter said. 
Senators said the vaccine strategy should also address “all impacted species” of poultry and that the department should then prioritize a vaccine strategy for dairy cattle. 
“Finally, as the USDA rolls out any avian flu vaccine strategy, it is critical that clear and transparent communication to producers, veterinarians, and state animal health officials, along with direct guidance and resources are in place,” the letter said. 
The letter was addressed to Rollins and dated Dec. 11. Signees included: Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minnesota; Sen. Mike Rounds, R-South Dakota; Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pennsylvania; Sen. John Thune R-South Dakota; Sen. Ruben Gallego, D-Arizona; Sen. James Justice, R-West Virginia; Sen. Elissa Slotkin, D-Michigan; Sen. Michael Lee, R-Utah; Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York; Sen.

(Photo via Florida House)Florida’s University Chancellor Ray Rodrigues was already the highest-paid state employee with his more tha $441K salary, beating out the No. 2 employee (Education Commissioner Anastasios “Stasi” Kamoutsas) by roughly $110K.
But on Friday, that financial lead grew when the Board of Governors of the State University System approved a three-year contract extension including a $600,000 base salary with a chance at a 20% performance bonus. This makes Rodrigues the highest-paid state employee by far, according to the database of state employee salaries. The effective date is Jan. 1
He nearly doubles Kamoutsas’ $330K salary. But Kamoutsas was one of the biggest supporters of Rodrigues’ pay increase.
“When we talk about what a national model this state is in higher education and the envy of the country … I can’t emphasize enough how deserving he is,” Kamoutsas said during Friday’s Board of Governors meeting. “Not just of this pay increase, but honestly more.”
According to the contract amendment, raises in Rodrigues’ contract are paid from Board of Governors Foundation funds, which are considered private. When the state began setting up its new accrediting body under direction from Gov. Ron DeSantis, the BOG in July transferred $4 million in budget allocated funds to that foundation.
The new contract expires in 2029 and provides a $75,000 annual housing stipend and $12,000 a car allowance.
Eric Silagy, former CEO of Florida Power & Light, was the lone BOG member to vote against the new contract — which he claimed was submitted to members at the 11th hour.
“I hear you loud and clear on the fact that taxpayers aren’t directly paying this increase, but it is coming through universities’ foundations,” he said, calling the increase “significant” and unprecedented for an employee staying in the same role. “And so, it is money that would otherwise be able to be spent for other things that would benefit students.”
Various university presidents make more than Rodrigues, but state law requires university president contracts to be paid by foundation funds once they exceed $200,000. 
The contract defines Rodrigues’ responsibilities as ensuring “the efficient operations of the Board” and he “is authorized to enter into any contract necessary for the operation of the Board to employ all personnel and establish policies and procedure, incident to Board personnel and operations, and to submit and annual legislative budget request and any amendments thereto for the Board office to the Board for approval.”
Rodrigues “shall serve as the Board’s liaison for communications with university boards of trustees, university presidents and other university officers and employees, the Governors and the Governor’s staff, the Legislature and the Legislature’s staff, the media, other state entities, and the public.”
Rodrigues has served as university chancellor since 2022. He’s now paid a $441,252 salary, some $40,000 more than under his first contract. Rodrigues previously served 12 years in the Florida Legislature. As of Dec. 2021 — his most recently available financial disclosure form — his net worth was $313,213.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/HousePhotoOriginal7055-ray-rodriquez-1024x696.jpg,,,2025-12-12 15:57:34.779937

Jill Nolin/Georgia RecorderATLANTA — The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against Fulton County for refusing to turn over voter records from the 2020 election, escalating an ongoing legal campaign aimed at forcing state and local officials to disclose sensitive voter roll information to the federal government.
The lawsuit, filed in a federal district court in Atlanta, demanded that Fulton County turn over “all used and void ballots, stubs of all ballots, signature envelopes, and corresponding envelope digital files,” from the 2020 election. It also accuses Fulton County Clerk Ché Alexander of violating federal laws for refusing to relinquish the records.
In a statement, Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon said the records were needed to protect U.S. citizens from “vote dilution.”
Trump has long claimed — without evidence — that the 2020 election was stolen in Georgia and other swing states, blaming his loss on unfounded accusations of rampant voting fraud, even though two recounts affirmed former President Joe Biden’s victory in Georgia. In an interview with POLITICO published earlier this week, Trump claimed that in the next few months, evidence would emerge to prove that 2020 was “a rigged election.”
Dhillon first requested Fulton County’s 2020 election records in October, following a subpoena over the same records issued by the State Election Board in 2024. In a letter to the Fulton County Board of Election, she argued that the records were needed to “ascertain Georgia’s compliance” with the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 and the 2002 Help America Vote Act.
DOJ is sharing state voter roll lists with Homeland Security

However, Alexander denied Dhillon’s request, according to the lawsuit, stating that the records were under seal and could not be released without a court order. Alexander did not immediately reply to a request for comment Friday.
The Justice Department also filed lawsuits against Colorado, Hawaii, Massachusetts and Nevada on Friday to compel the states to turn over their voter registration lists.
The Justice Department has requested voter data from 40 states and filed lawsuits against 18 states that refused to provide the records, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University, which is tracking the requests. Officials told Stateline that the records will be shared with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in an effort to locate noncitizens on the voting rolls.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_8422.jpeg,,,2025-12-12 15:57:34.779937

A new influenza A(H3N2) virus strain renamed “H3N2 subclade K,” which is circulating widely today, was identified by health organizations months after the seasonal influenza vaccine was developed. 
The World Health Organization selected the components for the northern hemisphere influenza vaccine between February and March of this year. Since August, there has been a rapid increase of A(H3N2) subclade K.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention explains that even if the current vaccine does not match the flu virus mutation that is currently being spread — the “K” variant — vaccination continues to protect against severe illness, hospitalization and death, as well as offering protection against other influenza viruses and help reduce the overall community spread.

Evidence shows he’s slinging quesadillas.,Molly Minta and Anna Wolfe,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/12/jackson-councilman-dope-boys-accusation/,"Jackson City Councilman Kenneth Stokes has taken exceptional steps to target his nephew Daniel Cooper’s food truck. Stokes has repeatedly called police, complained to city departments and used his own vehicle to block the lot where the food truck operates.","Kenneth Stokes is preoccupied with the concept of “dope boys.”
It’s one of the longtime Jackson city councilman’s go-to insults, hurled toward people he blames for the city’s woes. “Dope boys are controlling this city,” he said during a December council meeting.
He has recently zeroed in on the owner of a food truck that secured a business license with the city last year and operates on an empty lot near Stokes’ home in central Jackson’s Georgetown neighborhood.

The blue trailer housing Georgetown Grub is one of few places in the area to grab a bite. It serves wings, quesadillas, cheesesteaks and fried broccoli across from an abandoned Jasco gas station. 
Stokes alleges it serves dope. 
“The dope boys have found a way to get the planning department to help give permission and permits for them to have food trucks,” he said from behind the council dais. “They’re not selling food, but they’re selling dope.”
This, in part, is what inspired Stokes’ new ordinance, enacted Dec. 2, banning city employees from maintaining any kind of business or personal relationship with anyone “known to be engaged in illegal drug activity.” 
The new law perplexed some Jacksonians, leaving them to wonder what conspiracies are afoot at City Hall. But for residents in Georgetown, it’s clear the origin of Stokes’ decree is more personal – considering the owner of the supposed drug-deal-on-wheels is the councilman’s own nephew, Daniel Cooper.
An HVAC technician who manages several rental homes in the neighborhood, Cooper said he opened the mobile restaurant – which, indeed, sells food – last year after cleaning up an abandoned lot owned by his late grandfather.

Cooper, who now lives in Clinton with his wife and teenage son, said he wanted to help revitalize the neighborhood where he grew up. But ever since he returned to Georgetown, Cooper said he’s dealt with harassment from the councilman. Mississippi Today found no Jackson drug sale charges in Cooper’s history. 
“He thinks he can’t be touched. He thinks that everybody sells dope,” Cooper said of Stokes. “But he met his match with me because I’m not scared to fight back, because I know I’m not doing nothing illegal.”
“I’m not going to let a lie run me from that lot and diminish my father and my grandfather’s legacy,” Cooper said.
Not only does Stokes say the food truck is a dope operation, he also claims it has no authority to operate there on a major thoroughfare at the intersection of Woodrow Wilson and Ludlow avenues. That’s because of its complicated ownership status: The lot is heirs property, meaning its owner did not leave a will when he died.

Several people have a potential stake in the property, including Cooper’s father and, since his wife died, Stokes and their children.
The city’s longest serving councilmember elected in 1989, Stokes has taken exceptional steps to target Cooper’s business, repeatedly calling the cops, complaining to city business departments, blocking the entrance of the lot with his own truck and now using it to justify his nebulous ordinance.
The ordinance, which was not reviewed by the city’s legal office before passage, requires employees who know of colleagues with relationships to drug dealers to “immediately” disclose the information to the city attorney. 
Earlier this week, City Attorney Drew Martin said no one, including Stokes, has made such a report.
There’s little dispute that Georgetown, a historically Black neighborhood in a census tract with a poverty rate of over 30%, experiences crime because of the presence of narcotics. 
“He does have concerns that there are folks in that part of town who are engaged in illegal activity, and I share his concerns,” Pieter Teeuwissen, the city’s chief administrative officer and a former Hinds County judge, said of Stokes. “I can’t say I share those concerns about these individuals.” 
The neighborhood is also home to elderly and working class people who live in colorful, well-kept homes, enjoy fresh produce from a community garden and generally love their community.

But Stokes and one of his neighbors and allies, Geneva Johnson, are adamant that Georgetown is overridden with dope dealers, who they say congregate at the barber shop across the street from the food truck and, before it closed, the Jasco at the same intersection. Stokes takes credit for shuttering the gas station. 
Johnson said she’s experienced multiple burglaries, and that despite her numerous calls, police have neglected to address the dope problem. She estimates drug dealers live in 13 out of 24 houses on her block. This activity is one reason they allege Cooper must be involved with drugs.
“If they were not involved with drugs, why would they locate there, in a drug haven?” Stokes said.
Ten years ago, police raided the building housing the barbershop, finding $6,000 worth of methamphetamine. Its owner Shawn Morrow was arrested, but he said the drugs were found in a separate unit from his shop, and his guilty plea was deferred, meaning the court dismissed the charges after he completed three years of probation. 
In the last two years, police have recorded two calls at the address, both for “suspicious circumstances,” according to a JPD call log.
Morrow denied having any involvement in drugs, but he wasn’t surprised by the accusation, which he said is a common refrain from Stokes. Morrow told Mississippi Today that Stokes has run off all Black businesses in the area and has failed to do anything to build up the community. 
Stokes is known for cruising the neighborhood in his white Chevy Suburban, scowling, several residents told Mississippi Today.
Johnson similarly keeps a look out. When she sees Daniel Cooper in the neighborhood, she alleges his conduct matches that of the other dealers she’s aware of in the area.
“It’s obvious that they’re doing something illegal because the cars come and go,” Johnson said, adding that people in the neighborhood frequently approach Cooper. “Who walks away with their hand closed up? Nobody.”
Resident Norma Michael, the Georgetown Community Neighborhood Association president and founder of the “Sharing is Caring” Neighborhood Block Garden, said she’s disappointed by the claims, for the message they send about her community. She told Mississippi Today that no one who attends the association’s meetings has complained about drug dealing in the neighborhood. 
Michael said it seems like Stokes’ is on a “witch hunt” because nearly every issue he has raised recently about the neighborhood seems to trace back to Cooper. 
“He has an obsession about it, and I can’t understand that,” she said. “Here’s a man trying to do something about the neighborhood. It’s no drugs, it’s no people hanging around (the food truck) drinking or smoking or things like that. It was a good thing to me.”

Cooper and his father, Roy Byram Cooper, argue their efforts have reduced crime in the neighborhood. Vagrants had taken up residence in an abandoned office building on their family lot before they demolished it. They said a house across the street was a high-traffic area with a frequent police presence until Daniel Cooper bought and renovated it. A WLBT news report even highlighted their progress in a recent feature. 
“If you had any evidence for the things you’re saying and accusing us, my son, of doing, then you should present it and we can move forward from that,” Roy Byram Cooper told Mississippi Today. “He’s not giving us anything to defend. He’s just making accusations because of his position.”
Gabrielle Cooper, Daniel’s sister, said Stokes is using his power as a city official to harass her brother, turning what is a family matter into a public issue. 
“The council might just ignore him,” she said. “But there are people who are listening, and it’s your responsibility to say something regardless of if you feel like he’s just talking.”

A family dispute
Stokes’ screed against Daniel Cooper also deals with the ownership status of the property where Georgetown Grub resides.
The parcel has been in the Cooper family name for decades. Daniel Cooper’s grandfather, Roy Cooper, repaired air-conditioning units and owned a two-story building that housed several family businesses – a beauty salon, an ice cream parlor and a brass exchange company. 
Daniel Cooper’s father, Roy Byram Cooper, also went into the HVAC trade and helped his father maintain the property. Now 71, Roy Byram Cooper told Mississippi Today he takes pride in working with his hands, one time writing his name into sidewalk concrete he poured outside the building. 
“The other kids, they had their own careers and other things they were doing,” Roy Byram Cooper said of his siblings. “See, Daddy and I were blue collar.”
But after Roy Cooper died in 2012, the building fell into disrepair and the ownership of the lot into limbo. He has many heirs, but a court would need to establish the shares to which they’re entitled, and that hasn’t happened yet. 
Stokes told Mississippi Today during the reporting of this story that he was working with an attorney to initiate that process, but the Coopers’ attorney beat him to it, filing a petition Thursday to open the estate.
Still, the councilman has gone around boasting that he owns the property. 
“I’ll tell you this, if Mr. Cooper owned it, I own it,” Stokes said recently, taunting a few of Cooper’s friends who were using the lot to pass out food the day before Thanksgiving. 
“Go to law school,” Stokes said when pressed for an explanation before driving away, according to a video recording.

Roy Bryam Cooper says he has never gotten along with Stokes. The councilman says the same, calling his brother-in-law a “bad apple” and alleging he’s a dope dealer, too. 
But Stokes wasn’t acting out a vendetta until after Cooper-Stokes died in 2023, the brother-in-law said.
“If he wasn’t a councilman, it wouldn’t be no problem,” Roy Bryam Cooper said. “But because of him being a councilman, he knows people downtown. So he’s tried every avenue he can to try to shut it down.”
The Coopers also suspect that Stokes, whose family owns properties throughout the area, is out for a landgrab. 
For Stokes, some bitterness comes from his claim that he took out a loan years ago to pay the unpaid taxes on the property – at the request of his wife – so the Cooper family wouldn’t lose it to a tax sale. 
But he also says he doesn’t want the property. Rather, it’s the alleged drug activity – on property bearing his wife’s family name – that makes him so intent on shutting the food truck down.
“If people in these neighborhoods know that this is drug-related and everybody in these neighborhoods know that was my wife’s father’s property, you don’t think they would associate my wife’s good name with the negative activity taking place?” Stokes told Mississippi Today.

The Cooper family hasn’t collectively decided the future of their lot, hence the temporary restaurant. Daniel Cooper said they are waiting to see how the neighborhood develops. 
But Stokes’ allegations about his nephew’s conduct extend beyond the heirs property to just about every effort Daniel Cooper said he’s made to improve the community.
Daniel Cooper and his wife began buying property in Georgetown a decade ago. He said he uses one of the homes as a makeshift office and storage for maintenance supplies to take care of his rentals. 
He said he’s tried to bring positivity in other ways, too. Cooper and his friends took a small tractor to a block of nearby Crawford Street, a mostly wooded area, to rid the street of debris and trash. Volunteers use the Cooper lot to distribute toys and back-to-school supplies for young people in the neighborhood.
Stokes has referenced each of these endeavors, alleging the address of Cooper’s home office is a drug spot, that his nephew is recruiting young people in the neighborhood to deal drugs in exchange for bicycles and that his cleanup efforts are strictly a performance.
“We got to stop them from participating in cleanups, ‘cause they trying to clean their image,” Stokes said during a Nov. 4 council meeting. “If there’s going to be cleanups, I have an ordinance to come. It must be approved by the mayor or the CAO to make sure that the wrong element is not involved.”

Marshaling city resources 
Stokes’ efforts to expose the food truck began the very day his nephew placed the trailer on the lot last year, Daniel Cooper said.
Stokes began by claiming the business, co-owned by Daniel Cooper and his father, does not have permission to be there. He alleged Roy Byram Cooper fraudulently signed city paperwork using his deceased father’s name.
In fact, the lease agreement, obtained by Mississippi Today, was signed “Roy Cooper” by Roy Byram Cooper, who shares a name with his late father. 
While Stokes has failed to make his case to the city, he has repeatedly made this forgery allegation.
“I never heard of a dead person giving permission for people to use his property,” Stokes said at an Oct. 7 council meeting. 
Stokes also insisted to Mississippi Today that the Coopers acquired the food truck used from a “dope man that’s already in jail,” but the Coopers provided a check and receipt showing they purchased the trailer new from a manufacturer in Texas.

Roy Byram Cooper said he tried to ignore his brother-in-law’s antics. Over the last year, police have visited the food truck, “in droves,” Daniel Cooper said. When it came time to renew the business license this fall, he said the city planning department’s response was sluggish.
The Coopers eventually pushed back. In August, their attorney, John Hall, sent a letter to the city attorney and planning and development department noting his clients had faced roadblocks from the city despite satisfying its permitting and licensing requirements. 
“It has come to our attention that this inference stems from the actions of a member of the Jackson City Council who is acting under the color of his authority and law in a manner that exceeds his proper jurisdiction and violates my clients’ rights to due process and equal treatment under the law,” Hall wrote. 
Hall received no response, and Stokes did not stop. 
In response to Stokes’ complaints, Teeuwissen said he paid a visit to Georgetown Grub in mid-October. On a warm Friday afternoon, he sat in his car across the street and observed two people coming and going. One bought what appeared to be a drink and another seemed to buy food. Nothing out of the ordinary. 
When he reviewed the business file, it didn’t take long for Teewuissen to realize Stokes had a familial connection to the property. But he said he found no reason for the city to reject the business renewal.
“The I’s are dotted and the T’s are crossed,” Teeuwissen told Mississippi Today.
While the city was still contemplating the renewal, an unusual series of events transpired.

The mysterious Impala
First, a man, unrelated to anyone in this saga, was driving down Martin Luther King Jr. Drive days before Thanksgiving when his car engine died. He wrote his phone number and a message saying he’d be back, and then left that piece of paper on the driver’s window after pushing the broken-down Chevy Impala into an empty lot.
The lot belonged to Stokes. The councilman then hired a wrecker to tow the car blocks away, next to the food truck.
Hours later, volunteers with a group called Organized Gentlemen arrived at the Cooper lot for a Thanksgiving food drive and encountered the Impala. 
As the group of men, local law students and a judge dished plates of turkey, mac and cheese, and green beans, Stokes appeared. The councilman summoned the police to meet him and asked an officer to run the plates to see if the car was stolen. 
The confrontation put a damper on what had been a joyous event and made the people there to receive food feel uneasy, said Perry Thomas, a member of Organized Gentlemen.
“You could see their face change,” he said.

Thomas, wearing blue food-safe gloves, approached Stokes to inquire about the gray Impala and why Stokes had called the cops, according to a video recording. The councilman sat on the hood of another broken down car, a vintage Mercedes that belonged to Cooper’s grandfather, and answered by repeating: “FBI. FBI. FBI.” 
Police found the Impala was not stolen. Stokes told Mississippi Today he had the car towed because he was attempting to do gravel work on property where the car was left as part of his effort to build a museum for his late wife. 
Cooper said he believes Stokes was attempting to harass, or worse, entrap him. 
The following Monday, when Cooper’s cook arrived to open up the truck for the day, Stokes had maneuvered his SUV to block the lot’s entrance on Ludlow Avenue. 
Cooper, exasperated, called the cops. As he began to explain the problem, the arriving officer interjected, “I already know. We’ve been dealing with this for a while,” according to a recording obtained by Mississippi Today.
The officer told Stokes he couldn’t block the property because Cooper possessed all the proper paperwork. He would know: “We’ve had several officers to come out here and they’ve did several reports,” the officer said.
“Y’all have to work this out a better way than this,” he added. “Because this is going to cause somebody to get hurt.” 
Stokes’ antics may seem petty, but Cooper said he’s afraid of what might happen if someone takes his uncle seriously. Stokes is a city councilman who appears on the news, after all. 
If an idea that Cooper’s food truck is full of drugs prevails, Cooper said it’s not hard to imagine someone trying to rob his business. The same goes for his nearby office. Or what if the man who owned the Impala had spotted it on Cooper’s lot and gotten angry?
“It has you paranoid at all times, thinking that somebody might believe this junk,” Cooper said. “I just have to hope nothing that he’s trying to conspire to do works.”

Slang in city code
The clerk of council first read aloud Stokes’ “dope dealer” ordinance during the council meeting Nov. 18. Attendees laughed, but the other council members had no comment, and the meeting proceeded to other items. 
When Stokes brought the measure to a vote Dec. 2, he explained that in addition to problems in his neighborhood, his ordinance was also a nod to a recent FBI sting involving Mississippi Delta sheriffs, as well as a federal investigation that ensnared Jackson’s former mayor, a former Jackson council member and the Hinds County district attorney. 
The Jackson case doesn’t pertain to drugs, rather a development proposal, but District Attorney Jody Owens was quoted in the 2024 indictment as saying, “We can take dope boy money… but I need to clean it and spread it.”
After Stokes’ spiel, his council colleagues raised concerns: Should city employees shun family members they suspect of selling drugs? What if someone was convicted years ago and has reformed? How would the ordinance be enforced? 
“If you believe this city is that unsafe, we need to have a task force or something in place to do something with safety and security,” Ward 2 Councilwoman Tina Clay said after introducing an amendment to replace the term “dope” with “drug,” arguing city code should not contain slang. 
Her amendment failed, but two others passed: Only drug activity within the last year would count, and the ordinance would not violate or impose on federal law. The ordinance passed with all but Clay voting yes.

Not long after, Stokes spotted Cooper and his friend, Jeremy Harris, in the hallway through the glass of the chamber doors. The men had hoped to hear what Stokes was saying about them. Stokes left the meeting and summoned a Jackson Police Department assistant chief to deal with the men.
Out in the hallway, Harris asked Stokes if it’s illegal to attend a public meeting, to which Stokes responds: “It’s against the law to be a dope boy,” according to a video recording.
“I’m not a dope boy,” Harris told him. “Just ‘cause you said don’t mean it’s true.” 
The officer asked the pair to leave City Hall, and they didn’t put up a fight, Cooper said. Stokes moseyed back to his leather seat behind the dais. 
“I left the council chambers ‘cause the dope boys had showed up,” he announced, adding that he’d given Cooper’s office address to the sheriff, FBI and U.S. Attorney’s Office.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/09115047/3X0A6630-e1765571045219.jpg,,,2025-12-12 15:57:34.779937

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — An estimated 750,000 Kansans could receive a chunk of a $700 million settlement, but they must be Android users to be eligible.
Attorneys general in all 50 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico announced this week an agreement reached in a lawsuit accusing Google of harming consumers who made purchases in the Google Play Store.
The agreement arose out of a 2023 class action antitrust lawsuit alleging Google monopolized app distribution and in-app billing services on some Android devices, according to the settlement website.
Most funds are expected to be distributed to people who made Play Store purchases between August 2016 and September 2023. Google is also expected to change its practices, the Kansas Attorney General’s Office said in a Friday news release.
“Google abused its control of the Android market, costing Kansans and harming Kansas businesses. With this settlement, we change how Google does business and give money back to Kansas citizens,” said Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach.
Notices to eligible recipients began going out Dec. 2.
Danedri Herbert, a spokeswoman for the office and state GOP chair, said the office’s best estimate was that 750,000 Kansans could be eligible for a settlement payment.
Eligible recipients will likely receive payments directly into their PayPal or Venmo accounts, and a claim form is not necessary in most cases. Payments can occur only after a judge gives the agreement final approval. A hearing is scheduled to take place April 30.
Consumers who do not want a payment and wish to bring a case of their own against Google must opt out of the settlement class online or in writing by Feb. 19. People who wish to object to the agreement must do so in writing by the same deadline.

(Photo courtesy of the Forward Party of Utah)The Forward Party of Utah’s unprecedented midterm preference poll has picked a winner to replace outgoing Sen. Dan Thatcher, of West Valley City, the state’s only third-party lawmaker, after he announced earlier this year his departure from the Republican Party. 
The party announced Friday — the same day Thatcher’s retirement from his District 11 seat became effective — that Emily Buss won the party’s preference poll. Party officials have formally submitted her name to Gov. Spencer Cox for official appointment. 
Buss, of Eagle Mountain, describes her background as “rooted in advocacy, policy, and research, with a focus on child welfare and social impact,” according to her candidate bio on the party’s website. 
Utah’s Forward Party introduces 5 candidates, lays out voting plan to replace Sen. Thatcher

“I’ve spent my life fighting for families and building programs that serve real needs in real communities,” her bio says. “Whether it’s creating resources for underserved youth, expanding access to support services, or partnering with local organizations, I know how to turn ideas into action, and action into outcomes.”
The Forward Party of Utah — a centrist party with the slogan “Not left. Not right. Forward” that coalesced when the state’s two centrist groups merged earlier this year — is an affiliate of the national Forward Party. 
To fill Thatcher’s midterm vacancy, the party held a first-of-its kind online voting system that used the approval voting method, which allows voters to vote for more than one candidate. The candidate with the highest number of total approvals is declared the winner. 
Uniquely, the Forward Party of Utah held an open election — allowing all registered voters in District 11 to vote, regardless of their party affiliation. Eligible candidates needed to pass a party background check, agree to sign a pledge supporting the Forward Party’s values, and commit to running for reelection in 2026 as a Forward Party candidate. 
Buss won the preference poll — which included online and paper voting — with 625 votes, or 47.21% approval percentage. A total of 2,308 votes were cast in the election by 1,324 voters.

Approval percentage is calculated by dividing the number of approvals a candidate received by the total number of ballots cast. It represents the percentage of voters who approved that
candidate. Because voters may approve more than one candidate, total approvals across all candidates will exceed the number of ballots cast.
Bass, in a prepared statement, expressed gratitude for voters’ support. 
“I am honored, surprised, and grateful to the voters of District 11 for placing their trust in me,” she said. “But this isn’t about me, this is about the people I represent. Together, we will work toward common sense solutions that will strengthen our communities, support our families, and bring a brighter future for District 11 and all Utahns. There is a lot to be done. Let’s get to work.”
Thatcher said representing District 11 Utahns for the past 15 years “has been my honor, and I am deeply grateful for the trust and partnership of my constituents.” He also thanked the party for “facilitating an open, transparent, and historic process with more participation than any replacement process in Utah history.”
“Seeing every registered voter in this district invited to participate gives me tremendous confidence in the future of our community and its leadership,” he said, while congratulating Buss and her constituents.
Utah Republican Party won’t challenge mid-term appointment
In October — when Thatcher first announced his planned retirement — Utah Republican Party Chair Rob Axson indicated that the GOP took issue with Thatcher’s party switching, and he did not rule out challenging the Forward Party of Utah’s first-of-its-kind replacement process.

Prepared to fight if necessary, Thatcher and Forward Party leaders said Utah law is clearly on their side. When a midterm vacancy occurs in the Legislature, the law says “the governor shall fill the vacancy until the next regular general election by immediately appointing the person whose name was submitted by the party liaison of the same political party as the prior senator.”
Reached Friday, Axson told Utah News Dispatch the GOP would not challenge Buss’s appointment, though he said in a text message “there are certainly concerns to the process and situation which created this moment.” 
“We disagree with Thatcher’s action of pulling a fast one on voters by changing his affiliation,” Axson said. “We also disagree with the process used by the Forward Utah party but respect the law allows them to be the party filling the vacancy.”
So while Buss is set to become the Utah Legislature’s only third-party candidate during the 2026 general session scheduled to begin Jan. 20, the Utah GOP will be putting forward a Republican challenger in the 2026 election, when the remainder of Thatcher’s and now Buss’ term ends. 
“The Utah Republican Party looks forward to our Republican candidates engaging with voters this next year and for the district to have a chance to have a senator who represents the principles and preferences of the district,” Axson said. 
Phil Boileau, spokesperson for the Forward Party of Utah, told Utah News Dispatch that “we look forward to the competition in 2026.”
“If the people of the district choose that they prefer a Republican candidate at that time, then they will make that selection under the democratic system that we cherish and revere,” he said. 
Utah’s only third-party legislator says he intends to resign — but there’s a catch

To Axson’s comment about “pulling a fast one,” Boileau noted that while the Republican Party uses a “closed” system to pick its nominees (with only registered Republicans able to vote in the primary and delegates picking nominees during caucus meetings), the Forward Party of Utah opened its preference poll to all District 11 registered voters.
“Considering we had a process where literally everybody in the district could cast their vote and participate … I’m not sure that you can reasonably say that we pulled the fast one on the people,” he said. “We followed the law, and we created a system that was more inclusive, including the Republicans who were more than welcome to participate in the voting for this.” 
Boileau said leaders of the Forward Party of Utah were “thrilled” with how the election went, with more than 1,300 voters participating, which he said far exceeds the number of caucus delegates that likely would have participated in a typical party midterm replacement, which he estimated would have been up to 150 delegates.
He said he hopes the party’s preference poll can set an example for future elections, both in and outside of Utah. 
“As a new and upstart party, we took a big swing by doing this, but we followed state statute and protocol to the letter, so we fully expect not only that the state will accommodate the decision that we made,” he said. “We hope that people all around the country will look at this as an opportunity to maybe revise their midterm replacement processes as well.”

North Carolina legislators ready to close the book on 2025 and begin the holidays received a sobering reminder of how much work awaits when they return in the new year.
Billy Lassiter, deputy secretary with the Division of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, told members of the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on Justice and Public Safety on Thursday that North Carolina has seen an increase of over 14% in juvenile delinquency complaints between 2022 and 2024.
That represents more than 40,000 complaints against 14,189 juveniles this past year.

Simple assault is the number one complaint brought against juveniles, often occurring in a school setting. But Lassiter said what’s new is the rise in vehicle break-ins and motor vehicle thefts.
“It’s not that they’re breaking into one car – they’re breaking into multiple cars at one time,” Lassiter told lawmakers. “And what is the number one thing that they’re trying to steal from your car? Firearms.”
Lassiter, who has worked in juvenile justice for 27 years, said gun owners are making it far too easy for juveniles to get their hands on a weapon.
“60% of those cars were not even locked. So, when we say breaking and entering, there wasn’t much breaking going on,” Lassiter shared. “Most of those guns were not secured in the vehicle. They were sitting right there on the front seat of the car for those young people to get access to.”
There were nearly 11,000 guns stolen from North Carolina citizens in 2024.
Juveniles are also more likely to be armed while committing a crime than in the past. Four years ago, just 4% of the juvenile crimes in North Carolina involved a firearm. Last year, it was almost 15%.

Lassiter said lawmakers could help by providing recurring funding for the NC S.A.F.E. campaign, which provides gun locks and messaging to remind firearm owners how to safely store their firearms in their house. Of all the school shootings across the country, 80% of the guns came from the child’s own home.
Lassiter said the department also needs more staff for the state’s juvenile detention centers.
A change in the law in 2020 requires that any child under the age of 18 facing adult charges be housed in a juvenile detention facility until they’ve been convicted of those adult charges.
With the slow-moving justice system, many of those young people are staying in juvenile detention centers now for almost 200 days.
“It’s not just that we’re getting more young people, it’s that those young people that we’re getting are staying much longer in the facilities. And that’s driving the population to go higher and higher,” Lassiter explained.
The North Carolina Sentencing and Policy Advisory Commission is expected to release data Friday projecting the state won’t have enough beds at its youth development centers to serve the young people who need to be housed.
In 2023, the General Assembly granted Lassiter’s department approval to build another 48-bed facility. But because no  state budget passed this year, no funding is available to continue that project.

“We desperately need those beds so that we can get kids off the floor in these facilities,” he stressed.
“You contract with local jails, right?” asked Rep. Carson Smith (R-Pender) hoping to ease the housing shortage.
Lassiter explained that under federal law, juveniles must have sight and sound separation from adult inmates to protect them  from physical or sexual abuse, and few local jails are set up to meet that requirement.
In addition to a place to sleep, Lassiter told the oversight committee that many of North Carolina’s juveniles need wraparound services.
Thirty-eight percent of the juveniles who were involved in the system last year had a mental health diagnosis. And 50% of them had five or more mental health challenges.
“Last year, 36% of our kids that came into the system had parents that said they were unwilling or incapable of taking care of their own kids,” Lassiter said.
Juvenile Crime Prevention Councils (JCPCs) in each county work to develop strategies on delinquency prevention that involve the full family, not just the child. Programs like conflict resolution, counseling, family therapy and community service can help change the trajectory of a troubled youth’s life, Lassiter said..
“How do those recidivism rates compare with adult recidivism rates?” Sen. Norm Sanderson (R-Pamlico) asked.
“Overall, the juvenile justice recidivism rate is about 15% lower than the adult recidivism rate,” said Lassiter. “In general, we get better results.”
But these programs have not had an increase in their daily rate since 2020, he added. Without additional funding in the near future, service providers will be forced to reduce their services.
Lassiter said for every dollar invested in a community-based program, research has shown the state gets $70 in return.
“That’s what we’re doing by investing in these community-based programs – we’re investing in our young people so they don’t break into your house or my car next week,” he said. “We need the programming in these local communities.”

(KOSU File Photo)The executive director of Oklahoma City’s chapter of Black Lives Matter has been accused of embezzling more than $3 million meant to cover bail for Oklahomans detained in one of the country’s deadliest jails.
Prosecutors say BLM OKC executive director Tashella Sheri Amore Dickerson, 52, deposited at least $3.15 million in returned bail checks into her personal accounts.
Black Lives Matter had raised the funds to post pretrial bail for people arrested during racial justice protests in Oklahoma City after the 2020 murder of George Floyd. The indictment said much of the money was properly used at that time.
However, when a person’s case was adjudicated, and money was returned to BLM, instead of creating a revolving fund for people who couldn’t pay bail in the future, the U.S. Department of Justice alleges Dickerson deposited it into her personal accounts and into those of a company she controlled.

The jail in Oklahoma County, where the chapter is based, has long been cited for chronic understaffing, repeated health inspection failuresand a high number of deaths, including suicides.
“The Oklahoma County jail is known as a place that is totally inhumane,” Dickerson told The Oklahoman in 2020.
“The community has really stepped up and said, ‘We got you.’ Being able to support one another is epic,” she said to the newspaper.
The indictment said that support was not used to secure people’s release from jail, as donors intended. Instead, the money was used to pay for recreational travel to the Caribbean, a personal vehicle, six real estate purchases and tens of thousands of dollars in retail spending.
In a live video posted on her Facebook page Thursday afternoon, Dickerson reassured friends and family that she’s doing OK.
“This is not a formal comment,” she said. “I’m not giving a comment. All I am saying is that I’m letting my family and my friends and everyone that has been pouring into me know that I’m alright.”
“A lot of times when people come at you with these types of things … it’s evidence that you are doing the work,” she continued. “And so that is what I’m standing on.”
BLM OKC was not a registered 501(c)(3) organization under the Internal Revenue Code, which meant it could not accept donations from individuals or via grants, the indictment said. An Arizona-based nonprofit, Alliance for Global Justice, collected donations on its behalf.
In grant reports to the Alliance for Global Justice, Dickerson is accused of providing false information and failing to report her actions properly.
She faces 20 counts of wire fraud and five counts of money laundering, which, if convicted, could lead to decades in prison.
The Associated Press reported in October that the Department of Justice is investigating leaders in the BLM movement for defrauding the tens of millions of dollars it garnered during protests in 2020. A spokesperson for the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation did not comment on the allegations against Dickerson, but said the movement uses a decentralized leadership model.
“The Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation operates independently from local chapters, and the local chapters operate independently of the Foundation,” the spokesperson said. “The Foundation remains committed to transparency and integrity, and disrupting what philanthropy looks like in service of Black people.”

Patrick Morrisey said Thursday.
Melody Wolfe, mother of U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, said her son was smiling, moving more of the right side of his body and sitting in a chair for hours, the governor conveyed during a news conference. Wolfe has also been communicating, though not verbally, Morrisey said. 
“Melanie and Jason are deeply appreciative for the hospital staff and for all the prayers that have come throughout West Virginia and across the country,” the governor said. 
Wolfe, 24, of Martinsburg, West Virginia, and U.S. Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, 20, of Webster Springs, were ambushed Nov. 26 while on duty blocks from the White House while hundreds of Guard members were in D.C. for President Donald Trump’s “Operation D.C. Safe and Beautiful.”
Beckstrom died of her wounds on Thanksgiving. She was laid to rest in a ceremony at the West Virginia National Cemetery in Grafton earlier this week. Wolfe remains in the hospital with severe wounds. 
Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old Afghan national, was charged with one count of murder after the attack on the Guard members, as well as two counts of assault with the intent to kill, and a count of possession of a firearm during a crime of violence. Lakanwal pleaded not guilty.
A West Virginia veteran has called for Beckstrom and Wolfe to receive the Purple Heart award.
In a video the National Guard posted to social media on Sunday, Melody Wolfe said her son had been active and alert. 
“He’s coming along well, surpassing expectations,” she said in the video. “All the prayers that you’ve given, they’re working and we’re seeing that miracle happen in that hospital bed right now.” 
Morrisey said Thursday that Wolfe’s parents’ one request has been for prayers for their son. The governor cautioned that while Wolfe’s parents are optimistic, Wolfe has an “intense rehabilitation” period ahead of him. 
“[Prayers are] working, and I think mom and dad are grateful for the support so many West Virginians have shown during this difficult time,” Morrisey said.

Rhode Island’s bidding process drew no applicants before Monday, when the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) suddenly withdrew its controversial plan to overhaul its Continuum of Care program, worth nearly $4 billion in grants.
R.I. judge calls HUD move to rescind funding notice right before court hearing ‘intentional chaos’

That’s because HUD never began accepting applications to its online portal e-snaps, leaving Rhode Island’s network of care providers with no blueprint on how to comply with the federal government’s changes.
“It was really crazy,” Michelle Wilcox, CEO and president of Crossroads Rhode Island, a lead plaintiff in one of the lawsuits against the administration, said in an interview. “People were obsessively checking the e-snaps site to see if it had opened — and it had not.”
HUD’s federal funding rules are typically made in the late summer, with ample runway given for local providers to shape their grant proposals that Rhode Island’s Continuum of Care formally submits to the federal government. 
The Trump administration instead issued a funding notice for the federal fiscal year 2025 grants on Nov. 13, the day the federal government reopened from the longest shutdown in U.S. History. 
Federal housing officials had planned to divert 60% of the funding historically dedicated to “Housing First” programs like permanent supportive units, which provide long-term housing with no preconditions, toward temporary transitional housing.
Grant rules also would have eliminated funding for diversity and inclusion efforts, support of transgender clients and use of “harm reduction” strategies that seek to reduce overdose deaths by helping people in active addiction use drugs more safely.
Critics warned the Trump administration’s changes would jeopardize the housing of more than 170,000 people across the nation, including over 1,000 in Rhode Island. 
“This complete 180 from HUD of deviating from Housing First would have forced all of us to completely upend our business model of how we deliver supportive housing to the populations that we serve,” said Lisa Guillette, executive director of Foster Forward, the East Providence social services agency that assists young people as they age out of foster care.
Foster Forward was awarded $520,000 in Continuum of Care grants during the most recent federal fiscal year, funds Guillette stated went mostly toward rental assistance for youth as part of its rapid rehousing program. 
HUD’s notice had set an application deadline of Jan. 14, 2026.
That tight timeframe led Rhode Island’s Continuum of Care to issue a request for proposals on Nov. 21 from providers who work with unhoused populations, with the local deadline of 3 p.m. Friday, Dec. 12 in order to review grant applications before final submission.
“The turnaround on this was going to be really untenable,” Guillette said.
How long it will take the federal agency to reissue a new grant funding notice, along with what conditions it will include, is unknown. A HUD spokesperson did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
A statement on the department’s Continuum of Care Program website only notes that a new grant application announcement would go out “well in advance of the deadline for obligation of available Fiscal Year 2025 funds.”
In an 85-page lawsuit against HUD, nonprofits led by the National Alliance to End Homelessness and the National Low Income Housing Coalition state that programs across the country have grants expiring as soon as January.
For Guillette, among her first programs up for renewal will be in the spring. Wilcox said Crossroads, the largest homeless service provider in the state, doesn’t see its first permanent supportive housing grant program expire until late into the next year.
But the lack of a timeline from HUD still makes it difficult for Rhode Island’s homeless care providers to properly forecast their future budgets and pay lease renewals for existing permanent supportive housing units.
“We need to know what the funding is for next year,” said Wilcox, whose organization received $2.1 million in grants for federal fiscal year 2024. “These aren’t programs that we can just flip a switch and turn them on and off — a lot of the dollars go into leasing and rents.”

The case was first dismissed in 2023 by the Menominee County Circuit Court. The Court of Appeals heard the case in October, after which they denied the writ of habeas corpus on the grounds that chimpanzees are not “persons” under the law.
In their decision, the appellate court wrote that “only our Supreme Court may revise that common law principle,” referencing the argument from Nonhuman Rights Project lawyers that common law, as opposed to a specific statute referencing a person, should apply in this case. The judges then noted that “plaintiff’s argument for doing so is in any event substantively unpersuasive.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX

(Kevin Mohatt for Colorado Newsline)The U.S. Department of Justice sued Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold on Thursday over her refusal to hand over unredacted voter registration information.
The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court of Colorado, demands that Griswold, a Democrat, provide the federal government a copy of its statewide voter registration list that includes people’s full names, dates of birth, address and either their driver’s license numbers, last four digits of their Social Security numbers or their unique identifiers provided under the Help America Vote Act.
“This proceeding arises from the Attorney General’s investigation into Colorado compliance with federal election law, particularly the (National Voting Rights Act) and HAVA,” the lawsuit says.
The U.S. attorney general is Pam Bondi.

The DOJ has now sued 18 states over the issue, including four on Thursday. Fifteen of those states voted for Kamala Harris, a Democrat, in the 2024 presidential election. The department has requested voter registration information from at least 40 states.
The DOJ first asked Colorado for voter registration records on May 12. In November, after federal officials acknowledged that the DOJ shared voter information with the Department of Homeland Security to search it for noncitizens as a way to “scrub aliens from voter rolls,” Griswold joined a group of other secretaries of state to ask Bondi and the department if it misled them about how voter information would be used.
On Dec. 1, officials once again asked the state for the records via email and proposed a memorandum of understanding that the DOJ believed “cures all potential concerns a state might rightfully raise regarding its citizens’ private data and identifying information,” according to an email cited in the lawsuit. Griswold responded that she would not send the voter files.
“We will not hand over Coloradans’ sensitive voting information to Donald Trump,” Griswold said in a statement. “He does not have a legal right to the information. I will continue to protect our elections and democracy, and look forward to winning this case.”
Besides asserting that the administration is not legally entitled to the information it seeks, Griswold and other election officials have expressed concern about the security of sensitive voter data if they release it to federal agencies, and they have questioned the administration’s motives.
“Is the administration collecting in an unprecedented way mass voter data and dumping it into an untested, unverified federal system to spread voter disinformation — disinformation to undermine our elections?” Griswold said last month.
Griswold has already given publicly available Colorado voter information to the DOJ.
The lawsuit requests the voter information within five days of a court order. It claims the DOJ has broad power to request the information through the Civil Rights Act from 1960.

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)More special elections are being set in Virginia’s legislature as a growing number of Democratic lawmakers depart the House of Delegates to join the incoming administration of Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger or pursue higher office.
On Friday, House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, scheduled special elections for Jan. 13 in House Districts 11 and 23, following the resignations of two veteran Democratic delegates tapped for Spanberger’s cabinet.
In House District 11, Del. David Bulova, D-Fairfax, stepped down after being named Virginia’s next secretary of natural and historic resources. Bulova, first elected to the House in 2006, built a reputation as a consensus-builder on environmental issues, working across party lines on legislation related to land conservation, clean energy and water quality.
House District 23 was vacated by Del. Candi Mundon King, D-Prince William, who resigned after Spanberger selected her to serve as secretary of the commonwealth. Mundon King, first elected in 2021, has focused much of her legislative work on voting access, maternal health and consumer protection.
The two Jan. 13 contests add to a growing list of special elections triggered by Democratic turnover in the House ahead of the 2026 session. 
Earlier this week, Del. Mike Jones, D-Richmond, resigned his seat in House District 77 after winning the Democratic nomination to succeed Lt. Gov.-elect Ghazala Hashmi in Senate District 15. A special election to fill Jones’ House seat has already been scheduled for Jan. 6.
So far, only Democrats have announced bids in the three Democratic-leaning districts.
In House District 11, Bulova’s wife, Gretchen Bulova, is the only candidate who has publicly announced a campaign, according to the Virginia Public Access Project. However, Susan Weltz, chair of the district’s Democratic Committee, said the party will hold a firehouse primary Tuesday, Dec. 16, to select its nominee.
“We look forward to an informative campaign that will give voters in the district a chance to vote for whom they wish to see representing them in the General Assembly, and then we must all unite in support of the eventual Democratic nominee, whoever it may be,” Weltz said in a statement.
In House District 23, Margaret Franklin has announced her candidacy for the Democratic nomination. No Republican candidates have declared in the district.
House District 77 is already drawing a crowded Democratic field. Three candidates are competing in a firehouse primary scheduled for Sunday: former Richmond Ccity Ccouncil member Michelle Mosby, Greg Powers, and attorney Charles Schmidt.
The series of special elections underscores the ripple effects of Spanberger’s transition into office, as well as the political maneuvering underway ahead of the 2026 legislative session, which is set to start Jan. 14. 
While Democrats hold a comfortable 63-37 majority in the House of Delegates, the outcome of the special elections will determine whether their significant advantage remains intact as lawmakers return to Richmond.

Contango Ore, the mining company developing the prospect, announced a merger this week with a Canadian firm. (Max Graham/Northern Journal)A Fairbanks-based company with several Alaska mining projects, including two near Anchorage, could nearly double in size in a proposed merger with a Canadian firm.
The deal, announced this week, would combine Contango Ore with Vancouver-based Dolly Varden Silver Corp. It’s the latest in a recent flurry of deals in the global mining industry, including in Alaska.
Contango is involved in multiple high-profile projects in Alaska, including the already operating Manh Choh mine in the Interior. It’s also doing substantial exploratory work at two other prospects — one in Hatcher Pass, above the Mat-Su, and another on Indigenous-owned land surrounded by a national park southwest of Anchorage that’s drawn sharp opposition.
The merged company would be called Contango Silver & Gold and would control both companies’ assets.
Contango and Dolly Varden are touting the deal as a step toward becoming a bigger, multibillion-dollar business. Once combined, their executives said, they’d have deeper pockets — though the new company would still be geared mainly toward exploration and would need several years to build producing mines.
“We had a good five-year plan, and now we’ve got a good 20-year business,” Rick Van Nieuwenhuyse, Contango Ore’s chief executive, said on a call with investors after the announcement.
There are no expected changes to Contango’s plans for its Alaska projects, and the company would remain based in Fairbanks, Van Nieuwenhuyse said later in a phone interview. A longtime player in the state’s mining industry, Van Nieuwenhuyse would become chief executive of the merged company.
Contango is perhaps best known for its unconventional development model, which involves shipping minimally processed ore to other mines rather than building its own storage areas for potentially toxic tailings.
It’s also known for helping launch Manh Choh, near the town of Tok. The company owns a 30% stake in that mine, which trucks ore some 250 miles on state highways to a processing plant at another Interior mine, Fort Knox. The state of Alaska, through the Permanent Fund, invested $10 million in Contango in 2021.
Beyond Manh Choh, the company is pushing the Johnson Tract project, a gold, zinc, copper, lead and silver deposit beneath an Indigenous-owned inholding in Lake Clark National Park — on the remote west side of Cook Inlet.
That project has fueled concerns from commercial fishermen, environmental groups and tribal governments over potential environmental impacts and the project’s proximity to the national park and prime wildlife habitat, including for endangered beluga whales in an area called Tuxedni Bay.
Its other significant prospect is named Lucky Shot. At that project, in the scenic Hatcher Pass area north of Anchorage, Contango is trying to revamp a historic underground gold mine.
Dolly Varden’s focus, meanwhile, has been a large exploratory silver mine in British Columbia, called Kitsault Valley, near the border with Southeast Alaska.
Though Dolly Varden doesn’t currently operate in Alaska, one of its top shareholders is Hecla Mining Co., which runs the huge Greens Creek silver mine in the Juneau area. (Hecla owns some 13% of Dolly Varden, according to financial disclosures.)
Industry observers say deals like this one are common among small mining firms, known as juniors. What they portend for a company’s prospects, however, can be challenging for outsiders to parse.
“It‘s part of the mysterious, impenetrable workings of the churnings of junior mining companies,” Bob Loeffler, an industry consultant and research professor of public policy at the University of Alaska Anchorage’s Institute of Social and Economic Research, said in an email.
The deal comes just a few weeks after a different Vancouver-based company announced the sale of a contentious copper and zinc project in Southeast Alaska. It also comes a few months after the multinational company that operates Northwest Alaska’s massive Red Dog mine, Teck Resources, agreed to merge with another global mining firm, Anglo American.
In the call with investors, Van Nieuwenhuyse and Dolly Varden’s chief executive, Shawn Khunkhun, said they would continue to advance both the Johnson Tract and Lucky Shot prospects.
Johnson Tract opponents say they’ll continue to fight the project. The proposed merger indicates Contango is focused on “vanity metals” like gold and silver, rather than “critical minerals,” Cooper Freeman, Alaska director at the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement.
Gold and silver “do nothing for humanity but plunder spectacular places like Lake Clark National Park and Tuxedni Bay for corporate profit,” he added.
The merger is not expected to be finalized until February or March, Contango said in a press release.

(Photo by Eli Voorhies for Washington State Standard)As rivers began to recede, the federal government on Friday approved Washington’s request for aid to respond to ongoing record flooding.
Gov. Bob Ferguson said he received a call from U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to let him know that President Donald Trump had signed Ferguson’s request for an emergency declaration. This will allow the state to seek federal funds in response to the flooding.
“I expressed my thanks to Secretary Noem on behalf of the people of the State of Washington during this extremely challenging time,” Ferguson said in a statement.
Around midnight, the Skagit River crested at a record 37.7 feet near Mount Vernon, surpassing the mark set in 1990. The flooding didn’t quite hit the peaks in the city that some officials were warning of, and that could have toppled the city’s floodwall. 
After thousands of Skagit County residents were directed to evacuate their homes Wednesday and Thursday, authorities early Friday morning told thousands more in Burlington to leave immediately due to a flooding slough. 
Members of Washington’s National Guard were going door to door to let residents know they should evacuate from the city, though some were allowed to return hours later. Officials lifted evacuation orders in some other areas, as well, including Orting in Pierce County, which sits between the Carbon and Puyallup rivers.
The National Guard was also helping in swift water rescues in Burlington. In all, more than 300 members of the National Guard were assisting in Skagit County. California Gov. Gavin Newsom deployed search and rescue teams to Washington to help. 
The Snohomish River has also set a new flooding record. Both the Skagit and Snohomish were forecast to remain in the major flooding stage into Saturday. Rivers as far east as the Yakima in Benton County were flooding at least moderately.
People congregate at a flood wall in Mount Vernon on Dec. 11, 2025, with some climbing up to get a view of the surging Skagit River, despite posted warnings. Police routinely came by to kick people off and one officer commented that all it takes is one slip for things to go wrong. (Photo by Eli Voorhies for Washington State Standard)
Some major highways remain closed, including a long stretch of U.S. 2 between Skykomish and Leavenworth. 
There were concerns that Washington may have trouble accessing federal assistance to respond to the flooding, given Trump’s posture on disaster aid. The Republican president has appeared to favor GOP-led states for this help. 
This year, he denied Washington’s request for federal aid in the aftermath of the devastating bomb cyclone windstorm that hit the state late last year.
On Wednesday, Ferguson, a Democrat, asked for a statewide emergency declaration from the feds. 
This emergency declaration covers Benton, Chelan, Clallam, Grays Harbor, Jefferson, King, Kittitas, Lewis, Mason, Pierce, Skagit, Snohomish, Thurston, Wahkiakum, Whatcom and Yakima counties, along with tribal nations in those areas.

“Thank you for the fast emergency declaration,” Washington Sen. Maria Cantwell, a Democrat, said on social media. “Thank you for helping respond to our infrastructure needs. Thank you for supporting our first responders. Thank you!”
Ferguson is planning to host a press conference at a levee in Tukwila on Friday afternoon. He’s set to be joined by new King County Executive Girmay Zahilay, state Adjutant General Gent Welsh and Robert Ezelle, director of the Military Department’s Emergency Management Division.

California’s unemployment department bought more cellphones than it needed for remote work during the COVID pandemic and kept paying for thousands of unused lines.


California’s unemployment agency kept paying cellphone bills for four and a half years without checking whether its workers were actually using the devices.
That’s how it racked up $4.6 million in fees for mobile devices its workers were not using, according to a new state audit detailing wasteful spending at several government agencies. 
The Employment Development Department’s excessive cellphone bills date to the COVID-19 pandemic, when it shifted call center employees to remote work and faced pressure to release benefits to millions of suddenly unemployed Californians.
It acquired 7,224 cellphones and wireless hotspots by December 2020. State auditors analyzed 54 months of invoices since then and found half the devices were unused for at least two years, 25% were unused for three years and 99 of them were never used at all. 
The investigation, which auditors opened after receiving a tip, identified 6,285 devices that were unused for at least four consecutive months, and said the department spent $4.6 million on monthly service fees for them.
From the beginning, the department had about 2,000 more cellphones than call center employees, according to the audit. The gap widened over time after the pandemic ended and the department’s staffing returned to its normal headcount.
As of April, the audit said the department had 1,787 unemployment call center employees, but was paying monthly service fees for 5,097 mobile devices. 
“Although obtaining the mobile devices during COVID-19 may have been a good idea to serve the public, continuing to pay the monthly service fees for so many unused devices, especially post-COVID-19, was wasteful,” the audit said. 
Department officials told auditors they were unaware of the spending, but auditors pointed to regular invoices from Verizon that showed which phones were not being used. 
“We would have expected EDD management to have reconsidered the need to pay the monthly service fees for so many devices that had no voice, message, or data usage,” the audit said.

The unemployment department began acting on the auditors’ findings in April, when it canceled service plans for 2,825 devices. It has since implemented a policy to terminate service plans for devices that go unused for 90 days. 
The California state auditor highlighted the mobile devices in its regular report on “improper activities by state agencies and employees.” The audit also showed that the California Air Resources Board overpaid an employee who was on extended leave as he prepared to retire by $171,000.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/011022-EDD-Sacramento-MG-CM-03.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-12 14:57:36.270893

SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
According to the December edition of the Fiscal Year 2026 General Fund Budget Monitor report released Thursday by the nonpartisan Idaho Legislative Services Office, Idaho’s state budget is projected to end the current fiscal year 2026 on June 30 with a deficit of $40.3 million. That number includes the 3% budget holdbacks that Gov. Brad Little ordered in August, as well as the latest revenue collections that the state took in in November.
The projected budget deficit has shrunk from an estimated $58.3 million last month to $40.3 million this month, according to the Legislative Services Office. 
Idaho budget writers prepare to enter new era of trimming state budgets

The projected budget deficit is important because the Idaho Constitution prohibits the state from running a budget deficit and requires the state to pass a balanced budget. 
Idaho state legislators and officials in the governor’s office have vowed that they will intervene during the 2026 legislative session that starts Jan. 12 to prevent the state from running a budget deficit. Although their tactics have not been made public, the most likely tools they will use to balance the budget appear to include enacting additional new budget cuts and/or dipping into more than $1 billion in state rainy day reserve accounts.
It is important to note that the projected budget deficit is not a hiccup limited to the current year. State budget officials have projected a much larger budget deficit of $555.2 million for next year’s budget, fiscal year 2027. The state’s top budget official, Idaho Division of Financial Management Administrator Lori Wolff told the Idaho Capital Sun the state may need to come up with an additional $600 million to $1 billion for the 2027 budget if the state wants to conform with federal tax changes championed by President Donald Trump and also leave an ending cash balance to serve as a budget cushion to guard against additional budget uncertainty. 
 Idaho officials sounding alarms over budget shortfalls

During a closely watched state tax conference in Boise last week, Republican Lt. Gov. Scott Bedke sounded an alarm about the state budget situation, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported.
Idaho Lt. Gov. Scott Bedke is sworn in on the steps of the State Capitol building on Jan. 6, 2023. (Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)
“For the first time in Idaho’s history, (in) last year’s budgeting session, we acted more like Washington, D.C., than we did Idaho,” Bedke said earlier this month. “… We created a list of things that we wanted to accomplish and passed that list of things before we set the revenue number, and then we backed into the list with the revenue number, and adjusted the revenue number to pay for that list of things.” 
The projected state budget shortfall is occurring after years of tax cuts approved by the Idaho Legislature. A recent report from the Boise-based nonprofit Idaho Center for Fiscal Policy says the state reduced revenue by a cumulative total of $4 billion over the past five years to pay for income tax cuts. The Idaho Center For Fiscal Policy said those income tax cuts benefitted businesses and the wealthiest Idahoans earning more than $738,300 per year much more than average Idaho working families and families with low incomes. 
House Minority Leader Ilana Rubel, D-Boise, said the budget shortfall was entirely created by the Idaho Legislature. In an interview Friday morning, Rubel called for repealing the most recent income tax cut and a new education tax credit that the Idaho Legislature created in 2025 to pay families for education expenses that include tuition at private, religious schools.
“If we came in and reversed some of that and restored revenue, honestly most people wouldn’t even notice,” Rubel said, adding that the income tax cuts and the education tax credit primarily benefit wealthy families. “We have a revenue problem; we don’t have a spending problem. But unfortunately what I think the Legislature is going to do is move in the other direction and exacerbate all of this with even more tax cuts.”

Rubel said she is afraid the Idaho Legislature will enact deep new budget cuts to avoid a budget shortfall, which she fears will have significant negative consequences. She pointed out Idaho sheriffs are already issuing public warnings that mental health cuts will pose significant public safety concerns. 
“The repercussions of the cuts will be felt far beyond the vulnerable communities who took the hit on the front end,” Rubel said. “It’s going to hit regular people. It’s going to hit them a lot harder in the very near future, and they are going to want answers.” 
Rubel also said some legislators are not being forthcoming about how serious the budget situation is and the root causes that created it.
“Unfortunately what we are seeing is just a lot of gas-lighting,” Rubel said. “The people driving us into the ditch are still holding the keys to the car, and they’re telling people what a beautiful ditch it is. It appears they don’t have the appetite to admit they maybe made a mistake and we need to take a different direction.”
 Idaho’s decision on ‘Big Beautiful Bill’ tax cuts will have a big impact on the budget and 2026 legislative session

Idaho’s projected state budget deficit does not include the cost of conforming to the tax changes in the federal One Big Beautiful Bill Act that Trump signed into law on July 4. 
The Idaho Legislature will get to decide whether and how to conform with those tax changes during the upcoming 2026 legislative session. If the Republican-controlled Idaho Legislature follows Trump’s lead and conforms with the tax changes, it could reduce state revenue by an additional $284 million in 2026, according to estimates from the Tax Foundation. 
Some of Trump’s individual tax changes include no tax on workers’ tips, no tax on workers’ overtime pay, no tax on borrowers’ car loan interest and a temporary expanded deduction for senior citizens. 
If the Idaho Legislature chooses to conform with the tax changes, that would reduce state revenue available for the state budget. If the Idaho Legislature does not conform with the tax changes, the state would deviate from Trump and the federal government and collect state taxes in those areas. 
Rubel told the Sun on Friday that after meeting with Republican leaders she believes the Idaho Legislature will conform with Trump’s tax changes from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.
Last month, state Rep. Wendy Horman, R-Idaho Falls, told the Sun that it may not make financial sense for Idaho to comply with all of the business tax cuts in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that Trump signed.

“This year conformity could have a very high price tag,” Horman told the Sun on Nov. 25.
“Normally we just conform with the federal policies. This year will be different because of the Big Beautiful Bill — there is no tax on tips, there is no tax on overtime, but there are also substantial tax cuts for business. In my opinion, it makes no sense to set a revenue number (for the budget) until we know what the conformity policy is going to look like. As you know, JFAC does not set revenue policy – the tax committees set the policies that will determine the amount of eligible revenue to appropriate. So this is a unique year in that conformity could have a price tag in the hundreds of millions of dollars, and there will be important policy decisions that need to be made outside of JFAC before we will really know how much revenue will be on the table for appropriation.”
Efforts to reach Horman on Friday morning were not immediately successful. But Horman has consistently downplayed the state’s projected budget deficit as merely an estimate on a piece of paper and a guess. 
Horman has also vowed to prevent the state from running a deficit.
“We will set a balanced budget,” Horman told the Sun on Nov. 13.  “The constitution requires it. I am personally committed to it. And I anticipate we will leave as large of a cash balance as we can to carry over into next year to guard against unforeseen circumstances.”
Horman is co-chair of the Idaho Legislature’s Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee – or JFAC, for short – which sets every budget for every state agency and department every year. 
Idaho is not alone in facing a state revenue and budget shortfalls. The Colorado Legislature called a special session in August to address a nearly $800 million hole in the state budget, Colorado Newsline reported. Additionally, the states of Arizona, New Mexico and Maryland are projecting tax changes from Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act will reduce state revenues in their states, according to a report from Pew Charitable Trusts.

A federal judge halted a large logging project near Yellowstone National Park because he said the United States Forest Service submitted plans that made it impossible to judge how it would affect critical grizzly bear habitat.
The 16,500-acre project located in the Custer Gallatin National Forest would have allowed the U.S. Forest Service to select timber and build roads for logging, but without offering specifics, only pledging that its plans would consider the total distance of the roads and not exceed certain parameters in acreage size, designed to protect critical bear habitat.
However, Judge Donald W. Molloy said that the plans amounted to giving the Forest Service permission and trusting that it would be compliant later. He also said in a 46-page ruling released Thursday that the plans also made it difficult to judge how the logging project would impact grizzly habitat, and that U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said a female grizzly’s minimum range was 10 acres, while not basing that decision on any cited science.
Meanwhile the groups that challenged the logging project, the Center for Biological Diversity, the Alliance for the Wild Rockies, Wild Earth Guardians and the Western Environmental Law Center, pointed to other research that indicated as many as 2,500 acres were needed.
Molloy also vacated the Forest Service’s project because it failed to comply with several different portions of federal law, including the National Forest Management Act.
“(The groups) argue that this approach conflates a promise of future statutory compliance with actual compliance. (They) insist that it is impossible to assess the true environmental impacts of the project under the National Environmental Policy Act, or determine whether it meets statutory or forest plan protections for grizzly bears and lynx under the Endangered Species Act and the NFMA,” Molloy said.
The judge agreed the Forest Service failed to properly consider the impacts of the logging project on the grizzly bears. While the Forest Service, in its plans, said that it would be approving 56.8 miles of temporary roads associated with the project, it said those would be determined during the project, based on other conditions.
However, the groups had argued one of the biggest factors in grizzly bear habitats is their proximity to roads. Grizzly bears, according to the scientific testimony presented in the case, tend to avoid and settle in habitats far away from roads, and that humans are the largest threat to grizzly bear survival.
In the lawsuit, the groups argued it wasn’t just the total number or length of the roads that mattered, but also the placement. Because the Forest Service plans gave no specifics on the location of the roads, Molloy said it was impossible to judge the impacts on the bears.
“Essentially while the Forest Service’s math check out, it is unclear how the Forest Service can calculate the amount of secure habitat that will be lost without first determining where the temporary roads will be routed,” Molloy said in his ruling.
Furthermore, the judge agreed that approving the project would have meant the true extent of the project could not be calculated until after the project, leaving the groups with few legal remedies.
“Here, however in the context of grizzly bear secure habitation, the lack of specific road mapping prevents such informed decision making,” Molloy said. “The Forest Service avowing that future activities will comply with NFMA falls far short of showing that those actives do so.”
The court also said the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service relied on using a grizzly 10-acre patch size for habitat was consistent, but officials provided no science or basis for that size, while the groups cited other scientific research that calls for much more, and highlights the importance of that land in relation to roads for motorized vehicles.
“The U.S. Forest Service identify no specific explanation of why 10 acres, as opposed to 1 acre, 5 acres or 50 acres is an appropriate metric,” Molloy said.
The conservation groups cheered the ruling.
“This ruling makes it clear that agencies can’t just rubber-stamp massive logging projects and promise to sort out the details later,” said Kristine Akland, Northern Rockies director and senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. “The court saw right through the Forest Service’s vague plans and determined that moving targets aren’t good enough, especially when threatened animals and treasured public lands are at stake.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Yellowstone-National-Park-Grizzly-bears-1024x621.jpg,,,2025-12-12 14:57:36.270893

Tennessee state leaders announced on Friday morning that the state will partner with Turning Point USA, a conservative nonprofit founded by the late Charlie Kirk.
They announced at an event at the Tennessee State Capitol that there would be Club America chapters, student-led organizations affiliated with Turning Point USA, at every high school in the state of Tennessee.
U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., who is running for Tennessee governor, and Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson, R-Franklin, spoke at the event announcing the partnership. There was no media invited to the event but a 30-minute video was posted on Rumble, social media platform that’s particularly popular with right-wing creators.
Gov. Bill Lee appeared in a video that was played at the event.
“I am encouraged to see significant interest from Tennessee students in starting Club America chapters, an effort that will give students an opportunity to respectfully engage in the issues that shape our country,” Lee said.
Lee and Johnson did not discuss the terms of the partnership or where the money to fund it would come from or how much it might cost.
“I’m proud to be here on behalf of Gov. Lee to make this very, very special announcement,” Johnson said at the event. “Today, we are announcing that the state of Tennessee is forming a partnership with Turning Point USA, with a shared goal of establishing Turning Point chapters at every high school, every college, every university campus in our great state, in honor of Charlie Kirk.”
Riley Gaines, a former college swimmer and opponent of transgender athletes in women’s sports, first talked about the partnership between the state and the conservative nonprofit in November at an event at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, as reported by the Chattanooga Times Free Press.

A spokesperson from Lee’s office and Turning Point USA did not respond to questions about the partnership when asked in November.
Gaines, who also attended Friday’s event, said she hopes other red states like Tennessee will establish partnerships with Turning Point USA.
This week, Texas announced a similar partnership. Florida has one as well.

(Photo by Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)A group of state attorneys general, including North Dakota’s, this week dropped a federal lawsuit that targeted health care for immigrants across the U.S.
Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach announced Wednesday he voluntarily dismissed the lawsuit, but health care for certain immigrants was stripped away more than three months ago when President Donald Trump rescinded the Biden-era rule that offered health care plans to people who migrated to the U.S. as children.
The roughly 10,000 immigrants in the United States under Deferred Action of Childhood Arrivals who purchased health insurance from the marketplace were removed from their plans by Oct. 1. An estimated 525,000 people are in the U.S. under DACA.
North Dakota joins Kansas-led suit challenging health insurance for DACA recipients

Kobach initially filed the lawsuit involving 18 other states after the Biden administration adopted rules in November 2024 enabling DACA participants to enroll in public health insurance plans, which wasn’t previously possible under the Affordable Care Act. Kobach argued in court against the policies, winning a preliminary injunction.
“This is a big win for the rule of law,” Kobach said in a Wednesday announcement. “Congress never intended that illegal aliens should receive Obamacare benefits.”
The lawsuit was filed in North Dakota federal district court.
North Dakota U.S. District Court Judge Dan Traynor closed the case on Thursday after Kobach filed a notice of voluntary dismissal.
Traynor ruled roughly a year ago to suspend the Biden administration program while the lawsuit progressed.
There were approximately 130 DACA recipients in North Dakota as of June 30, 2024, according to data from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service.
The 19 states bringing the case were Kansas, North Dakota, Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia.

Some medical systems seemed to be involved, too (Naomi O'Donnell/The Beacon).For years, stories circulated around Joplin, Missouri, about the city’s homeless population and how they arrived in the city.
Calls would come in to city officials following a recurring theme.
“People were coming to the City Council meetings and saying, ‘I don’t know why you guys don’t know this, but I’m witnessing busloads of people being dropped off in our town,’” said Joplin Mayor Keenan Cortez. “‘Buses are coming in, stopping at gas stations, unloading and the buses are turning around and going back.’”
The city commissioned a study to investigate. But it came back with no hard evidence.
Still, the reports kept coming in. So the city took a deeper look.
Officials collected video evidence of out-of-state law enforcement vehicles dropping people off at truck stops. Some medical systems seemed to be involved, too. They also gathered signed affidavits from people who were new to Joplin, saying they were given promises of a shelter bed or resources at the end of their ride.
“We were starting to hear from people in our community that, ‘I was brought to Joplin and just dropped off. I was in trouble over there. That community didn’t deal with me. They put me in a car, a van, a bus and said there’s help for you,’” Cortez said.
Instead, they were left without their support system, in a new city with limited resources and few places to turn.
Cortez said city officials aren’t sure how many people shared similar stories.
“At the end of the day, I don’t know if it was 15, if it was 50,” Cortez said. “As a mayor, it doesn’t matter.”
Joplin officials put their heads together with the city’s legal team. After sending cease-and-desist letters to the organizations they believed were dropping people off in the city, the City Council started considering legislation to ban the practice.
The City Council passed an ordinance at the beginning of November. It isn’t uncommon for medical systems to refer patients needing specialized treatment, or for victims of domestic violence, to be sent to a shelter in another town. The ordinance includes exemptions for those situations.
So far, Cortez and city officials think the letters and new ordinance appear to be working. They haven’t had any reports of people being dropped off since the ordinance was passed. But the trend points to a larger problem Missouri’s cities are facing as homelessness rises across the state.
 Missouri’s reliance on larger cities for services for the homeless population

It is fairly common for smaller, rural areas to rely on the services in larger cities for things like shelters, medical care or mental health treatment.
From 2023 to 2024, the number of unsheltered people grew 9% in Missouri, according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development point-in-time counts. In Kansas, the number grew by 6%, while Oklahoma saw an 18% jump.
Columbia is similar to Joplin when it comes to being a regional hub for services and shelter beds.
Columbia began working more closely on reducing homelessness in 2023 by establishing a program within Boone County’s Department of Public Health to connect people with resources. City officials also created a homeless outreach team within the police department to try and divert people from the justice system.
Now, the city has launched the Ride Home program, which gives homeless or impoverished community members free rides back to their hometowns or to support systems up to three hours away. If someone needs to travel farther, the city will purchase a bus ticket to get them to where they need to go.
Since the launch in October, the city has provided three rides, said Austin Krohn, public information specialist at the Columbia & Boone County Department of Public Health and Human Services.
“People come in for mental health services, or if there is a facility that can only do a certain type of screening for them,” Krohn said. “People are coming here from all over Missouri to get services, and then they’re stuck here.”
Local service providers and shelters can refer people to the program to receive a free ride. People must have verifiable support at the destination, a referral, photo ID and no outstanding warrants in the county.
Studies have shown that voluntary transport to a support system can be instrumental in improving someone’s housing situation.
San Francisco runs a robust transportation program, similar to Ride Home in Columbia. In fiscal year 2024, the agency that runs the program gave 230 rides.
San Francisco officials followed up with riders 90 days after their ride, and found that of the 230 served, 61 found housing, while 29 had another or unknown location. The remaining riders were unreachable or declined to be surveyed as part of the program.
“When I was doing direct service 30 years ago, people called it Greyhound therapy,” said Jeff Olivet, the former executive director of the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness. “Get a bus ticket to another town, just get out of here, basically. Sometimes that can be incredibly helpful if people are really wanting and needing to get back to family and social supports.”
But if someone is transported or coerced to leave town against their will, it can lead to poorer outcomes, Olivet said.
“Transportation can be critical,” Olivet said. “But if it’s basically, ‘Get out of town or we’re going to arrest you,’ that doesn’t solve homelessness for anybody. It just moves the problem around.”
One 2023 study modeled over 20 U.S. cities concluded that involuntary displacement of people experiencing homelessness — things like encampment sweeps or involuntary transport to another area — could lead to substantial increases in morbidity and mortality.
The study linked involuntary displacement with worse outcomes for overdoses and hospitalizations and a decrease in getting connected with treatment for opioid use. It said the displacements could contribute to deaths of homeless people who use drugs.
A 2017 investigation from The Guardian analyzed nearly 35,000 relocation journeys over a six-year period. The investigation found that most riders were relocated to places with a lower median income.
 How Missouri fares 

And as homelessness rates rise across all of Missouri, cities may need to start thinking about how to address these gaps, Olivet said.
“In the case of rural areas, or even suburban areas, where there aren’t as many shelter options for people, there aren’t as many mental health treatment programs, there aren’t as many supportive services. Oftentimes, the only way to get help is by going to a larger urban area,” Olivet said.
“That speaks to a tremendous gap when we don’t have good services, support and housing options for people in rural areas. They have to go somewhere else, even if they are from that rural area.”
In Missouri, the numbers aren’t improving.
The state’s continuum of care — a group of agencies that work under the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to address homelessness — found in its most recent report that homelessness is rapidly increasing across the state.
In Region 9, which includes the southwest corner of the state (but does not include metro areas like Joplin or Springfield, which run their own continuums of care outside of the statewide framework), 2023 data found a 133% rise in unsheltered homelessness and a 100% rise in sheltered homelessness from 2022 to 2023.
The area also saw family homelessness increase by 100% from 2022 to 2023.
Region 10, which represents the counties surrounding the Kansas City area, 2023 point-in-time data showed a 3% increase in unsheltered homelessness and a 119% increase in sheltered homelessness from 2022. Family homelessness increased by 173%.
In the group’s annual report, every region saw at least one metric of homelessness, sheltered or unsheltered, increase from 2022 to 2023.
It rings alarm bells with Mary Kenion, the chief equity officer at the National Alliance to End Homelessness.
“At least half of all people experiencing homelessness in largely rural continuums of care do so outdoors, in unsheltered locations,” Kenion said. “We’re also seeing family homelessness on the rise, in rural communities specifically.”
And in their report, the Missouri continuum of care providers noted that while larger towns were better equipped to handle homelessness, it highlights the lack of resources in more rural areas.
The report found a positive relationship between the number of beds available in permanent housing situations and the length of time someone was homeless. For every 1% increase in permanent housing beds, there was a 54-day decrease in the length of time someone was homeless.
Although solutions like access to permanent housing show promise, roadblocks remain.
A coalition of nonprofits and local governments recently sued the Trump administration, arguing it created unreasonable restrictions on state continuums of care across the country. The lawsuit argues that the administration is looking to shift funding away from proven solutions that improve homelessness and that it could force up to 170,000 Americans into homelessness.
The new rules change what types of projects are eligible for funding through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the criteria for selecting projects and the conditions grantees have to accept to receive the funding, the lawsuit argues.
Ultimately, Joplin Mayor Cortez and other experts said that following up with someone after they receive care or resources is key in reducing homelessness.
Cortez is excited about a new development of 16 tiny homes dedicated to providing permanent housing situations for Joplin. But addressing the issue takes everyone coming together, he said.
“This is an ongoing thing that everybody in the community is involved in —– the health care community, the religious community,” Cortez said. “We have some passionate champions in our community working to resolve this problem.”

Details of services
A Mass of Christian burial is being celebrated in the Chapel of Saint Michael the Archangel on the campus of Saint Michael’s College in Colchester on Friday, December 12, at 10:00 a.m.  Interment will be private at a later date. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Professor Edward Pfeifer Scholarship Fund, Saint Michael’s College, 1 Winooski Park, Box 256, Colchester, VT 05439; or to Home Health and Hospice, University of Vermont Health, 1110 Prim Road, Colchester, VT 05446.

Frank Landry, M.D., died peacefully on Saturday, Dec. 6, on home hospice, after suffering the effects of the acute illness Goodpasture Syndrome.  
Born in Newton, Massachusetts, to Frank and Nan Landry on Jan. 27, 1960, Frank grew up with his beloved siblings Joan, David, Nannette and Michael.  There he appreciated the beauty of the ocean and all it offered — swimming, fishing, exploring salt marshes and clamming.
With the death of his father at age 8, the family was left financially burdened but emotionally rich.  Their mother taught the family the tremendous importance of a work ethic, something Frank embraced his entire life.  With his two brothers in their own neighborhood landscaping company, Frank cared for the property of the summer Scituate residents. 
Frank was proud of his excellent public education in Scituate. Combining his hard-earned savings with scholarship funds, he attended and graduated from Saint Michael’s College in 1982, proud to pay his own way.  He met Justine Pfeifer there, the kindest, most loving woman on the planet.
Frank wanted to be a doctor and follow in his brother David’s footsteps, studying medicine. Though crushed by David’s suicide, he maintained a commitment to medicine as a career.  Frank graduated from Tufts University School of Medicine in 1987, receiving a Health Professions Scholarship through the U. S. Army.  Besides marrying Justine and adopting his children, Frank always said that the ten years serving for the country was the best thing he ever did.
He completed his training in Internal Medicine at Walter Reed Army Medical Center and the Uniformed Services University Medical School.  He served ten years in the Medical Corps at Walter Reed and at Madigan Army Medical Center in Tacoma, Washington. His passion was not just doctoring, but also teaching and mentoring medical students and residents.  During his tenure in the service, he traveled the country and world, serving during Desert Storm, and receiving numerous awards for teaching and medical practice. 
Moving to Vermont in 1996 to be closer to family, Frank joined UVM Medical Center and UVM Medical School  as an associate professor of medicine.  He opened his own practice in Burlington’s New North End, recruiting and mentoring younger doctors, showing them the joy of an independent practice.  In 2011, Frank further defined his clinical practice by establishing the first MDVIP concierge internal medicine practice in Vermont.  He was always an advocate for the independent doctor. 
Over the years, Frank served as medical director of Birchwood Terrace Health Care, president of FAHC Medical Staff in 2004, governor of the American College of Physicians (Vermont Chapter) and president of Vermont Internal Medicine. 
His greatest enjoyment in life came from his family.  Frank was passionate about embracing life in Vermont with Justine and their two sons, Nick and Matt. Fishing, swimming, sledding, and exploring with his boys at the Pfeifer home on Molly’s Falls Pond in Cabot was the delight of his life. He was most proud of Nick and Matt, despite all the usual struggles of growing up, for how well they have done, and how well they chose their partners, Martha and Rachel.

(Photo by Janine L. Weisman/Rhode Island Current)Eighty days have passed since coastal regulators agreed to ramp up pressure against Quidnessett Country Club to remove a rock wall built without permission along its shoreline. 
It’s been far longer — 835 days — since the same North Kingstown Country Club was first caught and reprimanded for erecting the 600-foot-long stone wall in defiance of state coastal regulations.
Yet the wall still stands. And the no holds-barred enforcement order issued by the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council on Sept. 23 has not amounted to much in the eyes of Topher Hamblett, executive director for Save the Bay.
“It’s been crickets since they voted,” Hamblett said in an interview Thursday. “We did a search of all available public records to see if they have had any communication.”
Have they forgotten? Hamblett doesn’t know. But he can’t forget, worried about lasting damage to the shoreline and habitat, and restricted public access.
“The Council must end its delay game and require Quidnessett Country Club to immediately restore the shoreline to allow the public to regain access to its tidelands and repair the Bay habitat harmed by its blatant violation,” Hamblett wrote in a Dec. 10 email to Ray Coia, CRMC chairman.

The email recounts the main events involved in the complex dispute encompassing environmental, development and administrative issues — and now the subject of a trio of lawsuits by Quidnessett.
The club built the rock wall along its shoreline in the winter 2023, seeking to protect the 14th hole of its signature golf course against rising sea levels and shoreline erosion. But the permanent structure is expressly forbidden under state regulations restricting development in economically sensitive habitats.
 In January, the CRMC denied an initial request by the country club to seek retroactive permission for the wall. The council’s unanimous vote seemingly ended the debate over the state’s classification of nearby waters and shifted focus to details of how Quidnessett ought to remove the wall and restore the shoreline.
That proved no less challenging, with seven plans submitted by Quidnessett — the most recent sent Sept. 5 — all rejected by coastal staff because they did not meet state coastal requirements. 
Muddying the waters: three separate lawsuits by Quidnessett against the agency and its appointed council members, alleging procedural violations and challenging the validity of shoreline restoration requirements.
The most recent complaint, filed on Oct. 23 in Providence County Superior Court, applies the same arguments of the prior legal lawsuits to the council’s Sept. 23 enforcement order. It asks a judge to reverse the enforcement order, contending that the dispute should be referred to an administrative hearing officer under the agency’s own guidelines, while labeling coastal regulators’ conditions for the location and slope of a natural barrier to replace the rock wall as “arbitrary and capricious.” 
Robin Main, an attorney representing Quidnessett, declined to comment.
Laura Dwyer, a spokesperson for the state coastal regulatory agency, acknowledged requests for comment but did not provide a response. The agency has not filed written responses to any of the three lawsuits from Quidnessett, according to public court documents.
The legal challenges could be holding up enforcement action. But Hamblett still thinks there is a bigger problem with what he sees as a pattern of inconsistent treatment and favoritism for well-connected property owners. 
He referred back to council’s now-infamous 2020 vote allowing Champlin’s Marina on Block Island to expand. The decision, which reversed a prior block of the marina expansion, drew swift public scrutiny and allegations of back room deals.  In 2022, the Rhode Island Supreme Court struck down the council’s approval of the marina expansion, finding it failed to meet requirements around public input and transparency in its decision making. 
“The Rhode Island public cannot help but wonder on whose behalf the Council is working,” Hamblett wrote in the email to Coia. “Is it the people of Rhode Island, who expect their coastal agency to protect Narragansett Bay and abide by its own rules and regulations? Or is it well-connected actors who brazenly violate coastal protection laws, knowing that the Council will assist them?”

Gov. Dan McKee, Attorney General Peter Neronha, House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and Senate President Valarie Lawson were copied on Hamblett’s email. 
Advocates have pressured state lawmakers for years to overhaul the coastal agency, abolishing the politically appointing council and redirecting decision-making power to its expert, administrative staff. Yet the legislation failed to advance in either chamber for the last three years amid cost concerns. 
In 2025, on the final day of the legislative session, the Rhode Island General Assembly agreed to a modest restructuring that adds professional qualifications and reduces the size of the council from 10 to seven people. 
“We’ll see how that goes,” Hamblett said of the restructuring. “We’re going to continue to push for real change. It’s important to keep this issue in front of state leaders, even though there appears to be indifference.”
Neronha, who has joined the chorus of critics calling to overhaul the coastal regulatory agency, said his office was considering “alternative enforcement options” for Quidnessett.
“When Quidnessett decided to build an illegal seawall on protected waters, they did so with blatant disregard for the law and under the assumption if they got caught there wouldn’t be consequences; not a bad bet given the reputation of the Council,” Neronha said in an emailed response Thursday. “And while the CRMC ultimately did the right thing, they have yet to take corrective enforcement action. Rhode Islanders rely on the coast, in part, to support their social and economic well-being, and unfortunately, the Council does not reliably act in the best interest of Rhode Islanders.”
McKee’s office did not respond to requests for comment.
Greg Pare, a spokesperson for Lawson, noted that the Quidnessett enforcement was tied up in litigation when asked for comment about the email.

While we mourn her passing, we are left with all that her generous spirit has given.

Cambridge, Massachusetts
Died Nov. 28, 2025
Brookfield, Vermont
Details of services
The family is holding a small closed ceremony soon, but is planning a much grander send off in the coming summer — a place where we can all gather one last time in her name and celebrate the life and the force that she was. More details will be forthcoming.

Colleen Candace Dunn passed away on Friday evening, Nov. 28, after a difficult battle with lung cancer. She is survived by her three children — Erica, Heidi and Nathaniel — as well as her beautiful grandchildren — Adeline, Tobias, Silas and Asa — whom she loved deeply.
Born in Cambridge, Massachusetts on Nov. 14, 1953, to Melvin Dunn and Mildred Baird, she had a challenging childhood and was eventually adopted by her uncle, who sent her to a boarding school in Bordeaux at the age of 12. Here, she began a lifelong love of languages and cultures.
She was fluent in several languages and turned this passion into a career in ESL that spanned all the way to the Department of Education in Washington, DC. She worked tirelessly to bring language to children, and more recently worked in schools like Montpelier and U-32, teaching Latin and French. When she could no longer work full time, she collected a small group of neighborhood children in Brookfield and taught them Spanish in her home. Long story short, her children learned quickly to never challenge her to a game of Scrabble!
While we mourn her passing, we are left with all that her generous spirit has given. Her love of travel, recently visiting Greece with her sisters. Her love of music — she saw James Taylor this year and even caught Joni Mitchell’s last performance in the Gorge. Her love of books, of museums, of thrifting, of art and food, of gathering around a full table. All these gifts live on in her family.
She was a wild and wondrous woman who was able to make something out of nothing, spin fancy from invisible silk thread; a woman who would open the door and invite you in for dinner knowing full well she hadn’t much to share. She will be sorely missed by all whom she touched.

The rally is scheduled from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Tuesday, Dec. 16 on the state Capitol lawn.
With the respective chambers of the state Legislature in session next week before the holiday break, supporters and organizers are hoping their voices will be heard and that they can find common ground with lawmakers who could help in their fight against data centers.
Plans for various data centers have been cropping up in rural areas, and there has been an outpouring of opposition from a wide swath of residents from both sides of the political aisle.
The protest and rally scheduled for Dec. 16 is being billed as a bipartisan affair and a unity event to build up the burgeoning anti-AI data centers movement.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Rally organizers on social media have said their main demands are for no secret deals between utilities, developers, the AI companies that would benefit from the data centers and local or state governments. They are urging local and state government officials to slow the process and not fast-track approvals, and for the deals to take place in public without non-disclosure agreements, redacted planning documents or backroom negotiations with big tech companies.
Also among their demands is a statewide moratorium on data centers, which advocates hope lawmakers will be able to push along – one of several reasons they’re flocking to Lansing next week.  Organizers are calling for land and water protections as conversations around approving new data centers intensify, and for rural community support as some feel they are being bullied or taken to court in attempts to silence the opposition.
Speakers are scheduled for the event, but the social media invites give no indication if any state government officials are scheduled to speak. The invites do indicate, however, that rallygoers will hear speakers from both political parties, community leaders and residents.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-12-123421.png,,,2025-12-12 12:58:23.336911

But the chief judge vacated the decision and ordered a rehearing. (Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)Gun owners looking to topple a New Jersey law banning guns in parks, bars, beaches, and other “sensitive places” have successfully persuaded a federal appeals court to rehear the case.
A three-judge panel rejected their arguments in a September ruling and largely upheld the law Gov. Phil Murphy signed in December 2022.
But the gun owners in October asked that the full U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals reconsider the panel’s ruling, which they contend conflicts with a June 2022 U.S. Supreme Court decision that declared gun carry a constitutional right.
On Thursday, Chief Judge Michael A. Chagares vacated the September ruling and granted a rehearing after a majority of the 3rd Circuit’s active judges voted for a rehearing. Chagares was appointed to the appeals court by former President George W. Bush in 2006 and became the 3rd Circuit’s chief judge in 2021. The rehearing is scheduled for Feb. 11.
September’s ruling — based on arguments made in October 2023 — was not unanimous. U.S. Circuit Court Judge David J. Porter, an appointee of President Donald Trump, issued a fiery dissent accusing his colleagues of “selective reading and overreading of Supreme Court precedent, methodological mistakes, and anachronistic disdain for public carry (which) combine to generate constitutional error.”
A majority of the judges on the full 3rd Circuit were appointed by Republicans, and most of them by Trump.
The Firearms Policy Coalition, one of the case’s plaintiffs, celebrated Chagares’ order.
“This significant development ensures that the entire court will evaluate the state’s unconstitutional scheme under the proper historical and constitutional framework,” the coalition said in an unsigned statement. “The prior panel’s flawed decision — upholding key elements of the law — has been vacated, restoring the case to a posture where New Jersey’s unlawful policies can be fully and fairly scrutinized.”
Attorney General Matt Platkin said the panel that issued September’s ruling “carefully and exhaustively studied the history and recognized that our statute was constitutional.”
The state will continue to defend the law, Platkin said, saying it protects residents from gun violence.
“Laws like this one have improved law enforcement’s ability to keep our community safe, and they have helped contribute to the dramatic reductions in gun violence and record low numbers of shootings and other violent crimes we have seen in recent years,” Platkin said. “We look forward to continuing our defense of our critical sensitive-places law.”
The law makes it a third-degree crime, punishable by up to five years imprisonment, to take guns into 25 sensitive spaces. Those include casinos, zoos, youth sporting events, public libraries and museums, concert venues, theme parks, transit hubs, churches, hospitals, nursing homes and other health care facilities, and movie sets.
That leaves people legally allowed to carry guns on private property with property owners’ permission. They can also carry while hunting and fishing.

Sign up for their newsletter here.
Forever War, Part 2: This story is published in partnership with WHQR, a nonprofit radio station and NPR affiliate in Wilmington. It is the second in a series of stories about the PFAS crisis in North Carolina.
The shipment arrived by FedEx, packed in dry ice. Inside were 119 plastic vials, each containing three drops of blood that had been stored at minus 112 degrees Fahrenheit for as long as a decade.
Jane Hoppin, an environmental epidemiologist at N.C. State University had ordered the blood. From 2010 to 2016, Wilmington residents had donated their serum to a biobank run by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to help scientists better understand how the body works. Now Hoppin wanted to learn if high concentrations of PFAS in the city’s drinking water were also present in the donors’ blood.

However, Hoppin and her fellow scientists didn’t anticipate finding one type of PFAS compound: TFA. The chemical industry has touted its toxicity as being “of lower concern,” because it breaks down quickly in the body.
Yet there it was, TFA, in five-year-old water and blood.
“We were surprised,” Hoppin said. “No one expected this.”
Hoppin was born in northern California and grew up in Cincinnati, about 200 miles west of a DuPont factory that discharged PFOA, a chemical used in non-stick cookware, into the Ohio River.
Even as a very young child she was interested in chemicals and their effects on human health.
When Hoppin was 4, her mother took her to a school psychologist to determine whether she could enter kindergarten a year early. The psychologist asked Hoppin to draw a person. When she finished, the psychologist seemed alarmed and recommended she stay home another year.
The people in her drawings had no nose or mouth.
“My mom said, ‘Why didn’t you draw a nose or a mouth?’” Hoppin recalled.
It was 1968, two years before Congress established the Clean Air Act, and Hoppin had recently seen television footage of smoggy Los Angeles.
She remembers telling her mom, ‘Well, I didn’t want them to breathe the air.’”
Now Hoppin feels the same way about people drinking water from the Cape Fear River.





Because many labs were closed during the pandemic, the Wilmington study took five years, but in October Hoppin and her colleagues at N.C. State and UNC released the results. All of the blood samples contained at least one of 34 toxic chemicals known as PFAS, including some used in fluorochemical manufacturing at Chemours, 80 miles upstream in Fayetteville.


More than three-quarters of the Wilmington blood samples contained elevated levels of TFA, whose health and environmental effects aren’t fully understood.
The study included archived samples of the Cape Fear River and Wilmington’s drinking water. They also contained elevated levels of more than two dozen PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, including TFA.
There are no federal or state drinking water standards for TFA.
Hoppin knew that It would not be unusual to find certain types of PFAS in the water and blood samples. In particular, PFOA and PFOS, known as “long-chains” because of their molecular structure, are notoriously persistent and linger in the environment for hundreds of years. In the human body, it can take more than a decade to eliminate them.
But TFA is an ultra-short chain compound. That the blood still contained such high levels of TFA suggested that the donors were being exposed to the compound, not just from Chemours, but by a variety of sources that scientists are only becoming aware of.
The troubling results opened a new front in a decades-long battle North Carolina environmentalists have been waging against PFAS in the state’s drinking water and air, soil and food.

PFAS Are Everywhere

There are tens of thousands of types of PFAS, which are found in many consumer products,as well as water-resistant clothing, furniture and personal care products. The compounds are ubiquitous, contaminating air, drinking water, fish, soil, crops, eggs and milk worldwide. PFAS even contribute to climate change by disrupting the ocean cycle and increasing the emissions of greenhouse gases.
PFAS exposure can lead to myriad serious health conditions, including kidney and testicular cancer, thyroid disorders, reproductive problems, high cholesterol and a depressed immune system.




In 2024, they celebrated when the Environmental Protection Agency under former President Joe Biden finally enacted the first drinking water standards for PFOA, PFOS, GenX and three other related compounds.
But their victory was short-lived. During President Donald Trump’s second term, the EPA has weakened or gutted its few PFAS regulations. The agency has delayed implementation of drinking water standards for PFOA and PFOS by two years, until 2031.
In September it also petitioned the U.S. Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia to rescind drinking water standards for several compounds, including GenX, which Chemours uses to produce non-stick cookware, food packaging and firefighting foam.
The government shutdown earlier this fall delayed the court case. Lawyers for the agency and opponents of the rollback are scheduled to file additional legal briefs this month.
As the chemical industry applauds the rollbacks, Chemours is planning to expand its Fayetteville Works plant, the source of GenX and dozens of similar compounds, including TFA.
The company doesn’t make TFA in Fayetteville, but its presence in the river and the air illustrates a stubborn aspect of the ubiquitous compounds: PFAS precursors.
There are thousands of such precursors, substances that, under certain conditions, transform and break down into a different PFAS compound. Like wood is a precursor to ash, and iron to rust, the compound PAF degrades and becomes TFA.
Chemours told state regulators in February that “based on risk assessment modelling and available toxicological data for similar compounds, TFA is not believed to be harmful to human health or the environment.”
The N.C. State study and other research calls into question Chemours’ assertions that TFA is benign. The compound is widespread in the environment, and even though it breaks down relatively quickly in the body, people rapidly absorb it from their food, drinking water and air.
Hoppin and Duke University scientists found in a separate study released earlier this year that the compound was present in house dust.
When TFA and other ultra-shortchain compounds accumulate in the body, according to the N.C. State study, they “can reach very high levels,” potentially harming human health.
Earlier this year the German government proposed classifying TFA as toxic to reproduction, including impaired fertility and harm to the fetus.
“We’re piecing together the past,” Hoppin said. “But the real concern is that we continue to measure exposure in people today.”
High Levels of TFA
N.C. State scientist Detlef Knappe was failing at taking his sabbatical. This fall, between globetrotting trips to Australia, Singapore and beyond, he was proofreading and finalizing the Wilmington blood and drinking water study.
Knappe had played an outsized role in the protests that led to the EPA’s drinking water standards for several types of PFAS. He was among the scientists who, in 2015, discovered GenX in the Cape Fear River and Wilmington’s drinking water. Those findings launched an environmental movement, with thousands of North Carolinians urging the EPA to regulate GenX and other PFAS in drinking water.

As part of that research, Knappe had stored samples of river water and drinking water in case he wanted to reanalyze them in the future.
In 2024, that time came.
The collection date of the water and blood samples was critical. To fully understand the extent of residents’ PFAS exposure, Hoppin and Knappe needed samples taken before June 2017, when state regulators forced Chemours to stop discharging the compounds into the river.
Knappe retrieved samples from one day in late May 2017, when he and his colleagues had collected water from 10 spots in the river: upstream and downstream of Chemours, in Wilmington and at the Cape Fear Public Utility Authority, which provides drinking water for nearly 200,000 people.


The study found that concentrations of TFA in the Cape Fear River immediately downstream of Chemours reached 6 million parts per trillion, “orders of magnitude” higher than in upstream samples. This suggested Chemours was a significant source of the compound at these locations.
By the time the TFA reached Wilmington and passed through the utility’s water treatment plant, the levels were still extremely high: 108,000 parts per trillion.
That’s equal to 50 times the health guidance level of 2,200 ppt set by the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment. It is also above the German Federal Health Agency’s advisory of 60,000 ppt; Germany considers TFA to be toxic to reproduction.
“The overwhelming evidence is that these compounds are of concern,” Knappe said. “I’m very concerned that we’re not going to get TFA under control in the time that is needed to prevent adverse health outcomes.”
A “Regrettable Substitute”
TFA is what scientists refer to as a “regrettable substitute,” because in trying to solve one environmental problem, it creates another.
In 1985, the problem was an enormous hole that researchers had discovered in the Earth’s ozone layer, which shields the planet from the sun’s harmful ultraviolet radiation. The culprits were chlorofluorocarbons, also known as CFCs, used in refrigerants in common appliances, such as air conditioners.
Not only were CFCs exfoliating the Earth’s protective skin, they were also contributing to climate change. Two years later, companies began phasing out CFCs under an international treaty, the Montreal Protocol, and replaced them with other substances that in the atmosphere can transform into TFA.
Since then, TFA has become baked into modern life. When Prozac, the antidepressant taken by 5.7 million people in the U.S., breaks down in water, it forms TFA.
At data centers, the AI that drafts emails, mines cryptocurrency  and analyzes medical scans requires enormous computing power. To prevent the computers from overheating, data centers use cooling fluids, some of which emit chemicals that become TFA. Chemours makes such a product at its plant in Corpus Christi, Texas.
Dozens of pesticides also contain TFA, including one recently approved by the EPA to kill insects on corn, soybeans, wheat and citrus. The pesticide, called isocycloseram, is also approved for home lawns and to kill cockroaches, termites and bedbugs.
The planet is so bombarded with TFA that, since 2010, global levels have increased as much as 17 times compared with previous decades, according to Scandinavian scientists. They warned that TFA could cause “potential irreversible, disruptive impacts on vital earth system processes.”
“We went from compounds that destroyed the ozone layer,” Knappe said, “to compounds that break down and pollute the earth with TFA.”
What’s Coming Out of Chemours Now?

One day in late September, Cape Fear Riverkeeper Kemp Burdette paddled his aluminum rowboat toward the Chemours Fayetteville Works plant. The N.C. State scientists were finalizing their study, but their findings would show only a snapshot of Chemours’ past discharges. Burdette wanted to know how much TFA and other ultra-short chain compounds Chemours was currently sending into the river.
He dipped a sampler into the water near Outfall 2, where the company discharges treated wastewater unrelated to its manufacturing. He continued downstream to the boat ramp below the Huske Dam. There, he collected water entering the Cape Fear via a seep, then rowed to Outfall 3, to grab more water leaving the southern edge of the plant.
Burdette returned to Wilmington, where he collected drinking water from a tap, and then a second one in nearby Brunswick County.
The results were disturbing: Water leaving Outfall 2 had concentrations of 14,950 ppt of TFA; discharge from Outfall 3 contained 21,900 ppt.
Near the dam, TFA concentrations reached 148,513 ppt. There were high levels of other ultra-short chain compounds, as well.
Downstream, TFA was penetrating the $80 million advanced filtration system the Cape Fear Public Utility Authority had installed to remove GenX. The drinking water Burdette collected at a Wilmington tap contained TFA at concentrations of 1,900 ppt; levels at the Brunswick County tap were 1,400.
Both results are below the Dutch health guidance level of 2,200 ppt in drinking water.
“It is unfortunate, though unsurprising, that we continue to see the impacts from Chemours’ decades of PFAS releases from their chemical manufacturing plant on the Cape Fear River,” said utility spokesman Vaughn Hagerty. “Chemours continues to shift the ever-growing, multimillion-dollar burden for addressing its PFAS contamination to downstream water users.”
Burdette’s findings bolstered concerns raised by Southern Environmental Law Center about the plant’s TFA discharges, especially in light of the planned expansion.
SELC is urging the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality to require Chemours, as part of its pending wastewater discharge permit, to sample for TFA and other ultra-short chains in Outfall 3. DEQ should then limit the amount of TFA that enters the river, SELC wrote.
Legally, if the DEQ doesn’t implement limits for TFA and other ultra-short chains, then Chemours could try to argue that those pollutants are permitted, SELC attorney Jean Zhuang told Inside Climate News. “That risks shielding them from liability for releasing them. It is really important that the state acts on these pollutants.”
The recent findings also raise questions about whether TFA is in private drinking water wells. A 2019 consent order among Chemours, Cape Fear River Watch and DEQ requires the company to test wells near the site for more than a dozen types of PFAS. However, TFA is not on the list.
“We don’t know if it’s in wells,” Hoppin said. “They need to be re-analyzed the samples for TFA.”
The program is voluntary. So far, 22,000 private wells have been sampled, and of those nearly 7,500 households have qualified for alternate water supplies as stipulated in the consent order.
A DEQ spokesperson said that the agency is weighing options to add TFA to its environmental monitoring. That would require a separate laboratory method outside those established by the EPA.
Since there is no regulatory drinking water standard for TFA, the spokesperson said, DEQ “does not have an alternative water recommendation to offer at this time.“
Chemours’ Expansion
The Chemours plant fans out over 2,100 acres flanked by N.C. Highway 87 and the Cape Fear River in northern Bladen County, about 15 miles from Fayetteville. A dozen straight roads and a railroad spur run through the property and impose order on the cacophony of tanks and pipes and smokestacks.
Those smokestacks emitted 267 pounds of TFA in 2021, according to documents accompanying the company’s air permit application. Once released, TFA floats through the air, falls to the ground and contaminates all that it touches.
A Chemours spokesperson told Inside Climate News even though the company would increase production of PFAS after the expansion, fluorinated organic compound emissions, which include TFA, to the air are still “projected to decrease by an average of 9 percent compared to the 2021 baseline.”
In its 2024 permit application, Chemours says indoor, outdoor and process emissions—those released directly from manufacturing and waste management—would decrease by 1,765 pounds per year.
But Zhuang of SELC said that claim is misleading. Accounting for maximum potential PFAS emissions from different product lines, the 2024 permit application shows a potential increase of 20 percent, or 2,500 pounds per year.
However, Chemours’ 2025 application shows significant decreases in PFAS air emissions, although those don’t account for the maximum possible.
The company has based some of its air emissions estimates on the demand for Chemours products. State records show DEQ, in reviewing the air permit application, recently asked Chemours for additional information over concerns about the use of “market conditions” as a basis for calculating potential emissions, as well as other inconsistencies.
“That’s not a reliable estimate of their actual potential emissions,” Zhuang said.
The Chemours spokesperson said that due to the “operational limitations of Vinyl Ether manufacturing units, the emissions potential hinges on how much of each product the company manufactures, which can vary.”
Chemours has also set a goal of reducing PFAS emissions and discharges by 99 percent globally by 2030, according to the company’s sustainability report released last year. Since 2018, Chemours says it has cut global PFAS emissions and discharges by three-quarters.
Ralph Mead, a professor of Earth and Ocean Sciences at UNC Wilmington, is an affable man who dresses casually, like a lot of people who live in beach towns. He specializes in understanding how contaminants travel through the air and where they land, a phenomenon known as atmospheric deposition.

On a humid and breezy September day, outside Mead’s lab between a parking lot and a marsh, he and a graduate student, Justin Parker, peered into a white bucket to see if it had collected rain overnight.
Similar to other PFAS compounds, when TFA is emitted into the air—from a refrigerator, a heat pump, a smokestack—it can travel hundreds of miles in different directions before it falls to the ground—or into a bucket.
If it had rained, Parker would inject the water through a labyrinth of instrumentation to analyze it for dozens of types of PFAS. The bucket was empty. But previous rainwater sampling had found very high levels of TFA, its origins likely varied, but unknown.
In Mead’s view, that’s the issue with Chemours’ air permit application: It doesn’t fully account for the long-range dispersion of the compounds, including TFA.


DEQ required Chemours as part of its application to show that increased PFAS production at Fayetteville Works would not increase the atmospheric deposition of the compounds coming from the facility.
State regulators wanted to avoid a repeat of what had happened with GenX: For more than a decade, Chemours emitted tons of the contaminant from its smokestacks. It fell to the ground and contaminated the soil, river and drinking water wells at least 28 miles away.
Chemours hired a contractor to study how PFAS would behave in the air. The analysis separated the compounds into “depositable”—meaning they can chemically transform and land nearby—and “non-depositable”—which would linger in the atmosphere for years and float far away.
The contractor’s report concluded that depositable emissions, including TFA, would total 1,700 pounds, an 11 percent reduction from 2021 estimates.
Non-depositable emissions would decrease by 15 percent, to 9,300 pounds.
Mead read the contractor’s study and said he still has questions about the fate of the non-depositable compounds. “We need to account for those,” he said. “It’s important for human exposure aspects, as well as contamination of the surface of the Earth away from the facility.”
Mead and scientists from four other public universities in North Carolina will soon launch a three-year study on the behavior of PFAS in air leaving the Chemours plant. The research, paid for by the N.C. Collaboratory, which funds academic research in the state, will include analysis of how the compounds transform in the atmosphere and their deposition patterns when they fall to  the Earth’s surface.
“This information may allow for better enforcement and regulation of these compounds from the facility,” Mead said.
Environmental advocates say the air permit application is yet another example of the company’s lack of transparency about its operations, transgressions documented in state and federal records.
In 2023, with EPA approval, the company imported GenX from its plant in Dordrecht, the Netherlands, but never informed state regulators. 
Three years earlier, DEQ cited the company for dumping soil and tree roots likely contaminated with PFAS into an unlined landfill. In 2017, Chemours failed to report a chemical spill at the plant.
And ??in the early 2000s, state records show when Chemours’ parent company, DuPont, told DEQ it was manufacturing GenX, it didn’t disclose that it was discharging the compound into the river.
Since Chemours has failed to clean up its existing and widespread contamination from Fayetteville Works, Zhuang told Inside Climate News, the facility “is absolutely not a place where the company should even be contemplating expanding its manufacturing operations.”
More recently, Chemours has kept under seal thousands of pages of information about the compounds, including health effects, as part of a federal lawsuit filed against the company by the Cape Fear Public Utility Authority, Brunswick County and the Town of Wrightsville Beach.
Lawyers with SELC filed a motion with the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District in North Carolina, to intervene in the case, arguing the public has a First Amendment right to the information.
“After contaminating the drinking water, air, soil, and food for more than half-a-million North Carolinians for decades,” SELC’S motion reads, “the companies have no right to conceal essential documents related to their own pollution, including information on sampling data, air and wastewater treatment options, toxicology, and the public’s exposure to their toxic chemicals.”
The Southern Coalition for Social Justice filed a similar motion as well.
The company previously argued in court documents that the sealed material contains confidential, proprietary information. On Dec. 3, U.S. District Court Judge James Dever, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, ruled against Chemours. Dever wrote that the company’s “move to seal a broad class of documents they deem commercially sensitive or confidential do not provide specific evidence to support their motion.”
Warnings in an Empty Room
On the evening of Nov. 5, nearly every metal chair was empty at the Wilmington City Council meeting. Burdette, dressed in a slate gray button-up shirt and olive pants, his eyeglasses perched on his head, urged the council to pass a resolution opposing Chemours’ expansion.
Burdette noted that his two children drank the water for years before they knew it was contaminated, and that his father died of kidney cancer, which is linked to PFAS exposure, especially GenX.
“This resolution is our City Council saying it won’t tolerate the continued contamination of our air and water,” Burdette told the six-member council and mayor. “It tells DEQ that our leadership expects the state to do its job and protect the people and the environment. The expansion is a slap in the face to Wilmingtonians.”
The City Council unanimously passed the resolution. The next  week, on Nov. 12, the Cape Fear Public Utility Authority board did the same, followed by the New Hanover County and Brunswick County Commissioners.
A Chemours spokesperson said the company “respects Wilmington City Council’s and Cape Fear Public Utility Authority’s right to express their opinions, though it seems counterintuitive to oppose a permit application that would ultimately reduce Fayetteville Works’ site-wide PFAS air emissions even further beyond the significant reductions already achieved in recent years, despite an increase in production.”
The company’s significant reductions in air emissions were required by DEQ as part of the consent order.
As Hoppin reflected on the study results, she sounded dismayed. PFAS contamination in the Cape Fear River Basin appears to be worse than scientists had surmised in 2017, when the public became aware of GenX in the drinking water. “It’s unfortunate that eight years later we’re getting a broad picture of what’s been happening.”
Chemours has not announced a timeline for its expansion. DEQ is reviewing the company’s permit applications, and after the agency releases the draft permits, it will hold public hearings and a public comment period.
Two weeks after the study was published, on Nov. 6, Chemours announced its latest financial results to investors and the public. The company’s net sales of $1.5 billion were flat compared with the third quarter of the previous year. But one product showed an 80 percent year-over-year growth: Opteon, a refrigerant  used at data centers. It emits TFA.

(Photo provided by Mullins McLeod)A Democrat running for governor slammed his fellow Democrats as corrupt this week as he asked a court to dismiss the misdemeanor disorderly conduct charge that resulted in calls for him to withdraw four months ago.
Mullins McLeod, a prominent Charleston attorney, has been at odds with his party leaders since days after he launched his campaign this summer, after police released footage of him ranting for more than 30 minutes in the back of a cruiser.
Tripling down on his refusal to exit the race, McLeod said the state Democratic Party chairwoman’s call for him to “focus on his mental and emotional well-being” is an example of the corruption he is running against.
“The idea that the chair of a political party would attempt to put his or her thumb on the scale is a perfect sign of political corruption,” he told the SC Daily Gazette on Thursday.
“When political parties try to put their thumb on the scale, guess what it does? It disenfranchises voters. It’s not good for democracy,” he said.
SC Democrats call on Charleston lawyer to suspend campaign for governor following arrest video

Christale Spain, who chairs the South Carolina Democratic Party, did not respond to the Gazette’s phone and email requests this week for comment.
McLeod said corruption was rampant in Columbia, accusing politicians of putting corporate profits over people.
When asked about his fellow Democrat in the race, Rep. Jermaine Johnson, McLeod suggested he, too, was corrupt.
“I think they should look at his voting record, and I think they should make a decision whether or not he is trying to clean up this corrupt system, or whether he’s part of it,” he said, without pointing to any specific vote or legislation.
Johnson, first elected to the state House in 2020, declined to address the accusations directly.
“Mr. McLeod is lashing out because he and his character have been on trial for his actions,” he said in a statement to the Gazette. “Unfortunately, this is not the first time Mr. McLeod has insulted me.
“Taking baseless shots at my character will not help restore his reputation,” said Johnson, of rural Hopkins in Richland County. “I hope he gets the help he needs.”
At a bond hearing following his arrest in May, McLeod’s attorney at the time explained his client’s behavior as stemming from a mental health episode and exhaustion, rather than drugs as officers suggested, The Post and Courier reported.
In a Tuesday court filing, a different attorney, Scott Bischoff, disputed the Charleston Police report altogether, saying McLeod was not “yelling at the top of his lungs” or in his underwear before he was arrested and began ranting to officers.
McLeod told the Gazette that his May arrest was unlawful but declined to go into more detail.
“My obligation is the voters of South Carolina, and I promise them that long before they go to the polls, they will know my side of the story,” he told the Gazette.
According to his lawyer’s filing, McLeod was rehearsing a political speech on an empty street near his house at the tip of Charleston’s peninsula when officers approached him and was wearing shorts with pockets, not underwear. Citing body cam footage, Bischoff said the officers did not witness any disorderly conduct before they arrested McLeod.
“There is no evidence he rambled incoherently or was loud and boisterous at that time and therefore there was no lawful reason for the officers to stop him much less place him in handcuffs,” according to the filing.
The filing said the officers failed to tell McLeod why he was being arrested before they handcuffed him, as the law requires.
“We have asked the city to conduct an internal affairs investigation regarding the officers that were involved in this case on account of over a dozen violations,” Bischoff said at a press conference Tuesday.
A judge will now rule on the motion to dismiss the charge.
In August, the Charleston Police Department released a nearly 35-minute video of McLeod from the night he was arrested that showed him shirtless and yelling in the back of a police car. During the profanity-laced rant on a variety of grievances, McLeod threatened to kick in the teeth of political opponents, said the U.S. president was likely his cousin, and called himself “one of the most just humans to ever walk this soil.” At one point, he repeated a racial slur used against Black people.
The department released the video to media outlets, including the Gazette, in response to open records requests. It did not respond to Thursday phone and email requests for comment.
After the video’s release, Spain discouraged McLeod from continuing his campaign in a statement posted on social media.
“Mullins McLeod is a skilled attorney, a former county Democratic Party chair who worked tirelessly for our values, and a member of a proud Lowcountry family with a long tradition of public service,” she wrote. “After reviewing the transcript of the dash cam footage from his recent arrest, it is clear that Mr. McLeod is navigating profound challenges and should focus on his mental and emotional well-being instead of a campaign for governor.”
McLeod is well-known for his legal work and was one of the lawyers who helped negotiate an $88 million settlement for the survivors and families of the nine victims killed by an avowed racist in 2015 at Charleston’s oldest Black church.
He also ran for governor in 2010 but suspended his campaign about four months before the Democratic primary.
McLeod, the first Democrat to announce a 2026 run for the Governor’s Mansion, is largely self-financing his campaign so far. Of the $1.4 million he’d raised as of Sept. 30, 94% was his own money, according to his latest campaign filing.
Johnson only has an initial filing showing $2,800 raised on Oct. 28, when he launched his campaign.
No Democrat has won a statewide race in South Carolina since 2006. It’s been 27 years since voters elected a Democrat as governor.
The five announced Republicans vying for the Governor’s Mansion are Lt. Gov. Pamela Evette, state Sen. Josh Kimbrell, U.S. Reps. Nancy Mace and Ralph Norman, and Attorney General Alan Wilson.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-12 16:34:09+00:00,CT Mirror,Efforts to require Asian American history in K-12 schools begin to pay off,Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/12/efforts-to-require-asian-american-history-in-k-12-schools-begin-to-pay-off/,"Three years after CT became the third state to require Asian American and Pacific Islander history in K-12 education, a curriculum is launched.","When high school students in the West Hartford Public Schools district study World War II in the coming year, they will learn about more than just the typical hallmarks like Japanese American detention camps. They will also hear about Sadao Munemori, a soldier who died protecting comrades from a grenade. The 22-year-old posthumously became the first Japanese American awarded the Medal of Honor.
Lessons like this that delve beyond places have left teachers “humbled,” said Jessica Blitzer, the district’s social studies department supervisor who helped design curriculum for secondary grade levels.
“It’s one of those moments where you think ‘How have we not been doing that?’ These are moments where you realize this is really important, particularly given the population that we have in West Hartford, which is incredibly diverse in many ways,” Blitzer said.
Three years after Connecticut became the third state to require Asian American and Pacific Islander history in K-12 education, a developed curriculum is being put into motion. For now, instruction is being rolled out in every grade except fourth and fifth. Most of the district’s 9,300 students will have lessons integrated year-round. It will not be “the heritage month approach,” Blitzer said.
Since pandemic-fueled anti-Asian hate surged in 2020, Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander advocates have mobilized to make AAPI history mandatory learning through legislation or state education boards. Today, most AAPI adults want educators to teach history through the lens of racism, slavery and segregation, according to a 2024 survey. There have been some successes, with around a dozen states passing statutes requiring curriculum.
Beyond well-known events, classes are diving into topics like stereotypes of South Asians and Vietnamese refugees. But as efforts arise, so has disagreement among Asian Americans.
More progressive voices question the fairness and optics of seeking approval from lawmakers who have rejected history focused on other historically marginalized groups, such as expanded Black history curriculum that some critics more recently maligned as woke ideology or likened to critical race theory.
How teaching AAPI history finally came to the forefront
AAPI organizations devastated by reports of thousands of verbal and physical attacks, including the 2021 Atlanta spa shootings that left six Asian women dead, ramped up lobbying for more inclusive education. The hope was teaching about AAPI contributions would foster understanding. In July 2021, Illinois became the first state to mandate Asian American history. In 2022, New Jersey and Connecticut followed.
An expanded look at history includes reading accounts of new immigrants in San Francisco and Wong Kim Ark’s Supreme Court fight for birthright citizenship. It also includes studying living figures like Chinese American architect Maya Lin.
Jason Oliver Chang, director of the University of Connecticut Asian and Asian American Studies Institute, helped develop legislation and train teachers. He remembers how lawmakers were moved by student testimonials.
“They were talking about their experiences sort of living two lives — one at school, one at home — feeling invisible and not feeling seen by their peers or respected by their peers,” Chang said. “Any time there’s a mention of someone that looks like them in a school curriculum, it’s that they’re the bad guys.”
President Donald Trump has intensified scrutiny of how schools address race, threatening to withhold federal funds over diversity initiatives. The guidance has left some educators uncertain, despite some anti-DEI measures being blocked or put on hold by federal judges. Concerned teachers should stick to the framework and consult with colleagues, advises Kate Dias, president of the Connecticut’s largest teachers’ union.
“Almost every person who teaches content of this nature does not do it in a way to say, ‘Here’s all the injustices of the world,’ ” Dias said. “The the call to action is ‘You need to now look at this information and you need to decide what it means.’ ”

Working with critics of race-conscious curriculum
Requiring AAPI history in schools has garnered bipartisan support. But in some conservative states, divisions have arisen over lawmakers who don’t see systemic racism and social justice as essential to history.
When Florida adopted AAPI history legislation in 2023, critics saw it as hypocritical given the state denied Advanced Placement African American studies for being “critical race theory.”
In Arizona, failed legislation mandating AAPI and Native Hawaiian history lessons was endorsed by the Japanese American Citizens League. The Arizona chapter came out against it.
Chapter leaders asserted the bill’s co-sponsor, state Republican Sen. John Kavanagh, and other supporters were only interested in rubber-stamping a sanitized history and ignoring African American and LGBTQ+ history.
Kavanagh equates talk of systemic racism with indoctrination. He previously supported barring college groups based on racial or ethnic identity and high school ethnic studies classes that seemed politicized.
He says teaching the history must be done in a “neutral, thorough manner.”
“I certainly have no problem teaching the history of Blacks or Hispanics or anybody,” Kavanagh said. “I don’t think there should be a course in a high school teaching students that this country is systemically racist when it’s not.”
The Arizona chapter of Make Us Visible, a national organization trying to establish AAPI history in every state, has faced criticism for not calling out right-leaning legislators. Astria Wong, chapter director, dismissed it.
“It’s really a good thing that even a conservative senator will support it. That means there is some bones in it,” Wong said. “It should be bipartisan anyway.”
Amber Reed, co-executive director of AAPI New Jersey, finds it upsetting.
“What teacher wants to suddenly start teaching Asian American history while sort of being discouraged from teaching African American history or Latinx history, the history of all of our communities,” Reed said.
A ‘deeper, richer’ look at American history
Before next summer, West Hartford Public Schools will assess how to improve curricula.
The goal is not to teach just “doom and gloom” to the student body — of which white children make up about 55%, Hispanics 21% and Asians and Black students more than 10% each — but a balanced look at history, said assistant superintendent Anne McKernan.
“There’s resistance, there’s perseverance, there’s greatness,” McKernan said. “As I look through the changes in elementary and the changes in secondary, it’s a richer look.”
Elementary grades are using books to learn culture, reading comprehension and vocabulary, said Erika Hanusch, district literacy and social studies curriculum specialist. For example, kindergartners are reading the picture book “Dumpling Soup” by Jama Kim Rattigan. Centered around a family in Hawaii, the characters come from different Asian backgrounds.
“It’s really more so embedded through story and lens,” Hanusch said. “And it’s giving teachers and students that natural opportunity to learn a little bit more about the where and the who and the traditions that come from those stories.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25336731932612-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-12 11:57:20.107625

President Donald Trump’s administration said in April it was “ending” the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program, which helped communities with predisaster projects to harden infrastructure and improve resilience against the increasing threats of climate change.
The administration called the program “wasteful and ineffective” and said it would halt $3.6 billion in funding awarded but not yet paid and would not award $882 million in grants for the following fiscal year.
The program’s disruption upended projects across hundreds of communities in both Republican- and Democratic-led states, thwarting plans to improve stormwater drainage, harden electrical lines and even help relocate households living in areas most vulnerable to disasters.

In a statement Thursday, Connecticut Attorney General said, “Donald Trump tried to unilaterally dismantle and defund our government’s ability to prevent and prepare for natural disasters. We sued, and once again, we won.” Tong added, “Refusing to prepare for a disaster does not stop nature, does not save lives, and does not save money.”
A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson told The Associated Press Thursday that DHS “has not terminated BRIC,” but did not elaborate on the program’s status.
“The Biden Administration abandoned true mitigation and used BRIC as a green new deal slush fund,” the spokesperson said, referring to a Democratic plan to combat climate change. “It’s unfortunate that an activist judge either didn’t understand that or didn’t care.”
The order comes at a time of profound uncertainty over FEMA’s future and on the same day that a long-awaited meeting of the FEMA Review Council to present a report recommending reforms to the agency was abruptly canceled by the White House because it had not been fully briefed on the latest version of the report, according to a White House official who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Congress funded BRIC during the first Trump administration through the 2018 Disaster Recovery Reform Act, and FEMA launched the program in 2020. The 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act made an additional $1 billion available for BRIC over five years, though only about $133 million had been delivered to communities by April, according to FEMA.
The program was criticized by some for being difficult to access for rural and less wealthy communities due to a complicated application process and cost-sharing requirements. But even Republican lawmakers like Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana opposed the cancellations and called for BRIC’s reinstatement.
“It protects families and saves taxpayer dollars in the long-run,” Cassidy said on the Senate floor a week after the funding cancellation. “That’s efficient in my book.”
Judge Richard G. Stearns found that FEMA’s actions were unlawful since Congress appropriated the money specifically for the grants and that there was an “inherent public interest in ensuring that the government follows the law.”
“The BRIC program is designed to protect against natural disasters and save lives,” Stearns wrote in the court order.
The Trump administration has slashed disaster preparedness dollars across multiple FEMA programs this year as part of its campaign to transfer more responsibility for disasters to states.
Since February, Trump has not approved any requests for hazard mitigation funding, a typical add-on that helps states, tribes and territories complete resilience projects after major disasters.
Emergency preparedness grants that states and local governments rely on to staff emergency management agencies and buy equipment are currently frozen after 12 states sued the Trump administration over unprecedented grant stipulations related to the administration’s immigration agenda.
Multiple studies have shown that preemptive investments in disaster readiness can yield significant savings. A 2024 study funded by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce found every $1 invested in disaster preparation saved $13 in economic impact, damage and cleanup costs.

The men, according to the news release, “are aligned with Governor Braun’s commitment to making energy affordable for families and businesses.”
Zay will chair the IURC, the news release said. He has served in the Indiana Senate since 2016, with several years on the chamber’s dedicated utilities committee.
His appointment will create a vacancy in the Senate because the Indiana Constitution bans government employees from concurrently holding more than one “lucrative,” or paid, office.
Once Zay moves to the IURC job, a caucus of precinct committeemen from his district will have 30 days to meet and select a successor, according to Indiana Code. That person will serve out the rest of his four-year term, which is set to end November 2028.
Zay will be joined by Deig, a Democrat who spent a term in the Senate from 2006 to 2010, with time on the chamber’s utilities committee. The IURC’s makeup must include both political parties.
Swinger, meanwhile, has spent more than 25 years with the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor, the state agency that represents ratepayers in cases before the commission. He is the executive director of technical operations, but previously managed media, consumer, and governmental relations.
The IURC is charged with ensuring that utilities provide safe, reliable service at just and reasonable rates. By law, the commission serves as an impartial arbiter — “an advocate of neither the public nor the utilities” — but its decisions often draw scrutiny from consumer advocates and lawmakers alike.
The three men will fill roles left vacant by Commissioners Sarah Freeman and Wesley Bennett, who left in October, months before their terms were set to end. Chair Jim Huston’s term lapsed in April, but he pledged to stay on until a successor was chosen.
The jobs come with salaries of $152,000.

(Photo vis FAU)Florida’s Board of Governors on Friday scrapped a year-old rule that let its chair sign off on presidential finalists before they are sent for votes by university trustees — a policy critics said vested too much power in one individual.
Now, the state chair no longer will have a role in approving presidential finalists. Incoming BOG Chair Alan Levine, who starts his new position on Jan. 1, lauded the move as a win for non-consolidated power in the university sphere.
“I don’t think any chair of a board should have the power to act unilaterally to make decisions about the hiring of a president or anybody,” Levine said in Friday’s Board of Governors meeting. “I strongly support this particular change.”
Sitting Chair Brian Lamb agreed.
“Vice Chair Levine, I concur, and it’s all for the right reasons at the right time. I’m glad we’re making the change,” he said.
Last legislative session, the Florida House took a long look at, and passed, legislation that would have made the university presidential search process more public. The Senate began conversations, but ultimately did not pass similar legislation after Gov. Ron DeSantis said he would veto any such bill.
DeSantis has won nationwide acclaim from the right and condemnation from the left for his sweeping revamps to higher education. They include overhauling the former liberal arts school New College into a “Hillsdale of the South,” post-tenure review for professors, and installing political allies and former GOP lawmakers at colleges and universities statewide:

Former Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nuñez at Florida International University.
Former House GOP Leader Adam Hasner at Florida Atlantic University.
Former Education Commissioner and legislator Manny Diaz Jr. at University of West Florida.
Former House Speaker and Education Commissioner Richard Corcoran at New College.
Former U.S. Sen. Ben Sasse, a Republican, at the University of Florida.
Former lobbyist and DeSantis appointee Marva Johnson at Florida A&M University.

Moez Limayem was approved, too, to be the University of South Florida president, after being named a sole finalist.
The BOG also approved an amendment to its policies, permitting contract extensions longer than one year for university presidents. Existing policy only permits one-year extensions. 
The new language requires that a university, for the majority of the president’s tenure, received a high performance-based funding score to be extended for more than a year.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/boca-raton.png,,,2025-12-12 11:57:20.107625

WILMINGTON, Del. — The Ladybug Music Festival, widely recognized as the nation’s largest free celebration of women in music, will return under new stewardship in 2025, continuing a run that has made it one of Delaware’s most successful and enduring cultural events.
The festival will now be managed by Igniting Delaware Edutainment Association, known as I.D.E.A., a Wilmington-based nonprofit that focuses on education, arts, and community engagement. The transition marks the first change in leadership since the festival’s founding in 2012.
For more than a decade, Ladybug has grown from a small, grassroots showcase on Market Street into a statewide cultural institution, drawing thousands of attendees each year and featuring hundreds of women-fronted bands and solo artists from across the country and abroad. Artists have traveled to Wilmington from more than 20 states and three countries to perform at the free, women-led festival.
The festival was founded and led by Gayle Dillman, whose vision and persistence helped establish Ladybug as a signature summer event in Wilmington and a nationally recognized platform for women in the music industry.
“I’ve been privileged to be a part of The Ladybug Music Festival from the very beginning,” Dillman said in a statement. “It has been my honor to create and nurture this event and watch it grow into something truly special. I’m excited to hand it off to the incredibly capable and creative hands of the I.D.E.A. team.”
Under Dillman’s leadership, Ladybug became known not only for its music but also for its community focus, boosting Wilmington’s creative economy, supporting local businesses and creating an inclusive, family-friendly event that remained free and accessible.

I.D.E.A., a 501(c)(3) nonprofit formed in 2024, said it plans to preserve the festival’s core identity while expanding its reach and programming. The organization is best known locally for producing TEDxWilmington and developing youth-focused “edutainment” initiatives across Delaware.
“The success of Ladybug is a direct result of Gayle Dillman’s vision and the dedication of the team she built over more than a decade,” said Jamie Kleman, board chairwoman of I.D.E.A. “We are deeply inspired by what they created and mindful of the responsibility that comes with stewarding something so meaningful to the community.”
Kleman said the nonprofit’s role is not to reinvent the festival, but to build carefully on the foundation already in place.
“Our work begins with honoring Gayle and her team — their values, their standards, and their belief in women artists,” she said. “Our goal is to support and extend that legacy in a way that stays true to the spirit of Ladybug.”
I.D.E.A. said it is committed to keeping the festival women-led, free to the public, and rooted in Wilmington, with Market Street remaining the heart of the event.
Looking ahead, the organization plans to expand Ladybug beyond a single-day festival into a broader, multi-day experience that includes workshops, artist development programs, entrepreneurship sessions, and community events. The group also plans to introduce year-round Ladybug-branded concerts and programs in other Delaware communities, including Middletown, Milford, Newark and Dover.
Longer-term plans include regional and national expansion, with pop-up festivals, college partnerships, and touring showcases designed to extend Ladybug’s mission beyond Delaware.
Since its debut, Ladybug has positioned itself as more than a concert series, becoming a platform for women’s empowerment and creative entrepreneurship while fostering a strong sense of community pride in Wilmington.
“Ladybug belongs to the community that Gayle and her team helped build,” Kleman said. “Our commitment is to protect what makes this festival special — keeping it free, keeping it women-led, and keeping Wilmington at its heart — while thoughtfully carrying it forward.”
Additional details about the 2025 festival, including dates and programming, are expected to be announced in the coming months.

(Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images)A new citizen’s initiative is looking to roll back recreational cannabis use in Maine. 
Maine has allowed for prescribing and limited possession of medical marijuana since 1999, and a successful 2009 referendum established licensed and regulated medical dispensaries. Then, in 2016, Maine voters approved recreational use, retail sale and taxation of cannabis, which the state also refers to as adult use.
However, a newly proposed ballot referendum wants to do away with the commercial cultivation, sale, purchase and manufacture of cannabis starting Jan. 1, 2028. However, it would still allow for personal use and possession of up to 2.5 ounces. 
Colin Mack of Brunswick is listed as the lead petitioner on the Secretary of State’s website; however, he did not respond to a request from Maine Morning Star for comment.
The proposal would also create a streamlined process for people currently licensed under the recreational use program to switch to the medical program and sell any existing recreational products to medical use participants. 
The petition will need about 68,000 signatures by early February to make it onto the 2026 ballot. The number of signatures required represents 10% of the total votes cast in the last gubernatorial election in 2022.
Rep. David Boyer (R-Poland), who led the successful 2016 campaign to legalize recreational cannabis, called the petition “shortsighted.” Pointing to research that has found cannabis to be less addictive than alcohol, Boyer said the state’s adult use program has helped Maine’s economy by bringing in tax revenue and creating jobs. 
“How do you put the toothpaste back in the bottle? These Mainers have invested their blood, sweat and tears in these adult use businesses. A lot of them were medical, made that shift to adult use or maybe do both markets. We’re going to put them out of business?” Boyer said.
Since 2021, the adult use retail cannabis program has grown from nearly $82 million in annual sales to more than $243 million in sales last year, according to data provided by the state’s Office of Cannabis Policy. 
There are 180 licensed adult use stores throughout the state, compared to 86 medical dispensaries.
In addition to funneling use back into the medical program, the initiative also wants to create testing and tracking requirements for the medical use cannabis program to detect any harmful contaminants in the cannabis or cannabis products. 
Boyer said these regulations would be “overly burdensome.”
The adult use program already tests for six categories of contaminants. For every 50 samples that were tested in the third quarter this year, about three of them were found to have at least one contaminant exceeding the level permitted in statute.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/marijuana-1.jpeg,,,2025-12-12 11:57:20.107625

New data from the Pew Research Center found only 17% of Americans believe that what the government does is right either “just about always” or “most of the time,” hitting one of the lowest points Pew has seen since first asking this question in 1958. And according to a DataHaven survey, Connecticut residents trust the federal government less than state or local institutions.
While these are some of the lowest polling numbers seen in American history, national trust in the federal government has been on the decline for decades. Public trust initially dropped in the 1960s and ’70s during the Vietnam War from a near 80% but began rising again in the 1980s into the early ’90s. Trust peaked again after 9/11 before falling.
The DataHaven survey found that of all Connecticut residents surveyed, only 9% trust the federal government “a great deal” to look out for the best interests of them and their family. About 28% trust the federal government “a fair amount.”
Federal government trust among Connecticut residents was at its highest in 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic, when the federal stimulus programs and child tax credit were active.
The DataHaven survey also asked about trust in local and state government. Connecticut residents generally trust these institutions more than they trust the federal government, the survey found.
Trust in the local governments was higher than trust in both state and federal, with 67% of residents surveyed trusting their local government “a great deal” or “a fair amount.”
And when it came to state government, 61% of residents trust the state “a great deal” or “a fair amount.”

With two-thirds of U.S. caregivers struggling to manage both employment and home duties, experts say planning, boundaries, and support can prevent burnout.
For thousands of Delawareans, caring for an aging or ill loved one is among the most meaningful roles they will ever take on — and also one of the most demanding. The constant pull of work obligations, family responsibilities, and the daily needs of someone who depends on you can feel like a relentless juggling act.
According to a recent AARP and S&P Global survey, 67% of family caregivers say they are struggling to manage both work and care, often feeling stretched thin and unsure how to stay ahead of it all. Many caregivers routinely experience stress, guilt, frustration, sadness, and emotional exhaustion, becoming overwhelmed by the daily decisions and responsibilities that caregiving requires.
This article — the sixth in a continuing series on the caregiver’s experience — explores practical strategies for balancing competing pressures while protecting your own well-being. Insights from national research and guidance from Delaware Hospice, Oasis Senior Care (a leading consultant for families), and Easterseals Delaware & Maryland’s Eastern Shore underscore a central message: you don’t have to do this alone, and thriving — not just surviving — is possible.
At Home: Building a Support System That Works
Caregiving is rarely meant to be a one-person job, even though many caregivers feel forced into that role. Experts recommend stepping back and making a clear-eyed assessment of what your loved one truly needs — and what tasks might be shared.
Seek Support and Share the Load
Delaware Hospice encourages caregivers to begin by listing daily and weekly care needs and identifying which tasks can realistically be delegated. That may mean asking a sibling to handle financial paperwork, a neighbor to assist with transportation, or hiring part-time in-home support.
When family members live far away or cannot provide hands-on care, asking them to share in financial support — such as covering a few hours of respite care — can significantly reduce stress.
When others offer help, be specific. Instead of a general response, try:“Can you come over Tuesday at noon to help with lunch?”
Clear requests make it easier for others to step in meaningfully.
Prepare for the Unexpected
Health changes, sudden hospital trips, and equipment malfunctions are part of the caregiving reality. Preparing in advance reduces panic when emergencies arise.
Experts recommend:


Keeping medical, legal, and financial documents up to date


Creating a list of trusted helpers for home maintenance or repairs


Maintaining a folder with medications, emergency contacts, and care instructions


When the unexpected happens, preparation allows for calmer decisions and greater peace of mind.
Protect Your Own Health
Caregivers often put themselves last — yet burnout is one of the greatest risks. Even small, scheduled breaks can help reset both body and mind.
Think of self-care as a daily practice, not a luxury:


A 20-minute walk


Quiet reading before bed


Stretching or light exercise


Time with a pet or favorite hobby


Take time to truly enjoy that cup of coffee or tea — not while multitasking, but simply being present.
Crystal Baynard, of Easter Seals also recommends scheduling time for yourself — daily, weekly, or monthly.  “As a caregiver myself and someone who works for the Easterseals Community Outreach Program, my personal thoughts on caregiving support what you already have written.  Most caregivers fully devote themselves to the role of supporting and providing for their loved one. Having connections of their own by socializing with friends or family, finding the right support group, and not ignoring signs stress or burnout are critical to the journey,” insists Baynard. 
Caregivers are also encouraged to resist the urge to be “perfect.” No one can maintain an immaculate home, a full-time career, a perfectly stocked pantry, and be a caregiver — all at once. It is neither realistic nor necessary.
Equally important: do not compare your situation to others. Every caregiving journey is unique. Guilt over what hasn’t been accomplished only adds unnecessary weight.
At Work: Communicating Clearly and Knowing Your Rights
Balancing employment alongside caregiving is a major source of stress, but open communication and workplace flexibility can make a meaningful difference.
Talk With Your Employer
Experts say transparency can prevent misunderstandings about performance, attendance, or availability. Many workplaces offer options such as:


Flexible or adjusted hours


Remote or hybrid schedules


Extended lunch breaks for caregiving tasks


Employee Assistance Programs


A conversation with an HR representative may reveal benefits or accommodations you didn’t realize were available.
Inform and Lean on Colleagues
Letting coworkers know about your caregiving role can remove stigma and reduce misperceptions about commitment. It may also open the door to informal support — many colleagues are navigating caregiving responsibilities themselves.
Know Your Legal Protections
If your workplace has 50 or more employees, you may qualify for unpaid, job-protected leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA).Additionally, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) protects caregivers from discrimination, including being passed over for promotions because of family responsibilities.
Understanding these protections allows caregivers to manage their responsibilities without fear of risking their job or career progress.
Managing Stress: Tools and Techniques for Long-Term Balance
Caregiving stress is not only emotional — it affects physical health, decision-making, and relationships. Chronic stress can lead to serious health issues. Recognizing warning signs and lowering stress early can improve overall well-being.
Time Management and Organization
Digital tools and simple routines can bring structure to chaotic days:


Use shared calendars such as Google Calendar or Outlook


Try caregiving apps like CareZone for medication tracking and reminders


Group similar tasks together to conserve mental energy


Breaking large responsibilities into smaller, achievable steps helps reduce overwhelm.
Mindfulness and Mental Health
Practices such as deep breathing, meditation, journaling, or creative hobbies provide valuable emotional release.Professional counseling and caregiver support groups — both virtual and in person — offer coping strategies and reassurance that you are not alone.
Caregiver support groups, in particular, help reduce isolation by connecting people facing similar challenges. Many caregivers say others don’t fully understand their experience unless they, too, are caregivers. Local groups meet both in person and online to maximize access.
Stay Connected
Isolation is one of the hidden challenges of caregiving. Maintaining social connections — even brief ones — combats loneliness and restores perspective.
Acknowledge Your Limits
Fatigue, irritability, sadness, or withdrawal are common signs of burnout. Delaying help only worsens these conditions. Caregivers who recognize their limits and reach out early are better equipped to sustain care over the long term.
The Takeaway: You Can’t Pour from an Empty Cup
Lynn Paxson of Oasis Senior Advisors of Delaware reminds caregivers that balancing work, family, and caregiving is not about perfection. It’s about creating routines, setting boundaries, asking for help, and recognizing that caregiving will never be one-size-fits-all.
Caregivers who plan ahead, seek support, and prioritize their own health are better able to provide compassionate, consistent care for those they love.
This series will continue to explore issues facing caregivers, including financial planning, navigating difficult emotions, using respite services, and preparing for later stages of care.
If you are a caregiver, remember: you are doing one of the hardest — and most important — jobs there is. And you don’t have to do it alone.And if you know a caregiver, reach out — and help them understand that support is available.

(Reworld application to Unified Government of Wyandotte County planning commission)TOPEKA — A global industrial waste company that sought to open a recycling facility in a historic Kansas City, Kansas, neighborhood withdrew its plans after organized opposition from environmental activists and community advocates.
Reworld, which manages industrial waste and converts it into energy, honed in on the city’s Armourdale neighborhood for its new processing facility and said four months ago it was “excited” to work in the Kansas City community.
But the company quietly withdrew its petition Nov. 10, before it was set to meet again with the Unified Government of Wyandotte County’s planning commission. Company representatives had billed the facility as positive economic development and a sustainable waste management initiative that redirected waste from aging landfills.
Concern from Armourdale residents and environmental activists arose when Reworld representatives did not address potential flood risks, traffic volumes and health effects.
“This win belongs to the people,” said Beto Lugo Martinez, executive director of the local environmental group RiSE4EJ.
The opposition effort involved neighbors who spoke at public meetings, translated messages, posted flyers, gathered signatures, counted trucks and made calls, he said.
“It’s proof that grassroots power works and that when communities come together, we can protect our health, our air and our future,” Lugo Martinez said.
The city-county planning commission delayed its decision on Reworld’s requested special use permit in August until the company addressed some of the neighbor’s concerns.
The company was set to go before the commission the same day it withdrew its plans.
Linda Ribakusky, a spokesperson for Reworld said in a statement: “Reworld has withdrawn its application for the proposed Kansas City material processing facility because of changing business circumstances.”
“Reworld remains committed to driving innovation in resource recovery,” she said.
The Armourdale neighborhood, which used to be its own city, sits near the Missouri border and is surrounded on all sides by the Kansas River, highways and an interstate. It has become a home to a significant Spanish-speaking population along with industrial development.

(Photo by Anne-Marie Caruso/New Jersey Monitor)Two New Jersey lawmakers have proposed a bill that would extend new tax breaks to New Jersey diners in a bid to counter post-pandemic slowdowns and inflation.
The bill, dubbed the “Saving Our Diners and Protecting Our Past Act,” would exempt qualifying diners from New Jersey’s sales tax and create new tax credits for the state’s historic diners and other restaurants. It is sponsored by Sen. Paul Moriarty (D-Gloucester) and Assemblyman Lou Greenwald (D-Camden).
“They’re kind of the history and culture of many of our communities and kind of a symbol of our state, and I thought we could do something to maybe help them, preserve them, and keep them from closing,” Moriarty said.

The sponsors said diners — something of a cultural hallmark in New Jersey — need the assistance amid rising costs and shifting consumer patterns that have pushed some establishments that have operated for decades to close. Those closures include, among several others, the 58-year-old Cherry Hill Diner, the 38-year-old Townsquare Diner, and the 85-year-old Miss America Diner.
“This does two things: It preserves an institution that New Jersey is known for as part of our historical culture, and it also addresses an issue of affordability, not just for those small business owners, but for their patrons,” said Greenwald, the Assembly’s majority leader.
Even diners that remain operational face challenges, the two men said.
Some that used to operate 24/7 have slimmed their schedules or cut menu offerings, Moriarty said, and others dropped dinner service altogether to help make ends meet.
“There’s one right down the street from where my office is that used to be open seven days a week and have long hours,” Moriarty said. “Now they’re open six days a week, and they’re only open until two in the afternoon.”
The legislation would allow qualifying diners and restaurants that have been operating continuously for at least 25 years — not counting pandemic shutdown interruptions — to apply to be added to an annual registry of historic eateries.
Presence on that registry would exempt them from sales tax levies on sales of food and beverages consumed on site for a year, and they could renew that exemption by reapplying to the registry annually.
Restaurants and diners on the registry could also obtain two non-refundable tax credits worth up to $25,000 each.
Those credits, which would be applied to gross income tax and corporate business tax bills, would equal 10% of an eatery’s spending on ingredients used for meals or drinks, to a cap of $25,000.
To be eligible for the tax breaks, diners and restaurants must be small businesses under federal law. Restaurants can only obtain the exemptions and tax credits if they are family-owned.
The bill is not expected to pass during the current legislative session, which ends in mid-January, Moriarty said. That means diners and restaurants would have to wait until at least Jan. 1, 2027, to take advantage of the bill’s exemption and credits, if it becomes law.
Assemblyman Lou Greenwald (Hal Brown for New Jersey Monitor)
It’s not clear how much the exemption and tax credits will cost the state in foregone revenue. The nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services has not yet completed a fiscal note to estimate its costs. Greenwald suggested the tax breaks would not overstrain state coffers.
“This is not going to break the bank. I think if you look at what it can generate by the rejuvenation of people going to these landmarks, as well as maybe new and young restaurant owners who want to come in and take over some of these businesses, I think it can create a stimulus of the economy,” he said.
Moriarty said he expects hundreds of diners and restaurants to qualify for a spot on the registry and its tax benefits, though it’s not clear how many of them would qualify for the full value of the tax credits by spending at least $250,000 on ingredients.
Businesses on the registry that cannot use the full value of their tax credits in a given year because they would reduce their tax liability below zero or statutory minimums, in the case of the corporate business tax, can apply them to taxes billed in up to seven future years.
They could also trade or sell those tax credits to other firms, which could apply them to income tax bills in up to three future years, or six future years for corporate tax bills.

Mike DeWine said Thursday he will sign a bill into law that will ban intoxicating hemp products and make various changes to the voter-passed marijuana law from 2023, including new criminal provisions.
“No longer will it be the Wild, Wild West,” DeWine said to reporters during an event Thursday morning. “At least we’ll have some regulation of the juiced-up hemp that is there. So, to me, that’s a major, major victory.”

Ohio Senate Republicans lawmakers passed Ohio Senate Bill 56 earlier this week, sending the bill to DeWine’s desk. If DeWine signs the bill into law before the new year, it could take effect as soon as March. 
This comes after DeWine has been urging Ohio lawmakers to regulate or ban delta-8 THC products since January 2024. 
Intoxicating hemp products are items that contain THC that are sold anywhere other than licensed marijuana dispensaries including gas stations, smoke shops, and CBD stores, among others. 
“It was a long time coming, but it’s a major victory,” DeWine said. “(Kids) won’t be able to have juiced-up, hemp gummies, and you won’t be able to walk into a gas station and let an 11-year-old go buy the stuff. That, to me, is the most important part of the bill.”
Children’s safety was DeWine’s biggest concern with intoxicating hemp products.
The Ohio Poison Control Center reported in January 2024 that there had been at least 257 reports of delta-8 poisoning in Ohio in recent years — including 102 in 2023 and 40 that involved children under six-years-old. 
DeWine tried to take matters into his own hands earlier this year when he announced a 90-day executive order that banned the sale of intoxicating hemp products.
The executive order started on Oct.14, but a Franklin County Court of Common judge placed a temporary restraining order on DeWine’s ban through January. The next hearing in this case is scheduled for Jan. 29.
Ohio S.B. 56 complies with recent federal changes by banning intoxicating hemp products from being sold outside of a licensed marijuana dispensary. 
Congress voted to ban products that contain 0.4 milligrams of total THC per container when they voted to reopen the government. Previously, the 2018 Farm Bill said hemp can be grown legally if it contains less than 0.3% THC.
There is a one-year implementation delay for the federal hemp ban, but states can create their own regulatory framework before then.
The Ohio bill also allows five milligram THC beverages to be manufactured, distributed, and sold until Dec. 31, 2026. 
Ohio state Sen. Steve Huffman, R-Tipp City, originally introduced the bill, which also makes changes to Ohio’s marijuana law. 
It would reduce the THC levels in adult-use marijuana extracts from a maximum of 90% down to a maximum of 70%, cap THC levels in adult-use flower to 35%, and prohibit smoking in most public places. 
Part of the probable cause portions were removed from the bill, but some of it still remains. 
The bill prohibits possessing marijuana in anything outside of its original packaging and criminalizes bringing legal marijuana from another state back to Ohio. 
Ohio S.B. 56 would also give 36% of adult-use marijuana sale revenue to municipalities and townships that have recreational marijuana dispensaries.
Ohioans passed a citizen-initiated law to legalize recreational marijuana in 2023 with 57% of the vote. Sales started in August 2024 and exceeded $702.5 million in the first year. 
When asked about the marijuana portions of the bill, DeWine said he had “not gone through the whole bill.”

Limayem, now president of the University of North Florida, succeeds retiring President Rhea Law amid a broader shakeup statewide of public university presidents. He will be USF’s ninth president.
The contract between Limayem and the Tampa institution is for a five-year term with a base salary of $1.25 million.

“Thank you for the trust and confidence you have placed in me. I’m truly just honored, humble, energized, and just fully aware of the responsibility this confirmation carries,” Limayem said during Friday’s remote Board of Governors meeting, adorned in academic regalia ahead of UNF’s graduation ceremony.
“You have my word that I will lead with transparency, community, and purpose. Every decision I make will be guided by one question: What is best for our students, our faculty, staff, our community, our state, and our country?”
He thanked his UNF colleagues and USF trustees, retelling how he came to America from Tunisia.
“I came to this country from Africa with a very, very modest background because I believed in the power of education to change lives,” he added.
Limayem is one of a few nonpolitical figures to lead state universities under Gov. Ron DeSantis, who’s long-championed his “war on woke” at the higher education level.
Since DeSantis took office, former GOP lawmakers or allies to the governor have assumed university presidencies, including former Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nuñez at FIU, former Education Commissioner and state Sen. Manny Diaz Jr. at UWF, former state Rep. Adam Hasner at FAU, former Education Commissioner and former Senate President Richard Corcoran at New College, and state Board of Education Chair Marva Johnson at FAMU.
Limayem is eligible for a performance bonus of up to 50% of his base salary, putting his cash total at $1.87 million annually before other benefits. 
He will receive $18,000 annually to pay for his car and the university will pay his auto insurance. The university will pay $144,000 annually toward a housing stipend. A one-time moving stipend of $50,000, too. Additionally, Limayem will receive deferred compensation of 25% of base salary.

In February, Law announced she would step down at the conclusion of a presidential search. She spent more than 40 years as a student, volunteer, board member, and president at the institution. 
Limayem leaving his post as president at University of North Florida kicks off a search at that school.
Part of Limayem’s first few months will be navigating a legislative session, which includes DeSantis’ proposal to hand all of USF’s Sarasota-Manatee campus facilities over to New College of Florida.
USF Board of Trustees Chair Will Weatherford, a former Florida House Speaker, chimed in on the governor’s proposal during a trustee meeting Thursday.
“This is a policy matter that’s going to be discussed, debated, and worked through over the coming months of the legislative session. We don’t control the outcome of that discussion, but I also want to say, it’s a process, this is the very beginning of the process,” Weatherford said, going on to add there’s “a lot of ball to be played.”",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/20251021-UCM-Limayem-BOT-Confirmation-3-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-12 10:57:51.532386

The state is hoping to put a stop to the turnover through proposed rules that will be open for public comment starting Monday through Jan. 14. 
Regulators first introduced the rules last December and have since held two opportunities for public input, before submitting them to the Missouri Secretary of State in November.
The microbusiness program — sometimes called the social-equity cannabis program — was designed to boost opportunities in the industry for people in disadvantaged communities that have been most impacted by the war on drugs. It began in 2023, after passing as part of the constitutional amendment to legalize recreational marijuana in 2022.
For the last two years, The Independent has documented a pattern of well-connected groups and individuals flooding the microbusiness lottery by recruiting people to submit applications and then offering them contracts that limit their profit and control of the business. 
Of the 105 microbusiness licenses issued so far, 35 have been revoked, including 22 that involved contracts drafted by St. Louis-based Armstrong Teasdale law firm.
Missouri lawyer for cannabis trade group behind contracts tied to revoked licenses

In order to prevent the continued cascade of revocations, the Missouri Division of Cannabis Regulation is proposing to adjust when its extensive application-review period occurs. The point when regulators would review questionable contracts would take place before the license is issued, instead of afterwards as it is now.
The rules would also be changed to clarify that “owners, agents or representatives” of a microbusiness application or license that regulators have denied or revoked would be prohibited from holding a voting or financial interest in any other microbusiness license.
The designated-contact role was envisioned as a way to ensure clear communication between the state and licensees. However, regulators found in their investigations that designated contacts have kept the actual eligible applicants in the dark about business and license dealings. The new rules would require the designated contact for a microbusiness applicant to be a majority owner of the microbusiness license.  
According to court documents, some applicants of the revoked licenses told regulators they were going to be “one of three managers,” leaving them without majority voting power in the business. And they did not demonstrate they had “a credible intent or ability to be the majority owner and operator” of the business, regulators found.
Under the new rules, “majority owned and operated” would be defined as the eligible individuals who are listed as having majority ownership must have a level of operational control that would be expected of an owner.  
Eligible individuals must have the power to order or direct the management, managers, and policies of the license, enter into agreements on behalf of the license, and otherwise make decisions for the business.
“A purported owner with little to no knowledge, control, agency or decision-making authority in an application or license does not meet the intent or meaning of the” constitutional amendment that created the microbusiness program, according to the press release the division issued when it introduced the rules last year.
Applicants would also be required to take an online training course that addresses predatory practices and funding opportunities.
The division expects to file the final version of rule amendments for formal rulemaking in early 2026, prior to the third round of microbusiness licensing.
 The contracts

An investigation by The Independent in October revealed that the attorney who crafted most contracts at the heart of the recent license revocations also represents the marijuana industry trade group.
Eric Walter is a St. Louis-based attorney who represents the Missouri Cannabis Trade Association and a significant percentage of the state’s cannabis licensees. 
He wrote 22 agreements the state believes would take the microbusiness licenses out of the hands of eligible applicants and put them into the hands of well-connected or out-of-state cannabis investors, according to the administrative appeal case documents obtained by The Independent.
Each of those agreements largely led to the state revoking a microbusiness license issued last year for not meeting the constitutional mandate that the licenses be “majority owned and operated” by eligible applicants.  All but one of the license revocations is being appealed to the Missouri Administrative Hearing Commission. 
To be eligible for a microbusiness license, applicants must meet certain criteria, including income below certain thresholds, having past marijuana offenses or being a disabled veteran.
The contracts written by Walter gave applicants two years to pay back loans that can total up to $2 million. If they couldn’t, they’d have to pay a “break-up fee” of up to $2.5 million or give up ownership of the license transfers to the loan holder, according to the state’s response in several of the appeals. 
“Therefore, the business would likely be unable to generate revenue to pay back the loan,” the state argues in one of the legal filing responding to a revocation appeal. “This leaves them no option but to convert the debt into ownership.”
In most cases, the same people involved in the consulting company that hired Armstrong Teasdale to draw up the contract are also involved in lending the money.
Walter’s law firm and the consulting companies who hired the firm to draw up the agreements have vehemently denied the contracts are predatory, arguing the applicants voluntarily signed them.
“Those documents are all transparent, fair, and compliant with Missouri law, including the Department of Health and Senior Services’ rules,” Jamie Moss, spokeswoman for Walter’s law firm, Armstrong Teasdale, said in an email to The Independent in October.
Under the new rules, regulators will specifically ask for any business agreements related to the license “that affect ownership, control, or financial interests in cannabis operations,” including all management agreements, consulting agreements, partnership agreements, loans, “or other agreements whereby any entities stand to gain financially from the business.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_5798-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-12 10:57:51.532386

Wes Moore (D) vetoed the RENEW Act in May over its cost, but announced Friday that he will allocate nearly the same amount of money to achieve the same goals as in the bill. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Gov. Wes Moore (D) will announce Friday that he is allocating nearly $500,000 to study the costs of climate change in the state — just months after he cited cost concerns as he vetoed a bill to spend almost the same amount of money for the same study.
Friday’s expected announcement comes just days before a special legislative session Tuesday, when lawmakers are expected to consider overriding Moore’s veto of the RENEW Act — for Responding to Emergency Needs From Extreme Weather — which included the climate study.
“While the federal government has spent the past year rolling back climate protections and driving up energy costs, Maryland is taking a responsible step toward understanding the true price tag of climate damage,” Moore wrote in a news release Friday.
The bill was part of a larger effort by climate activists in Maryland and across the country to eventually require large fossil fuel companies to compensate states for the effects of climate change, including flooding and extreme heat.
The study Moore is funding, which will be administered by the comptroller’s office, will also evaluate any potential impact to taxpayers if fossil fuel companies are compelled to make compensatory payments to the state. A final report is due by Dec. 1, 2026 — the same deadline as in the vetoed legislation.
It is not clear whether legislators will still pursue an override of the RENEW Act veto, bill sponsor David Fraser-Hidalgo (D-Montgomery) said.
Report: Climate change imperils toxic sites across Chesapeake Bay region

“At the end of the day, I’m just excited to get going on the study,” Fraser-Hidalgo said. “I’ve been working on a version of this bill for five, going on six, years so I’m just excited to move the ball forward.”
Maryland isn’t alone in considering so-called “Make Polluters Pay,” or “climate Superfund” legislation. New York and Vermont have already passed legislation that will ultimately charge fossil fuel firms for a portion of climate damages. In New York, the tab is $75 billion over the next 25 years. Earlier this year, the Trump administration sued both states, challenging the laws, and those cases are ongoing.
In May, Moore shocked lawmakers when he vetoed a variety of studies, including one evaluating slavery reparations for African American Marylanders and another looking into the potential impacts of large-scale data centers in the state.
“Our current budget situation requires us to reconsider bills that create expensive and labor intensive studies,” Moore wrote in a veto letter about the climate study. “While such bills can be a first step to addressing complex issues and allow the signaling of support for an issue, the practice has become so commonplace that it is now a significant financial and staff burden on the state government.”
Since May, when the bill was vetoed, the administration has been able to secure a $30,000 grant from the Rockefeller Family Fund for the climate study. The remaining $470,000 will come from the state’s Strategic Energy Investment Fund over the next two fiscal years, according to the governor’s office. The vetoed bill would have pulled all $500,000 from the SEIF in fiscal 2026.
“Governor Moore has maintained that Maryland doesn’t have to choose between a green economy and a growing economy,” said Moore spokesperson Rhyan Lake. “By leveraging both philanthropic funding and existing state funding sources over two fiscal years to fully fund this study at no expense to Maryland taxpayers, Governor Moore is continuing to take action on climate and build a more sustainable Maryland.”
When Moore vetoed the RENEW bill, climate advocates were shocked, noting that the administration had not previously voiced opposition to the bill. Mike Tidwell, founder of the Chesapeake Climate Action Network, called the move “unforgivable.”
But it’s possible that Moore’s about-face will help him to make amends, as Annapolis gears up for its next full legislative session on Jan. 14.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“Maryland suffered devastating losses this summer due to climate change. From extreme flooding to heat deaths, the impacts of climate change are costing Marylanders now,” said Brittany Baker, Maryland director of the Chesapeake Climate Action Network Action Fund. “We appreciate Governor Moore’s commitment to moving the climate costs study forward.”
Rockefeller Family Fund Director Lee Wasserman said the charity — which focuses on climate change, democracy and economic justice for women — supported the RENEW bill and others like it around the country, and was stunned by Moore’s veto.
“These costs are going to be landing on states including Maryland whether they figure out what they look like ahead of time or not, so it’s hard for me to imagine how achieving a greater understanding of the parameters of those costs could possibly be seen as negative,” Wasserman said. “To the contrary, it seems like good governance 101.”
“I’m less surprised that the governor has decided to backtrack, appropriately so, and give the state the opportunity to really practice good governance,” Wasserman said.
Prior studies have endeavored to tabulate bits and pieces of Maryland’s costs from climate change.
In 2024, the Maryland Department of the Environment estimated that it would take $1 billion per year to meet the state’s emissions reduction goals and transition to 100% clean energy. Amid historic budget shortfalls, the state has not allocated that amount to the effort, even though some programs are underway. Under state law, Maryland must reduce the state’s greenhouse gas emissions 60% from 2006 levels, by 2031.
An April report from the comptroller’s office indicated that Maryland experienced 85 natural disasters between 1980 and 2024, at a cost to the state of $10 billion to $20 billion.
Moore calls lawmakers back for long-anticipated special session next week

“Although extreme weather events have always occurred, scientists can now quantify how much more intense and frequent they have become due to climate change,” read the report. “Maryland can use this emerging science to assess the additional expenditures the state is spending due to anthropogenic climate change.”
That report also cited research from the Center for Climate Integrity, which supports climate Superfund bills, that said trying to build a seawall to protect Maryland’s coastlines from rising seas would cost the state $27.4 billion by 2040.
The RENEW study will be done under a memorandum of understanding between the Maryland Energy Administration and the comptroller’s office, the governor’s news release said. Comptroller Brooke Lierman said the report “will build a roadmap for financial resilience in Maryland amid the challenges of climate change.”
Lawmakers raided the SEIF fund for other uses during this year’s legislative session. The fund — which is supposed to be used on energy projects such as solar panels, EV chargers and energy efficiency upgrades for low-income households — was used to fund a roughly $80 energy bill refund for all of the state’s residential customers, and to help correct a massive state budget deficit.
The SEIF is funded in part by “alternative compliance payments” from electricity suppliers who do not meet the state’s renewable energy mandates. It had ballooned in recent years because it was cheaper for suppliers to make the alternative compliance payments than to buy the required renewable energy credits from clean energy generators.
SEIF revenues went from $52,240 in alternative compliance payments in fiscal 2021 to $318 million by fiscal 2024, according to the fund’s most recent annual report.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DSC_4543-1024x681.jpeg,,,2025-12-12 10:57:51.532386

(Justin Garcia/Las Cruces Bulletin)New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez on Thursday filed a brief with the state Public Regulation Commission to oppose the proposed sale of New Mexico Gas Company to a subsidiary of a Louisiana-based private equity firm.
The gas company filed an application last year to be sold for nearly $1.3 billion to private equity firm Bernhard Capital Partners. If approved, Bernhard subsidiary Saturn Utilities Holdco would take over New Mexico Gas Company, which serves more than 500,000 customers in 27 of New Mexico’s 33 counties.
In his PRC filing, Torrez argues that Bernhard’s reliance on short-term investments and private debt could lead to rate hikes; that its “layered corporate structure” poses a threat to transparency; and that its “complex web” of holding companies could thwart regulators’ oversight.
“The proposed acquisition raises real risks of higher rates, reduced transparency, and long-term financial instability for customers across the state,” Torrez said in a statement. “We are urging regulators to deny this application unless there are significant changes made to safeguard ratepayers from unnecessary costs and hidden liabilities.”
If the deal proceeds, Torrez contends that PRC members must enact restrictions on selling utility assets without PRC approval; offer rate credits for low-income customers; require competitive cost analyses before implementing new IT systems; and require funding for a “severe weather reliability fund” to protect ratepayers during hazardous weather.
A spokesperson for Bernhard Capital Partners in an email to Source NM said the firm has been “committed to active participation throughout the regulatory process.”
“Our application includes nearly $87 million in direct benefits to local communities, employees, and organizations. These commitments have been informed by feedback from these same stakeholders throughout the regulatory process,” the spokesperson wrote. “This includes $22 million in rate credits for customers, $7 million to assist families who need help paying their utility bills, and more than $2 million in charitable giving to local nonprofits. We’ve also committed $15 million to advancing community priorities, like economic development, workforce training, and renewable energy projects.”
Torrez is the latest public official to oppose the proposed sale. In November, state Sen. Harold Pope Jr. (D-Albuquerque) and Rep. Matthew McQueen (D-Galisteo) spoke before the commission and took exception to the exclusion of information relating to other companies previously owned by Bernhard Capital Partners’ founder.

Specifically, a 2008 U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General report said FEMA wasted millions by awarding no-bid contracts to the Shaw Group — a firm previously run by Bernhard’s founder — and others. A 2011 report commissioned by state leaders in Louisiana alleged that Shaw appeared to overbill the state by nearly $500,000 for building sand berms along the coastline to prevent oil from the infamous BP spill from washing onto the land.

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images).On Tuesday, a set of Democratic senators introduced a set of policies to incorporate virtual power plants into the state’s energy system. 
Virtual power plants aggregate distributed energy resources, like rooftop solar panels and battery storage, to help meet changes in energy demand. These systems can help circumvent demand for peaker plants, which only run when energy demand is at its highest, and can help even out fluctuations in energy supply generated through wind or solar.
Put forth by Sen. Sue Shink (D-Northfield Township) and Jeff Irwin (D-Ann Arbor, Senate Bill 731 would create the legal framework needed for these facilities to operate, while Senate Bill 732 would instruct the Michigan Public Service Commission – which regulates the state’s energy companies – to establish regulations requiring utility companies to incorporate these resources into their plans for distributing and transmitting energy.
‘Valuable and largely overlooked:’ Interest in virtual power plants grows

If passed, the virtual power plant aggregators and the owners of the energy resources would be compensated for the benefits their systems provide to the energy grid.
“We can’t meet our state’s future energy needs with 20th-century infrastructure,” Shink said in a statement. “This legislation will help us create the flexibility and reliability to rise to modern energy challenges.”
In 2023, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed off on a set of laws to transition the state to clean energy, including requirements for energy companies to meet a 100% clean energy standard by 2040.
The state urgently needs to improve its reliability and move away from energy resources that are driving climate change, Irwin said. 
“We already have resources we can use for this, but they can’t be coordinated in an organized way without the framework this legislation will provide,” Irwin said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/gettyimages-1747382682-1024x705.jpg,,,2025-12-12 10:57:51.532386

(Photo by Guido Mieth/Getty Images)Since my husband and I went public with our family’s story about our son’s severe mental illness, my phone, inbox, and social media messages have been full. People reach out constantly — some looking for help for themselves, others desperate to find treatment for a loved one.
They come from every corner of Iowa, and beyond. Some ask if they can share my contact information with a friend, neighbor, a coworker in crisis or even a constituent. My answer is always yes. I do my best to respond, though I can’t always keep up. I try — because I know how much it means to have someone simply answer.
Sometimes the help is straightforward. I can recommend an access center, a provider, a support program, or a specific contact who might make a difference.
Other times, the conversations are anything but simple. Some callers are angry — furious at a system that has let them down. Some sob uncontrollably. Some ramble through the chaos of their loved one’s illness, and I have to listen carefully to piece together enough information to know where to start.
All of them need to be heard. All of them deserve compassion.
But these stories stay with me. They break my heart. They keep me awake at night. They fill me with rage at the injustice of a system that continues to fail people who are sick, scared, and out of options.
And even as I work with providers and advocates across the state — many of whom are deeply dedicated — it’s hard to hear story after story of people being failed by hospitals, agencies, and professionals we trust to help.
It’s devastating to learn about a young woman who died within days of discharge from a psychiatric hospital — her parents, who were her legal guardians, never even notified that she’d been released. We know suicide risk skyrockets in those first days after hospitalization.
It’s infuriating to hear about a man “streeted” from an emergency department because he was psychotic and using drugs—  drugs that were the only thing quieting the voices in his head — because he couldn’t access real treatment, and just kept being streeted by the people who are supposed to help him.
It’s exhausting to advocate for someone who clearly qualifies for an Assertive Community Treatment program, only to be told he’s “too sick” for admission, even though the program’s own criteria say otherwise.
These calls are constant. They come in frequently. I do what I can to connect people to help:
• Office of Recovery Services: 855-622-4692
• Your Life Iowa: 855-581-8111
• 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline
• Iowa Warm Line: 844-775-9276 (Peer-run, non-crisis, 8 a.m.–2 a.m. CST)
• Treatment Advocacy Center Helpline: 703-951-9760
But the calls I truly dread are the ones that come after someone has been arrested for something they did while in untreated psychosis. Once a person is criminalized for being sick, it becomes so much harder to get them treatment instead of punishment.
There is help and information available through the Treatment Advocacy Center’s guide:
Criminal Legal: When mental illness leads to arrest -TAC and Video.
If you’re one of the people reaching out, please know it’s OK to keep doing so (lcarpenter@iamentalhealth.com). I don’t have all the answers, but I will always try to help, to listen, and to keep pushing for a system that treats people with severe mental illness with dignity and care.
I believe it will get better — but only if more people care enough to speak out, to get involved, and to refuse to accept the way things are.
If you’re ready to be part of that change, I hope you’ll consider signing up for updates from NAMI Iowa ( NAMI Iowa Newsletter Sign Up ) and the Treatment Advocacy Center (TAC Action Center – Treatment Advocacy Center )
Every voice matters—and every call for change helps bring us one step closer to a system that truly helps the people who need it most.

You can read more about the section here.

Growing up in a grocery store in the Arkansas Delta resulted in a part of my DNA being formed with the smell of freshly sliced bologna and the clinking of ice in the ice box that kept drinks cold. One of my favorite memories was standing on a Coke case selling the drinks and baked goods to customers of all ages.
Country stores are mostly memories of bygone days, but in my case, I learned many life lessons spending my preschool years there. My daddy was owner and proprietor of the store that served mostly farm workers, community residents and individuals who used the store as a bus stop for trips to bigger cities like Memphis. In his 50 years running the store, he was familiar with multigenerational families, and many of them considered him family.
Early on, I saw hardworking people going to the fields every day —  rain or shine — with a cotton sack or hoe. Not to be overly dramatic but I knew even then, if you did not eat, you could not be healthy enough to work. I got into the food business before food stamps were a staple.
In the 1950s at our store, the real currency was credit, trust and the monthly payments made by patrons when they were paid. Daddy kept a ticket on each credit customer, and with nothing more than a cigar box and his own accounting system, he maintained meticulous records. I never saw a dispute with a customer.
Life changed over time. The ice box was replaced with a refrigerated cooler, and the Coke box was put away. I was trusted to make change, and my payment for helping out was the chance to play the pinball machine.

By the time I left the community, food stamps and cash were prominent means of payment, even though the monthly credit was still an option to regular customers. The type of food changed as new products were promoted on television and added to the basics.
As I became an adolescent, my days of working at the store were replaced by involvement in school activities. But as I became a young adult schoolteacher, I found myself back there holding a makeshift summer kindergarten on the front porch. With more mature eyes, I saw the place and the people differently.
I knew the popsicle from Mr. Raymond’s store was my drawing card for attendance, and it worked. Children walked to the store accompanied by an older child or adult, while the local elementary school principal and a parent with a car transported those who lived too far away to walk. We learned basic skills to be better prepared for first grade.
As a first-grade teacher, I saw starving children eating as much as they could hold in the school cafeteria. With stomachs bulging, we would return to the classroom to digest and hopefully keep it down. I also saw their parents working for a very low wage and trying to navigate the life they had.
Today, many people assume that children no longer live in food-scarce homes. However, according to Feeding America, for the last 19 years at the county level Mississippi has the highest rate of food insecurity in the country. We deserve the rating.
The minimum wage remains at $7.25 an hour. The most recent report disseminated by the United Ways in Mississippi underscores the depth of the problem. In 2023, based on the Federal Poverty Level (FPL), 19% of Mississippi households were defined as being in poverty.
Yet this measure failed to account for an additional 30% of the state’s households that were also experiencing financial hardship. These households fall into the ALICE: Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed — earning above the FPL, but not enough to afford basic expenses in the county where they live.
Combined, ALICE households and households living in poverty make up an estimated 49% of Mississippi homes below the ALICE Threshold in 2023. This rate placed Mississippi 50th among all states and the District of Columbia with first representing the lowest rate of hardship. Families below this threshold are forced to make impossible choices — like deciding whether to pay for utilities or a car repair, whether to buy food or fill a prescription.
The history of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP helps explain the hardship many Mississippians face today. It began when unemployment was widespread and there was an agricultural surplus.
From the beginning, its purpose was and still is to supplement the income of working-class families and individuals on fixed incomes due to low wages and high costs of living.
Some of today’s most successful men and women participated in the SNAP or the federal supplemental nutrition program for women, infants and children, also known as WIC. 
During my son’s pursuit of a master’s degree in theology, he applied for WIC, which is a cousin to SNAP. With a new baby and only one very fixed-income, WIC was a critical supplement to their budget.
Research clearly demonstrates access to healthful, nutritious food during pregnancy and early childhood is essential for a strong start in life. For babies, good prenatal nutrition helps lay the foundation for healthy brain development supporting learning, behavior and mental health well into adulthood.
A balanced diet also builds stronger immune systems, leading to fewer infections and doctor visits. It is important to Mississippians to lower the risk of obesity, diabetes and heart disease, which all carry high lifetime medical costs and result in missing work. When adults are frequently sick, the workforce becomes less productive, affecting not only families but the state’s overall economic health.
Mississippi consistently has some of the highest food costs in the nation. It can be difficult for Mississippians to afford healthy foods that help their babies grow up healthy. As of July 1, Mississippi has a grocery tax of 5% while 33 states do not have any.
Mississippi continues to struggle with food deserts, where access to full-service grocery stores is limited and reliable transportation is often unavailable. For many families, the only nearby options are gas stations and dollar stores – places where fresh, nutritious food is scarce.
I have no fight with the state auditor or governor if they want to campaign for cutting food stamps to purchase sugary foods. But I do take issue with the growing atmosphere of disrespect toward the working people who rely on these benefits. These families deserve dignity, not judgment.
When the nation was facing a government shutdown earlier this year, Gov. Tate Reeves talked about requesting a waiver to limit the use of food stamps on sugary products such as drinks and candy even though there were questions of whether there would be any SNAP payments at all. He commented that “welfare benefits are a hand-up for those in desperate temporary need.”
The truth is, there was and still is a desperate need across the state for the full SNAP payments disseminated to participants. Yet during the shutdown, Gov. Reeves was not interested in following the strategy Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry implemented. He used Louisiana state emergency funds to allocate $150 million to supplement SNAP during the shutdown.
This contrast reveals a fatal flaw in Mississippi’s leadership. When the weakest link in the chain of productivity breaks or is damaged, the entire system suffers.
Without healthy workers who keep our streets clean, prepare hotel rooms and staff our restaurants, we will have no tourism, no community growth, no strong tax base and no one to train in the highly publicized high-paying jobs coming into our state.
It seems to be a no-brainer.

Holiday Gift Wrapping a gift is more than covering what is inside. It adds anticipation and shows care. A wrapped present feels thoughtful and personal.
Jamie Kleman | Contributing Writer | Delaware Live | December 2025
As the holidays arrive in Delaware, the rolls of wrapping paper, shiny ribbons, and neatly tied bows that show up in homes and stores are more than decoration. They are part of a tradition that carries centuries of history. Today wrapping gifts brings joy to families and adds a special touch to local holiday shopping.
Gift Wrap: From Ancient Utility to Holiday Ritual
The earliest known examples of wrapping gifts date back more than two thousand years in China, when paper was first invented to wrap delicate items. Over time wrapping became a sign of respect and ceremony. In other parts of Asia, families used traditional cloth wrappings such as Japanese furoshiki or Korean bojagi to present meaningful gifts. These pieces of fabric were often handmade and intended to be reused.
In the Western world wrapping developed slowly. For many years gifts were simply tucked into cloth sacks or boxes. By the Victorian era, decorated paper and ribbon began appearing in homes during Christmas and other celebrations. Wrapping became part of the excitement and presentation.
The modern wrapping tradition took shape in the early twentieth century in Kansas City, Missouri, where the Hall Brothers operated a small stationery shop. During the Christmas season of 1917, they ran out of their usual white, red, and green tissue paper. Searching for a substitute, the brothers placed sheets of elegant French envelope lining paper on the counter. Shoppers loved the colorful designs and bought every sheet. Sensing an opportunity, the brothers printed their own decorative paper the following year. This simple improvisation eventually grew into Hallmark and helped launch the gift wrap industry as we know it today. Today patterned paper, ribbon, tags, and gift bags are common during holidays and special occasions.
Why We Still Wrap and Why It Matters
Wrapping a gift is more than covering what is inside. It adds anticipation and shows care. A wrapped present feels thoughtful and personal. For many families in Delaware, it is part of the holiday atmosphere. People choose colors, save matching ribbons, and use handwritten tags to make each package feel special.
Shopping local in Delaware also supports the practice. Small boutiques and independent stores in Wilmington, Newark, Lewes, and Rehoboth often offer gift wrapping for purchases during the holiday season. A beautifully wrapped package from a local shop feels warm and memorable before it is even opened.
Whether you are preparing presents at a kitchen table in Middletown, or carrying wrapped gifts home from a coastal shop, the simple act of wrapping connects generations. It turns giving into an experience that is both personal and joyful. The magic is not only in what is inside the box, but also in the care taken to wrap it.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-12-095330.jpg,,,2025-12-12 10:57:51.532386

A lawsuit filed Thursday claims the U.S. Bureau of Land Management approved ConocoPhillips' winter oil exploration plan without adequately considering damages to habitat used by caribou and other wildlife. (Photo by Bob Wick/U.S. Bureau of Land Management)Environmental and Native organizations on Thursday sued the Trump administration to try to overturn last month’s approval of an expansive oil-exploration program on the North Slope.
The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Anchorage, said the U.S. Bureau of Land Management violated federal laws when it gave the go-ahead to a ConocoPhillips plan for seismic surveys and exploration drilling this winter on federal lands in Arctic Alaska.
ConocoPhillips’ plans call for seismic surveys in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, along with four exploration wells and associated development. The exploration work is planned near ConocoPhillips’ huge Willow project, which is in development, and its Greater Mooses Tooth Unit, which is already producing oil.
The plaintiffs bringing the lawsuit are Sovereign Iñupiat for a Living Arctic, the Center for Biological Diversity and The Wilderness Society. They are represented by the environmental law firm Earthjustice.
The lawsuit argues the approval violates the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act, a 1976 law that mandates environmental protection in the reserve, and the Administrative Procedures Act, which concerns the public process for government decision and actions.
The planned program will cause serious environmental damage that will last for several years, including in areas around Teshekpuk Lake, the North Slope’s biggest lake, and the Colville River, known for its raptor populations and paleontological resources. Previous presidential administrations established protections for those sensitive habitats, including the calving site for the caribou herd named for the lake.
“The record shows the exploration program is likely to cause long-term harm to vegetation and soils that provide crucial habitat to caribou, birds, and a host of other wildlife in the Reserve, including to those within the Teshekpuk Lake and Colville River Special Areas,” the lawsuit said. “The exploration program is also likely to cause population-level impacts to the Teshekpuk Caribou Herd, and long-term harm to subsistent hunters and the communities that rely upon them for food security and health and wellbeing.”
The lawsuit faults the BLM and U.S. Department of the Interior for limiting public information about the proposal and, once the proposal was announced, restricting public comment to a mere seven days before concluding that the exploration work would pose no significant environmental harm.
Both the lack of public information and the conclusion were wrong, the plaintiffs said. In their lawsuit they cited expert testimony from Martha Raynolds, a University of Alaska Fairbanks scientist, who said the seismic program would scar the tundra for more than 15 years.
“The company’s plans would crush sensitive Arctic tundra under 95,000-pound thumper trucks, disrupt caribou migration patterns and destroy our ability to enjoy these magnificent lands,” Matt Jackson, Alaska senior manager for The Wilderness Society, said in a statement. “With an administration bent on ignoring the public, our only choice is to turn to the court to defend these public lands for generations to come and ensure that our rural communities remain free to sustain our Alaskan way of life.”

	Seismic surveys use sound waves to help map underground geologic structures. The work is done with vehicles that crisscross the surface. UAF experts have warned for years about the threats to tundra and permafrost from seismic surveys.
Nauri Simmonds, executive director of Sovereign Iñupiat for a Living Arctic, said the areas targeted for exploration are sensitive and should be protected from development.
“Even among our own Iñupiat relatives who support oil development, there is recognition that some places are too important to risk, too vital to our way of life to be sacrificed. ConocoPhillips’ exploration program is not only an assault on caribou and tundra — it is another chapter in the enfoldment of our people into systems designed to fracture us from within,” she said in the statement.
A spokesperson for the Department of the Interior declined to comment on the lawsuit, citing a policy concerning pending litigation.
Dennis Nuss, a ConocoPhillips spokesperson defended the approvals and criticized the plaintiffs.
“These actions by the same groups that have historically used legal maneuvers to delay exploration and development in the Petroleum Reserve jeopardize hundreds of local jobs and adds unnecessary risk to investment in Alaska,” Nuss said. “We remain confident in the robustness of our plan and BLM’s permits and look forward to completing our work within Alaska’s limited winter exploration season.”
He did not comment on whether ConocoPhillips had started the winter program.
The Willow project, with an estimated 600 million barrels of oil reserves, is expected to start producing oil in 2029. It is slated to be the westernmost producing oil field on the North Slope. The development has been controversial, but its approval by the Biden administration in 2023 has survived legal challenges. Projected revenues to the state from Willow production are now far more modest than previously estimated, according to Alaska Department of Revenue officials.
Production at the Greater Mooses Tooth site started in 2018.

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)Wisconsin’s health department is reaffirming longstanding recommendations that all newborns get a vaccination for hepatitis B.
The Department of Health Services announced Thursday it has sent a memo to Wisconsin vaccination providers about the vaccine.
Ryan Westergaard, M.D., Wisconsin Dept. of Health Services
“DHS continues to recommend that all newborns receive the hepatitis B vaccine within 24 hours of birth, and then go on to complete the standard three-dose series within the first 18 months of life,” said Dr. Ryan Westergaard, chief medical officer in the DHS bureau of communicable diseases, at a media briefing Thursday.
Hepatitis B, a viral infection, can lead to lifelong liver disease, Westergaard said, including cirrhosis and liver cancer.
“Infants and young children are particularly at high risk,” he said. A baby infected with the virus has up to a 90% chance of developing chronic liver disease, he said.
Infants can be exposed during birth or through close contact with adults and caregivers “who may not even know that they carry the virus,” Westergaard added. “That’s why vaccination early in life is so important.”
DHS issued the announcement following a federal shift in vaccine policy, eliminating a recommendation in place since 1991 for newborns to receive the hepatitis B shot. The recommendation was eliminated Dec. 5 in a vote by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
In June, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. replaced all 17 members of the advisory committee with a new group of appointees, many of whom are seen as vaccine skeptics.
CDC vaccine committee overturns decades-old hepatitis B recommendation for newborns

The decision to end the recommendation for all newborns to get the hepatitis B shot dismayed the leaders of  medical organizations, including the American Medical Association and the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.
“For more than 30 years, the hepatitis B vaccine has been used safely and effectively in newborns,” Westergaard said Thursday. Since the 1991 recommendation was put in place, hepatitis B infections in children have declined by 99%, he said.
“This recommendation is grounded in decades of research showing that the vaccine is safe and effective, and it aligns with guidance of the American Academy of Pediatrics and other leading medical groups,” Westergaard said. “So, our message today is straightforward, hepatitis B and its long-term health consequences are preventable. And routine childhood vaccination remains one of our most effective tools we have to protect children’s health and prevent lifelong disease.”
Westergaard said there has been no change in insurance coverage for the vaccine and that the hepatitis B shot remains among the vaccines available through the Vaccine for Children’s program for patients without health insurance.
ACIP also recommended blood testing for antibodies before giving the rest of the hepatitis B series shots for infants and young children, but Westergaard said that recommendation is not supported by scientific evidence.
The presence of hepatitis B antibodies in adults is a good indicator that they are protected against an infection, he said. “There’s no science suggesting that that same strategy works for newborns and children,” he added.

Still, signs of change are emerging.","DON’T PULL THE FIRE ALARM YET, but new data on home insurance in Massachusetts is turning heads across the industry. 
Massachusetts enrolled more than 173,000 policies in its insurer-of-last-resort, known as the FAIR Plan, in fiscal year 2024 — marking the first year-over-year increase for the insurer since 2017 and its largest single-year jump since 2007. In fiscal 2023, the FAIR Plan enrolled 158,660 policies. 
“Insurance numbers like these are the canary in the coal mine,” said Charlie Sidoti, a former insurance executive who now serves as executive director of the Cambridge-based nonprofit Innsure, which works with insurers and communities navigating climate risk. “It leads to all sorts of other things — property values dropping, tax bases eroding — which puts financial pressure on municipalities. Ultimately, it could lead to declines in bond ratings. It’s an early, leading indicator of the impacts of climate change flowing through the economy.” 
Insurers around the country are adjusting to a warming world, rising seas, and more costly extreme weather events by canceling policies, issuing nonrenewal notices, and raising premiums in risky areas — and in some cases, exiting states altogether. The trend is creating massive disruptions in homeowners’ ability to afford and access insurance — which provides a crucial backstop in case disaster strikes — and threatens to negatively impact property values.  
Massachusetts, officials and experts stressed, is in a much better place than other parts of the country. The state has a robust market with a number of private insurers offering coverage, though prices have surged throughout New England. And it isn’t suffering from an onslaught of disastrous hurricanes or wildfires like in Florida or California. 
Still, signs of change are emerging.  
The latest data showing the FAIR Plan increases, from the state insurance commissioner’s recently-released annual report, comes on the heels of Massachusetts’s having the fifth-highest nonrenewal rate in the country in 2023, according to a congressional investigation. That nonrenewal rate is driven by areas most vulnerable to severe storms: In Barnstable County, 1 in 16 policies weren’t renewed in 2023. In Dukes County, it’s 1 in 9. 
Statewide, there were 3,483 policy nonrenewals in 2022, 1,300 of which were in coastal areas, according to the state division of insurance. The very next year, that number jumped to 9,248, including a more than tripling of nonrenewals in coastal areas. By 2024, total nonrenewals grew again to more than 13,000.  
Though there are a few factors explaining the increase in FAIR Plan enrollees in 2024, the high nonrenewal rates in 2023 likely drove some homeowners to the state’s insurer-of-last-resort. Insurance Commissioner Michael Caljouw’s report found that 14 out of the top 25 insurance companies in the state implemented measures over the past five years “that were intended to reduce their exposure to climate-related risks,” including by reducing coverage in areas near the coast.  
Chris Stark, executive director of the Massachusetts Insurance Federation, said that global reinsurers — companies that provide insurance for insurance companies — sought to offload some of their riskier policies in the wake of mounting losses for several consecutive years from natural disasters around the world. Massachusetts, a state in which it’s expensive to rebuild, has seen the number of heavy downpours increase 71 percent between 1958 and 2010. 
About 4 in 10 homes on Cape Cod and the islands are now insured through the FAIR Plan — up from 33 percent in 2023. That represents the highest rate for the region since 2017. The coastal Bristol and Plymouth counties, together with the Cape and islands, accounted for about 51 percent of all FAIR Plan policies in 2020. Now, those regions have about 55 percent of all FAIR Plan enrollees after modest upticks in each of the past five years.  
“Over the years, we’ve morphed from primarily an urban plan to now a coastal plan,” said Frank O’Brien, the FAIR Plan’s general counsel.  
Such a change has consequences for the severity of risks and damages for which the plan has to contend.  
“It’s just a huge concentration of risk that’s ultimately backstopped by the taxpayers of the Commonwealth,” said Andrew Gottlieb, executive director of the Association to Preserve Cape Cod. “And depending on the size of the next catastrophe, that may not be feasible. It’s going to be a burden on the state’s budget.” 
Other changes aside from the nonrenewal rates may have led to the increase in FAIR Plan policies. Rising home insurance prices in the private market driven by climate risk and high rebuilding costs due to inflation and tariffs have made the FAIR Plan look more financially attractive, especially to lower and moderate-income households, Stark said. The FAIR Plan hasn’t raised rates since 2006.  
FAIR Plans sprung up around the country in the 1960s in response to, at the time, rioting in American cities that exploded into mushrooming property damages and losses, with Massachusetts’s plan established in 1968. In more recent decades, though, these plans increasingly became focused on properties vulnerable to extreme weather events, like floods that damaged basements and high winds that tore through roofs, as private insurers raised rates and pulled coverage from these areas.  
The Massachusetts FAIR Plan writes its own coverage policies and collects premiums, but it also has the ability levy an assessment against private insurers when massive losses stack up. An assessment, which needs approval from the state insurance division, would force private insurance companies in the state to pay the FAIR Plan money to meet its claims and continue providing coverage. 
While one year of insurance data may be enough to raise eyebrows, it’s not yet prompting a panic.  
There have been more FAIR Plan policies in the past than there are today. In fiscal year 2007, there were about 204,000 policies overall in Massachusetts, compared with the roughly 173,000 last year, and when Superstorm Sandy hit in 2012, there were about 10,000 more policies on Cape Cod than there are now.  
While every Massachusetts county experienced year-over-year growth in FAIR Plan policies between 2023 and 2024 — Worcester saw the largest, a 25 percent spike — the fact that the number of policies statewide has remained roughly between 150,000 and 200,000 for two decades is a testament to the state’s “robust” home insurance market, Stark said. 
Massachusetts’s FAIR Plan also isn’t nearly as strained as plans in other states are. Texas’ insurer-of-last-resort doubled its exposure from $113 million to $237 million and added 41,000 policies just between 2023 and 2024 alone. California’s FAIR Plan, meanwhile, doubled both in policies and the value of properties it insures between 2023 and 2025 as private insurers fled the state following devastating wildfires. 
And the rise in FAIR Plan policies in the Northeast last year wasn’t confined to the Bay State. Neighboring New York and Rhode Island saw FAIR Plan increases in 2024 by 7 and 19 percent, respectively, compared to Massachusetts’s 9 percent growth.  
“It was disturbing to see this pretty significant spike,” said Jonathan Schreiber, associate vice president of state government relations at the American Property Casualty Insurance Association. “But this is one year, so we need more data to understand if this is a new trend. Climate change is certainly here to stay, but there are other economic factors that hopefully can improve, as well as steps communities and individual homeowners can take to mitigate climate risk.” 
Now that private insurers have made moves to rebalance their risk portfolios, Stark is hopeful that the 2024 growth in FAIR Plan policies proves to be more of a blip and that the market will stabilize in the years ahead. 
“We’re not Louisiana or Florida or California in terms of what the homeowners insurance market is looking like right now,” Stark said. “But we also don’t want to see this trend of year-over-year growth in the FAIR Plan continue.” 
Despite the relative health of the Massachusetts home insurance market, the thought of a catastrophic storm battering the Bay State’s shores — something it has largely avoided in recent history — still keeps insurance experts on guard, particularly with the FAIR Plan increasingly exposed on the coast. O’Brien said it’s unlikely at this time that the FAIR Plan would need to issue an assessment to pay claims should damages pile up following such a severe storm. 
“However, we’re weather-dependent. That’s the business of insurance,” O’Brien said. “You hope for the best, you plan for the worst, and at the end of the day, we’re taking on a risk that people can’t take on by themselves, so you just try to be prepared.” 
The new data is prompting some to think about the mission of the FAIR Plan in the first place. Dominick Dusseau, research associate at the Falmouth-based Woodwell Climate Research Center, said the plan in some ways is trying to serve conflicting purposes: be both an insurer of last resort for homeowners rejected by the private market and provide affordable coverage.  
When the FAIR Plan is competitive with private insurers, people will flock there, forcing the private market to spread risk over fewer people, raise rates, and reduce their coverage in certain areas — fueling a cycle that could push more people into the FAIR Plan, especially in the state’s most vulnerable areas, he said. A devastating storm could increase the potential for an assessment, which private insurers would pass on to their customers.  
“It’s a scary thought,” Dusseau said. 
Still, Dusseau said the state is doing a decent job at striking that balance given the number of private insurers still offering coverage in Massachusetts. And he credited the FAIR Plan’s coverage cap of $1 million per home as an effective tool at keeping its potential exposures in check, given the otherwise high cost of rebuilding some of the more lavish properties dotting the coast.  
But the future impacts of climate change will test the state’s insurance system and have implications for where and how to build for decades to come. 
“Like a lot of things that were developed to respond to one set of circumstances, the FAIR Plan is not necessarily so well-tuned to apply to the rapidity of change that we’re seeing in climate and the huge increases in risk profile,” said Gottlieb of the Association to Preserve Cape Cod. “What you’ve got happening here is a massive shifting of the risk and the cost associated with remediating the risk when the storm hits to the public sector.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Flooding5.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-12 09:57:55.764737

(Photo by Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)A day after the Indiana Senate rejected President Donald Trump’s contentious mid-decade redistricting proposal, warnings of political and financial retaliation escalated — including public threats that the Hoosier State could lose federal funding as punishment for GOP senators’ refusal to approve the new congressional map.
The Republican-controlled state Senate voted 31-19 on Thursday to defeat the redistricting bill — a measure Trump and others had pushed for months as a way to carve Indiana’s congressional map to potentially yield two additional Republican seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.
In a rare rebuke of Trump from within his own party, 21 of Indiana’s Republican senators joined all 10 Democrats in voting down the proposal, ensuring it can’t be revived until the 2027 session. Nineteen GOP senators voted in favor of the bill.
The outcome was met with fierce criticism from state and national Republican leaders who helped drive the effort. 
Comments came from Trump, Gov. Mike Braun and national GOP leadership signaled potential retaliation against lawmakers who broke ranks.
Reactions From Washington
Minutes after the vote, U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson addressed reporters at the U.S. Capitol, pushing back on the notion that Thursday’s result reflected a weakening of Trump’s influence. 
Johnson said the Indiana vote was “inconsequential to that” and insisted the GOP will prevail in next year’s midterm elections, regardless of how individual states vote.
He also refuted suggestions that Trump is a “lame duck,” calling him “the most powerful president of this generation and many others,” and downplayed the Indiana effort, saying the president “did not put in a major pressure campaign for it.”
Senate Republicans reject Trump’s plea for gerrymandered maps

“He let his opinion be known — as he does on everything all the time, all day long. We win some, we lose some,” Johnson continued. “We’re going to win on whatever maps are presented. … “I’m very bullish. I’m more bullish today than I was yesterday.”
Trump and White House officials had numerous calls with Senate Republicans and Vice President JD Vance traveled to Indiana twice to push the effort.
Trump himself, speaking from the Oval Office, lamented the rejection of Indiana’s proposed map and targeted Senate leadership. The president specifically named Republican Senate Pro Tem Rodric Bray, who voted against the measure and said repeatedly in recent months that too few GOP senators supported the mid-decade redistricting for it to pass.
“You had one gentleman, the head of the Senate, I guess Bray, whatever his name is … He’ll probably lose his next primary, whenever that is,” Trump said, adding that Indiana’s Republican Senate “has done a tremendous disservice.” 
“I’ll certainly support anybody that wants to go against him,” he added. 
The president also asserted that his strong electoral performance in Indiana should have translated into support for his redistricting push.
“It’s funny, because I won Indiana all three times by a landslide, and I wasn’t working on it very hard. It would have been nice. I think we would have picked up two seats if we did that,” he continued. “(Indiana) is a great place. I love the people there, they love me. We won in a landslide all three times. I got tremendous votes — record votes. … There’s no reason for (not redistricting).”










I’ll certainly support anybody that wants to go against him.

On social media, Trump’s allies and conservative advocacy groups amplified the pressure. 
Heritage Action — the advocacy and lobbying arm of The Heritage Foundation, a Washington, D.C.-based conservative think tank — posted just hours before the vote that “if the Indiana Senate fails to pass the map, all federal funding will be stripped from the state. Roads will not be paved. Guard bases will close. Major projects will stop.”
Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith echoed that assertion, saying in a post on X Thursday night that the Trump administration was “VERY clear” in its warnings to state lawmakers and the governor that a failed map could bring consequences. Beckwith deleted the post Friday morning.
“They told many lawmakers, cabinet members and the (governor) and I that this would happen,” Beckwith said in the since-deleted post. “The Indiana Senate made it clear to the Trump Admin today that they do not want to be partners with the (White House). The (White House) made it clear to them that they’d oblige.”
Other threats on the horizon
Republican U.S. Rep. Marlin Stutzman of Indiana’s 3rd Congressional District, appearing on CNN Thursday night, also lamented the Senate’s decision. He described the vote as “a terrible decision” and tied it to broader concerns about cooperation with the federal delegation.

“I’m really disappointed. … We have a lot of projects that we’ve been working on in Indiana. And … just like in business, you work with people who work with you. And President Trump asked for this. Speaker Mike Johnson, he put a ton of time making phone calls. There was pushing, pulling,” Stutzman said. “There was no good excuse that I heard other than, ‘This just breaks precedent,’ or ‘The president was being a bully about it.’ This is politics. I mean, this is hardball, and we’re playing softball.”
“My belief,” he added, “is that (Trump) is going to look at Indiana and say, ‘Look, we want to work together, but I need your help, and the state Senate failed to help today.’ … Unfortunately, we just don’t have a state senate that sees the big picture and understands the national implications of this.”
But when pressed on the notion that Indiana should be denied federal funding absent redistricting support, Stutzman objected. 
“No, I mean, I hope not,” he said. “I want to work with the president.”
Braun additionally wasted little time signaling political repercussions for Republicans who opposed the measure, saying in a statement shortly after the vote that the senators who “partnered with Democrats to reject this opportunity” had failed Hoosiers and would face consequences.
“I will be working with the President to challenge these people who do not represent the best interests of Hoosiers,” Braun said in a Thursday evening statement.
Despite the barrage of criticism, however, Bray expressed little concern about threats of lost federal funding or retribution from national party figures.
After the vote, Bray told reporters he had “lots of conversations with folks in Washington, D.C.” and maintained that “Indiana will continue to function.”

Since September, American employers have been required to pay a $100,000 sponsorship fee for new H-1B visas, one of several policy shifts under President Donald Trump to restrict who gets to come in and out of the country. But while much attention has been paid to what this means for applicants in California’s tech industry, the rule affects its public school system as well.
As Sophie Sullivan and Alina Ta of CalMatters’ College Journalism Network explain, K-12 schools employ skilled foreign educators, particularly to staff language and special education programs. In 2023, West Contra Costa Unified School District hired about 88 teachers on H-1B visas, most of whom came from the Philippines, Spain and Mexico. Even then, hiring those teachers required paying application fees ranging from $9,500 to $18,800. 

Sylvia Greenwood, the district’s assistant superintendent for human resources: “With our shortages in special ed, they were a good fit for our district. … We kept that pipeline open and brought teachers here from the Philippines to support our students and our students with special needs.”

With the cost of hiring those teachers now exceeding $100,000 following Trump’s new policy, it’s likely those positions will be left empty. Without international employees to fulfill hiring gaps, the workload for other teachers will also increase, said one Ford Elementary School teacher in the district. 
H.R. is a physical education teacher in West Contra Costa who works on a short-term J-1 visa. He and his family moved from Mexico to the U.S. three years ago, but he now expects to move back after his visa expires in June 2026 because the district is unlikely to pay for his immigration fees.

H.R.: “Everybody says here that they need teachers in California … but they don’t want to do anything to (help us stay) here.”

PG&E secures another permit for nuclear plant

On Thursday the California Coastal Commission approved Pacific Gas & Electric’s permit to keep operating the state’s last nuclear power plant, but only under key conditions, reports CalMatters’ Nadia Lathan.
Located along the San Luis Obispo shoreline, Diablo Canyon provides about 8% of California’s total energy. Originally due to close this year, the plant remains open through 2030 following a state law passed in 2022 to keep Diablo Canyon operating. Because the plant operates within the coastal commission’s jurisdiction, however, PG&E still needed its separate approval.
The commission gave that approval on the contingency that PG&E also conserves about 4,000 acres of land on its property that would not be developed for any commercial or residential use.
The vote renewed debates about keeping the plant open. The plant draws in 2 million gallons of water from the ocean daily to cool its systems. In addition to the harm this brings to marine wildlife, environmentalists have also raised concerns about radioactive waste.
Proponents say the plant provides reliable, clean energy and keeps thousands of people employed. PG&E now awaits federal approval for a 20-year relicensing permit through 2045.

The price of CA water

A new report finds that California cities pay more for water than what irrigation districts pay to supply water to farms, write CalMatters’ Rachel Becker and Natasha Uzcátegui-Liggett.
Cities pay on average about $722 per acre foot for water, compared to just $35 agricultural districts pay, according to researchers at UCLA and advocates with the Natural Resources Defense Council. One acre foot can supply roughly 11 Californians with water for a year.
The difference in water prices depends on the source: Water supplied from federally managed rivers and reservoirs costs far less on average than water from state-managed distribution systems or through water transfers, which drive up prices with each change-of-hands.
Researchers attributed this 20-fold difference to the cost of delivering water to cities and water transfers. The most expensive water in California, for example, flows from Northern California rivers all the way down to the San Gorgonio Pass Water Agency in Riverside County, which costs more than $2,850 per acre foot. Meanwhile, three California agricultural suppliers with rights to the Colorado River receive water for free from the federal government.

“The idea is to have a political and social component in the creation of knowledge at the university,” said Camilo Ruiz, assistant professor of anthropology at the University of Connecticut.
On the second floor of the Park Street Public Library, Ruiz’s students presented their final projects in English to community members in Hartford, with simultaneous Spanish translation provided by Constanza Segovia, organizing director and cofounder of Hartford Deportation Defense and Connecticut For All.
The People’s Migrant School is an effort by Ruiz, with the support and collaboration of the Human Rights Institute and the Center for Latin American Studies at the University of Connecticut, to bring the classroom to the people. And also to focus the research generated by students in the ‘Latinx communities in the United States’ class, on creating tangible and useful information for neighborhoods in Hartford.

More than 150,000 people in Hartford are considered immigrants, according to the national census. This group is composed primarily of people who migrated from the Caribbean, South America and Central America. Two-thirds of them have resided in the U.S. since 2009 or earlier.
Ruiz said classes traditionally do not extend beyond the four walls of a university classroom, but this year he wanted to do things differently, given the multiple detentions of immigrants around the city.
“Since many of my students have migratory connections to the United States, I proposed to them changing the class format to something relevant that connects the university with the immigrant population,” Ruiz said.
Segovia advised Ruiz to have the students focus their projects on Connecticut and, if possible, on Hartford. This led to the creation of seven different projects with one-page printed infographics in English and Spanish, which were distributed at the event.
Saturday’s presentations covered topics such as the history, recruitment and infrastructure of national immigration agencies, the Trust Act, and a short film that offered a mother’s perspective on immigration raids.
Two presentations were about ‘Know Your Health Rights’, where students outlined strategies to mitigate risks, like having photocopies of medical prescriptions, a list of their medical providers and medical records.
For some students, like Nicole Samaniego, the project was more than just a class assignment.
“I don’t have the luxury of separating this project from my personal life. My family is immigrant, and this information we presented is so important to me,” said Samaniego.
Student Beatriz Torres explained that this project is an attempt to connect with communities and what happens in their daily lives outside of the university campus.
“If you walk around the university campus, people act like nothing is happening, and that’s a privilege,” Torres said.

After the presentations, there was a time for dialogue and reflection with the audience, which included Hartford residents, professors and community activists from the immigrant community, such as Ruth Valera, a member of the Hartford Deportation Defense.
Valera asked the audience if those who had gone to the Capitol to support them when they testified in favor of HUSKY for Immigrants, the Trust Act or for more protections for immigrants could raise their hands. Less than 10 people in a room of more than 40 did.
“It wasn’t easy speaking in English to politicians in suits, who are mostly white, right?” said Valera, looking at the people who had testified with her at the legislature. “It’s not easy to be heard; it’s intimidating sometimes, but we’re going to keep doing it, and we need you to join us.”

La Universidad de Connecticut, junto con el Colectivo de Defensa de Hartford, inauguró el sábado en Hartford la primera sesión de la nueva “Escuela Popular”, con el objetivo de crear puentes de colaboración entre la universidad y las comunidades inmigrantes de la ciudad.
“La idea es que haya un componente político y social en la creación de conocimiento en la universidad”, dijo Camilo Ruiz, profesor de antropología en la Universidad de Connecticut.
En el segundo piso de la Biblioteca Pública de Park Street, estudiantes de Ruiz presentaron sus proyectos finales en inglés a miembros de la comunidad de Hartford, con traducción en español al momento por Constanza Segovia, directora del Colectivo de Defensa de Hartford y Connecticut For all. 
La Escuela Popular es un esfuerzo del profesor Ruiz, con ayuda del Instituto de Derechos Humanos y el Centro de Estudios Latinoamericanos de la Universidad de Connecticut, en abrir el salón de clase a la calles. También en que la investigación que alumnos de su clase de Comunidades Latinas en Estados Unidos, genere información palpable y útil para los vecindarios en Hartford.
En Hartford, más de 150,000 personas son consideradas inmigrantes en el censo nacional. Este grupo está formado por gente que migró mayormente del Caribe, Sudamérica y Centroamérica. Dos tercios de ellos residen en EE.UU desde el 2009 o antes. 
Ruiz comenta que las clases tradicionalmente no salen de las cuatro paredes de la universidad, pero que este año quería hacer las cosas diferente al haber múltiples redadas en comunidades migrantes alrededor de la ciudad.
“Dado a que muchos de mis estudiantes tienen conexiones migratorias con los Estados Unidos, les propuse que si estaban dispuestos a cambiar el formato de la clase, algo que sea relevante para vincular la universidad con la población migrante”, explica Ruiz.
Segovia aconsejó a Ruiz, para que los estudiantes orienten sus proyectos en Connecticut y de ser posible, en la capital. Fue así que surgieron siete proyectos diferentes con infográficos impresos de una página en inglés y en español, los cuales repartieron en el evento.
Las presentaciones del sábado cubrían temas sobre la historia, reclutamiento y la infraestructura de las agencias de immigracion nacionales, el Trust Act, y un cortometraje que pone un lente de madre a las redadas. 
Para algunos estudiantes como Nicole Samaniego, el proyecto fue mas que una tarea de clase.
“No tengo el lujo de separar este proyecto con mi vida personal, mi familia es inmigrante y esta información que presentamos es tan importante para mí”, dijo Samaniego.
La estudiante Beatriz Torres explicó que este proyecto es un intento de acercarse a las comunidades y lo que pasa en el día a día fuera del campus universitario. 
“Si caminas por el campus de la universidad, la gente actúa como si no estuviera pasando nada y eso es un privilegio”, sostuvo Torres.
Al terminar las presentaciones se abrió el espacio al diálogo y reflexiones con la audiencia, quienes eran residentes de Hartford, profesores, y activistas de la comunidad migrante como Ruth Valera, miembro del Colectivo de Defensa de Hartford.
Valera pidió que levantaran la mano quienes habían ido al capitolio a acompañarlos cuando testificaron a favor de HUSKY for Immigrants, el Trust Act, y por más protecciones para los inmigrantes. Menos de 10 personas levantaron la mano en un salón de más de 40.
“No fue fácil hablar en inglés con políticos encorbatados, mayormente blancos ¿verdad?”, dijo Valera dirigiendo la mirada hacia las personas que fueron a testificar con ella a la legislatura. “No es fácil ser escuchados; intimida a veces, pero lo vamos a seguir haciendo y necesitamos que nos acompañen”.

Rigel Robinson is a former Berkeley City Councilmember


At first the plan for the property a block from UC Berkeley was modest: build a two-unit accessory dwelling behind a pair of small apartment buildings.
Since then, Berkeley’s zoning board has approved a dramatically different vision for the site: a 20-story tower with 169 apartments. When complete, it will be the tallest structure in Berkeley’s Southside neighborhood.
The project’s evolution captures how quickly Berkeley’s housing landscape can change, as the city and state embrace pro-housing policies. It also shows how one California community can switch its approach to solving its housing problems. 
For years, Berkeley’s shortage of student housing near campus has caused ripples throughout the broader rental market. Students were pushed to live far from campus, which drove up rents citywide. 
It’s a student housing crisis within a citywide housing crisis.
In 2023 Berkeley adopted a major upzoning plan for the Southside neighborhood, after years of debate over how to relieve the housing shortage. The rezoning campaign, launched when I was a student at UC Berkeley and completed during my tenure on the City Council, allowed taller and denser buildings near campus. 
The final vote was contentious. Some council members proposed last-minute restrictions. But a pro-housing majority advanced the plan.
At the same time, lawmakers in Sacramento were rewriting rules to help cities grow and meet their housing needs. Changes to the state’s density bonus law, including Assembly Bill 1287, signed in 2023, allow developers to exceed local height limits if they include additional affordable units on site.

Together, those reforms transformed what was possible at the Berkeley site, at 2425 Durant Avenue. Yes Duffy Architects included additional affordable homes into the project, triggering the density bonus and unlocking additional height beyond Berkeley’s new zoning limits.
But the journey to project approval has been complicated.
Once plans for the site were in motion, the Berkeley Architectural Heritage Association tried to make the existing property at the site a landmark, a move consistent with its pattern of targeting sites slated for new housing. 
The city council unanimously rejected the landmarking attempt. Now, the project has its permit but an appeal has been filed.
When built, the 20-story structure will undoubtedly make some Berkeley residents uncomfortable. But after decades of restricting growth, the city has little standing to object. 
Berkeley’s political culture has shifted, slowly but decisively, from resistance to responsibility. That shift didn’t come easily. 
For years, progress was stymied by neighborhood opposition and a city council wary of change. But cycle after cycle, pro-housing candidates won elections, reshaping the city’s politics and setting a new course.
And on campus at UC Berkeley, Chancellor Carol Christ championed new student housing, a cause her predecessors had neglected. From Anchor House to People’s Park, the city’s skyline is being remade by new housing for students.
The result is a city that has become one of California’s most surprising housing reform success stories: a community that, after years of hesitation, is building with urgency.
That progress remains fragile. Across the state, local resistance continues to stall housing projects. Perhaps it’s best exemplified by the resistance of Los Angeles’ city leaders to the recently signed Senate Bill 79, which encourages the development of dense housing around public transit locations.
We have much work to do to move public consciousness around solutions to the housing crisis. 
Berkeley’s experience shows that change is possible when local and state reforms align, and when communities are willing to let go of outdated fears about growth. The 169 new homes coming to 2425 Durant are the product of years of advocacy and persistence from residents tired of watching their friends and neighbors priced out.
Progress in city halls and the state Capitol can be slow. But once reform takes hold, transformation can come fast. When the political will exists, even a two-unit idea can grow into a 20-story solution.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/081623_Berkeley-Student-Housing_SN_CM_29.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-12 08:58:58.426660
,California,2025-12-12 13:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,"Some Newsom detractors make up stuff, though there’s fodder for legitimate criticism",Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/12/gavin-newsom-detractors-for-president/,"As California's governor prepares for an expected run for the presidency, a chorus of right-wing criticism is growing. Some of it isn't true.","As Gavin Newsom ramps up his almost certain campaign for president, and polls put him in contention for the Democratic Party’s nomination in 2028, he has become a favorite target of right-leaning commentators on network television and in YouTube videos and social media.
While some criticism is grounded in fact and reasonable differences, there’s also a substrata of highly exaggerated, even fictional, output. Talking heads present him not as an ambitious politician who poses as a selfless public servant — something they all do, including the current president — but as a crooked charlatan.
There’s plenty of material in Newsom’s nearly three decades-long political career for legitimate criticism. And he tends toward over-the-top braggadocio about his accomplishments and amnesia about his failures.
However, his most virulent critics take nuggets of fact — including those having nothing to do with Newsom — and pump them up to depict him as an agent of corruption and incompetence.
One much-repeated trope is that Newsom, in concert with Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, purposely or incompetently failed to protect residents of the city and suburban neighborhoods from devastating wildfires early this year.
President Donald Trump fed that narrative by accusing Newsom of not sending enough water to Southern California, thus leading to shortages that impeded firefighting. It’s just not true, but it’s repeated, with embellishments, on a regular basis.
Another oft-aired criticism of Newsom misuses a column I wrote when he was inaugurated in 2019. It depicted the fascinating interconnections between his family and the Getty, Brown and Pelosi clans, stretching back more than eight decades.
Videos that frequently pop up on YouTube quote from the column verbatim, without attribution, and show the chart of family connections that accompanied the article. Then they tack on fact-free addendums suggesting connections to organized crime or some other nefarious activities.
Another line of criticism cites some left-wing legislative or ballot measure proposal, treats it like it’s already in law, portrays its supposedly devastating effect on the innocent public and lays it at Newsom’s feet. The proposed wealth tax, which could appear on the 2026 ballot, is one favorite topic, even though Newsom has repeatedly rejected it.
Many of Newsom’s critics who breathlessly report on his evil plans (that the left-wing mainstream media supposedly cover up) are just nobodies who feign authority and are obviously fronting for right-wing organizations. But some are recognizable California figures.
Two frequent YouTube critics are Carl DeMaio, a longtime Republican politician in San Diego who won a seat in the state Assembly last year, and Victor Davis Hanson, an historian connected to Stanford University’s Hoover Institution.

Assemblymember Carl DeMaio speaks during the session at the state Capitol in Sacramento on Jan. 23, 2025. Photo by Fred Greaves for CalMatters.

DeMaio’s shtick is that he has discovered some horrible thing that Newsom and other Democrats have cooked up to damage honest, hard-working Californians, but that mainstream media have ignored. It’s usually accompanied by a pitch for donations to his organization.
Hanson is a widely recognized, erudite authority on military history, particularly World War II. He also fancies himself a political commentator with a particular bead on Newsom, but his critiques are often factually deficient.
One of Hanson’s favorite assertions is that Newsom diverted bond funds meant to construct new water projects into financing the demolition of four dams on the Klamath River. However the commitment for that project dates back to Arnold Schwarzenegger’s governorship, and the bond issue specifically contained the appropriation for it.
Distorted criticism of Newsom is more off-putting than even his own tendency to bend historic fact. It also undercuts legitimate questioning of Newsom’s record, because he can, and does, depict any negative depictions as baseless propaganda.
The anti-Newsom drumbeat is likely to get louder as he moves ever closer to a declaration of presidential candidacy. Viewer beware.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/082125_Redistricting-Newsom_MG_CM_07.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-12 08:58:58.426660

(Photo courtesy The Conservation Fund)A former mineral processing site in the middle of a treasured desert wetland habitat will soon be cleaned up and restored after a conservation group reached a deal to buy the 18-acre industrial site.
The Conservation Fund – in partnership with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service – purchased the longtime industrial processing site within the Ash Meadows National Wildlife Refuge from zeolite manufacturer KMI Zeolite in October for $900,000. 
Under the purchase agreement, KMI Zeolite agreed to remove industrial equipment from the site by October 2026. The Conservation Fund said their ultimate goal is to transfer ownership of the property to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which manages the national refuge. 
The Ash Meadows National Wildlife Refuge was established in 1984 to protect the desert oasis’ natural springs, and significant populations of threatened and endangered species found nowhere else in the world. However, several swaths of private land purchased before the refuge was established are scattered throughout the area.
The property purchased by the fund has been in private ownership since 1914. Remnants of a former dude ranch that catered to divorce seekers, a motel, and a bar built on the site before it became an industrial site are still present. 
While the site is not the largest parcel of private property located in the refuge – that honor goes to a 40-acre Christian camp dubbed “Patch of Heaven” – it is a significant site due to the presence of a spring that supports a large swath of riparian habitat.
It’s also one of the few sites in the refuge still being used for industrial purposes. 
“It’s highly visible because it’s right on the entrance road coming in from the south, so you have to drive right past it. Everybody sees it and they wonder what those big buildings are,” said John Hiatt, one of the founding board members of the Amargosa Conservancy.
The Ash Meadows National Wildlife Refuge and surrounding area has a large concentration of zeolite, a clay-like mineral used in water filtration, odor control, and soil conditioner. The area has recently attracted applications for new zeolite exploration projects, which received strong pushback from locals and conservation groups. 
“They basically had trucks hauling it in, trucks hauling it out, and whatnot, which really is not a use that’s necessarily compatible with a wildlife refuge and they had no interest in maintaining the riparian portion of the property,” Hiatt said of the former zeolite processing site.
KMI Zeolite confirmed they sold their former Ash Meadows National Wildlife Refuge parcel but declined to make an official statement. The company recently relocated its main refinement center to Pahrump, in order to build newer facilities and be closer to a population center.

Gavin Kakol, the Nevada field representative for the Conservation Fund, said when he first visited the site in January there were remnants of materials and debris. 
Kakol said the site is significant because of its proximity to habitat with known populations of the endangered Ash Meadows speckled dace and Ash Meadows pupfish pupfish. 
“We’re dealing with a wetland system here. After large rains this whole area becomes interconnected, and there’s the potential for these fish to flow even onto the property itself, and for water to move in between the refuge itself and the private property,” Kakol said.
Kakol said there are several other endangered groundwater dependent plants with known populations within a quarter mile of the former industrial site, including Ash Meadows Gumplant, Tecopa Birdbeak, and the Spring loving century.
“We are actively working with the Nevada Heritage Foundation to do habitat surveying this spring and upcoming summer. We hope to get a good handle on the other potential endangered species that are actually on site or in close proximity to it,” Kakol said.
The Conservation Fund’s purchase of the KMI Zeolite processing site is “a victory for conservation,” said Haitt.
“Now we have an opportunity to restore the riparian habitat in that area for which the entire refuge was created. Ash Meadows is just this unique place. It’s the largest oasis in the Mojave Desert, and this is just one of the springs that constituted that oasis,” Hiatt said.
The Conservation Fund has conserved over 1.2 million acres of habitat in the State of Nevada. The fund also worked with the Fish and Wildlife Service on several other acquisitions, including a 120-acre Ruby Lake Refuge acquisition in 2022 and a 433-acre Stillwater National Wildlife Refuge acquisition in 2020.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_8816-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-12 08:58:58.426660

The commission approved three dispensary licenses at its meeting on Thursday. (Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama Medical Cannabis Commission Thursday approved three dispensary licenses, which members of the commission hailed as a critical step toward making medical cannabis available in Alabama nearly five years after the Legislature established the program. 
“We waited a long time to get to this point in time where we can make a decision like this, and it is monumental,” Rex Vaughn, chair of the commission, said. “It’s a milestone meeting for us, so I’m tickled we can get this far.”
GP6 Wellness, RJK Holdings and CCS of Alabama will receive dispensary licenses within 28 days, as long as the companies pay the $40,000 licensing fee. A fourth license will be approved by the commission in late January due to a recommendation from an administrative law judge, Vaughn said after the meeting. 
Vaughn said multiple times during the meeting that the approval of dispensary licenses is a milestone and will lead to patients getting care they need and tax revenue for the state. 
“It takes a while for that to come through the system, but we should be seeing revenue by springtime at the latest,” Vaughn said.
The Alabama medical cannabis law, enacted in 2021, allows registered physicians to recommend cannabis for about 15 medical conditions, including cancer, depression, Parkinson’s Disease, PTSD, sickle-cell anemia, chronic pain, and terminal diseases. The approved product forms are restricted to tablets, tinctures, patches, oils, and gummies (only peach flavor), with raw plant material and smokable forms remaining prohibited.
People who suffer from the qualifying conditions must get approval from their physician and enter the patient registry in order to buy products at a dispensary.
Litigation has also held up access to medical cannabis. Some firms sued the commission for not being awarded a license, citing a discriminatory process. Another case involved five parents that sued the commission over delays in access to cannabis, which was dismissed in August.
As of Thursday, the commission had distributed licenses for nine cultivators, four processors, four transporters, and three dispensaries. There is also one patient in the registry, Vaughn said. 
Vaughn was not able to give a specific timeline for when the product will be available for purchase, but estimated Spring 2026. Earlier this year, AMCC Executive Director John McMillan had expressed hopes of getting medical cannabis in patients’ hands by the end of 2025. 
“We’ve gotta get our physicians certified quickly. All those things are being staged as we talk right now, and we’ll see how the wintertime goes,” Vaughn said. “Hopefully all these things will fall in place quite quickly.”
Sam Blakemore, a pharmacist and member of the commission, said in an interview after the meeting that medical cannabis can help relieve symptoms without side effects like nausea and vomiting.
“Everybody focuses on Delta-9, but there are over 120 chemicals in the plant that’s able to give this full body experience of allowing patients to really get relief when it comes to nausea and vomiting, spasticity,” Blakemore said.
Blakemore primarily prescribes drugs for pediatric oncology patients. He brought his wife and two young children to the meeting to celebrate the approval of licenses.
“I’m not going to say cannabis is a cure all, but the big thing with getting this done today is at least the folks, that I call the sick and shut in, in the state, they can get relief,” Blakemore said. “They can’t get relief from opioids. They can’t get relief from the gabapentin. They can finally have an opportunity to try something.”
Supporters of medical cannabis attended the meeting Thursday. 
Amanda Taylor, a medical cannabis patient advocate, has been a part of the commission’s process since 2021. She suffers from multiple lesions on her brain and spine. 
“I am absolutely elated today because we’re on the cusp of having a working program,” she said in an interview after the meeting.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC_0439-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-12 08:58:58.426660

(Photo: Thianchai Sitthikongsak/Getty Images)If your family is anything like mine, you dread opening up your NV Energy bill every month. Over the summer and fall, I thought I was seeing double; my bill was so high. All across the country, rate payers are facing eye-popping increases.
What is to blame for the sudden increase in costs? Recently, big tech’s AI-fueled data center frenzy has been driving up utility costs nationwide. And it’s about to get even worse.
According to a MIT study, a single data center can use as much energy as an entire city, and frighteningly, big tech could transform the Reno area into the largest data center market in the world if we don’t take action. Greedy businesses are making opportunistic moves on data center expansion, and Nevada is where they come for cheap land, cheap energy, and tax breaks. As a result, multi-billion-dollar tech companies whose massive data centers power AI growth are consistently proposing new data centers. These giant warehouse-like structures house hundreds of computer servers and other IT infrastructure to store, process, and manage data. That number of computers and servers requires enormous amounts of energy and also generates a lot of heat. To keep the computers cool, data centers use large amounts of water and place a massive burden on the energy grid, which drives up energy costs for everyone else to line the pockets of big tech’s AI companies.
For example, take Switch, a multi-billion dollar corporation that built one of the largest data centers in the world—named “the Citadel,” in the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center. Switch’s clients include some of the wealthiest corporations in the country. On its website, Switch names as its clients PayPal and Thiel Wealth, companies owned by Peter Thiel, the billionaire founder of Palantir, an organization providing the U.S. government with unprecedented surveillance capabilities, which could threaten the rights of us all. 
Despite being valued at billions of dollars, data center companies like Switch are receiving hundreds of millions of dollars in public subsidies from our state. Annually, Nevada spends $139 million in public subsidies for data centers. That means that taxpayers like us foot the bill twice: first, we give data center companies a massive tax break to build in Nevada. Then, we pay for the energy upgrades and ongoing energy use they require through our increased utility bills.
Since data centers have sprouted up in Nevada, NV Energy has predicted a 53% increase in greenhouse emissions, which amounts to 3.2 million tons of additional greenhouse gas pollution. Data centers use billions of gallons of our scarce water, which should be prioritized for people, not big business. Moreover, they would necessitate expanding the state’s power sector by approximately 40%, when we already experience blackouts regularly threatening the lives of Nevadans across the state.
The public is paying for tech companies’ dirty energy expansion with little to no benefits to show for it. Data centers employ very few people full-time, and with no real investment in our communities and an increasing concern of an AI bubble burst, this irresponsible growth of data centers at the expense of working families should concern us all. We need a state that meets the needs of everyday Nevadans, not big tech billionaires.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/transmission-lines-1.jpeg,,,2025-12-12 08:58:58.426660

(Alander Rocha/Alabama Reflector)The Veterans Mental Health Steering Committee announced grants Thursday for five organizations to provide mental health services for veterans.
The organizations will provide a host of services focused on the mental health needs of veterans, from substance abuse and treatment referrals to outpatient services, as well as telehealth, in-person therapy  and treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder.
“They are filling a gap,” said Kimberly Boswell, commissioner of the Alabama Department of Veterans Affairs and chair of the steering committee, in an interview following the meeting. “A lot of individuals do not necessarily want to come to a mental health center, do not necessarily want to go to the federal Veteran’s Administration programs, and so they are really filling in a gap between those services where they can go to an independent, private provider to get services.”

The recipients include Altapointe, an organization based in Mobile that provides crisis care and referrals for treatment, as well as education and preventative services.
Another group, The Shoulder, will offer residential substance abuse treatment services to veterans along with preventative outreach. The Shoulder focuses on treating veterans with drug addictions living in rural areas, along with veterans who have become involved with the criminal justice system.
Alabama’s veterans experienced suicide at a rate of 35.4 per 100,000 in 2021, exceeding both the national veteran average and the state’s general population rate. A significant number of Alabamians, including veterans, suffer from traumatic brain injuries (TBI), a condition linked to increased mental health challenges. Research indicates veterans in Alabama face higher rates of mental illness and substance abuse compared to their non-veteran counterparts.
A committee with veterans with behavioral health services or administration evaluated the applications for the grants, funded by money from the national opioid settlement.
Boswell said the Legislature allocated $3 million for the pilot programs, part of a comprehensive plan aimed at mental health treatment for veterans.
The five organizations will provide the Alabama Veterans Resource Center — established under SB 70, sponsored by Sen. Andrew Jones, R-Centre and passed by the Legislature last spring — with additional organizations where they can refer veterans who need services.
According to the bill, the center will provide “comprehensive support services” for veterans and their families, from career counseling and job placement services to education and career training opportunities.
“The whole idea of the veterans resource center is to help our veterans make that transition from military service to civilian service,” said Jeffrey Newton, commissioner of the Alabama Department of Veterans Affairs, in an interview following the meeting. “When they walk into this veterans resource center, it is going to be a one-stop shop, so whatever they need to help them with the transition, including their family members, we are there to help them.”

Mike Braun lead an Indiana Economic Development Corp. meeting on Thursday, Dec. 11, 2025. (Photo courtesy of Indiana Economic Development Corp.)Hoosier economic development leaders on Thursday celebrated updated job creation data and outlined a push for regional strategic plans.
As of Dec. 1, the Indiana Economic Development Corp. has secured company commitments to add 10,600 new jobs, leaders said.
Those roles are expected to pay an average of $40.59 hourly, up from last year’s $36.09. Incentive spending per job, meanwhile, dropped to $15,485 from the $46,850 expended last year, according to the IEDC.
“Our strategic focus on increasing wages and jobs in Indiana is working,” Gov. Mike Braun said in a news release. “By supporting Indiana companies and the Main Street economy, we’re helping businesses to grow, encouraging more high-wage career opportunities, and creating the next generation of entrepreneurs. All in all, these results will deliver a more robust economy.”
Braun leads the quasi-public agency’s board of directors, which convened Thursday afternoon for its first meeting since releasing the results of a forensic analysis into the activities of IEDC and several partners.
It was also new Chief Administration Officer Alison Grand’s first meeting. She’ll have general counsel duties and serve as one of IEDC’s two ethics officers.
IEDC audit results sent to inspector general; Dems call for accountability 

Her role is among changes prompted by the findings, which included lackluster oversight and questionable spending.
IEDC’s nonprofit arm, which previously funneled largely anonymous donations into economic development travel, hasn’t accepted contributions in months. The $1.9 million left in the account will be used to support the agency’s initiatives, said David Fagan, the board’s audit and finance committee chair.
The board has also revamped its conflict of interest policies — with screened members exiting the room for certain projects — and investment policies. Only the full board makes binding votes now, with committees offering recommendations.
“The foundation is firmly in place; 2026 is all going to be about execution,” Commerce Secretary and CEO David Adams said.
That includes a renewed focus on regional economic development.
IEDC has contracted McKinsey & Company to create the guidelines for regional strategic plans. That’s expected to be done this year, Adams said.
The 15 regions will create and submit their plans in the first quarter of next year, and then execute them with state support, according to a slide deck for the meeting.
The agenda also included the approval of changes to investment policies and loans with the Indiana Angel Network Fund. It’s part of Elevate Ventures, one of the “entities of interest” examined in the forensic analysis.
One loan amendment lets IEDC convert the remaining outstanding balance into ownership of the Indiana Angel Network Fund since the loan’s maturity date has passed. The board also approved a new, $5 million loan for the group.
New IEDC President Josh Richardson also made his board meeting debut.
Braun appointed him to the position in October, after lawmakers decreed the IEDC’s president and CEO roles should be held by two separate people.

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)The U.S. Senate sent President Donald Trump a bill Thursday that would protect a portion of the Wounded Knee Massacre site on the Pine Ridge Reservation.
U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-South Dakota, sponsored the legislation in the House, where it passed in January. Sen. Mike Rounds sponsored the legislation in the Senate, where it passed Thursday, with Majority Leader John Thune as a cosponsor. Both are Republicans from South Dakota.
Johnson released a statement saying “the time is now here to properly memorialize the lost and preserve the land.”
“I look forward to seeing the president sign this into law to ensure the land remains sacred for generations to come,” Johnson said.
Rounds also issued a statement, saying the Wounded Knee Massacre was “a devastating low point in U.S.-Lakota relations” and “we will continue to tell the story of this dark day in our nation’s history.”
Focus on individual conduct instead of massacre doomed Wounded Knee medals review, panelist says

The legislation would place 40 acres at the massacre site in restricted-fee status, which means it could not be sold, taxed, gifted or leased without approval by Congress and the Oglala Sioux and Cheyenne River Sioux tribes, which jointly purchased the land three years ago.
The leaders of both tribes praised the bill’s passage in comments included in a news release from Johnson.
“Today, we stand to acknowledge the atrocities committed against the Lakota people to continue to heal, to protect, to educate, and most importantly, to ensure that we never forget the Wounded Knee Massacre of 1890,” said Cheyenne River Tribe Chairman Ryman LeBeau.
Oglala Sioux Tribe President Frank Star Comes Out called the bill “an important act that will preserve the memory of the Wounded Knee Massacre and the legacy and sacrifice of our ancestors.”
“Significantly,” Star Comes Out said, “it also promotes tribal self-determination and allows us to protect our Wounded Knee site in perpetuity.”
The bill’s passage comes a little more than two months after U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth announced his rejection of calls to rescind medals awarded to soldiers for their participation in the massacre.
Bills to revoke the medals have been introduced this congressional session in the House from Jill Tokuda, D-Hawaii, and in the Senate from Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts. Neither bill has advanced out of its assigned committee, and South Dakota’s members of Congress have not signed on as cosponsors.
The massacre occurred on Dec. 29, 1890. A large group of Lakota people traveling to the Pine Ridge Agency in southwestern South Dakota made camp near Wounded Knee Creek, where they were surrounded by hundreds of Army soldiers. A shot rang out during a struggle while the soldiers tried to disarm the camp, and the soldiers opened fire.
Fewer than 40 soldiers were killed (some by friendly fire, according to historians), while estimates of Lakota deaths ran from 200 to 300 or more, depending on the source, including men, women and children. After some of the bodies froze on the ground for several days, a military-led burial party placed them in a mass grave.
One hundred years later in 1990, Congress passed a resolution expressing “deep regret” for the massacre.

(Photo by SDI Productions via Getty Images)A true ban on cellphones at school is working its way through the Legislature and I can’t think of something that could more directly — and quickly — make a difference in student behavior and performance.
It should have been done years ago, but only recently has it gained momentum.
I remember my daughter texting me during school and getting her phone taken away for not paying attention. That burden on teachers has turned into an everyday chore that eclipsed their teaching duties.
I managed to get through school just fine without one. Of course, younger folks will label me a grumpy boomer (I’m not that old), but phones are not necessary in school. Parents and students can arrange pickup or after school plans the night before or in the morning. If an emergency occurs, parents can call the office to get a message to their children.
In 2024, the General Assembly started down the path of restricting cellphones but only during instructional time. That meant kids were still carrying them around, checking them between classes and texting each other covertly.
Testimony at the Statehouse this week included that some students even physically assaulted teachers who tried to take the phones away.
So, the Senate Education Committee is considering a “bell to bell” ban. The Indiana House has a similar bill filed as well.
The details
Under Senate Bill 78, school corporations and charter schools would be required to adopt a wireless communication device ban that prohibits students from using or possessing a wireless communication device during the school day and requires that any teacher-directed use of a device “for educational purposes” occur only on school-supplied devices.
It also mandates that each district choose between two enforcement models: a “no device policy,” in which students may not bring phones to school at all; or a “secure storage policy,” in which students may bring phones but must store them so they are “inaccessible throughout the school day” and returned only after dismissal.
Some schools are already doing this. For instance, Fort Wayne Community Schools requires students to place their phones in secure pouches upon arrival and keep them locked until dismissal to reduce distractions and improve focus.
Other schools have similar programs.

Testimony this week indicated lunchrooms and hallways are noisier — in a good way — and bullying is down.
And we are starting to see more than anecdotal evidence. Studies are finding schools with cellphone bans have seen test score boosts, fewer fights and better attendance.
The issue does become more problematic when schools give students their own laptops for schoolwork. I know from experience that students will find a way to use that device to chat with their friends or watch videos. And schools spend a fair amount of time trying to block websites and ensure the computers are actually used for academic work.
The one area that gives some people pause about such bans is the reality of school shootings. It has become an unfortunate part of society that students have had to call 911 for help during the chaos of a student shooting. Or they send parents texts and updates.
The bill being discussed has exemptions for emergency circumstances as well as for students with ongoing medical conditions. For instance, a student might need their phone to use a glucose monitor for diabetes.
I look forward to seeing how the bill moves forward. I think there is a way to ban devices and force students to focus on their education instead of the latest TikTok trend.

Michigan is the only state with a currently circulating statewide Ranked Choice Voting ballot petition, according to Rank MI Vote, the grassroots organization, which wrote in a press release that the Heritage Foundation will make Michigan “ground zero in a national battle over whether voters or political insiders will shape the rules of our elections.”
The foundation included the issue of ranked choice voting in its policy section on election integrity, initially released in March in a report titled “Restoring America’s Promise”.
“Heritage will restore faith in elections and protect the right to vote for all Americans by advocating for commonsense reforms at the state and federal level like requiring proof of U.S. citizenship to vote and ending the practice of ranked-choice voting,” the organization’s website reads. “We will always oppose a federal takeover of our elections by Washington elites.”
But Joe Spaulding, Rank MI Vote’s Campaign Director, sees ranked choice voting as exactly the opposite of takeover by elites: he sees it as increasing the options for voters at the ballot box. 
“Out-of-state special interests oppose Ranked Choice Voting for a very simple reason: it means elections deliver representative, majority-supported outcomes where voters can easily reject their extreme policy agendas,” Spaulding said in the press release.

In an interview with Michigan Advance, he also pushed back against an argument that a new style of voting would confuse voters and lower voter turnout.
“Voters are not overwhelmed or confused by having too many choices when they vote. Their arms aren’t getting tired when they’re filling out ballots,” he said. “They feel underwhelmed by having a lack of choice, and they are upset by a hostile and very negative politics that drives perpetual decreases in voter turnout, cycle after cycle.”
That was one of the most pressing concerns of the Michigan Association of County Clerks, who published a resolution in October to oppose the ballot initiative. 
Spaulding says he is very focused on addressing those concerns, as they come from election administrators who will be impacted by the policy if it goes into effect. 
But when it comes to bad-faith attacks on ranked choice voting, like those coming out of the Heritage Foundation, he said, “it would be a disservice towards the folks that have legitimate concerns about improving democracy to be treating what they’re saying seriously.”
In order to both address those concerns and reach voters to sign the petition to get the initiative on the 2026 ballot, which Spaulding said is in the “window of viability,” Rank MI Vote has been hosting its “Bridge the Divide tour” — a run of 60 town halls scheduled across the state in 40 days, though some of those were cancelled or rescheduled due to weather. 
“Folks are super interested in not being punished as voters for having more choices. The math behind that is super simple,” Spaulding said. “When you tell a room full of folks that voters are punished for getting more choices — and the way that looks is, if a third person runs for a race, the winner only needs 34%, if a fourth person runs, it’s only 26% — they all nod.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/20250405-Holland-scaled-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-12 07:56:22.904809

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has called such bans unconstitutional. (Photo by Anne-Marie Caruso/New Jersey Monitor)A controversial bill that would largely ban immigration agents from covering their faces on the job advanced Thursday after nearly an hour of tense debate.
The bill, which passed along party lines, would require all law enforcement officers in the state, including federal agents, to keep their faces uncovered while performing official duties in public. Officers would be exempt during undercover assignments, while wearing protective equipment that doesn’t intend to conceal their identities, or if supervisors say “stealth is necessary.”
The legislation comes amid a rise in episodes of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and other federal agents concealing their identities during immigration raids. U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials defend agents masking by saying they and their families are targeted if their identities are known. 
Ewing resident Georganne D’Angelo responds to ICE raids as part of Resistencia en Acción, a group focused on immigrant workers. D’Angelo told the Assembly’s public safety committee Thursday that she has witnessed masked men who refuse to identify themselves “dragging” people off the streets, and fears that they could be impostors.
New Jersey residents deserve to know what agencies are enforcing federal laws, she said. 
In one of several testy exchanges, Assemblyman Erik Peterson (R-Hunterdon) asked D’Angelo why she’d need to know who the masked agents are. 
“Because I am witnessing what is happening, and in order to witness effectively, I need to know who is doing this. I walk right up to these people, and I say, ‘Can you please identify yourself?’ And they’ll say, ‘No,’” she said. 
“Do you do this with the police in Ewing?” Peterson asked. 
“If someone is in a police uniform and gets out of a police car, I have a feeling they’re police,” D’Angelo responded. 
Madison Linton is a policy and research analyst at the New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice, the state’s largest coalition of immigrant organizations. Linton said immigrant communities across the state have faced an unprecedented escalation of enforcement tactics, both large-scale raids at warehouses and individual arrests. 
“Concealing the identity of officers contributes to the widespread fear and confusion that ICE perpetuates and furthers their agency’s culture of rogue lawlessness and immunity from justice,” she said. 
Many activists who testified Thursday afternoon said the legislation doesn’t go far enough. It does little to discourage bad actors from impersonating local, state, or federal officers, they said, and several urged the committee to advance the Immigrant Trust Act, which would codify a state directive limiting local police cooperation with federal immigration agents. 
Assemblyman Paul Kanitra (Hal Brown for New Jersey Monitor)
Assemblyman Paul Kanitra (R-Ocean) called the bill “blatantly unconstitutional,” adding that the measure’s supporters should not back it either because all of the exemptions in it make it “completely feckless.”
“All this bill does is pander to you. It accomplishes absolutely nothing,” he said.
While the legislation faces more hurdles before making it to the governor’s desk — a Senate companion has not yet been heard and the current legislative session wraps up in four weeks — Homeland Security officials have already said they won’t cooperate.  When Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill said she supports a ban on masked immigration agents, a Homeland Security spokeswoman called such a ban “unconstitutional” and said the agency will not abide by it.
At least one legal expert has agreed that the bill, if signed into law, would likely violate the Constitution’s supremacy clause, which bars the state from regulating the actions of the federal government.
Similar legislation has been signed into law in California, which goes into effect Jan. 1. The U.S. Department of Justice sued the state over the law.
The committee approved the bill Thursday 5-3, with all Democrats on the panel who were present voting yes and all Republicans voting no. Assemblywoman Mitchelle Drulis (D-Hunterdon) acknowledged the constitutional concerns before voting yes. 
“I also think we need to send a message that we are not OK with what is happening in our neighborhoods, in our streets, and to our fellow community members,” she said.

When the infection was discovered during delivery, Cunningham was able to treat the newborn and prevent the infection from spreading.
“ It broke my heart because she was afraid to seek care out of fear of what could happen to her and her baby,” Cunningham said, recalling the woman’s worry that the state might take her child if she admitted to a history of substance use. 
Cunningham, who now serves as director of the St. Louis County Department of Public Health and oversees its perinatal Hepatitis B prevention program, said this case is an example of how a patient with Hepatitis B might fall through the cracks and accidentally spread the illness to her baby. 
Hepatitis B is a viral infection that primarily attacks the liver. Those infected with chronic Hepatitis B can suffer a lifetime of negative health conditions, including cancer.

Last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’ Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice announced it no longer recommends infants receive the first of three doses of a Hepatitis B vaccine at birth. 
Instead, for mothers who did not test positive for Hepatitis B in pregnancy, the CDC recommends parents wait until their child is at least 2 months old to administer the first of three doses of a vaccine that protects against Hepatitis B, if it’s given at all.
“Hearing this news that they want to undo what has been a well-researched practice … that can really set families back,” Cunningham said. “I’m really concerned about the impact on the most vulnerable, our babies, contracting it.”
While most infants with Hepatitis B were infected during delivery, Cunninghamn is among scores of medical experts warning this new guidance overlooks the risk for infection that exists outside the delivery room. 
“The thing is, you don’t know who has Hepatitis B,” said Dr. Rachel Orscheln, a professor of pediatrics in the division of pediatric infectious diseases at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. “Many people are asymptomatic, and so why delay protection when the protection is safe to be administered at an early age?”
Several Missouri health care providers who spoke with The Independent, including pediatricians and obstetricians, strongly urged families to consider the risks of waiting or skipping the vaccine. All continued to align with the American Academy of Pediatrics’ recommendation that infants be vaccinated at birth.
The academy’s president, Susan Kressly, called the new CDC guidance “irresponsible and purposely misleading,” warning that it will lead to more infections. 
Missouri statute requires testing for Hepatitis B, C and syphilis at the first prenatal appointment, typically in the first trimester. But it’s possible for a person to become infected at any point in pregnancy. And not everyone makes it to prenatal appointments.
About 25% of pregnant people in Missouri don’t get prenatal care until after the first trimester, according to the March of Dimes. 
It’s in part why a handful of lawmakers have been pushing for the introduction of a second Hepatitis B test at 28 weeks of pregnancy. Despite bipartisan support the past two years, the legislation never made it to a final vote. 
‘Light bulb moment’: New approach to treating Hep C postpartum a success in St. Louis

Orscheln also fears that without universal newborn vaccinations, more babies will get sick.
She knows pediatricians who are increasingly hearing from parents hesitant to follow the recommended childhood vaccine schedule.
“It has not been helped by the fact that there’s been new changes to the vaccine schedule that are not supported by any data,” Orscheln said. “Our vaccine programs have been so successful that people now are more fearful of vaccines than they are for those infectious diseases … These infectious diseases still exist, and they’re ready to come back.”
Orscheln noted that while every vaccine has potential side effects including soreness at the injection site and a mild fever, serious side effects from vaccinations are “exceedingly rare.”
Dr. Bret Gordon, the OB-GYN division chair at Saint Luke’s in Kansas City, said while parents have always had the right to refuse vaccinations at the hospital, he predicts more parents will opt out of the newborn Hepatitis B vaccine as a result of the new CDC guidance. 
“When patients come in with these questions, when they read things and they see things in the news, we do our best to objectively explain the data and give them good advice based on scientific data,” said Gordon, who added that clinicians increasingly have to counter opinions patients see on social media.
Since the infant Hepatitis B vaccine recommendation was announced in 1991, there has been a 99% decrease in the number of children and teens with the infection.
Martha Smith, Missouri maternal child health director with the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, said many people aren’t aware of the lifelong health implications of chronic Hepatitis B, the most common type of Hepatitis B to occur in babies and children if the infection isn’t discovered in time.
Not only is the liver at risk. The kidneys can also be harmed. The risk of stomach and pancreatic cancer increases, she said. Those with Hepatitis B double their chances of developing lymphoma. 
“It doesn’t take much more than a microscopic amount (of body fluid) for the virus to spread,” Smith said, noting that younger infants who tend to put everything in their mouths are particularly vulnerable.
Prior to routine vaccination, about half of children who became infected with Hepatitis B got it from a source other than their mother. This was often a different caregiver, like an extended family member or a daycare provider. 
“When you think that hepatitis B can be a silent, asymptomatic condition for somebody, but then they pass it to your baby who doesn’t have all the immunity built up, then they test positive for it, and now they have some significant health implications, because somebody kissed your baby. It kind of puts that age-old tradition of kissing the baby on the head in perspective, doesn’t it?”
Smith encouraged parents to consider all possible risks, and to ask their trusted health care providers about how best to manage those risks.
Dr. Edward Lyons, a pediatric board certified infectious diseases physician at Children’s Mercy in Kansas City, also encouraged parents to bring any worries or confusion to their trusted health care providers.
“I don’t know what misinformation or disinformation people have seen if they don’t tell me,” he said.
And he said while parents can’t protect their children against everything, vaccines are a known safeguard against some of the potential harm in the world.
“The goal of everybody is the same, right?” Lyons said. “Parents and families and clinicians all want these children to be healthy, to be happy, to live long, fulfilling lives.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1210311035-scaled-1-1024x684.jpeg,,,2025-12-12 06:57:36.004710

“It kind of now feels like the same as where I'm coming from,” said Juvenari Kambale, a refugee from the Congo. “There's that fear for what's gonna happen next.”

Theo Wells-Spackman is a Report for America corps member who reports for VTDigger.
When Juvenari Kambale arrived in Vermont last December, he felt huge relief — his family was safe, and his children could attend school. He arrived through the now-suspended U.S. Refugee Admissions Program from his home country, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, via a refugee camp in Uganda.
Kambale, 25, lives in Burlington with his wife and three children, aged 5, 3 and 1 month. He works “as (many) hours as possible” at the shipping department of a local business. 
“I like Burlington so much,” Kambale said. “I like the schools … I’m able to find work.”
But in October, his family abruptly stopped receiving the food assistance they rely on.
Kambale’s is one of over 140 noncitizen households legally residing in Vermont who have experienced a loss of or decrease in nutrition benefits due to visa status, following changes implemented after the congressional passage of July’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Many are humanitarian entrants, meaning they relocated to the United States having fled serious threats to their safety at home.
The 3SquaresVT program — Vermont’s version of the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP — has tightened restrictions in a number of areas this year, including expanded work requirements and cuts to the widely used “heat and eat” utility allowance program. For noncitizens, the cuts have been sweeping, eliminating many — including those with green cards — from the program entirely. 
New guidance from the U.S. Department of Agriculture required Vermont to amend its rules for the program this week. A spokesperson for the Department for Children and Families confirmed Thursday that refugees and asylees with green cards, in addition to Afghan Special Immigrant Visa holders, are once again eligible for 3SquaresVT, contrary to the state’s previous position.

Roughly 90 people total will begin receiving benefits again starting as early as next week, including retroactive payments that were withheld in recent months, the spokesperson said.
Refugees like Kambale, who do not yet have green cards, will remain ineligible regardless. His kids — except the youngest, a U.S. citizen — have been removed from the program along with him and his wife. 
Kambale said he is applying for a green card now, which under the latest guidance would eventually return food benefits to his household. It’s a protracted process, but one in which he would ordinarily have a high probability of success given his status as a refugee. However, in late November, a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services memo halted all such applications for refugees who arrived under former President Joe Biden, Reuters reported.
When Kambale was given the opportunity to relocate to the U.S. last year, he accepted it gratefully.
“Congo is not stable,” Kambale said in an interview translated from Kinyarwanda — a central African language — by Ernestine Tuyishime, a case worker at the Vermont office of the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants. “I was forced to flee,” he said.
Prior to acceptance, refugees must demonstrate to U.S. immigration officials that they are escaping persecution, a legal term with a high burden of proof. 
A United Nations report last year said recent escalations in armed conflict between militias and other actors in the Congo and Rwanda had “worsened the already dire humanitarian crisis” in the region, with violence often carried out against civilians directly.
Last week, the Trump administration announced that Congo was one of 19 countries that will see all U.S. visa applications paused. 
Though providing for his family had never been easy for Kambale, who is the sole earner in his household, he had been making it work financially prior to October.
“But now things have changed, with the SNAP cards — we’re not able to get the food that my family would like to have,” he said. “It’s really hard.”
Kambale’s work fluctuates seasonally, he said, and the hours are somewhat unpredictable. He’s looked for other jobs before, but most pay less than he currently earns, or don’t allow for overtime. Learning English, a vital skill for many workplaces, is a “luxury” that Kambale said he doesn’t have right now. He’s often skipped attending language classes, which are often provided to clients by the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, or USCRI, in order to work more hours while he can.
“During the wintertime, I may not be working as much,” he said. “So things are gonna get worse for me and my family.”
The safety Kambale thought he had gained just months ago no longer feels assured, he said, and he feels some of the old pressures returning.
“It kind of now feels like the same as where I’m coming from,” he said. “There’s that fear for what’s gonna happen next.”
‘Next month we don’t have anything’
When Hafiza, 53, and her young adult daughter arrived in Vermont earlier this year from Afghanistan, they left everything behind. 
Hafiza’s husband, who worked in the U.S. embassy in Kabul during the war, had applied for a Special Immigrant Visa, a program created to allow safe passage for Afghans and Iraqis who have risked persecution to assist the U.S. military. But by the time the visa was approved, Hafiza’s husband had passed away from Covid-19 at the height of the pandemic, and six of their seven children had aged out of the program’s family protection provisions.

VTDigger is withholding Hafiza’s last name, and her daughter’s name, at their request for the safety of their family.
After four long months in Islamabad, Pakistan — consular processing in Kabul collapsed after the Taliban seized power in 2021 — Hafiza and her daughter arrived in Vermont alone. They had to move several times to find a home that could accommodate Hafiza, who is now ill herself, and cannot climb stairs, her daughter said. 
In October, the two women were cut off from SNAP benefits, which was initially difficult for them to understand, they said. Sonali Samarasinghe, director of USCRI Vermont, said many of her clients had been confused by the flurry of notifications from 3SquaresVT program officials. Not only had many of them contained contradictory information as federal policy shifted rapidly, Samarasinghe said, but many people hadn’t received notifications in a language they spoke.
The loss in benefits came as a result of Vermont’s interpretation of July’s budget law, which, according to state officials, subjected Special Immigrant Visa holders to a five-year waiting period before they become eligible for food assistance. As the state only began accepting visa holders in this group in 2021, very few individuals, if any, in that community remained eligible for SNAP. 
Special Immigrant Visa holders like Hafiza and her daughter should soon begin to receive food assistance again following the latest USDA guidance, officials said Thursday.
Despite the difficulties she has encountered, Hafiza said she primarily feels grateful to be in the U.S. 
“I’m here, and I’m with my daughter,” she said in an interview translated from Dari by USCRI caseworker Hasina Mohammadi. “It’s good — (I) feel happy.”
Her daughter attends the local high school. She’s focused on finishing her education right now, the daughter said, and learning English as soon as possible so she can find a good job.
While glad to be in Vermont, Hafiza hopes desperately that the siblings who were forced to remain in Afghanistan will be able to join her soon. Given their father’s work employment with U.S. agents, she is concerned about retribution from the Taliban.
One of her other daughters, who is unmarried, calls often from Kabul, crying, Hafiza said.
“I left her alone,” she said. “It’s very hard for me.”
Hafiza’s daughter said what little money she and her mother have been able to save would soon be spent. Benefits restarting will be crucial for them.
“Next month we don’t have anything,” she said, referring to December.

‘I’m just thinking about my kids’
Other Afghans on Special Immigrant Visas in Vermont said they had encountered similar struggles.
Mohammed waited for years with his family in Afghanistan before receiving visa approval from the United States. During the war, he had been hired as an airport security guard in Jalalabad. His name is being withheld for his safety and that of his family.
He now lives in Colchester with his wife and six children. Because the kids are all minors, and Mohammed has a green card, he still receives a fraction of the food benefits he used to receive. Because Mohammed is the sole provider for the household, with the high cost of food, transportation and other necessities, it’s been hard to make ends meet, much less plan ahead, he said.
“It’s not enough,” Mohammed said of the reduced payments, in an interview translated from Pashto by Mohammadi. “These things (are) expensive.”
He’s asked for money from a friend, which should help for now. But his options for earning are limited — an injury has forced him to temporarily leave his job at a food manufacturing operation.
“Everything is heavy, physical … they don’t have anything else for me to do,” he said of his employer. “I’m looking for a different job.”
Lately, he’s been finding it difficult to think straight, Mohammed said. He’s inundated with high-stakes paperwork that he can’t understand without help, and with worry for his family.
He produced a photo of his youngest daughter, gazing back at the camera through large sunglasses.
“I’m responsible for everything,” Mohammed said. “I’m just thinking about my kids.”
Several state lawmakers in Vermont had raised the alarm on the issue of food assistance for people like Mohammed, including House Human Services Committee chair Rep. Theresa Wood, D-Waterbury. 
“These were people that we specifically welcomed to Vermont,” she said of Special Immigrant Visa holders last week. “We have a moral obligation to do what we can to help people who … assisted the United States government.”
Roughly 650 Afghans live in Vermont, many of whom hold Special Immigrant Visas.
Molly Gray, executive director of the Vermont Afghan Alliance, said her team had offered to assist the state and “reenroll eligible individuals as quickly as possible.” Gray emphasized that for her clients, food assistance is generally a temporary measure to help them find their feet. 
Ending SNAP for noncitizen groups blocks them from other programs that use food assistance eligibility as their own bar for access, Gray noted, such as the Crop Cash nutrition program run by the Northeast Organic Farming Alliance of Vermont. She’s also concerned that the same groups will soon lose other benefits, like Medicaid, come next year.
Samarasinghe’s team, as well as other providers around the state, are fundraising to try and help those who remain ineligible for benefits where they can, she said.
But for those like Kambale and his family, no clear reprieve is in sight.
“I’m able to pay for housing,” Kambale said, “but with the cuts (to food assistance) it kind of complicates everything.”
“It’s really kind of threatening to my family, and my stay here,” he said.

(Henry Redman | Wisconsin Examiner)The Wisconsin Elections Commission on Thursday denied a demand from the U.S. Department of Justice for the state’s full voter registration list, including personally identifiable information such as dates of birth, driver’s licenses and Social Security numbers. 
At a special meeting Thursday afternoon and in a letter sent in response to the DOJ demand, WEC stated that Wisconsin law explicitly prevents the commission from sharing the personal information of voters. 
“The U.S. DOJ is simply asking the commission to do something the commission is explicitly forbidden by Wisconsin law to do,” commissioner Don Millis said. 
This is the second time this year the DOJ has requested Wisconsin’s voter database. Both times, the department has been informed that Wisconsin state law requires that the commission charge a fee to obtain the list. 
Since the summer, the DOJ has requested the voter databases of several states — raising concerns over why the department is seeking massive amounts of voter data, especially as President Donald Trump has remained fixated on conspiracy theories that his 2020 election loss was rigged. 
In its demand for the data, sent Dec. 2 as a “confidential memorandum of understanding” the department said it was seeking the data to check if Wisconsin is properly complying with the National Voter Registration Act and the Help America Vote Act. 
VRLData Sharing Agreement DOJ-WI
“The Justice Department is requesting your state’s [Voter Registration List] to test, analyze, and assess states’ VRLs for proper list maintenance and compliance with federal law,” the memo states. 
However the WEC response questions the authority with which DOJ is asserting its right to the records. For one, Wisconsin is exempt from the NVRA because it offers same-day voter registration at polling places. Also, WEC wrote in its response letter that HAVA does not grant the DOJ access to confidential voter data. 
Compliance with HAVA and the thoroughness of states’ compliance with voter list maintenance requirements have become regular talking points among Republicans who say they’re concerned that there are thousands of people who have active voter registrations when they should be ineligible to vote because they’ve moved, died or otherwise are unable to cast a ballot. 
The sources of those complaints include the Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty, a right-wing law firm that in October sent a letter to the DOJ asking for the department to assess Wisconsin’s compliance with HAVA. 
WEC has said repeatedly that the commission and Wisconsin’s municipal election clerks are properly maintaining the voter rolls. They’ve also noted that the concerns are often overstated because even if a voter is ineligible and their file is deactivated in the database, their name will still appear in the system. 
WEC Letter – Resp to 12.2.25 DOJ Correspondence
“The joint effort between state and local election officials enhances the integrity of the system by ensuring responsibilities are distributed across thousands of officials in every city, village, and town, rather than concentrated among a small handful of state employees in the Capitol,” the WEC response letter states. “The vast majority of list maintenance work consists of routine updates, and the processes also serve to identify attempts at wrongdoing. Each year, Wisconsin election officials at all levels of government identify and refer to criminal prosecution: felons attempting to vote, double voters, non-citizens, and others trying to circumvent election law.” 
In the WEC decision to deny DOJ’s request as well as to release the DOJ memo and the response letter, Republican commissioner Bob Spindell was the lone vote against. Spindell pointed to a provision of state law that allows WEC to share restricted information in the voter database with law enforcement agencies. Spindell has often used his role on the commission to indulge conspiracy theories and cast doubt on the security of the election system. 
“This is a highly, highly controversial issue throughout the country at this point in time, and my point of view is that this information can be released,” Spindell said. “I believe that through the HAVA Act, the federal government has the appropriate ability to see if we’re doing everything that’s correct and OK. I’ve talked forever about we need to have, in the state of Wisconsin, an independent audit, or whatever, of the registration list to satisfy the many individuals and groups and so forth that question it. And all HAVA is doing here, the federal government is asking for a chance to take a look at us.” 
But commissioner Mark Thomsen said there is no way that a provision meant to help law enforcement find information about suspects in criminal investigations could be interpreted to mean WEC can give the personal information of every Wisconsin voter to the federal government. 
“Our rights as commissioners are limited by the Fourth Amendment, by state law itself,” Thomsen said. “Mr. Spindel is just flat out wrong that this one provision that he relies on would allow us to legally give Wisconsin citizens’ private information off to someone for some unknown reason. It’s not just a person that’s suspected of a crime, it’s everybody, and Wisconsin has never stood for the proposition that any government is entitled to all this data anytime someone asked. So I think Bob, you’re just making up the law there.”

I remember walking on the beach at Lake Huron, not far from our family cottage,  back in the 1990s. My feet were sort of crunching along in the sand, and I thought, “What in the world is this?”
We all knew the lake well. My great grandparents had bought the land in the 1940s. But things were different that summer.
The arrival of the zebra mussel changed the food web, the water clarity and the lake itself. It’s one of the few times I recall where there were distinct changes in its water level and quality.
The region came to understand how the zebra mussels got here, and how to stop them, thanks to the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL). Over the years, this lab, among other things, built a program to study invasive species. And we haven’t had any new invaders for decades.
This amazing institution just celebrated its 50th anniversary. Now it stands to be decimated, or shut down entirely, through federal funding cuts. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Based in Ann Arbor, GLERL is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). It provides the data, forecasts and long term scientific research that keep us and our food and water safe, support maritime commerce and ensure the health and resilience of the largest freshwater system on Earth.
I was lucky enough to work there for about 10 years. It was a dream job–and absolutely what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. Last year, I was promoted. So when the federal government began terminating “probationary” employees earlier this year, my job ended abruptly. I found out through an email during a doctor appointment – I was terminated with 90 minutes notice.
Now, I just want people to understand what we could lose.
Research and forecasting sound wonky, but this lab’s work keeps you, your family and your pets in the Great Lakes region safe.
Millions of people depend on the Great Lakes’ water supply. Trump decimated the lab protecting it.

From shipping to fishing to tourism, everything we do on the Lakes depends on weather conditions. Researchers at GLERL understand how the lakes move, how they interact with the atmosphere, and how they’re affected by weather patterns, which makes for better forecasts of things like lake effect snow.
They understand “meteotsunamis,” in which waves created by atmospheric pressure push the water up, dramatically changing its level very quickly, which can pose significant danger. There’s currently no warning system for the Great Lakes–a key example of how we need to invest in GLERL to continue developing the science.
GLERL helps the National Weather Service issue marine warnings through wave and ice models. It supports U.S. Coast Guard search and rescue operations with real-time lake data. GLERL works with the Coast Guard as they respond to, clean up and contain oil spills. Its ecological monitoring and other research protects $6 billion in fisheries.
An algal bloom in one of the Great Lakes can yield poisons and heavy metals that can contaminate and shut down a city’s drinking water system, threaten residents and cost millions of dollars. GLERL’s monitoring, toxin reporting and remote sensing capability has helped scientists understand where the toxic part of the bloom is, and vastly expanded information for local water treatment managers. For tourism, NOAA’s information on algal blooms helps the charter boat industry, for example, make decisions about where charters will go in a given season.
I could cite so many more examples – about the invasive carp, habitat protection and restoration, and treaties with Canada. But here’s the point: this lab costs the average household 7 cents a year and delivers lifesaving results. Right now, there are Congressionally-mandated duties going unfulfilled, because there are just not enough employees to do them.
Tell your local leaders and congressional representatives how important it is to fund NOAA and preserve this data powerhouse for our region and the health and well being of our communities.
My grandfather passed away before I took that job at GLERL. But I really wish I could share all of the lab’s amazing findings with him. He would have been so interested in the amount of data and research that went into understanding those invasive mussels.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NOAA-pic.jpg,,,2025-12-12 06:57:36.004710

Cutting a Christmas conifer from national forests or BLM land is a late-fall tradition for scores of Wyoming residents who have the privilege of forgoing a store-bought tree. 
The post Out on the evergreen hunt appeared first on WyoFile .","In much of the United States, selecting a Christmas tree is mostly a practical affair: find a pop-up vendor in a parking lot.
But for many Wyoming families, their seasonal harvest is an outdoor endeavor. 
In a state that’s half public land, it’s easy to do. Parts of eight national forests extend into the Equality State, and there are also eight Bureau of Land Management field offices spread across Wyoming. All offer Christmas tree permits. They’re inexpensive, ranging from $1 on BLM land to $15 on the Bridger-Teton National Forest.

Near dusk on a Monday in early December, Ada Brennan, 2, and her sister, Frances, 4, set out into the Shoshone National Forest with their tante, Jordan Schreiber, to select a Christmas tree.
Pickings were slim near a well-used trailhead a short drive from the nearest town. Trees in easy reach for a toddler were either too short, too tall or too mangled.

Eventually, the party eyed a symmetrical-enough fir that had escaped prior Christmas tree hunters’ saw blades, perhaps because it sprouted along a pretty steep slope. 
Not long later, the conifer was on the ground and being dragged down a trail on its way to a Lander living room.

Holidays are a time of reflection. What parts of Wyoming make you thankful and hopeful, asks columnist Khale Lenhart. 
The post Gratitude and hope for Wyoming appeared first on WyoFile .","This month, between Thanksgiving and Christmas, is a fitting time for reflection. Our focus turns toward family and community, and the changing weather causes us to slow down. It is a good time to take stock of the society around us. The Thanksgiving holiday naturally turns our minds to what we are grateful for — what already exists that we cherish. Christmas is a holiday of hope, focused on the promise of what is yet to come. With these holidays in mind, let us reflect on what parts of our state we are thankful for and hopeful about.

Opinion

Perhaps the thing Wyomingites hold most dear is our heritage. Culturally, we are descended from pioneers and settlers — or from those who came before — and we take that frontier heritage to heart. We value independence, community and overcoming challenges. We are willing to endure hardship to build a life that we want, and we are closely attuned to the natural world and the benefits that it provides. Above all else, we know that our perch in this place is still precarious. These are perspectives that are hard to find elsewhere. They set us apart. By embracing these values, we create a society that fits our circumstances. These ideas would not fit in other places, but they fit here, and for that I am grateful. 
I am also thankful for the good stewardship of our forefathers. Wyoming is a harsh place and it’s challenging to thrive here. Most of our land is arid and inhospitable, our physical conditions are difficult, and we are remote from most modern conveniences and luxuries. With poor planning or shortsighted leadership, this place could easily fall into decline. 
Fortunately, we have been blessed with the opposite. The state’s early settlers understood the importance of building the infrastructure that would allow for growth. When it became clear that natural resources would power our economy, our leaders decided to set aside large portions of the state’s mineral revenue to support us in perpetuity. The easy decision — the short-sighted decision — would have been to spend those dollars on the needs of the day. They certainly could have built some nice things, and those projects would have been popular. They also would have been fleeting. Because of wise leadership and decisions that focused on the long-term, we all benefit from our state’s bounty.
Just as we are grateful for the good decisions of the past, we should be hopeful for the future. Despite our state’s challenges, there are many good reasons to have hope. First, our state is full of opportunity. We have space, natural resources, and the ability to be nimble when it comes to building regulatory structures that can support new industries. Our people are hard-working and determined. We have existing expertise in manufacturing and mining that is missing in many other parts of the country. Our climate and location give Wyoming an advantage in attracting computing facilities to locate here. If we take advantage of the opportunities in front of us, Wyoming is poised to thrive, and that gives me hope.
I am also hopeful because there appears to be a growing consensus on the issues we face, which allows us to better meet these challenges. In surveys and conversations about Wyoming’s future, the challenges of economic diversification and talent retention quickly rise to the top. We recognize where our weaknesses are, which is a significant part of the battle. Once we agree on the problem, we can work to find solutions. 
Finding a fix is often an easier undertaking than identifying the problem itself. Already, drilling into these challenges has helped us recognize the underlying problems connected to affordable housing, livable spaces, health care access and education. Understanding how these fit together and how improvements in one area can lead to improvements in others puts us on a much more manageable path. It will still not be easy to overcome our hurdles, but the fact that we must wrestle with difficult problems is not unusual or unique. We have answered big questions before. Now that we have a growing consensus on what those problems are, I am far more hopeful about our ability to move forward.
In this holiday season, we should take the time to contemplate the world around us. Self-reflection is important. We should look both behind us and ahead of us, toward the past and gratitude and the future and hope. Our state gives us plenty to consider on both accounts.

(Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)Wisconsin should make child care universally available, just as public education is, former Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes said Thursday during a child care center visit that was part of the rollout for his campaign for governor.
“I support having full, comprehensive, universal childcare,” Barnes told the Wisconsin Examiner in an interview that followed a round table session with providers, parents and child care policy analysts. “I, for sure, hope others understand the urgency of this issue, understand the complexity of it as well, and we’ll be ready to fight tooth and nail to do everything we can to improve the system for our providers, for our parents and most importantly, for the young people, for the students, for our children.”
The round table took place at the Art House Preschool, a Waunakee child care center.
Barnes is not the first Democratic hopeful in the 2026 race for governor to visit the Art House. Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley held a round table on child care issues in November at the same location. And virtually every other active Democratic primary candidate in the governor’s race mentions affordable child care on their website as a priority of their campaigns.
During his event Thursday, Barnes coupled state funding for child care with his support for better public education funding.
“If we aren’t invested in children, what are we doing as a state? What are we doing as a country?” he asked at the start of the nearly hour-long discussion. “We need to ensure, one, that our schools, K-12, are fully funded, but also that our children are ready to enter K-12. And that means that early childhood education has support.”
During most of the session, Barnes refrained from lengthy policy prescriptions and focused instead on questions for the round table participants — asking for both their biggest challenges and their “biggest ideas” for addressing Wisconsin’s child care needs.
“Direct investment to providers, I believe, would be the best to keep people from closing their doors,” said Heather Murray, the owner of Art House, who has been a child care provider for nearly two decades. “I like to call it a public good, because I don’t believe it can exist without government funding.”
Stephanie Frontz is an IT specialist and the mother of four, one of them at Art House. She recently gave birth to infant twins who are slated to be enrolled there.
“We need the help there so the state can help pay fair wages,” Frontz said. That will  ensure child care workers stay, which in turn makes it possible for more parents to work, she added. “It impacts my family and the economy if I can’t work.”
Child care providers who have a shortage of teachers reduce the hours that they’re open, said Carly Eaton, a parent whose day job is with an organized labor environmental group.
She understands why, but jobs in construction, manufacturing and especially health care often “don’t fit in the 7 a.m. to 6 a.m. hours that you may be able to find child care,” Eaton said. “To hear legislators on a certain side of the aisle talk about the worker shortage and then not do anything about child care just breaks my brain.”
During the COVID-19 pandemic, federal relief funds included money designated for child care. In Wisconsin that money went to the Child Care Counts program, which originally distributed $20 million a month to the state’s child care providers.
The monthly support was later cut in half and extended through mid-2025 after the GOP majority in the Wisconsin Legislature rejected the proposal Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, made in the 2023-25 state budget to continue the subsidy with state funds.
Evers again proposed ongoing state funding in the 2025-27 budget. “I heard a lot of people say during the last budget cycle, ‘We can’t just keep writing checks …. It didn’t work,’” said Kayla Gardner, engagement specialist at the Wisconsin Early Childhood Association. “It actually did — it very much did work.”
“When the payments were the highest, we had very few closures,” said Paula Drew, director of early childhood education policy and research at WECA. “It stabilized the field.”
When the current budget finally passed in late June, it for the first time included some direct state funding for centers, but just for one year and at a smaller amount than Evers or child care advocates originally sought.
That money helped, said Jenn Bilderback, administrative director of Big Oak Child Care in Madison. But it also came with restrictions that made it less accessible for some providers and it will go away in June 2026.
“We have to do something that’s much more universal and that allows the flexibility for a provider,” Bilderback told Barnes.
She said her center’s board of directors, most of whom are parents, have supported providing benefits — a rarity for many child care providers — and paying a living wage. “We need to do this, but the cost of living in Madison and outside Madison is increasing too high to be able to keep up with that.”
Barnes — who along with most Democrats running for elected office in the 2026 cycle has seized on affordability as a campaign theme — responded that “the cost of living is top of mind for everybody.” But then he turned back to her earlier comments.
“You mentioned ‘something more universal,’ Barnes said. “I want you to say the thing out loud. Somebody can say it — universal child care, right?”
“We do dream big, and we do think of all these things,” said Gardner. “But what we see in return is almost nothing.”
Drew said that with turnover among child care teachers, programs are often operating at less than capacity, even as parents have trouble finding care.
“We don’t necessarily, right now, need new buildings, because we’ve got 33,000 open spots . . . across the state. We need teachers that can be working in programs to open up those 33,000 spots,” Drew said. “We’ve got the demand, but we also need the supply available in early education.”
Katie Licitis, an Art House Preschool teacher, said she first took the job four years ago after she and her husband moved to Wisconsin from Georgia. For the first time, she said, she needed child care after having been a stay-at-home mom until then. But with the turnover that providers are seeing, she asked Barnes, “Do you have a plan to retain teachers?”
“You shouldn’t have to choose between a job you love and Kwik Trip, as an example, because they’re paying more money, right?” Barnes replied. “Like, that’s an indictment on the way that things have been going. And I think that’s a big part of the broader universal child care package. And I don’t think people should be shy about wanting universal child care in this state. I think that this is exactly one of those areas that Wisconsin should be a leader in the nation.”

(Photo illustration by iStock/Getty Images Plus)A federal official from Idaho is taking steps in his new post to end a nationwide practice of states collecting Social Security benefits entitled to foster youth and using it to pay for the children’s care. 
The U.S. Administration for Children and Families, or ACF, on Thursday announced it notified governors of the 39 states that had not yet taken action to end the practice of keeping foster youth’s Social Security survivor benefits. 
ACF Assistant Secretary Alex Adams previously told the Idaho Capital Sun that he’d first become aware that Idaho had done this when he became director of the state Department of Health and Welfare. 
Adams in May issued a directive to the state agency to end the practice of using Social Security survivor benefits entitled to foster youth to pay for their basic care by July 2026. The memo directed staff to either use the funds to pay for unmet needs, not typically covered for other foster youth, or conserve them for the child’s future use. 
This practice affected Idaho native Scott Matlock, a current NFL fullback for the Los Angeles Chargers and a former foster youth. Matlock entered Idaho’s child welfare system as a 13-year-old following the death of both of his parents, according to a press release from the Administration for Children and Families. He never received any of his parents’ survivor benefits. 
“I commend President (Donald) Trump, Secretary (Robert F.) Kennedy (Jr.), and Assistant Secretary Adams for taking decisive action to encourage states to protect children and ensure foster youth have a strong financial foundation,” Matlock said in the release. “My hope is the next kid coming through foster care gets every penny he or she deserves, no matter what state they live in.”
Former Idaho health official brings same foster home focus to federal post

Following Adams’ Senate nomination in October to his federal post, which resides in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, he told the Sun in a November interview he planned to address the issue at the national level. 
He said that many of the leaders in states where the practice was ongoing may not be aware of it. 
A 2021 NPR and Marshall Project report found that 49 states and Washington, D.C., had engaged in this process at the time. National attorney and advocate Amy Harfeld told the Sun she’d been campaigning across the country to end the widespread practice. At the time, she said Adams’ move to end the practice in Idaho without outside intervention set him apart. 
“Most states have not done this by themselves,” she said in a previous interview, “and so that really does distinguish (Adams) here, and it’s exciting that it distinguishes the state at this moment where he is going to have such a big stage and authority and capacity to make changes like this.”
To date, 11 states have enacted policies to prohibit taking children’s benefits, according to the ACF press release.  
“ACF and the Social Security Administration plan to provide resources, in addition to existing technical assistance, to help the remaining 39 states change this practice,” the release said.
Adams in the emailed release, said, “Every earned benefit dollar belongs to these foster youth, not the government agencies or bureaucrats. Protecting children is the core mission of child welfare, and we will keep the best interests of the child front and center in all our efforts.”

Tom Tiffany and Democratic former Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, have denounced the unlimited flow of cash into state political campaigns. Then, practically in the same breath, both men announced their plans to raise tens of millions of dollars, signalling to their less well funded primary opponents that they might as well get out of the way.
In an interview with PBS Wisconsin on Dec. 5, Tiffany criticized “that pass-through loophole, I call it the ‘billionaire loophole,’” in Wisconsin law, adding, “there’s just so much money that comes into Wisconsin.” 
“You can cry about it or you can compete,” Tiffany continued. “We choose to compete … We’re hoping to raise $40 million.”
As Baylor Spears reports, Tiffany actually voted for the “billionaire loophole” he now criticizes back when he was serving in the state Senate in 2015. 
Mandela Barnes, in a recent campaign stop in Madison, told Spears and other reporters that he has raised a “strong haul,” in the first week of his campaign, and that he intends to raise a staggering $50 million by the end of the race. He added that he doesn’t like the role of money in politics. “It’s not a good sign,” he said, and his future goal is “to get big money out of politics” and enact “campaign and ethics reform.”
Back in 2015, when Republicans were ramming through the “billionaire loophole,” Barnes opposed it, saying at the time that it would allow “shady special interest money and allow for more corruption to go undetected and unprosecuted.”
Jay Heck, executive director of Common Cause Wisconsin, remembers that moment well. Under former Republican Gov. Scott Walker, Republican legislative majorities passed the law eviscerating campaign finance limits along with other measures getting rid of the nonpartisan Government Accountability Board and eliminating the John Doe procedure that was used to criminally prosecute leaders of both political parties for campaign finance crimes in the infamous caucus scandal of the early 2000’s.
The 2015 law doubled the amount individuals could give to candidates. More importantly, it eliminated all limits on state party contributions to candidates and allowed coordination between candidates and outside groups that make issue ads supporting the campaigns. Donors were able to give as much as they wanted to political parties, which then funneled that money to candidates, creating the billionaire loophole to which Tiffany belatedly objects. The 2015 law cleared the way for outsiders like Elon Musk to pour limitless cash into state races to try to affect the outcome.
“The Republicans did that in 2015 because they were convinced that they would have a great financial advantage since they generally raised more money from donors and special interests,” says Heck. “Of course, what they didn’t anticipate was [former Wisconsin Democratic Party chair] Ben Wikler and the Democratic Party’s ability to take that big hole in the law and use it to raise massive amounts of money.”
Recently, Democrats in Wisconsin have been beating Republicans in the fundraising arms race. In 2025, in the most expensive judicial election in U.S. history, Susan Crawford, the candidate for the Wisconsin Supreme Court supported by the Democratic Party, raised $28.3 million compared with Republican-supported Brad Schimel, who raised $15.1 million. Outside special interests accounted for most of the spending on the race, with Musk alone putting in nearly $20 million through his political action committees and millions more laundered through the state Republican Party for Schimel, while the Democratic Party of Wisconsin funneled $10 million to Crawford.
The lesson of the 2015 law, says Heck, is, “be careful what you wish for.”
That certainly applies to Republicans, who lost the two most expensive state Supreme Court races in history as well as the last two record-breaking gubernatorial races won by Gov. Tony Evers with $93 million in total spending in 2018 and $164 million in 2022. 
But it also applies to Democrats, who cannot count on continually bringing in more money than Republicans.
More importantly, when it costs tens of millions of dollars to win state elections, regular voters’ voices are drowned out by billionaires, who are not investing in candidates just out of the goodness of their hearts.
Heck believes that change will only come when voters demand reform, most likely because a big scandal clearly illustrates that politicians are doing favors for their donors in exchange for campaign cash.
“It’s going to require a bipartisan coming-together to establish some limits,” Heck says. 
Even as the U.S. Supreme Court has opened the floodgate for campaign spending with the Citizens United decision, which in 2010 struck down a federal ban on political donations from corporations, and McCutcheon v. FEC, which in 2014 found that annual caps on total political donations from one person are unconstitutional, states have the ability to impose limits. 
A report by the National Conference of State Legislatures shows Wisconsin is one of only 11 states that allow unlimited candidate contributions by state parties and among the top 10 for the highest limits on PAC contributions to candidates. Minnesota, Michigan, Illinois and most other states limit how much political parties can accept, which reduces the Elon Musk effect. Plus, “We are one of few states that allows so-called coordination between political candidates and outside groups,” Heck says.
The problem is that candidates, while acknowledging that massive amounts of money fueling their campaigns is a bad look, don’t want to unilaterally disarm. 
But now, as the Trump administration drags the country to new levels of overt corruption, it could be a good time for a campaign that ties together billionaires’ destructive influence on society and the fact that they are buying our democracy. 
“There has to be public disgust with the amount of money being spent,” says Heck. “If a candidate put corruption front and center, it might get a lot of traction.”

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)With the Affordable Care Act subsidies on the chopping block in the Republican-controlled Congress, it’s no surprise the Lee newspapers did an interview with Montana’s former senator Max Baucus.  As the chairman of the Senate’s powerful Finance Committee, Baucus “was chief architect of the Affordable Care Act known as “Obamacare.”
According to Baucus: “For 15 months, I had the committee work on health care, and it was totally nonpolitical. I had several rules. One is if anybody gets political, I’m cutting them off at the knees. We’re trying to address something here, honestly. Second, if anybody has a problem, they’ve got to bring a solution. Third, nothing is off the table. We’re going to consider everything.”
It’s not unusual for politicians to attempt to rewrite history to smooth over the blemishes and polish the successes.  That’s what politicians generally do.  A couple great examples, “the 2020 election was stolen” and on Jan. 6, 2021 the mob that stormed Congress and sent Representatives and Senators fleeing for their lives were merely “tourists.” 
To be kind, perhaps at Baucus’ age of 84 some details of the past aren’t quite remembered correctly. And things definitely look different from Washington, D.C., than they do here in Montana.  But the fact is, Baucus’ rendition of history is lacking some very significant details about the formulation of Obamacare, namely what got considered and what did not, and who did the considering. 
Many of the Montanans who were actively involved in attempting to provide their input to Baucus have passed on, including Eric Feaver, who was the head of Montana’s largest union at the time and who would certainly dispute Baucus’ claim that “nothing is off the table, we’re going to consider everything” when it came to formulating the legislation. 
The fact is Feaver, and the union he led as well as unions nationwide and thousands of Montanans, did not support Baucus’ plan to stick the insurance industry squarely between patients and their health care providers.  What they did support wholeheartedly was a single-payer system – which did not include the rapacious health insurance industry and assured citizens they would be covered for their treatments by a single public system without ever-rising premiums, co-pays and out-of-pocket costs.  Baucus, however, said single payer was “off the table.” 
Make no mistake, Feaver, his union members, and hundreds of Montanans didn’t just send emails or phone calls to Baucus’ office, they demonstrated all over the state, gave speeches, and marched en masse to his Helena office to protest his plan and support single payer —not just once, but many times, including once when the large crowd arrived to find the doors to Baucus’ Helena office locked in mid-day presumably because Baucus didn’t want to hear what they had to say. 
In the meantime, back in D.C., Baucus had hired Liz Fowler, a former insurance industry executive, as his chief health counsel on the Finance Committee.  As noted in an interesting interview with Fowler, she admits that President Obama did not support Baucus’ mandate that individuals must purchase health insurance.  Unfortunately, Obama got the same reception we Montanans got — and the bill included the insurance mandate, putting the insurance industry firmly in charge of Americans’ health care.
Were it not for that mandate, the current concern over millions of citizens losing their health coverage because Congress won’t extend the subsidies wouldn’t exist.  
Moreover, Democrats controlled majorities in both chambers of Congress and had Obama in the White House.  They didn’t need to appease Republicans and they could have passed real health care, not increasingly expensive health insurance in the misnamed “Affordable Care Act” — which isn’t affordable.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/chuckschumeroct15-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-12 06:57:36.004710

The department’s budget shrank 26% over the 14 year period, pulled from an analysis of public records provided by the department. As the Trump administration sheds staff and funding at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, a new analysis places Louisiana among states that have notably slashed their pollution regulation resources even as industry expands.
The report from the Environmental Integrity Project evaluated staffing and changes in operating budgets at Louisiana’s Department of Environmental Quality and comparable agencies in other states. From 2010 through 2024, the numbers show the agency’s personnel count decreased 24% with 222 positions eliminated from the agency. The department’s budget shrank 26% over the 14 year period, pulled from an analysis of public records provided by the department. 
“These cuts increase the risk that residents will face higher levels of pollution, especially if the EPA lacks the funding and capacity to do its job,” Environmental Integrity Project executive director Jen Duggan said Wednesday during a news conference for the report’s release.
“In Louisiana, we feel them deeply,” said Anne Rolfes, director of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade who also took part in the news conference.
The report focused on the Department of Environmental Quality’s operating budget, or the money it spends to handle day-to-day tasks such as paying employees, maintaining facilities, lab analysis and grants to local governments. Large loans and federal grants, which are considered as capital costs, were excluded from the analysis where possible to avoid outliers because they vary widely from year to year and “do not measure a state’s capacity” to limit pollution, according to the report’s methodology.
The staffing cuts at Louisiana’s Department of Environmental Quality are “among the most of any state,” according to the report. Other standouts included Mississippi, which reduced its environmental agency funding 71% from 2010 to 2024.
On the other end of the spectrum is California, which increased its environmental operating budget by 364% over the same 14 years.
At the federal level, the Trump administration has said it intends to bring the EPA’s employee count down to levels last seen during the Reagan era, when the agency had between 11,000 and 14,000 people of staff, NPR reported. It began Trump’s second term with about 15,000 employees.
The majority of environmental agency staffing cuts in Louisiana happened during Bobby Jindal’s terms as governor from 2008-16. The Department of Environmental Quality has not seen significant hiring or funding boosts dating back to Edwin Edwards’ fourth term as governor from 1992-96. 
The agency’s boldest policy moves came after Gov. Buddy Roemer took office in 1988. He  placed environmental scientist Paul Templet in charge of Environmental Quality, and the administration tied industrial incentives to benchmarks for reducing pollution. Since Roemer lost his reelection bid in 1991, governors who have succeeded him have, to varying degrees, urged cooperation with industry. 
The Environmental Integrity Project report points out cuts in Department of Environmental Quality staff and funding come as Louisiana sees a boom in industrial investment. The number of facilities seeking air pollution control permits from the state rose 29% from 2016-24, with 1,906 applications last year according to the report’s analysis of public records. 
A spokesman for the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality responded to the report in a statement, saying the department meets all federal grant requirements and performance expectations while prioritizing “efficiency” and remaining “fully committed” to environmental protection. 
The department has implemented an expedited permitting program to make up for its staffing shortages, allowing applicants to pay for agency staff members’ overtime as they work on the approval process. 
Rolfes cites issues with this process in the report, saying it creates a conflict of interest. 
“When you cut the resources of the agencies, you further depend on the companies themselves as the source of payment for permit writers — and that is an inherent conflict,” Rolfes wrote in the report. “When you have the company paying your overtime, you are just not going to ask the questions and scrutinize it the way you would if your salaries were being paid by the public.”
The analysis also identified Louisiana as having the highest amount of toxic air emissions per square mile of any state in the country. Staffing shortages also play a role in delayed response time to pollution issues, according to the report.
In 2019, the Environmental Integrity Project report counted only 10 LDEQ employees who handled all air enforcement actions at more than 500 major industrial facilities and hundreds more smaller locations. A Louisiana Legislative Auditor’s report from 2021 also found the department was understaffed and could do more to address air pollution violations.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/smokestacks.jpg,,,2025-12-12 06:57:36.004710

(Photos: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Nashville car magnate and political donor Lee Beaman is distancing himself from a federal investigation into the campaign finance filings of U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles.
But playing dumb about being named treasurer for Ogles’ first congressional campaign in 2022 couldn’t keep his nomination for a post on the Tennessee Valley Authority Board of Directors from being postponed this week. It is unclear when, or if, it will be revived by the U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. 
When Senate Democrats grilled him in a hearing last week, Beaman said he served as Ogles’ campaign treasurer for only four months. But he filed written responses afterward repeatedly saying he never agreed to be Ogles’ treasurer and had no knowledge of a questionable $320,000 loan Ogles reported on a Federal Election Commission filing. Beaman said Ogles asked him in a text message to serve as campaign treasurer in early 2022 but that he didn’t answer.
Despite not agreeing to take the job, Beaman said in his official responses to senators he thought it was an “honorary” position and that he didn’t sign any FEC reports even though his name appeared on them. 
This wasn’t Beaman’s first deal with Ogles. As ProPublica reported in March, Beaman said he planned to raise $4 million in 2017 when Ogles announced a bid for U.S. Senate that didn’t come to fruition.
Tennessee U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles’ campaign finance reports still don’t add up

An Ogles spokesperson didn’t respond to a request for comment.
None of the senators asked Beaman whether he thought Ogles committed fraud by putting his name on FEC documents without permission.
The former owner of multiple Nashville auto dealerships and Beaman Bottling Company said he asked that he be removed as treasurer after seeing an ad listing his name.
Previously, the House Ethics Committee found Ogles likely violated federal campaign finance laws, mainly by reporting an inflated personal loan to make his bid for office look stronger in 2022. Ogles initially said he raised $450,000 for the race, yet his first FEC report showed he brought in only $250,000.
Ogles amended campaign finance reports in May 2024 and acknowledged making a $20,000 loan to his campaign and saying the additional $300,000 was in a joint account he shared with his wife.
Beaman said he had “nothing to do” with the FEC report filed in July 2022 showing the $320,000 loan and wasn’t familiar with allegations surrounding it until they were reported by local media much later.
According to committee questioning, the Ogles for Congress campaign issued a press release in July 2022 stating that Ogles “did direct donors to a few independent expenditure groups they were planning to assist in my getting elected.”
Beaman, though, said other than being a donor, during his time as campaign chairman he wasn’t overly involved in a dark money-group called Volunteers for Freedom Super PAC that backed Ogles’ candidacy three years ago. It’s illegal for campaigns and PACs whose money is not traceable to coordinate.

Beaman said he and his attorney started researching the dark-money question but didn’t know about a “donor-direction scheme” by Ogles because he didn’t know he was the campaign treasurer.
None of this scared Beaman off of political work: He and his wife, Julie, a former Williamson County Republican Party chair, recently served as co-chairs for U.S. Rep. Matt Van Epps’ campaign. 
But despite asking to be removed as treasurer, Beaman said he didn’t become aware Ogles became treasurer for a short time until after the House Ethics Committee contacted him in September 2025. Political operative Thomas Datwyler, who also has numerous questions surrounding his work, then took the job.
“I am aware of certain prohibitions. My only involvement was as a donor to the Ogles campaign and to the Volunteers for Freedom Super PAC. I did not engage in any coordinated activity between these two entities,” said Beaman, who was removed from the Belmont University Board of Trustees in 2018 following salacious accusations against him in divorce proceedings. He returned to the board in 2021.
One Democratic senator broached the allegations Beaman’s ex-wife made but declined to specify them in the hearing because they’re just too embarrassing.
“Deja vu all over again”
With apologies to the late Yankees Hall of Famer Yogi Berra, we’ve been here before.
When the Tennessee Supreme Court sided with Gov. Bill Lee, striking down a challenge of his first private-school voucher law, it ran a flanking maneuver around the state’s Home Rule Amendment, which requires approval from local governments when targeted by the legislature. In short, the court decided Metro Nashville Public Schools aren’t part of the Metro Nashville government, or some such nincompoopery.
Yogi’s redundancy is fitting here because, once again, the Supreme Court found that the Constitution doesn’t mean what it says, this time in regard to a challenge of Senate redistricting maps the legislature adopted in 2022.
In split rulings that would leave 99.99% of the public in complete confusion, the court ruled against Nashville resident Francie Hunt’s challenge of Senate redistricting maps, deciding she didn’t even have standing to sue. Hunt claimed the Senate plan was unconstitutional in that it failed to enact consecutively numbered districts in Davidson County to ensure two districts would be selected during a presidential election year and two in a gubernatorial election year.
Supremely unconstitutional? A ruling by the Tennessee Supreme Court struck down an earlier ruling on a 2022 legislative redistricting plan. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
The idea is to keep most or all of the Senate seats in counties with multiple districts from changing in one fell swoop.
But the court found Hunt couldn’t even prove enough injury to sue, only that she was wronged in a legal sense. Thus, it never really resolved the argument.
Only Justice Holly Kirby, who is retiring from the court halfway through 2026, had the guts to say there was no precedent or legal basis for the ruling. She was appointed to the court by former Gov. Bill Haslam.
Meanwhile, the justices found that Gibson County resident Gary Wygant had standing to challenge the House redistricting map that split his county in two. But it decided his challenge could affect only Gibson County, not the rest of the state. 
Of course, the House districts in Gibson County could be reconfigured only if others were redrawn to reach the right numbers and racial requirements, so why bother?
Under the law, districts can be drawn to protect incumbents.
District 18 held by Republican Sen. Ferrell Haile of Gallatin had to be reshaped to take in tiny Trousdale County. Previously, it contained Old Hickory and other parts of Davidson County, ensuring Metro Nashville had consecutively-numbered Senate districts.
The Republican-controlled Senate redrew Lebanon Sen. Mark Pody’s District 17 out of rural counties into the Donelson/Percy Priest area, which wouldn’t necessarily protect his seat in 2026.
That move made it easier for Republican Sen. Shane Reeves of Murfreesboro to keep his post southeast of Nashville.
Lt. Gov. Randy McNally, obviously, was pleased with the decision.
“We carefully and cautiously drew a fair and legal map and I am grateful the court has allowed that map to stand,” McNally said in a statement. 
McNally and Secretary of State Tre Hargett congratulated Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti and his office on the win.
Democrats weren’t quite as enthused, saying the Supreme Court relinquished its authority to keep the legislature and executive branch in check.










That is a breathtaking step backward. This is the kind of radical decision that wipes away constitutional protections for the sake of insulating political power.


– Sen. London Lamar, D-Memphis


“Courts exist to safeguard our constitutional rights, not to create new barriers for citizens who seek to enforce them. I am deeply concerned that this decision closes the courthouse doors to everyday citizens and erodes the balance of powers our Constitution requires,” said Democratic Sen. Raumesh Akbari of Memphis.
Democratic Sen. London Lamar of Memphis called the ruling “devastating” for people who believe they have at least a shred of constitutional rights.
“That is a breathtaking step backward. This is the kind of radical decision that wipes away constitutional protections for the sake of insulating political power,” Lamar said in a statement.
Democrats point out the Supreme Court holds the distinction of being the nation’s first court to rule that a citizen lacks the legal right to challenge the constitutionality of their own voting district.
It’s not clear when the trophies will be handed out for this groundbreaking decision. But we have a feeling similar ones will follow. The justices need only perform a few legal cartwheels and, man, they’re already there.
Late lawmaker replaced
The Montgomery County Commission voted this week to fill the District 75 seat left vacant by the death of Rep. Jeff Burkhart of Clarksville.
According to ClarksvilleNow, Mayor Wes Golden broke a tie vote to make County Commissioner Michael Lankford the new representative, edging out Democrat Allie Phillips. Phillips ran against Burkhart in 2024.
Lankford will fill the rest of Burkhart’s term until elections in 2026. 
We’ll see whether he can stand the excitement.
Heavy hearts
Lawmakers are mourning the death of former House Majority Leader Gerald McCormick this week after a battle with Lou Gehrig’s disease.
“Though we stood on different sides of the aisle, as the Republican Majority Leader, he approached his position with fairness, integrity, and a genuine willingness to listen,” said House Democratic Leader Karen Camper.

Democratic Rep. John Ray Clemmons added that those who worked with McCormick will “miss his quick smile and hearty handshake.”
House Republicans said in a statement they are “heartbroken” over the death of McCormick.
“As a United States Army veteran, legislator and House majority leader, McCormick played a pivotal role in advancing the values and freedoms that make our state and our nation a beacon of success,” the caucus said.
McCormick left the legislature in 2018 and sold his Chattanooga house, acknowledging that Nashville was becoming his primary home. 
While lawmakers remember him fondly, a few folks probably recall he was good at delivering what some would refer to as an old-fashioned butt chewing, and that’s putting it kindly.

(Photo courtesy of the U.S. Forest Service)Mountain States Policy Center’s senior policy analyst Madi Clark recently argued that the Fix Our Forests Act may be enough to fix our public lands management backlog. In truth, the act is not just inadequate — it is a bad bill that risks deepening the very problems it claims to solve. By doubling down on outdated strategies and prioritizing logging interests, the act distracts from the real solutions Idaho needs: climate‑smart management and investments in community safety through home hardening and defensible space.
The Fix Our Forests Act leans heavily on thinning and prescribed burns as its primary tools. While these practices can play a role in targeted areas, they are not panaceas. Broad‑brush thinning often destabilizes ecosystems, removes critical wildlife habitat, and can even increase fire spread when not carefully planned.
Fix Our Forests Act may be enough to fix our public lands management backlog

Even more troubling, many logging operations conducted under the guise of “forest restoration” remove large‑diameter, fire‑resistant trees — the very trees most capable of surviving wildfire and anchoring healthy forest ecosystems. Stripping out these natural firebreaks leaves forests more vulnerable, not less.
The bill’s emphasis on “restoration” masks a troubling reality: It opens the door to expanded logging under the guise of wildfire prevention. This approach prioritizes timber industry profits over ecological resilience. Idahoans deserve legislation that protects forests for recreation, wildlife, and water resources — not one that commodifies them for short‑term gain.
Perhaps the most glaring flaw in the act is its silence on climate change. Wildfires are intensifying because summers are hotter, droughts are more prolonged, and snowpack is shrinking. Without integrating climate adaptation strategies — watershed protection, carbon sequestration, biodiversity safeguards — the Fix Our Forests Act is little more than a Band‑Aid on a gaping wound. Ignoring climate realities ensures that any gains from thinning or burning will be quickly erased by the next megafire season.
Clark frames the act as a way to reduce the backlog, but in practice, it adds new layers of bureaucracy while failing to address structural inefficiencies. Agencies will be tasked with more paperwork and reporting requirements, diverting resources from actual on‑the‑ground restoration. The backlog will grow, not shrink.
Most troubling, the act does little to empower local communities, tribes, or private landowners who are essential partners in wildfire prevention. Instead, it centralizes decision‑making in Washington, D.C., sidelining the very people most affected by forest mismanagement. Idahoans know their landscapes best — yet the Fix Our Forests Act leaves them on the margins.
If Congress truly wants to protect lives and property, funding should prioritize home hardening and defensible space, not more logging projects. Research consistently shows that the most effective way to reduce wildfire losses is to make homes themselves more fire‑resistant and to create defensible zones around them.
Home Hardening: Fire‑resistant roofing, ember‑resistant vents, and non‑combustible siding dramatically reduce the chance of ignition.
Defensible Space: Clearing brush, spacing trees, and removing flammable materials within 30–100 feet of structures creates a buffer that slows fire spread and gives firefighters a chance to defend homes, and in combination with home hardening reduces the risk of home ignition by 50%.
Cost‑Effectiveness: Dollar for dollar, investments in home hardening and defensible space save more lives and property than large‑scale thinning projects miles away from communities.
The act fails to prioritize these proven strategies. Instead of pouring money into logging contracts — often removing the very fire‑resistant trees that stabilize forests — Congress should direct resources toward grants and programs that help homeowners, local governments, and tribes implement fire‑safe practices. Protecting communities where people actually live must come first.
The Fix Our Forests Act is a bad bill. By prioritizing logging interests, ignoring climate realities, and neglecting community safety, it risks worsening the backlog it claims to fix. Idaho’s forests, indeed all forests, and the people who live near them, deserve better. Real solutions lie not in more bureaucracy and timber contracts, but in climate‑smart management and investments in home hardening and defensible space. As climate change accelerates wildfire intensity and frequency, legislation that fails to confront this reality leaves communities dangerously exposed. Protecting lives and landscapes requires policies that meet the scale of the climate‑driven fire crisis head‑on. Anything less is a dangerous distraction.

You may or may not notice it as you travel along the Front Range, but the world’s digital infrastructure is rapidly taking root here.
 Warehouses full of hyper-efficient computers powering everything from email to artificial intelligence. Denver alone projects nearly a 200% increase in data center growth, while utilities like Xcel Energy warn they will need $22 billion in new infrastructure to meet the rising demand for electricity.

Some are calling the Interstate 25 corridor “Data Center Row.” Others see potential for jobs and an increased tax base. And many Coloradans are asking a reasonable question: What does all this development actually mean for our communities, our water, our climate, and our energy bills?

As a researcher who studies the political and environmental dimensions of emerging technologies, the reality is this: Data centers are reshaping Colorado’s environmental and economic landscape in real time, and we need smart, transparent policy to guide that growth.
The scale is new, and enormous
A single AI-oriented data center can use as much electricity as 175,000 homes. Colorado has more than 60 data centers already, most clustered along the Front Range. Dozens more facilities, some exceeding 160 megawatts of power capacity, are planned or under construction.
This growth isn’t happening in isolation. Two federal executive orders issued this year removed environmental guardrails and fast-tracked data center construction nationwide. Colorado, eager not to lose investment to competitors like Texas, Iowa and Wyoming, has responded with tax incentives and the proposed “Data Center Development and Grid Modernization Act,” which sought to trade subsidies for basic energy and water stewardship requirements.
But even with efficiency improvements, the sheer scale of AI adoption means electricity demand is rising steeply, and the 1970s-era infrastructure we have isn’t built for the capacity of demand. Xcel projects that by 2040, data centers alone could require 8.5 gigawatts of power, roughly the equivalent of adding another Denver metro area to the grid.
The environmental impact is complex
Data centers are frequently criticized for their significant water needs and potential to strain local utilities. And it’s true that some proposed facilities in Colorado could consume hundreds of thousands of gallons per day if they rely on conventional evaporative cooling, putting a significant strain on an already scarce regional water supply.
But some newer facilities are adopting lower-water or water-free cooling technologies, such as liquid cooling, adiabatic systems and air-side economization. Still, these technologies are not yet industry-wide, and the cumulative effects of rapid data center growth could place real pressure on Colorado’s limited water supplies.
Energy use is also a key concern. Data centers currently account for 4.4% of U.S. electricity demand, and with rapid AI growth, that number could triple within a few years. Utilities may pass infrastructure costs on to ratepayers. And Colorado’s grid is still far from fully decarbonized. More load without more clean energy risks prolonging fossil fuel reliance.
Social impacts
Communities across the country have pushed back on data center proposals because of noise, diesel backup generators, light pollution, and secrecy around energy and water use. Colorado is starting to see the same concerns, particularly concerning the 600,000 square-foot center under construction in Denver’s densely populated Elyria-Swansea neighborhood.
Transparency remains a major problem. Some companies claim that disclosing energy or water use gives competitors an edge, leaving neighbors and local governments in the dark. And local officials, eager for economic development, may grant tax breaks without fully understanding long-term costs: increased grid infrastructure needs, potential rate hikes and land-use tradeoffs.
Meanwhile, the jobs picture is mixed. Construction jobs are plentiful, but once built, even massive data centers often employ fewer than 100 workers.
What can Colorado do?
Data centers are not going away; they are the backbone of the growing digital economy. But without effective policy, we risk letting the industry set the terms. Colorado can lead nationally by pursuing three principles:

 Require full transparency on water, energy and emissions. Every data center should publicly report annual water use, cooling methods, electricity consumption and backup generator operations. Communities deserve to know what is being built in their backyard.
 Tie incentives to real climate commitments.
 • 100% clean electricity procurement
 • Water-efficient or water-free cooling technologies
 • Investments in grid modernization that don’t fall solely on ratepayers
Colorado’s recent attempt — SB-280 — moved in this direction before collapsing under pressure. It should be revived and strengthened.
 Plan for regional impacts, not project-by-project approvals.
A single data center is manageable. Dozens clustered together can reshape electricity demand, land use and noise levels for an entire region. Colorado needs coordinated regional planning to avoid the chaotic landscapes seen elsewhere.

The reality is, data centers are foundational to how we live in the world today, and more so in the future. We know how to build them better, with community input and more sustainable resource use. We should demand that the infrastructure powering AI and the broader digital economy operates within Colorado’s environmental limits and contributes to a livable, resilient future.
If we get this right, Colorado can be a national leader in responsible AI infrastructure. If we get it wrong, we’ll spend decades trying to retrofit the consequences.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Austin Anthony)Strange as it seems, the Democratic Party has a remarkable roster of candidates to succeed retiring Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell next year.
Former state Rep. Charles Booker has run for senator twice before and been nominated once, and led his primary foes by 3 points in a mid-October poll.
Right behind him was Amy McGrath, a former Marine fighter pilot who gave the likeliest Republican nominee a tough, close race for his congressional seat seven years ago.
Far behind were Pam Stevenson, a retired Air Force colonel and minister who led her party caucus in the state House; Logan Forsythe, a Lexington lawyer and former Secret Service agent from West Kentucky; and Louisville businessman Joel Willett, a former CIA officer who has impressed party leaders.
After the poll was taken, horse trainer Dale Romans entered, with the sort of profile that could win the seat: a middle-roader like West Virginia’s Joe Manchin, backed by Democratic strategist James Carville, and the encouragement of Gov. Andy Beshear.
Kentucky is not on national pundits’ list of Senate seats that Democrats are supposed to have any chance of flipping, and Republicans consider the race “a sure-thing slam dunk,” as GOP strategist Tres Watson said last week.
But in the Donald Trump era, nothing is a sure thing. Though Trump is the main reason Republicans are confident, he’s also one reason Democrats think the Senate nomination is worth something. His national job ratings are about as low as they were just after Jan. 6, 2021, and are falling in Kentucky, which he won by 29 points. One recent poll had his net approval (positive minus negative) here at only 2 points; another had it at 14.
Trump’s doing better in Tennessee, but voters there gave Republicans a scare in a special congressional election this month. A moderate Democrat might have flipped the seat.
Republicans all over are starting to distance themselves from Trump, his behavior, his handling of the economy and his controversial appointees, but Kentucky’s three Republican candidates for senator are putting no distance between themselves and the president, since his endorsement in the race would likely be dispositive. But if his actions and those of his administration become much more objectionable, the Republican nominee could find himself in a disreputable ditch with an unpopular leader.
Among Republican candidates, former attorney general Daniel Cameron leads in polls, but 6th District Rep. Andy Barr is gaining and has a big fundraising advantage. Businessman Nate Morris trails, but has the best ties to Trump and is getting help from MAGA information channels unfavorable to Barr. Elizabethtown businessman Michael Faris is also seeking the GOP nomination.
All the major Democrats have assets and liabilities. Booker and Stevenson are unabashed liberals and African Americans in a  conservative state where racism still matters. McGrath lost credibility in 2020 when she out-raised McConnell and still lost to him by 20 points (after barely defeating Booker in a primary with unusual circumstances). Forsythe and Willett are unknown and will have trouble getting attention, but have overcome adversity before, and Willett has loaned his campaign $200,000.
Romans may have the most potential, pro and con. He is the most conservative Democrat, but still in the party mainstream on issues such as abortion, health care and immigration — about which he speaks knowledgeably; it’s an issue for the horse industry. But he paid a big fine for immigration violations over a decade ago, and has had other legal issues.
“I have not totally vetted him,” Carville said in an interview, “but I know his reputation in the industry is pretty solid.” Carville quit doing hired political work long ago, but still picks favorites and has promoted Romans. “If Democrats are gonna be competitive in places like Kentucky, we’re gonna need these kind of candidates,” he said. “I told him he can use my name; we need to encourage people like this to run as Democrats.”
Beshear encouraged him, Romans told the Paulick Report, a horse-industry publication: “The governor is a friend of mine and I talked to him about it before I ever decided to run. He said it was a good idea: ‘Get out there and run’ and that it was a very noble thing to do.”
Beshear would be Democrats’ best nominee, but a loss would greatly complicate his plan to run for president in 2028. Democrats are anxious to see if he will at last make good on his responsibility as party leader to recruit Democrats for legislative and local races.
State Democratic Party Executive Director Morgan Eaves said she expects more Democrats to run for the legislature than in 2024. Being in a lopsided minority is no fun, but she said potential candidates “are hearing from people in their communities the reality of the Republican agenda. … They understand that Republicans were once in the superminority too, and you’ve got to claw your way out, and they’ve got to be part of the solution.” The Senate race, at the top of the ticket, will matter.

(Peter Hall/Capital-Star)Gov. Josh Shapiro is urging federal energy officials to consider comments from consumer advocates, state utility regulators and power companies before deciding a case that could determine how AI data centers and other large electricity users connect to the grid.
The Shapiro administration filed a motion Wednesday with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) opposing a request to dismiss the case. It was made by groups representing electricity generators and Amazon, Google, Microsoft and other hyperscalers that plan to build data centers across the country.
“The commission must not take an extraordinary approach that would close the record before parties have an opportunity to be heard,” the filing by Shapiro’s Office of General Council says. ”It would be an error for the commission to deviate from its usual practice of assessing a complaint based on a fully developed record, particularly given the matters of such critical impact to affordable, reliable service throughout PJM.”

PJM Interconnection is the regional transmission organization that manages the electricity market and transmission for Pennsylvania, 12 other states from New Jersey to Illinois and the District of Columbia. The organization is in the midst of an expedited process to determine new rules to govern when data centers can connect to the grid. 
PJM’s independent market monitor proposed a set of rules that would bar data centers, which can consume as much power as a small city, from connecting unless there is sufficient generating and transmission capacity to serve them without blackouts affecting other customers.
The monitor, Market Analytics, a Pennsylvania company that serves a watchdog for PJM, filed a complaint with FERC last month asserting that its proposal – effectively a moratorium on new data centers – is the only way PJM can meet its mandate to protect reliable and affordable electricity access across its region.
The Data Center Coalition and PJM Power Providers Group argued the case should be dismissed on procedural grounds and that requiring stakeholders to submit briefs would be “a distraction and a waste of time when the industry and nation can least afford it.”
Data centers provide the computing power to train artificial intelligence. Proponents, including President Donald Trump, say improving AI is a matter of national security and cast it as a technological race with China.
Data center development across PJM’s territory has contributed to rising energy costs and peak demand that is forecast to grow by 20% over the next decade, according to PJM’s forecast.

Growing demand has already driven up the price that generating companies get for keeping power stations on standby to meet peak demands. Despite an agreement between the Shapiro administration and PJM capping prices until next year, energy costs for consumers have increased and are projected to continue rising. 
The Critical Issue Fast Track process PJM is using to determine new rules for data centers drew a dozen proposals that were presented and voted on by stakeholder groups at a meeting of the organization’s board of managers Nov. 19. Although the votes are only advisory for PJM’s board of managers, which will make the final decision, none reached the two-thirds majority threshold to be approved.
“The solutions offered by PJM and most stakeholders simply assume that PJM must agree to add large loads to the system when the loads cannot be served reliably,” Monitoring Analytics’ FERC complaint states.
The independent monitor argues PJM has the authority to make data centers wait, and in order to protect reliability and affordability, that is the only viable solution. 
Nearly 40 companies, government agencies and individuals have filed motions to intervene in the case. FERC has set a deadline Monday for comments.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_8692-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-12 05:57:04.660141

(Photo by Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger addressed the Virginia Press Association and contextualized key challenges she and legislators will face when she takes office in January. Addressing the state’s energy crisis is near the top of that list, as power demands ramp up largely due to the growth of high-powered data centers throughout the state.
Spanberger said she would be interested in revising the landmark Virginia Clean Economy Act to allow for an expansion of battery storage that allows for solar power to be dispatched hours after it is collected.
“Five years ago, when that bill was first passed, technology wasn’t where it is now. We have been employing in Virginia some energy storage infrastructure (but) certainly not nearly enough,” Spanberger said. “Having storage capacity will allow us to mitigate some of the ebbs and flows that can create, in some cases, brownouts.”
The state has seen more peak energy demand days. Dominion Energy saw 10 peak energy days this year reaching a total of 25 gigawatts of power being used at one time. They also have an estimated 47 gigawatts worth of data centers in the queue to be eventually energized, according to Scott Gaskill, vice president of regulatory affairs for Dominion. 
There are alternative energy sources but they aren’t all viable in the near term, the incoming governor said. Gas energy projects, such as the Chesterfield Energy Reliability Center, are projected to take at least five years to be built due to delays in getting gas turbines. Small Modular Reactors are about a decade away from coming online in a widespread way. Bolstering solar power is the fastest way to bring more power online to meet demand and keep costs from skyrocketing, Spanberger said.
“I support looking towards energy generation of the future, like SMRs, but we’re still 10-plus years away from that,” Spanberger said. “There’s benefit to renewable energy in that it can be realized much and certainly as someone working to lower costs – meet the moment and ensure that we’re generating enough energy. We will continue to need a mix of energy generation into the future.”
Virginia hospitals, clinics brace for federal health care changes

As the U.S. Senate deadlocked on a measure to extend the Affordable Care Act enhanced tax credits Thursday — which, if they expire at the end of this month, will cause millions of Americans’ insurance premiums to skyrocket — Spanberger weighed in on how to tackle health care challenges in Virginia. 
Over 600,000 Virginians could lose Medicaid coverage and be subjected to new work requirements under a giant reconciliation bill Congress passed this summer. Spanberger said the state needs to position itself to help people complete their paperwork in time to prevent them from losing coverage.
“We have to put our full attention to making sure that we can verify people’s employment quickly, efficiently, effectively, so that people don’t fall through the cracks, essentially creating scaffolding that allows for Medicaid coverage to continue,” Spanberger said.
Virginia hospitals and health clinics, especially in rural areas, remain concerned about potential cuts to their staff or services. Experts estimate the health care facilities could take a $2 billion hit once the federal changes are implemented. 
Spanberger highlighted that the state does not have enough money to backfill the full loss of federal funding. 
The governor-elect also said that the federal funding bill changed how much money students can borrow. She said these limitations will have an impact on people who want to become medical professionals but may not be able to afford schooling. She said the state could consider loan repayment programs or other ways to help overcome the financial barriers to higher education.
“It’s a problem of (Congress’) kind of ill conceived creation that will have real significant impact if we don’t figure out a way to contend with it, or frankly, just put such broad pressure on Congress for them to pass a walk back to some of their worst ideas,” Spanberger said.

(Photo courtesy NBC12)More than half of Virginia’s schools are exceeding or meeting the state’s academic expectations and made gains in achievement, graduation rates, growth and readiness, according to data from the Virginia Department of Education on Wednesday.
Performance data presented to the Board of Education also showed that more schools met the state’s standards to be fully accredited based on 2024-25 data compared to the previous year.
Wednesday’s results come after a years-long effort by Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration to address a “flawed” accreditation system to provide clear and more accurate student performance results.
“Our Student Performance and Support Framework is …providing timely, trustworthy data so we can target support to the students, schools and communities who need it most, and we can all learn from our Distinguished top-performing schools,” Youngkin said in a statement on social media. “This is how we prepare every student for success in life, whether they enroll in college, find employment in a great career, or enlist in our military.”
Since the beginning of Youngkin’s term in 2022, the agency has begun overhauling the accreditation system to improve overall clarity and transparency and deliver better, more actionable information, according to the agency.
Last year, the Board of Education opted to split the system, referred to as the state’s School Performance and Support Framework, into two for the current school year — assessing whether schools are meeting all state and federal regulations, and providing prompt and transparent information on school and student performance.
The data from the new accountability system shows that 66% of schools are exceeding or meeting state expectations for achievement, graduation, growth and readiness.
A total of 425 schools were identified as “distinguished” in the report, and 774 schools were labeled “on track.”
In addition, 399 schools were identified as “off track,”  while 213 schools were marked as “needs intensive support,” meaning they are not meeting any of the state’s expectations.
Agency data also stated that more than half of elementary schools demonstrated significant student growth in reading and math, and graduation rates remain stable compared to the last two school years. 
VDOE said the release was delayed to validate the results, which were conducted by Old Dominion University’s Virginia Modeling, Analysis and Simulation Center. The “added step promotes transparency and reinforces confidence and trust in the final framework outcomes” before providing summaries to school divisions, the agency said.
“Our goal of transparency has seemingly been achieved here, and it’s not just transparency for ‘gotcha,’ it’s transparency for growth, transparency for continuous improvement,” said Board President Grace Creasey, who was appointed by Youngkin, on Wednesday.
Superintendent of Public Instruction Emily Anne Gullickson congratulated the team on their work and said she looks forward to seeing how the results will help students.
“I am just so excited about what this means and possibility for every student,” Gullickson said.
Accreditation data showed that 94% of schools were fully accredited in 2024-25, compared to 85% in 2024-25.
“I’m excited… to have such clarity on what it means to become accredited,” said Board Member Beth Ackerman, a Youngkin appointee, at the board’s work session on Wednesday. However, she cautioned the department against relying solely on self-assessments and encouraged the inclusion of third-party reviews to strengthen the system.
A total of 113 schools, or 6%, received “conditionally accredited” designations, primarily due to missing or insufficient documentation by school divisions — not operational breakdowns. Staff said the process highlighted the need for clearer guidance and more standardized submission practices.
In addition, six schools were given “new school” designations for newly configured schools. No school was denied accreditation.
Erin Madden, VDOE senior program and strategy specialist, said the conditionally accredited status is not punitive but an opportunity for improvement, with the goal of achieving “everyone 100% accredited.”

By Katherine Hafner/WHRO
Stormwater runoff has become part of a growing, contentious debate around solar energy development in Virginia.
Some residents and officials in rural areas complain of flooding and pollution around large solar sites. Developers argue that there are already requirements in place to mitigate the problem.
Virginia Tech is in the midst of an effort to collect on-the-ground data to help inform state leaders how to move forward.
The Department of Environmental Quality gave the school $6 million for a six-year study. About two years in, the research team recently published initial findings.
“What we found is, these areas that have solar development happening tend to produce runoff more quickly,” said Ryan Stewart, associate professor at Virginia Tech’s School of Plant and Environmental Sciences. “In many cases, though not all cases, we tend to see higher peak flows coming off the solar areas.”
Stormwater runoff happens when rain falls on impervious surfaces, such as roadways and parking lots, which do not absorb water. That can cause flooding, contribute to erosion and allow pollutants to wash into waterways.
Utility-scale solar projects in Virginia are often built on former farmland, which absorbs water. But glass panels on top allow water to run off.
What happens next “is kind of an open question,” Stewart said.
Some people believe that when the water falls from below the panels, it keeps flowing, eventually running off the site. Others argue that once the water drips off, it infiltrates into the soil beneath adjoining panels downhill.
His team measured runoff at three utility-scale solar sites, one in Surry County and two in the Piedmont region, each spanning hundreds of acres.
Researchers installed metal structures, called flumes, in the channels lining the solar sites to monitor water flow during storms.
The devices are hooked up to data loggers with cellular connections that upload data to the cloud every 30 minutes, along with rainfall data from local weather stations.
For comparison, the group measured runoff at reference points around the solar sites, such as grass or cropland, to represent their previous land use.

Between January 2024 and October 2025, the group recorded between 39 and 76 storms at each site, most with less than an inch of rain accumulation.
The results showed that the spots within solar arrays often saw “rapid, and at times substantial,” amounts of surface runoff.
“I think that points out that solar development is having an effect on hydrology,” Stewart said. “We can’t just assume that the landscape is how it was before the solar construction.”
Last year, Virginia Tech published research on how to best manage land while building and decommissioning utility-scale solar sites. The paper states such facilities could impact 350,000 acres of the state’s agricultural and forested landscapes by 2045.
Recommendations included using conservative estimates for potential runoff, using sensors to trigger panels to move into vertical positions during heavy rainfall and minimizing the removal of topsoil.
Solar developers are required to address stormwater runoff, often using constructed ditches or retention ponds to store water, which then evaporates or slowly trickles into soil and streams.
Much of the regulatory debate comes down to a technical definition. The state previously considered only the foundations of solar panels to be impervious surfaces.
But Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration rolled out changes to classify panels as 100% impervious, saying stronger standards were needed to stem pollution in the heavily regulated Chesapeake Bay watershed.
The change “has caused a lot of consternation among some of the developers who think that’s overkill,” Stewart said. “That’s something we hope to get a better handle on through this project: What’s actually happening with water that’s coming off the panels.”
The Virginia Tech researchers plan to gather more information in the remaining years of the project, such as expanding to six sites, figuring out what the runoff contains and any changes to the soil itself.
Stewart said he’s mindful of the “strong interest on both sides.”
“We’re just trying to collect information in the best way we can and analyze it in a transparent way,” he said. “So that everybody involved can take a look and see this is actually what’s going on, versus what we assume or hope is happening.”

(Screenshot)Lindsay Lang’s morning doomscroll has become something of a compulsion.
As she gets out of bed, the HealthSource RI director can’t help but reach for her phone, combing through news headlines and social media feeds in case there’s an update on the federal tax credits for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. The pandemic-era discounts are set to expire at the end of the year. Without them, monthly premiums will double, from $109 to $220 a month on average, for the 48,000 Rhode Islanders covered through the state insurance marketplace, according to a state analysis. 
HealthSource RI estimates 13,000 current enrollees will drop coverage when federal tax credits expire at the end of the year because of the increased cost.
Unless Congress can agree to extend the subsidies — breaking the monthslong stalemate that was a driving force behind the 43-day federal shutdown.
Lang isn’t hopeful.
But, “things have changed on a dime before” she said in an interview Thursday.
Rhode Islanders are also watching Congress with a close eye ahead of the looming deadline to start or continue health insurance coverage through the state marketplace.
Preliminary information published on Dec. 5 by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services suggests that participation in individual marketplace health insurance plans remains on par with prior years: nationwide, 4.8 million consumers have returned, joined by 950,000 new enrollees.
In Rhode Island, more than 2,700 people signed up for marketplace health insurance for the first time, while over 41,000 existing participants returned, according to federal data.
Lang doesn’t put much stock in the CMS report, at least for returning customers, because they were automatically renewed for coverage at the start of open enrollment on Nov. 1.   
“It’s really hard to know where we’ll land until after that first payment deadline,” Lang said. 
Lang felt more confident about the staying power of those who just signed up.
“It’s safe to consider new enrollment folks are a bit more active shoppers,” she said. “They haven’t received the federal subsidy before.”
Going for bronze 
Among new participants, more are choosing less expansive — and expensive — coverage. More than 1 in 4 new enrollees have chosen a “bronze” medal health plan, which has the lowest premium of the four tiers, but typically much higher deductibles and fewer services covered. By contrast, 16% of participants who signed up in 2025 chose bronze medal plans, while nearly one-third opted for gold medal plans — the second-highest coverage. 
Lang expected returning customers would also choose to downgrade their coverage from platinum or gold medal plans to silver or bronze, although data was not available.
HealthSource RI sent out invoices to new and returning plan participants last week. Most have not made payments or put a credit card on file yet. 
But they are asking questions, flooding the phone lines of the East Providence call center and quickly filling the virtual enrollment time slots to try and comprehend why their health insurance costs so much more.
“We’re definitely having conversations about shock, concern, needing more time to process this information,” Lang said. “People are asking ‘is this number I’m seeing in my renewal notice right? Is there anything I can do to change it?’”
No longer able to tout the state insurance marketplace as affordable, Lang and her team have instead shifted their messaging to the importance of maintaining health insurance coverage.

– Lindsay Lang, HealthSource RI director


As of October 2024, Rhode Island boasted the sixth-highest insured rate of any state in the country, with nearly 98% of residents covered. Returning to pre-Affordable Care Act days, when more than 11% of the state population lacked any form of health insurance, could have dire consequences.
In 2024, Rhode Island hospitals provided more than $84 million in uncompensated care for people without insurance, according to the Hospital Association of Rhode Island.  The trade group representing Rhode Island hospitals warned in a Dec. 8 statement that “even a fraction” of newly uninsured people heading to emergency rooms, inpatient units or outpatient clinics will cause hospital costs to climb sharply, jeopardizing their financial stability and service.
Younger and healthier people are most likely to drop coverage, leaving a pool of older, sicker and more medically expensive enrollees for commercial health insurers to cover. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Rhode Island and Neighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island, the two insurers that cover marketplace enrollees, sought record high premium increases partly because of the company expenses associated with covering a riskier pool of plan participants. 
D.C. stalemate 
“It’s driving up costs for everyone, no matter where they get their care,” U.S. Rep. Gabe Amo said in a Dec. 3 statement, following a virtual town hall with Lang. 
Amo, like the rest of Rhode Island’s Democratic congressional delegation, has placed blame squarely on congressional Republicans and President Donald Trump for further straining the health care system.
“If Republicans in Congress refuse to act, people in their states aren’t going to be able to afford coverage,” U.S. Sen. Jack Reed said in a statement on Dec. 10. “And without coverage, the sad fact is some will not survive. So I hope my Republican colleagues will listen to their constituents and act in their best interests.”
The U.S. Senate failed to pass competing health care bills Thursday, Reed and U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse voted for the Democratic bill, which would have extended the federal tax credits for three years, and against the Republican bill, which would add funding to Health Savings Accounts for marketplace enrollees.
“Today’s vote is just one more data point showing the American people that Republicans are inexplicably hostile to their own constituents having high-quality health care,” Whitehouse said in a statement.
Peter Marino, CEO and president for Neighborhood Health, also expressed disappointment in the congressional stalemate.
“This inaction has real consequences: thousands of Rhode Islanders who relied on these credits as a lifeline to affordable health care coverage may now face the unthinkable choice of going without coverage for themselves and their families,” Marino said in a statement Thursday. “Despite today’s setback, Neighborhood remains steadfast in our mission to advocate for accessible, cost-effective, and equitable health care for every member we serve. ”
Reed also pledged to continue pushing for the federal tax credits.
“The tricky part is, there’s a lot of talk but just a few actual proposals out there,” Lang said.
Also challenging: planning for the local impact of eleventh hour federal actions. If Congress extends the tax credits, or reconfigures them, Lang’s 16-person team would have to recalculate monthly premium costs, giving existing or prospective enrollees the option to enroll, renew or change plans. 
It might also affect the commercial insurance rates approved by Rhode Island Health Insurance Commissioner Cory King, who granted increases for 2026 commercial premiums due in part to expiring federal tax credits.
“If we can lower the rates, we’d want to lower the rates,” King said in an interview with Rhode Island Current at the start of open enrollment in November. “And do it as quickly as humanly possible.”

President and CEO Andrew Marsh at Google's formal announcement of a $4 billion data center project on Oct. 2, 2025. (Photo by Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate) FOMO has broken out across Arkansas, as elected officials, unelected economic developers, utility companies and their regulators fall all over themselves not to miss out on the AI-fueled data center boom, a competition characterized by hyperbole, secrecy and healthy doses of wishful thinking.
Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and state legislators are fueling the campaign to turn Arkansas into a mecca for data centers, expanding a sales tax exemption for new projects and allowing Entergy Arkansas and other utilities to bill consumers for the expanded generating capacity needed to satiate data centers’ voracious appetite for electricity.
Yet, amid splashy announcements of projects, sort-of projects and maybe someday projects, and the handing out of tax breaks like a freewheeling Santa on Christmas Eve, some pesky questions are being ignored.
Do the relatively modest number of jobs generated by data centers justify the infrastructure improvements and tax breaks being offered to lure them to Arkansas? Is it fair for power customers who live far afield from data centers to foot the bill for expanding capacity?
Is it appropriate or wise for state and local governments to provide corporate welfare subsidies to some of the most profitable companies on the planet — and to negotiate those deals in secret to avoid appropriate public scrutiny? Is opening up the candy store really necessary to compete for these projects, or are state and local leaders — driven by their fear of missing out — getting played?
As we try to move away from our reliance on fossil fuels to combat climate change, should we really be encouraging environmentally unfriendly projects that undermine our renewable energy goals by driving up electricity demand beyond what renewable sources can possibly supply?
And, more basically, is indulging FOMO a responsible way to make decisions that could alter the state’s landscape, raise our electric bills and shackle state and local governments to tax incentives for decades to come?
The AI boom has led to exponential growth in the number of data centers sprouting up across the country, as high-tech behemoths such as Google, Meta, Amazon and Microsoft look to ramp up their server capacity. The number of U.S. data centers now tops 4,200, just nine of which are in Arkansas.
But the past year has seen a proliferation of projects across the state — a $4 billion Google data center in West Memphis and vague proposals for $1 billion data centers in Little Rock, Conway and Clarksville. Although Google is rumored to be behind all three of these projects, middlemen are being used to negotiate tax breaks, so the names remain a secret.
Of course, state and local governments offering tax breaks and infrastructure improvements to lure new businesses is nothing new — the entire economic development industry is built around the practice. The traditional justification is that the new facility will generate a large number of jobs that will provide stable long-term employment for local residents.
While that argument might hold water when it comes to a new factory or assembly plant, it falls flat with data centers — facilities with gigantic footprints that consume copious amounts of electricity and water but provide relatively few jobs.
For example, the prospective data centers in Little Rock and Conway would occupy 300,000 square feet — more than five football fields — but employ just 50 people, about as many as would be in a modest-sized high school marching band. Google’s center in West Memphis will have just 300 permanent employees, on a campus of 1,100 acres, although it’s projected to provide 5,000 temporary jobs during construction.
And companies operating data centers have also been loath to guarantee that even these modest numbers of jobs will go to locals; indeed, some of the more high-paying technical jobs are likely to go to outsiders with specialized skills.
Republicans in the legislature called their bill allowing utility infrastructure costs to be passed along to consumers the Generating Arkansas Jobs Act. But how many jobs? For whom? At what cost?
While the impact on employment may be modest, data centers’ effect on the power supply is not. Electricity demand for data centers is forecast to triple by 2028,  from 4% of total U.S. demand to 12%. And an analysis from the Harvard Electricity Law Initiative found that this alliance between utilities and Big Tech will shift billions in costs onto the shoulders of consumers, a trend we’re seeing already in Arkansas.
Entergy Arkansas customers, from Texarkana to Pocahontas and points in between, are going to pay on average $2 more per month to finance increased generating capacity to serve Google’s data center in West Memphis, under an agreement approved earlier this month by the Public Service Commission. Thus, customers who won’t receive economic benefit from this project will be paying to subsidize it.
A study from the University of Michigan also found that data center owners often negotiate sweetheart deals with utility companies for discounted rates, further shifting costs to consumers — and details of those deals are often kept secret.
We’ve also seen that in Arkansas:  When Entergy presented details of its contract with Google to the PSC, the public was ordered to leave the hearing room so that “confidential” information could be discussed in secret.
The secrecy around data center recruitment is a feature, not a bug. And the primary beneficiaries are the tech companies who get public subsidies and discounted utility rates without subjecting themselves to the transparency or accountability we should expect in what’s left of our democracy.
If we want to see where all of this might lead, we might look to Virginia, which has been inundated with more than 660 data centers and where FOMO is giving way to regret.
Officials there are getting an earful from voters mad about noise and environmental impacts, higher utility rates and a paucity of new jobs. Legislation has been introduced to prevent utilities from passing along data center infrastructure costs to consumers. And a Democrat recently flipped a legislative seat that had been in Republican hands for decades by stressing the effect data centers were having on electricity prices.
As a Republican state senator put it, “People are now looking at this, going, ‘What the hell is going on?’”
Which of course, is the irony of FOMO: Sometimes missing out is really in your best interest.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PA021854-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-12 05:57:04.660141

Ohio’s bill complies with recent federal changes by banning intoxicating hemp products from being sold outside of a licensed marijuana dispensary. If DeWine signs the bill into law before the new year, the ban could take effect as soon as March.
“This bill is going to put businesses like me and families like me out of business,” said Ahmad Khalil, one of the owners of Hippie Hut Smoke Shop, with locations in Ohio and Washington. 
“Overnight, we’re going to see tens of thousands of people directly impacted, which will ripple effect into 50,000 of families that are also dependent on this person.”
Khalil has been in the hemp industry for nine years.

“This was my American dream, so to see it get taken away from you, kind of hurts,” he said. 
Jason Friedman, owner of Ohio CBD Guy in Cincinnati, said this is extremely frustrating. 
“My tentative plan will involve eventually closing my East Walnut Hills location resulting in less hours and likely loss of jobs for some of my employees,” he said. 
Instead of a ban, Friedman wants regulations for the hemp industry such as age-gating, packaging restrictions, and testing requirements.
“For the state to say that they are changing their stance to banning from regulating because of what the federal government has done in banning intoxicating hemp in the recent spending bill, makes no sense because marijuana has been illegal federally the whole time,” he said. 
Mark Fashian, president of hemp product wholesaler Midwest Analytical Solutions in Delaware, Ohio, said this will put him, and hundreds of others out of business, if this becomes law. 
He works with more than 500 stores around Ohio that sell intoxicating hemp products. 
“It’s just despicable what (the lawmakers have) done,” he said. “It’s actually slowed my business down a lot because a lot of companies are now afraid to buy products because they don’t know what tomorrow will bring.” 
The intoxicating hemp ban has nothing to do with protecting children, Fashian said. 
“If we want to protect children, make it 21 and over,” he said. “If there is an increase in kids getting hold of this stuff it’s because mom and dad are pretty careless and leave it on the kitchen table, and the kids grab it from them.” 
Fashian said he expects lawsuits if the bill is signed into law. 
Kim Bryant, a salesperson at Your CBD Store Marion, said these products help people with their anxiety, sleep, and pain management. 
“It’s very sad to me,” she said. “This product helps so many people.” 
Bryant said the average age of their customer is 50 years old and she does not think they will want to go to a marijuana dispensary. 
The bill also allows five milligram THC beverages to be manufactured, distributed, and sold until Dec. 31, 2026. 
Marijuana 
Ohio S.B. 56 also makes changes to the state’s marijuana law. 
It would reduce the THC levels in adult-use marijuana extracts from a maximum of 90% down to a maximum of 70%, cap THC levels in adult-use flower to 35%, and prohibit smoking in most public places. 
The bill prohibits possessing marijuana in anything outside of its original packaging and requires drivers to store marijuana in the trunk of their car while driving. 
“This is a re-criminalization bill,” said Morgan Fox, political director at the advocacy group National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, or NORML.
“Civil protections for cannabis consumers were stripped for absolutely zero justification offered is incredibly disappointing,” Fox said. 
Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Michigan, Oregon, Washington, and Washington, D.C. require marijuana to be transported in a sealed package and/or in the trunk of  a car, Fox said. 
“I fear that what we will see in Ohio is an emphasis on enforcement combined with little to no consumer education on the part of the state,” he said. “People might think they’re in complete compliance, but yet are engaging in activity that could lead to prosecutions.” 
A similar law in Illinois has kept marijuana-related arrests high post-legalization with 6,944 arrests in 2024, according to NORML. 
The bill also criminalizes bringing legal marijuana from another state back to Ohio. 
“To the best of my knowledge, no other state other than Ohio explicitly bans possession of cannabis that did not originate in the state,” Fox said. 
He said is disappointed, but not surprised.  
“(Ohio lawmakers) have been trying to weaken the voter approved law and laws surrounding protections for cannabis consumers since after voters approved Issue Two,” he said. “(This) absolutely goes against the will of the voters.” 
Ohioans passed a citizen-initiated law to legalize recreational marijuana in 2023 with 57% of the vote. Sales started in August 2024 and exceeded $702.5 million in the first year. 
The Ohio Cannabis Coalition is happy lawmakers voted to ban intoxicating hemp products and give 36% of adult-use marijuana sale revenue to municipalities and townships that have recreational marijuana dispensaries.
“Ohio is taking decisive action to protect families and demonstrate leadership as one of the first states in the nation to act since the closure of the Farm Bill loophole,” OHCANN Executive Director David Bowling said. “These tax dollars are an important way the cannabis industry benefits the communities where they live and operate.”

Craig Benson (back right) addresses the New Hampshire Commission on Government Efficiency (COGE) at its inaugural meeting Wednesday, Feb. 26, 2025. (Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)It was one of Gov. Kelly Ayotte’s earliest priorities this year: A “Commission on Government Efficiency” that would review ways to reduce cost and waste in the New Hampshire government and whose acronym, COGE, bore a striking resemblance to DOGE, the controversial federal effort led by Elon Musk. 
Now, 10 months after the governor first introduced the concept, that commission has delivered to Ayotte its first report. 
The final 77-page document, created mostly out of the public eye by a team led by former Republican Gov. Craig Benson and former AutoFair Automotive Group CEO Andy Crews, includes suggestions for both basic and transformative changes. Here are some of the report’s major recommendations. 
A splintering of Health and Human Services?
One idea in the COGE report would be a major change: the breaking up of the state Department of Health and Human Services. 
The report calls for “a careful, data-driven evaluation” to determine whether the department should be split into smaller agencies. Currently, the agency oversees a number of areas that include child protective services, mental health care, public health, and Medicaid and Medicare services. That wide-ranging mandate has caused Health and Human Services to grow into a “behemoth agency” that makes accountability difficult, the report argues. 
“The scale of its operations can obscure performance, complicate oversight, and slow decision-making,” the report states. “In some areas, divisions have grown large enough to function as stand-alone agencies in all but name, each with its own administrative structure, management layers, and reporting processes.” 
The report argues that to be effective, the split should result in a reduction of bureaucracy, not an increase. “Smaller agencies could set clearer goals, benchmark progress, and identify inefficiencies more quickly,” the report states.
COGE includes a number of other ideas for streamlining health care. The report argues Health and Human Services should increase its efforts to find fraud within the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and stand up an automated verification system for Medicaid enrollment.
Embracing AI
The COGE report says artificial intelligence could be an asset to the state — if used correctly. 
The best use case, COGE argued, is to help automate routine tasks. That could include summarizing regulatory documents, sorting correspondence, and flagging duplications. It could also help to verify information by using databases and to detect anomalies that could indicate fraud.
“The goal is to use technology to handle time-consuming, repetitive, or highly administrative tasks so that state workers can focus their time and expertise on work that requires human judgment, compassion, and decision making,” the report states. 
That approach requires human input, the report notes: “These pilots should be designed with clear objectives, human oversight, and measurable outcomes such as time saved, backlogs reduced, or improved citizen response times.”
The report also recommends the use of AI chat assistants. “These tools can safely respond to basic inquiries, such as providing office hours, directing citizens to forms, or checking the status of simple requests,” the report states. 
Beyond AI, the report suggests creating a statewide system to manage constituent interactions, allowing departments to better share information about residents’ concern and problems. 
Workplace overhauls
The report recommended the state end remote work options and move fully to in-person work in order to support teamwork.
Some recommendations call for new programs to improve the state’s workforce. The report recommends that state agencies increase externship opportunities for state university and community college students to allow more hands-on experiences. And it suggests building partnerships between community colleges and trade schools and the state’s Department of Corrections to provide more work training for inmates.
Other work-related suggestions are focused on reducing costs. The report asks state departments to conduct a “top-to-bottom review” of management-to-staff ratios. It also urges them to post job openings “at their original classification and pay level,” and not post the salaries of departing employees.
COGE called on the University System of New Hampshire to catalog administrative roles that are redundant and could be eliminated, and it said state agencies should conduct a similar review of public information officers.
It also said state agencies should look into ways to streamline legal services, perhaps by eliminating in-house attorneys in favor of support from the Department of Justice. 
Reducing state oversight boards
Two recommendations centered on state boards. The report said the state Office of Professional Licensure and Certification should consider keeping the “largest and most complex” boards as governing entities, but converting smaller boards to advisory panels.
And it said lawmakers should look into easing some of the professional requirements for serving on a state board, to favor experience over educational attainment or credential achievement.
Tighter controls over indigent defense, right-to-know requests
In a suggestion that echoed efforts on the Executive Council, COGE suggested creating a centralized system for courts to evaluate applications for indigent defense counsel. 
In October, Republican Councilor John Stephen of Manchester led a move to hold up reimbursing the state’s Judicial Council for $5.5 million of funding, arguing that more controls are needed to confirm eligibility. Weeks later, the council approved $1.5 million of that reimbursement — about a quarter of the Judicial Council’s request — with Stephen saying the rest of the money would be contingent on the creation of a verification system.
The COGE report agreed with that suggestion, stating that the judicial branch should create a “centralized clearing system” using standardized criteria to determine income eligibility.
COGE also suggested the state should change its laws to only require indigent defense counsel be provided to defendants whose charges could result in jail time, and not just a misdemeanor or fine, in order to reduce costs. That would peg the state’s policy to the minimum required indigent defense level established by the 1972 U.S. Supreme Court opinion in Argersinger v. Hamlin. 
One recommendation by COGE would reduce Executive Council oversight, however. The report calls on the Legislature to consider raising the spending threshold for state contracts to require council approval; currently that threshold is $10,000, meaning the council has a number of opportunities to block funding or ask questions.
And the report urges a change to the way agencies process right-to-know requests: COGE suggests prioritizing records requests from New Hampshire residents and organizations over those based out of state.
Infrastructure efficiencies
Large portions of the COGE report mention the need for state departments to reduce waste. In some cases, that means auditing state-owned properties to determine which ones are underused and could be sold off. 
In other cases, COGE has called on departments to adopt collective standards for vehicle fleets, and to possibly pool vehicles across multiple agencies. The report recommends reviewing “who genuinely requires access to a State vehicle.” 
The report says more reviews should be taken to reduce energy costs and HVAC optimization. 
And it calls for the Department of Transportation to take over management of the state’s ports and harbors from the State Port Authority in order to expand access to federal grants and pursue a better transportation strategy that could boost state revenue.
Uncertain future
The report immediately drew praise from Ayotte. But it is not clear how many of the recommendations might be quickly implemented. Some could be achieved through executive order, but many would require comprehensive legislation. For lawmakers, the filing period for 2026 legislation has passed, but there are some mechanisms to introduce late legislation. 
Nonetheless, Ayotte said she would begin sifting through the suggestions and determine which she might push for. 
“This was done the New Hampshire way, with contributions from Commissioners, state employees, and members of the public who shared their input and ideas,” Ayotte said. “This report shows that when we focus on making operations better, we can deliver more value for taxpayers and build a more modern, efficient, and responsive government for all of New Hampshire.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_2797-COGE-1024x622.jpg,,,2025-12-12 05:57:04.660141

(Photo Courtesy of ACLU of Idaho)Immigration arrests under the Trump administration continued to increase through mid-October, reaching rates of more than 30,000 a month. But, rather than the convicted criminals the administration has said it’s focused on, an ever-larger share of those arrests were for solely immigration violations.
In 45 states, immigration arrests more than doubled compared with the same period last year, during the Biden administration. The largest increases: There were 1,190 arrests in the District of Columbia compared with just seven last year under the Biden administration. Arrests were also more than five times higher in New Mexico, Idaho, Oregon and Virginia.
“The result stands in contrast to the administration’s objective of arresting the ‘worst of the worst,’” said Ariel Ruiz Soto, a senior policy analyst at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. Heightened enforcement is likely increasing “collateral” arrests of people found during searches for convicted criminals, he said.
More industries want Trump’s help hiring immigrant labor after farms get a break

Comparisons between the Trump and Biden administrations were calculated by Stateline in an analysis of data released by the Deportation Data Project, a research initiative by the universities of California at Berkeley and Los Angeles. About 93% of arrests could be identified by state.
While more people were arrested this year, a lower percentage are convicted criminals.
The share of arrested immigrants who had been convicted of violent crimes has dropped from 9% in January to less than 5% in October. The share under Biden was consistently between 10% and 11% during the same period in 2024.
The same trend applies to people arrested solely on immigration violations: Immigration violations alone were behind 20% in April, then rose to 44% of arrests in October, according to Stateline’s analysis.
In some states and the District of Columbia, a majority of arrests were for immigration violations alone: the District of Columbia (80%), New York (61%), Virginia (57%), Illinois (53%), West Virginia (51%) and Maryland (50%).
States with high immigrant populations also saw the most arrests this year. The largest numeric increases were in Texas (up 29,403, triple last year’s figure), Florida (up 14,693, a fourfold increase) and California (up 13,345, a fourfold increase).
The two states with the largest arrest rate increases have responded very differently to President Donald Trump’s deportation mission.
“We’re going to resist like all of the Democratic states,” New Mexico Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said in an interview with The Santa Fe New Mexican after last year’s election, referring to mass deportation plans. She proposed legislation to ban U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facilities in the state. The legislation failed this year, but Lujan Grisham urged the state legislature to reconsider next year. The state has three privately run ICE detention centers with the capacity for 2,000 people.
Idaho’s Republican governor, Brad Little, is helping ICE under a 287(g) agreement by transporting what his office calls “highly dangerous illegal alien criminals” from county jails to federal custody. The 53 men pictured on the governor’s website have charges ranging from drug possession to sexual assault.
In a news release, the office says the program is intended to take people “after the completion of their sentences,” though an October review by the Idaho Capital Sun found some were transported despite dismissed or still-pending charges.
Trump allows more foreign ag workers, eases off ICE raids on farms

Nationally, arrests have increased this year from around 17,000 in February, the first full month of President Donald Trump’s current term, to more than 30,000 in September and October. The share of convicted criminals has dropped from 46% to 30%, though the number of convicted criminals arrested still has been higher each month than under President Joe Biden.
Some of the policies that have fed increased arrest numbers face new court battles. This month, a federal judge blocked the administration from making immigration arrests in the District of Columbia without warrants or probable cause.
In August, a federal court blocked the administration’s expansion of expedited removal, which itself allows fast deportations without judicial review. The administration has appealed, arguing that immigrants who have been in the country for less than two years without legal authorization are not guaranteed due process.
Such fast deportations could be used on 2.5 million people, according to a Migration Policy Institute estimate published in September, including 1 million people released at the border with Mexico with court dates and 1.5 million people with temporary protections such as humanitarian parole.
This fall, the share of arrested immigrants with criminal convictions continued to decrease just before and during the federal government shutdown, with only 3% of those arrested having convictions between Sept. 21 and Nov. 16, according to national information analyzed by Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC), a data research organization at Syracuse University.
“While ICE is detaining more and more individuals, targeting has shifted sharply to individuals without any criminal convictions,” the TRAC report noted.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-12 10:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Analysis shows CT ready for next recession as never before,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/12/analysis-shows-ct-ready-for-next-recession-as-never-before/,A new forecast from Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration projects a moderate downturn wouldn’t drain state reserves for two and a half years.,"As fears of a recession grow, Connecticut’s finances enjoy unprecedented protection, with one new forecast from Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration projecting a moderate downturn wouldn’t even drain the state’s reserves for two and a half years.
Connecticut’s record-setting $4.3 billion rainy day fund, which represents 18% of annual operating expenses, is more than double the financial safety wall the state built just prior to the Great Recession of 2007-09 — an economic slump that drained all reserves, left the state with $1 billion in operating debt, and triggered at least one of the largest tax hikes in state history.
“Make no doubt about it, today Connecticut’s fiscal health is the strongest it has been in decades,” Lamont said this week. “And that is due to the responsible budgetary decisions we’ve been making over these last several years.”
Lamont was talking about how the state’s savings habits have helped eliminate billions of dollars of the massive pension debt Connecticut accumulated across seven decades prior to 2011 — a burden that still exceeds $33 billion.
But the administration says those same savings habits, which generated yearly budget surpluses averaging $1.8 billion since 2017, also completely rebuilt Connecticut’s chief defense against a sharp economic downturn.
The governor’s comments come as fears of a looming recession grow. 
Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody’s Analytics — the research arm of a major Wall Street credit-rating agency — told Fortune magazine the country is on the precipice of a recession with too many households living paycheck-to-paycheck, job growth softening and tariffs ordered by President Donald Trump staggering the economy.
On Thursday, Connecticut Department of Labor Commissioner Danté Bartolomeo released the September labor situation report. While the state’s unemployment rate remained unchanged at 3.8%, September payrolls declined by an estimated 5,700 jobs and the labor force declined by 5,400. In August, total jobs reached a 17-year high and private sector jobs were at an all-time high. (The September report is normally released in early October, but it was delayed due to the federal government shutdown.)
Bartolomeo didn’t discuss a recession Wednesday but she said the decline in jobs in the state followed a national trend.
A recession typically triggers a sharp drop in tax revenues that can last for several years. States typically respond by drawing down their rainy day funds, hoping to delay program cuts and tax hikes for as long as possible to shield residents and businesses already beset by a weak economy.
Connecticut’s budget reserve held just $212 million eight years ago, a meager cushion equal to 1% of annual operating expenses. Today, Connecticut’s fund ranks in the top tier among states, according to the Pew Charitable Trusts.
According to a new recession “stress test” ordered by legislators and released recently by Lamont’s budget staff, a “mild” recession like the 2001 downturn triggered by overvaluation of internet companies wouldn’t even exhaust Connecticut’s reserves. The rainy day fund would shrink from $4.3 billion now to $1.4 billion before the hypothetical downturn ends in 2029.
An average or “moderate” recession would empty the rainy day fund by 2029.
Even a “severe” slump like The Great Recession of 2007-09 wouldn’t exhaust Connecticut’s reserves this fiscal year or next, though the state would slip about $800 million into the red by 2028. The state would end the recession owing about $4.5 billion, which represents 19% of the pre-recession General Fund.
At first glance, that’s worse than the $1 billion in operating debt — about 6% of the pre-recession General Fund — that Connecticut ran up during the 2007-09 slump.
But it’s not a fair comparison.
The administration’s “stress test” analysis doesn’t assume any savings from program cuts legislators likely would employ during the next recession, as they did in 2007-09, to mitigate operating debt.
Gov. M. Jodi Rell and the 2009 General Assembly also ordered tax hikes worth almost $620 million per year to avoid more debt. Prior to the 2007-09 recession, state officials had built a $1.4 billion rainy day fund equal to just 8.5% of operating expenses — less than half the reserve Connecticut has now.
Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, who succeeded Rell in January 2011, inherited a budget on pace to run a record-setting 18% in deficit unless adjustments were made. He and the General Assembly then approved a tax hike estimated at more than $1.8 billion a year, one of the largest in state history.
Lamont’s “stress test” assumes no tax hikes are ordered during the next recession.
Officials from both parties praised the new analysis.
“I think that points out how much has actually been done,” to avoid fiscal mistakes of past, said Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, co-chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee.
She added Connecticut’s pensions for state employees and municipal teachers also have been strengthened considerably since 2020 by the transfer of more than $10 billion in budget surpluses into these retirement benefit programs. These deposits also will protect state finances during the next economic slump, when earnings from pension investments usually drop and states are required to deposit more funds.
Rep. Tammy Nuccio of Tolland, ranking House Republican on the Appropriations Committee, said that while both parties voted for the 2017 budget caps that prepared Connecticut for the next recession, she fears majority Democratic legislators have forgotten Connecticut’s history.
Democrats in recent years have forfeited hundreds of millions of additional surplus dollars by not properly funding Medicaid programs and by creating a new fund — outside of the formal budget and spending cap — to bolster affordable child care.
“We need to make sure we’re ready for what comes,” Nuccio added. “We don’t want to be the Connecticut of the 2010s. … It was not a great time for us.”
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said legislators have struck a careful balance between preparing for economic slumps, paying down pension debt, and preserving core programs like health care, child care and education, even as President Trump and Congress shrink federal aid to states.
“The idea of putting away money for a rainy day is a positive thing,” Ritter said. “But also, you’ve got needs now.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025_0205_SR_BudgetDay_0951-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-12 05:57:04.660141

(Photo by Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)As a family physician, I work every day to earn the trust of my patients. I see lines being blurred between politics and medicine and, despite the high trust the public has in their own physician, it is becoming harder to separate medical and scientific information from misinformation.
I hear this concern from my patients, particularly when trusted resources, like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, make drastic policy shifts: Is this science based decision-making or politics?
 Who do you trust?
With every new patient I see, I share my approach to care by saying “I work for you. In many ways, you are my boss. My job is the make assessments and recommendations, yours is to make decisions, and I’m here to help you with that. How does that sound to you?”
People universally embrace this approach. It promotes individual autonomy and shifts the power to the patient — where it belongs. National surveys reveal that trust in government agencies such as the CDC is at an all time low, on par with approval ratings for Congress. However, trust in one’s own personal physician remains very high, with nearly 8 in 10 people rating their personal doctors as “very good” or “excellent,” according to a recent People’s Voices Survey.
Despite this relatively high trust the public has in their own doctors, the insertion of politics into the exam room has made it harder for people to make the right decisions for themselves by infecting the relationship between people and their doctors with misinformation, causing people to second guess recommendations they are receiving.
 Let’s pull back the curtain.
The public has good reason to be suspicious of the CDC right now. The changes approved last week by the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, are arbitrary, not science-based, and go against decades of safety and efficacy data. Their vote to remove hepatitis B vaccination from the recommended infant and child schedule will lead to a resurgence of hepatitis B.
Prior to recommending newborn vaccination in 1991, 18,000 children were diagnosed annually with hep B, a chronic illness that leads to liver failure and liver cancer. Half of these children were infected through mother-to-child transmission, and giving the shot at birth prevents the virus from taking hold. The other half occurred through contact with saliva or blood exposure to someone else who is infected. The virus can stay active for up to a week on surfaces and is known to have been transmitted during sports and in child care settings, through coming in contact with the virus by touching a contaminated surface, or exposure to scrapes or bites. (Up to half of the children in child care are bitten by another child each year.)
Since vaccination was universally recommended, infection rates have dropped by nearly 99%, and today we see much less liver failure and cancer resulting from hepatitis B infection. No one wants to see those numbers increase again.
 What are physicians saying?
By making ACIP a political committee rather than one based on science means that recommendations are subject to bias and can no longer be trusted. This breach of trust by our government results in lack of confidence in vaccine recommendations across the board, including those by the public’s trusted health care professionals who they continue to see as excellent.
Because politics and politicians are interfering with the patient-doctor relationships and undermining trust in public health measures like vaccines, we will likely see infections rise as we have seen with measles this past year.
While the federal government is spreading misinformation through ACIP and the CDC, the State of New Hampshire is showing that it still trusts doctors over politics with regard to childhood vaccines and is directing New Hampshire doctors to adhere to vaccine recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians.
As I stated earlier, I work every day to earn the trust of my patients and to share the best medical information and highest quality patient care available. I keep politics out of the exam room, and we need the politicians to stay out of our exam rooms and our relationships with our patients.
When going to see your doctor, remember that we work for you and our recommendations are based on years of training, a dedication to science, and, most importantly, a commitment to partnering with you to make the best decisions for your health.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/vaccinemeasles-1024x718.jpg,,,2025-12-12 05:57:04.660141

A federal judge is allowing a case to proceed challenging Ohio’s plan to fund a new Cleveland Browns stadium with residents’ unclaimed funds. Attorneys for the state had asked the judge to dismiss the case; plaintiffs wanted to halt any transfer of money out of the unclaimed funds trust fund.
U.S. District Judge Edmund Sargus declined to do either. But Jeff Crossman, an attorney representing the citizens challenging the state doesn’t see it as a draw.
“I think the judge is convinced there’s some smoke here, and there might actually be some fire as well,” he said, “and that’s why he’s letting the case proceed.”
Crossman remains optimistic about their case and said they’re still considering an appeal to halt the transfers set to begin Jan. 1, 2026.
The claims
State officials urged the court to scrap the case, insisting the plaintiffs, who have property in the unclaimed funds trust fund, lack standing and have suffered no injury.
Rather than sue the state, the argument goes, the plaintiffs should just claim their property.
What’s more, the proposed transfers haven’t even started, and rightful owners will have a ten-year grace period to reclaim their money after they do.
Sargus batted those arguments away.
He pointed to a Supreme Court case out of Pennsylvania known as Knick.
“There,” he wrote, “the Supreme Court held that plaintiffs need not exhaust state remedies to have an ‘actionable’ takings claim in federal court.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
He added subsequent lawsuits have applied the Knick decision to unclaimed funds cases, allowing plaintiffs to go forward “even if they had not pursued state law remedies for recovering unclaimed funds first.”
The state next argued the court should abstain because the dispute is a state issue and it should get hashed out in state courts. But the judge disagreed. The state statutes in question aren’t ambiguous or overly complicated and federal courts have ruled on similar cases before.
“Plaintiffs contend that these provisions violate the Takings Clause and the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution, which are federal issues that Ohio’s administrative process would not resolve,” Sargus wrote.
Attorneys call for timeout on Cleveland Browns receiving unclaimed funds

On the other hand, the judge determined the avenues available for reclaiming funds — filing a claim prior to transfer, or within the ten-year grace period, or by appealing to the Ohio Court of Claims — make it impossible to justify blocking the state’s plans.
One element of obtaining an injunction is demonstrating you’d suffer “irreparable harm” without court intervention.
“Here, plaintiffs cannot establish that they will suffer irreparable harm without an injunction,” Sargus wrote, “because monetary damages are available to compensate plaintiffs for any alleged violation of the Takings Clause.”
What’s next
Crossman’s case makes two central arguments.
First, it’s unconstitutional to take Ohioans’ money and hand it to a private organization like the Cleveland Browns without just compensation, and second, it’s unconstitutional to do so without providing prior notice.
“The state admitted this on the stand repeatedly,” he said. “They do not send any notice to any specific purpose. They do these generalized campaigns to make people generally aware to check on unclaimed funds.”
The stadium funding plan converts Ohio’s unclaimed funds program from one that holds residents’ assets in perpetuity to a fund that eventually flows into state coffers. To Crossman, that’s embezzlement, just slower.
“What incentive does the state have to notify you at all?” he asked. “It’s an immediate conflict of interest between you and the state of Ohio. Imagine if your stockbroker, holding your stock, had no incentive to make sure you actually got your money.”
Ohio Capital Journal reached out to attorneys representing state officials in the case, but they declined comment.
Unless Crossman’s team successfully appeals for an injunction at a higher court, the state will begin moving funds out of the unclaimed funds trust fund on Jan. 1.
That portion, made up of assets that have been in the fund for at least 10 years, is worth between $1.7 and $1.9 billion.
State lawmakers have actually appropriated $1 billion of that total — $600 million for the Browns stadium and the rest for “other qualifying projects.”
Lawmakers’ underlying motive for tapping unclaimed funds was that they could pay for the stadium without using taxpayer money.
But Crossman said that’s misguided.
“That $600 million, if that was an improper purpose, an improper taking for that purpose, then the state’s going to have to reimburse the trust account for the money it took out,” he said. “And you know, where does that money come from? It comes from you and me, right? It comes from the taxpayers.”

Ohio brewers fear the state’s new ‘intoxicating’ hemp ban will kill the buzz of the booming THC‑infused drink industry.
While the drinks poured, brewery Urban Artifact’s Scotty Hunter watched the clock tick.
“It’s really impacted our business quite a bit more than I would have expected,” Hunter said.
The Cincinnati business sells THC-infused beverages, drinks that have driven profits.
“We have improved our revenue by 30% two years in a row,” he said. “We’ve added jobs.”
But recent decisions by Ohio politicians are leaving him high and dry.
Well, just dry — not high.
“We saw about a 50% drop in our sales in the state of Ohio because of that executive order,” he said.
In October, Gov. Mike DeWine signed a temporary ban on hemp that gets users high. The THC products can look like candy, and they’re sold at places like gas stations and smoke shops with no age limits.
State lawmakers voted on Tuesday to send a bill to Gov. Mike Dewine, one banning the vast majority of “intoxicating” hemp.
“Not only has intoxicating hemp been impacting our industry, but it’s also impacting public health in general of Ohioans,” Marijuana advocate Adrienne Robbins said after the Senate vote.
Robbins, who fought for the hemp prohibition, is glad to see the products banned.
“The fact that this bill is going to take those dangerous products off the shelf sooner rather than later is a huge win for the whole state,” she said.
But the legislature carved out a small exception for brewers like Hunter. Stores with liquor licenses will still be able to sell low-level THC drinks until the federal hemp ban kicks in next year.
If Congress rescinds its ban, Ohio Senate President Rob McColley said he may be open to allowing the drinks.
“That’s something that we might take up again and see if we could put in a regulated process around that,” McColley said.
Bobby Slattery, founder of Fifty West, said he believes THC drinks are the future for the beverage industry, adding that this year has been their lowest for beer production but highest for overall production, thanks to their THC line. He is also worried about a total ban.
“It would have a major impact on jobs inside the state and to our consumers that are drinking these,” Slattery said.
The state’s craft brewing association has also spoken out against the legislation.
Hunter is worried that by the time a possible hemp system gets put into place, the buzz will be gone.
“Potentially wipe out an entire industry,” he said. “We’re looking at trying to adjust for that big of a drop in sales.”
The governor is set to weed through the legislation, but is expected to sign it in the coming weeks.

(Illustration by Eric Thomas/Kansas Reflector)Half a world away this week, Australia’s government implemented a law that feels just as relevant to Kansas.
The nation banned social media for teens under the age of 16, including some of the most popular apps for young people, such as Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok. (Some social media remained accessible this week.) Through the ban, Australian politicians aim to short-circuit teenage reliance, if not addiction, to social media and, by proxy, cellphones.
While this is happening 9,000 miles away in Australia, the political and legal debates in Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne signal something about Kansas’ approach to social media in our heartland homes and classrooms.
As the dad of a 16-year-old son and a daughter who just aged out of being a teenager, setting boundaries about cellphones has been an almost daily discussion for me and my kids for the past five years. From my son: “Can I have Instagram to work on a project for my club at school?” From me: “Please be sure to store your phone in the kitchen rather than your bedroom when you go to bed tonight.”
Parenting teens in the age of social media demands daily grit. Once you give teens even a little bit of social media access, they will use that limited permission like a crowbar, peeling back further access each day. Providing them even a bit of leverage inevitably becomes more and more.
One social media app becomes two. Two hours of screen time becomes three. Three days a week becomes seven.
As an instructor at the University of Kansas, one of my goals is to make class so engaging and fast-paced that students don’t have time to check their notifications from Instagram or play cellphone games.
Nevertheless, last week, a student continued an epic, if fictional, battle on his cellphone: a game of Clash Royale while I stood right beside him lecturing. Only after I interrupted the class to explain how distracting his gameplay was did he pocket the device.
Teaching teens in this age of social media is like waterproofing a boat constructed of sponges. Just when you think you have sealed every square inch, there is another leak in their attention.
Because we need to change the relationships that our American teens have with cellphones, I believe that the Australia ban is vital — but doomed.
Let me explain.
Australia’s so-called fix may be short-lived because of a constitutional challenge filed this week. The New York Times reported that two 15-year-old Australian teens argue the ban “infringes on their right to political communication.” The ban itself might be banned.
Here in the United States, if we mimic Australia by instituting a nationwide ban on teen social media use, it couldn’t clear a challenge under the First Amendment — and rightly so. Freedom of expression belongs to teens as well as adults. With two decades of social media behind us, the genie is out of the bottle. Social media is certainly protected speech, whether for adults or teens.
If Australia’s ban would be so obviously doomed, especially here, how is it vital?
Australia’s ban widens the Overton window when it comes to teens and cellphones. A major national government has enlarged what we can imagine as an acceptable political intervention aimed at social media. In this way, the Australian ban was vital to restart the conversation about teens and social media.
We needed some government to overstep. All credit to lawmakers down under.
If Australia can enact such a law, then certainly the United States or an individual state (hello, Topeka!) could make some incremental move.
As a culture, we have become irrationally OK with teens sitting at the dinner table with one hand on the Chipotle fork and another on their phone. As parents, we have become OK with teens barricading their bedroom doors to doomscroll each evening. As teachers, we shrug at the student in the back row thumbing through TikTok, an AirPod dangling from one ear.
The extreme freedom of unrestricted teen social media use has failed.
At the opposite extreme, as embodied by the Australia ban, outlawing everything from Instagram to Snapchat likely won’t work for legal reasons.
The solution is in the middle rather than at the extremes (so boring) and about defaults rather than bans (even more boring).
The most promising tactic to throttle the mania of teen social media use is to mandate specific default settings inside social media apps. When users start up the app and provide their age, social media apps could more insistently and aggressively set defaults for settings such as screentime limits, profile privacy and notifications.
Yes, the settings could be changed, but default settings would provide parents guidance.
It would also provide parents cover, similar to the collective action urged by the group Wait Until 8th. That group asks parents to sign a pact with other parents so that there is collective, community will. Default actions could function in largely the same way.
Many social media apps dedicate pages to the safety settings that they implement for teens. But this is some weak tea. Snapchat, for instance, creates default settings for teens ages 13-17, including public profiles and location sharing. That’s helpful, but not enough.
The outright ban in Australia makes universal default settings for teens seem politically reasonable. Default settings for teens inside social media are not bans — not even close.
Instead, they are norm-setting, signaling to parents and teens that there are measured and healthy ways to use apps.
From this American parent and teacher to the Australian government, this is my thank you — for acting so ambitiously that my suggestions seem downright gentle.

(Getty Images.)Public health is not defined only by the absence of disease, it is shaped by the safety and equity of our communities. In Ohio, discrimination has become a public health crisis that demands serious action, action we can and must take at the local level.
Discrimination of any form, whether based on sexual orientation, gender identity, race, disability, or immigration status, directly harms health.
Yet too many Ohio communities, including my own city of Lorain, still lack comprehensive protections that ensure people can live, work, and raise families without fear.
If we want healthier, safer, and more stable cities, we must stop framing equity as divisive politics and finally recognize it for what it is: a public health necessity.
As someone who has written and passed protections across multiple Ohio jurisdictions, including at the county level, I’ve seen firsthand how discrimination fuels psychological distress, homelessness, chronic illness, and suicide.
After these protections were adopted, I received hundreds of messages from families and individuals who finally felt safe enough to seek mental health support which is a shift that mirrors what research has shown for years.
Local health officials I’ve spoken with consistently reinforce that point, that exclusion damages health outcomes at every level.
The cost of this intolerance isn’t abstract.
A 2015 study published in Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology developed the “Costs of Discrimination Assessment,” which quantified how stigma interrupts daily life.
The findings were pretty stark: discrimination pushed individuals to withdraw from the workforce and disengage from their local economy.
Twenty percent of respondents reduced visits to family doctors out of fear of prejudice, and many skipped dental care altogether.
When people avoid preventive health care because they fear mistreatment, manageable issues grow into emergencies, for them and for our local systems.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The economic impact is equally undeniable.
A 2021 analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco estimated that racial and ethnic inequities have cost the U.S. economy $51 trillion in lost output since 1990.
Ohio feels these losses every day. Whenever a qualified worker is sidelined, a family is priced out due to bias, or an entrepreneur is denied capital, our economy loses value.
More recent data makes the problem even clearer.
The Federal Reserve’s 2024 Small Business Credit Survey found that Black-owned businesses were denied financing at more than twice the rate of white-owned firms (39% vs. 18%).
Research from the National Bureau of Economic Research showed that resumes with “white-sounding” names receive 50% more callbacks than identical resumes with “Black-sounding” names.
And when North Carolina passed a single discriminatory bill targeting LGBTQIA+ residents, the state lost $3.7 billion in investments and business, according to an Associated Press analysis.
Here in Ohio, the losses may be quieter, but they are just as damaging and harmful.
The Williams Institute estimates that stigma-driven health disparities alone cost our state more than $150 million every year in lost productivity and health care spending.
Ohioans are practical people. We believe that if you work hard and contribute to your community, you should get a fair chance. Discrimination violates that belief. It judges people not by their character or their contribution, but by who they are and that is not who we are as a state.
We often talk about politics as a battleground, but our communities should be the common ground.
Ohio has always been a place of builders, people who look beyond division and focus on what we can create together.
We cannot build our strongest future if we leave some of our strongest contributors on the sidelines.
Ending discrimination is not about pulling Ohio left or right, but it is about moving Ohio forward. And we are ultimately not defined by party lines, but by how we treat one another.
No Ohioan should have to leave the place they love to find respect or other opportunities. I
t is time to stop building higher fences and start building a longer table, one with room for every voice, dignity for every neighbor, and opportunity for every single family.
Let’s come together as the architects of the future we want, a state where every resident can contribute, succeed, and belong.
That is how we grow stronger economically, and more importantly, how we grow better as a people.

Wes Moore (D) told a gathering of county leaders Thursday that he does not plan to balance his next budget with taxes, while pledging to revisit an affordable housing proposal that local officials last year opposed. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Gov. Wes Moore (D) told a gathering of county leaders in Cambridge Thursday that he will not propose tax increases to close a projected $1.5 billion budget gap in the coming fiscal year.
Moore told officials attending winter conference of the Maryland Association of Counties that “budget decisions in front of us won’t be easy or simple.” He gave few specifics, but took at least one solution off the table.
“We cannot – and will not – balance our budget on the back of Marylanders. This is not a year where we anticipate tax increases,” Moore said. “At the same time, we must right-size programs that need to be made more sustainable.”
Moore and the General Assembly have been warned that they face about a $1.5 billion deficit in fiscal 2027. Additionally, there is about $700 million in budget deficiencies.
State fiscal leaders will get an updated look at the state’s revenue projections for fiscal 2027 when the Board of Revenue Estimates meets Friday afternoon. Friday’s forecast is the last before Moore delivers his budget to the General Assembly.
Lawmakers cautioned on use of reserves to solve nearly $1.5 billion deficit

Moore diverged several times from his speech as prepared. He dropped portions that named President Donald Trump or referenced the White House, instead referring only to Washington or speaking more in more general terms. The majority of county officials in the room hail from rural jurisdictions where Republicans are the majority party.
Moore was warmly received as he was introduced. During his speech, there was some applause from pockets of the banquet room. But there were also few obvious applause lines and attendees for the most part listened quietly.
Moore went off script to talk about one issue — housing.
The governor and the association were at odds in the 2025 legislative session over an administration bill that was aimed at sparking construction of affordable housing in the state. But county officials saw the bill as overriding local authority on zoning and on where projects can be built.
Moore lost that fight and his bill was ultimately defeated. A divide remains. While the administration seems focused on bringing the bill back, county officials have complained that they have had few substantive talks with the Department of Housing and Community Development — a continuation of complaints that surfaced at the association’s summer convention.
Despite any disagreements, Moore told the audience Thursday he was “not going to stop pushing.”
“Sometimes we butt heads on this one,” Moore said. “The thing that I ask you though, is this: If we disagree on the topic of housing on Monday, the only thing I ask is … let’s get back together on Tuesday and let’s keep on working, because I’m not going to stop pushing this housing.”

School districts that depend on hiring foreign workers to fill teacher jobs, especially in special education and bilingual education, say they can’t afford the new fee.","In summary
The Trump administration is now requiring new H-1B visa applicants to pay $100,000. School districts that depend on hiring foreign workers to fill teacher jobs, especially in special education and bilingual education, say they can’t afford the new fee.


There is a new cost to hiring an international worker to fill a vital but otherwise vacant position in a California classroom: $100,000.
In September, the Trump administration began requiring American employers to pay a $100,000 sponsorship fee for new H-1B visas, on top of already required visa application fees that amount to $9,500 to $18,800, depending on various factors. These visas allow skilled and credentialed workers in multiple job sectors to stay in the U.S.
Most foreign workers on H-1Bs in California work in the tech sector. But California also relies on H-1B visas to address another issue: a nationwide teacher shortage and a high demand for staff in dual-language education and special education in K-12 districts. 
Data from the California Department of Education shows school districts filed more than 300 visa applications for the 2023-24 school year, double the amount from just two years earlier. Educators and school officials say its overseas workers on visas are highly skilled, instrumental in multilingual education, and fill historically understaffed positions in special education.
Now education leaders are sounding the alarm that the high additional fee for overseas workers will worsen the strain on California’s public education system.
International employees fill a much-needed gap for school districts
California continues to face an ongoing teacher shortage. In 2023, California K-12 schools staffed 46,982 positions with employees whose credentials did not align with their job assignments, according to data from the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing. Another 22,012 educator positions were left vacant that year. Of total misassignments and vacancies, around 28% were in English language development and 11.9% were in special education. 
California school districts have also resorted to hiring teachers who haven’t yet obtained certain credentials, according to a study by the nonprofit Learning Policy Institute. Facing a need for teachers, school districts have found that trained professionals from other countries are willing — and qualified — to take classroom jobs that would otherwise go unfilled.

In 2023, in the Bay Area east of San Francisco, West Contra Costa Unified School District had 381 misassigned positions and 711 vacancies, according to the commission. So the district turned to foreign educators, hiring about 88 teachers on H-1B visas — a majority from the Philippines, Spain and Mexico — to teach in mostly dual-language and special education programs, said Sylvia Greenwood, the assistant superintendent for human resources at the district.
“With our shortages in special ed, they were a good fit for our district. And so, therefore, we kept that pipeline open and brought teachers here from the Philippines to support our students and our students with special needs,” Greenwood said. 
The decline in the number of credentialed special education teachers continues to worsen. Between 2020 and 2024, the number of credentials earned to teach special education decreased by almost 600 across California, according to data from the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing. The number of temporary permits and waivers granted by the commission increased by about 300 during the same period.
Francisco Ortiz, the president of United Teachers of Richmond and a teacher at Ford Elementary School in West Contra Costa, said the workload for teachers in the district will increase if West Contra Costa Unified is unable to bring in new international teachers.
This would create “greater instability” for students, he said, adding, “It’s going to have a great impact in special education, which is already on fire.”
California school district officials say they are unsure they can pay the new fee to fill hiring gaps with international employees. West Contra Costa officials said they do not know yet who will be responsible for paying the new fee: the district, international teachers themselves or another party.
“We are a district that is dealing with a structural deficit as well, and so that cost, in a lot of ways, is going to be very difficult for our district or really any school district, to be able to take that on,” said Cheryl Cotton, the superintendent for West Contra Costa.
“It’s essentially a giant ‘Keep Out’ sign.”Laura Flores-Perilla, an attorney with L.A.-based Justice Action Center
Pasadena Unified, in Southern California, filed about a dozen applications for H-1B visa sponsorships in 2024. Now the district, facing a $27 million budget deficit, will require those applying for H-1B visas to pay for it themselves, according to district spokesperson Hilda Ramirez Horvath. She said foreign employees will also no longer receive other types of financial support, including legal or filing fees related to immigration processing.
Language programs benefit from international teachers
District officials are also worried about the cultural costs of losing international educators. Educators on H-1B visas make dual-language public schools possible, giving families in California a unique multicultural education that sticks with their children for life.
Kelleen Peckham, a mother to two children in West Contra Costa, said she chose to transfer her daughter to Washington Elementary School in Richmond because it has a dual-language immersion program that teaches students to speak and read Spanish. 
Peckham also plans to send her son, who will start kindergarten next year, to the same school even though it takes the family an extra 15 minutes to drive there.
“My husband’s family is from Mexico, and so [their] grandmother, on one side, only speaks Spanish,” Peckham said. “It’s important for [them] to be able to communicate with [their] family and extended family.”
She said if the dual-language immersion program at Washington Elementary doesn’t survive, she would consider transferring her children back to the school in their neighborhood.

Fee spells ‘Keep Out’ to foreign workers
Within weeks of the fee’s announcement, a coalition of international worker groups, unions and religious organizations sued the Trump administration, alleging the fee would inhibit staffing in education, medicine and ministry services.
“It’s essentially a giant ‘Keep Out’ sign for prospective individuals looking to utilize the visa process to be able to come to the United States and fill these roles and provide these services,” said Laura Flores-Perilla, an attorney with the Justice Action Center, a Los Angeles-based immigration litigation group representing the coalition in its lawsuit.
“It’s not just going to hurt these individuals who have this pathway to do this, but it’s also going to hurt employers within the United States,” Flores-Perilla said.
Although the fee only applies to new visa applicants, many international teachers are feeling less welcomed to work and live in the states. A.F., an international elementary school teacher in the West Contra Costa Unified School District, said many teachers are still concerned the federal government will announce new policy changes that could force them to leave the U.S. 
“I feel like it’s a form of discrimination to impose [a] $100,000 fee for teachers,” A.F. said.

A.F., who is currently on an H-1B visa, asked to only give his initials because he fears speaking publicly will affect his ability to receive a green card in the future. He immigrated from the Philippines to California five years ago on a J-1 visa before transferring to an H-1B visa at the beginning of 2025. J-1 visas allow visitors to temporarily stay in the U.S. to participate in certain programs, including teaching, studying, conducting research and more, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.
A.F. said the district previously paid for all of his immigration costs for his H-1B visa, which amounted to more than $3,700 for processing fees and an immigration attorney.
The future is uncertain for H-1B visa hopefuls
H.R., a physical education teacher in West Contra Costa who works on a short-term J-1 visa, said he moved his family from Mexico to the U.S. three years ago to work at one of the district’s high schools because he felt it would be safer to raise his daughter in the U.S. H.R. requested to use only his initials because he doesn’t want to jeopardize his ability to apply for the H-1B visa in the future.
“My biggest reason [for moving] is my daughter,” he said. “Me and my wife decided that it would be a good chance for her [and] a big opportunity to learn the language and to grow up in a different environment.”
H.R. can’t apply for the H-1B visa because he missed the deadline and West Contra Costa Unified is now unlikely to pay for his immigration fees. After his visa expires in June 2026, H.R. will move back to Mexico with his family and reapply for the J-1 visa in hopes of returning to California. 
“Everybody says here that they need teachers in California … but they don’t want to do anything to [help us stay] here,” H.R. said.

At the Los Angeles Unified School District, spokesperson Christy Hagen said in an email to CalMatters that the recent visa changes have not yet impacted the school’s hiring of educators on H-1B visas. Hagen said the district’s immigration experts were “still evaluating the effect of this order.”
Maria Miranda, a representative for United Teachers Los Angeles — the union for Los Angeles Unified teachers — said the district had, as of mid-November, not provided any guidance to its educators or schools on how H-1B visa hopefuls would be supported.
Flores-Perilla, the attorney bringing the lawsuit against the Trump administration, says no hearings have been set in their case yet. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has now also brought a lawsuit over the $100,000 fee, arguing that the proclamation overrides provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act and harms U.S. employers.
For now, districts will have to wait on the results of either lawsuit to potentially see some relief in immigration costs.
“It’s absolutely unfeasible to be able to pay this fee [and] to be able to actually bring in prospective employees in their fields and industries, so it’s going to hurt everyone,” Flores-Perilla said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-12 05:02:00+00:00,CT Mirror,CT promised to protect students with dyslexia,Allison Quirion,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/12/connecticut-promised-to-protect-students-with-dyslexia/,"Since the creation of the Office of Dyslexia, the state education department has failed to meet nearly every major requirement legislators put in place.","When the Connecticut legislature unanimously voted in 2021 to create the Office of Dyslexia and Reading Disabilities (ODRD), parents and educators were hopeful.
For the first time, the state had a dedicated office charged with making sure teacher preparation programs, among other things, actually prepared educators to identify and teach students with dyslexia using proven, research-based methods. Legislators backed this work with more than $2.5 million in funding and clear statutory deadlines.
Four years later, the state has little to show for it.
Since ODRD’s creation, the Connecticut State Department of Education (CSDE) has repeatedly failed to meet nearly every major requirement legislators put in place. Among the tasks required by law: develop compliance measures, create audit procedures, verify that educator preparation programs are meeting the dyslexia-related requirements, and report the results publicly. All of these were due between 2022 and 2025. Nothing around compliance has been completed.
Instead of the firm oversight structure the law demands, CSDE has chosen to engage educator preparation programs in “pre-assessment,” surveys, and “reflection” activities that offer no evidence of whether teacher preparation programs are truly preparing future educators to teach students with dyslexia. These activities are not audits. They are not compliance measures. And they cannot verify whether programs are following Connecticut law.
Connecticut is now in its fourth year of delay.
Why this matters
Dyslexia affects roughly one in five children. Research is crystal clear that structured literacy instruction works. Connecticut acknowledged this when designing the statutes that now sit idle. To ensure this actually happens, the law requires CSDE to develop an oversight system that includes compliance measures, audits, and annual verification.
Without that system, teacher preparation programs are essentially operating on the honor system. Families have no way to know whether teachers are being properly trained. And students with dyslexia continue to struggle in classrooms staffed by educators who were never taught how to help them.
A pattern of excuses instead of action
When Decoding Dyslexia–CT (DDCT) raised concerns with the CSDE this fall, the department responded with assurances that everything is on track. But these assurances don’t match the facts.
CSDE claims timelines have been consistent. Yet none of the timelines shared with deans, directors, or advisory committees include dates for creating compliance measures, setting audit procedures, verifying compliance, or publishing required reports.
The department now states that compliance measures will be released in January 2026. This is the first time DDCT or many stakeholders have heard that date. It does not appear anywhere in public meeting minutes, advisory committee discussions, or the documents produced under multiple Freedom of Information (FOI) requests.
CSDE further argues that delays were caused by FOI requests from DDCT. But those requests came years after the state hired a full-time employee to lead this work, and they were processed within a typical two-month timeframe. If searching for documents that should already have existed slowed progress, that only highlights how little groundwork had been laid.
What we know from CSDE’s own records
Documents obtained internally and through freedom of information requests  show that:

As early as November 2023, concerns were raised inside CSDE about the lack of progress on compliance and audit development.
A work plan to create these tools was drafted, yet never executed.
Contracts intended to support this work were amended to delay deadlines, shifting emphasis toward “capacity building” rather than compliance.
A survey was originally communicated as the audit tool until pushback forced CSDE to rebrand it as a “pre-assessment.”

In short, CSDE has substituted workshops and self-reflection activities for the legally required oversight system.
Connecticut’s teacher preparation programs are now being asked to “plan and implement” curriculum changes without being given the compliance frameworks that will eventually be used to evaluate them. This is like asking districts to build a school without a blueprint and promising to send one later.
The result is predictable: confusion, inconsistency, and no accountability.
What needs to happen now
The solution is not more surveys, more reflection activities, or more vague promises. Connecticut must:

Reassign responsibility for this work to experts who understand the intricacies and who were responsible for creating the recommendations that led to the law in the first place—the Dyslexia Task Force and the broader dyslexia community.
Charge the task force to immediately complete the compliance measures and audit procedures required by law.
Restore transparency by providing stakeholders with clear, public timelines that include statutory deliverables.
Conduct the long-overdue audits so that Connecticut finally knows whether teacher preparation programs are preparing educators to meet the needs of students with dyslexia.

Families have been patient. Their children cannot be.
Connecticut made promises to students with dyslexia and the families who have advocated tirelessly on their behalf. The legislature committed the CSDE to oversight, accountability, and evidence-based teacher preparation.
Four years later, none of that has materialized.
The families of Connecticut do not want conflict. We want competence. We want transparency. We want a state that honors both its laws and its children.
The state must act now.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-12 05:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,There’s no need for Connecticut’s shelters to starve,Rachel Masterson,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/12/theres-no-need-for-connecticuts-shelters-to-starve/,"Connecticut must treat access to food in homeless shelters as a public infrastructure issue, not a charitable afterthought.","On a cold Monday night in 2024, my friend and I delivered leftover food from our university’s dining hall to a homeless shelter down the street. It was the first day of school after a six-week winter break, and the first food delivery the shelter had received since the break began. Carrying three platters, I was surprised when the residents excitedly ran out to help us bring the food inside. 
“Where have you guys been?” one man asked me, excited, and clearly hungry. 
Before that day, I had not realized how much our university’s volunteer food deliveries contributed to the shelter’s food stability and security. Sadly enough, this story of hungry shelter residents relying on an unstable and unpredictable supply of food is not a new one, and is just increasing in prevalence.



According to Connecticut’s Annual Point-In-Time (PIT) count, homelessness increased by 9.5% between 2024 and 2025, with the homeless population rising from 3,410 to 3,735 people. At the same time, food insecurity has increased in the state, where according to Feeding America, one in seven Connecticut residents, including over 122,000 children, struggle with hunger. 
With the recent government shutdown, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the nation’s largest food assistance program, was threatened, potentially increasing the number of hungry and homeless who need help from shelters. Inflation has only made things worse, with  the U.S. Department of Agriculture reporting that grocery prices rose by 2.7% since 2024 and are predicted to rise a further 3% throughout 2025. 
For small shelters with tight budgets, these increases in homelessness and food prices translate to empty kitchens, canned goods, and pleas for help from volunteer groups like Wesleyan University’s Food Rescue. 

Rachel Masterson

 Although volunteer groups are vital for feeding the homeless, donation-based models are inherently unstable. They depend on unpredictable surges in giving, which often peak during major holidays, and decrease in times of economic hardship, such as the period of high unemployment, fuel costs, and food prices that our nation is currently facing. Even when donations arrive, storage facilities and food transportation pose significant barriers to fully utilizing the food donated to shelters, as described in a 2023 article on homeless food intake. 
To ensure that shelter residents have full stomachs, Connecticut must treat access to shelter food as a public infrastructure issue, not a charitable afterthought. I propose three strategies to start this process: 
Firstly, rather than depending on unpredictable donations, shelters should form contractual relationships with local farms through tax-incentive donation programs. Farmers can claim enhanced federal deductions for donating food to nonprofit homeless shelters that are 501(c)(4) organizations. This approach allows shelters to receive a consistent supply of fresh, nourishing food by picking up unmarketable and surplus produce from local farms, while also economically supporting local agriculture and reducing food waste. 
Secondly, the Department of Agriculture should expand the Food System Capacity Building Grant to homeless shelters. Currently, the Food System Capacity Building Grant provides funding to organizations and groups that increase food access and security for Connecticut residents; however, the grant restricts eligibility to food pantries, agricultural producers, farmers’ markets, and local food policy councils. If the Connecticut Department of Agriculture expanded the grant’s eligibility to include homeless shelters, shelters could buy needed kitchen equipment, transportation equipment, and sufficient food during the grant’s up to 18-month funding period, which would have lasting positive impacts on the shelter’s ability to cook and distribute food to their residents.
Lastly, shelters should leverage food waste recovery programs, as the U.S.Food and Drug Administration estimates that 30-40% of the food supply goes to waste. Shelters can partner with nearby restaurants and grocery chains for scheduled weekly food drop-offs, and Connecticut can provide tax incentives for safe food recovery, which would further encourage lasting partnerships. 
Although inflation and homelessness are only increasing over time, Connecticut has the power to prepare for these trends and change the narrative. State legislators need to prioritize stable funding for shelters in the next budget, and residents can support shelters by continuing to volunteer while also holding elected officials accountable.

The Buccini Pollin Group celebrated the grand opening of their local grocery store, Pretty Eddie’s Market, on December 10, 2025.
 
WILMINGTON — The Buccini Pollin Group officially opened the doors of Pretty Eddie’s Market to the Wilmington community in a grand opening ceremony, Wednesday afternoon. The store aims to fill a need for members of the downtown Wilmington community looking for an easily accessible and walkable place to find a little bit of everything. 
“Pretty Eddie’s was created to meet the daily needs of the downtown Wilmington neighborhood, offering both everyday essentials and thoughtful extras,” said Robert Buccini, co-founder of the Buccini Pollin Group, via a press release. 
Pretty Eddie’s resides at 730 N. Market St. near Farmer & The Cow and just down the street from Bardea Food & Drink. The store sits alone as the only grocery store within walking distance for those living in apartment complexes like The Press and The Residences at Rodney Square. The store front Pretty Eddie’s now inhabits was vacant for over five years. 
“I moved here two years ago, and I don’t drive, so it’s a little inconvenient. And I’ve been really waiting for this grocery store,” said Sally Kupchock, a resident of the area. “I’m very happy about this.”
Kupchock was one of many community members that braved a little bit of rain to check out the store after the ceremonial ribbon was cut by Buccini and his team. The 2,000 square foot store was packed full of community members taking a look at all the offerings and sampling some of what the store has to offer.

The shelves were stocked with fresh produce, snack items, and normal pantry essentials like pasta sauce and canned foods. The store has a frozen food section in the back as well as cleaning supplies and pet food. There is a deli counter where customers can get deli meats and order sandwiches to sit and eat — there is a small seating area attached to the counter. Customers can also purchase coffee from the store’s coffee bar or small flower arrangements.
“The concept for Pretty Eddie’s was to create a fresh take on the traditional corner store, combining the charm of a local market with the ease of modern convenience,” Buccini said in the press release. “Through various partnerships, our business model allows us to pass on savings to our customers, preserving accessibility and variety without compromising on quality.” 
Pretty Eddie’s partnered with ShopRite to help keep their shelves stocked with affordable products throughout the store. The store also features many items from local vendors including the floral arrangements which were supplied by The Bloom Wagon — a company based in Wilmington. Pretty Eddie’s worked with Artisan Exchange and the Wilmington Kitchen Collective to help find local vendors for their store.

Kupchock purchased a package of vegetable dumplings and a rotisserie chicken amongst other things, but said she’d have to come back when the store wasn’t so busy to peruse some more. Kupchock said she enjoyed the selection of products available, and was surprised they had “unusual” selections like the vegetable dumplings. 
“It’s open seven days a week, so I can come over anytime, and especially with the fresh vegetables and fruit, fresh bread, things that I can’t stock up on when I go to a bigger grocery store, you know… it’s just nice,” Kupchock said. 
The store is open seven days a week. Pretty Eddie’s opens at 10:30 a.m. and closes at 7:30 p.m. everyday, except for Sunday. On Sundays, the store will be open from 10:30 a.m. until 5:30 p.m. 
There is a current promotion that will run until the end of the year where customers will receive a free tote bag if their purchase is $50 or more, according to the press release. Patrons can also join “The Pretty Chicken Club” and earn a free rotisserie chicken following the purchase of ten.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/PE1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-11 23:57:00.451099

To his side is a screen displaying significant budget deficits and exhausted savings accounts if oil prices perform as expected. (Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy is proposing to spend more than $1.8 billion from the state’s principal savings account to balance a first-draft spending plan that would cover Alaska’s response to recent disasters, the state’s annual expenses in the next fiscal year, and a 2026 Permanent Fund dividend worth about $3,800 per recipient.
The governor unveiled his plan Thursday, ahead of the Dec. 15 deadline to submit a first-draft state budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1, 2026. 
The governor’s $7.75 billion draft budget is similar to what he proposed last year, but this year’s proposal also includes a substantial supplemental budget intended to compensate for unforeseen costs in the current state budget. 
That supplemental budget includes a large amount of transportation spending caught in a dispute with the Alaska State Legislature, and an additional $40 million for the state’s disaster response fund, a figure that could rise if President Donald Trump fails to approve a 100% reimbursement rate for the Typhoon Halong disaster requested by the state.
Thursday’s proposals won’t become final unless approved by the Legislature, and legislators have revised each of Dunleavy’s prior budget proposals before they became law.
Alongside his annual budget proposal, the governor unveiled a draft 10-year plan that appears to call for billions of dollars in tax increases to avoid deficits in future years.
Alaska has no statewide personal income tax or sales tax; more than 60% of general-purpose revenue comes from an annual transfer from the Alaska Permanent Fund, and about 30% generally comes from oil.
The long-term plan published by the governor’s Office of Management and Budget is required by state law, and both Dunleavy and previous governors have used prior plans to demonstrate their ideas.
Dunleavy did not hold a news conference to answer questions about his plan on Thursday, but members of the governor’s administration said he intends to unveil his long-term approach in January, before state legislators open their regular session in Juneau.
“As many of you know,” the governor said in a prerecorded video released Thursday, “oil prices are down … that negatively impacts our budget, and so we will have to fund the budget from savings this year. We all understand that spending from savings and spending the PFD is not a sustainable way to support a budget.”
Dunleavy, who is term-limited and unable to run for governor again, is entering his final year in office. Elected in 2018, he has proposed a variety of ideas each year but has thus far been unable to garner sufficient legislative support for them.
Simultaneously, he has vetoed incremental legislation to address the state’s fiscal problems, most recently with a bill that would have shifted tax revenue from other states to Alaska.
On Thursday, legislators said they were skeptical but hopeful that 2026 might bring a different result to the perennial debates over how to balance the state’s budget in the long term. “It’s probably doubtful,” said Sen. Mike Cronk, R-Tok and a member of the Senate Finance Committee. “But I’m going to stay on the hopeful side, because I know that’s really where we need to be. I’m always going to think that other people will finally say, ‘enough’s enough.’”
In all but one year during his time in office, Dunleavy has proposed a dividend paid under a disregarded but still-on-the-books formula that dates from the 1980s. 
In 2017, the Alaska Supreme Court ruled that lawmakers may ignore that formula because it is not in the state Constitution. Since then, legislators have typically reduced the dividend to what is payable without spending from savings. 
Entering his last year in office, Dunleavy is proposing to spend $2.4 billion on the dividend. Divided among 624,000 recipients — the number of eligible Alaskans in recent years — that’s roughly $3,800 per person.
Dunleavy proposed a similar dividend last year; legislators ultimately approved a $1,000 PFD that could be paid without spending from savings.
Rep. Andy Josephson, D-Anchorage and co-chair of the House Finance Committee, said that at first glance, the governor’s proposal is “very much a status quo budget” when it comes to state services, albeit with some changes.
The governor plans funding for a separate Alaska Department of Agriculture, though the creation of that department has been challenged in court by the Legislature.
Funding for the Alaska Department of Corrections is up by 3%, while funding for the state’s Medicaid program is down. No money has been earmarked for the state program that pays for major maintenance and renovations at schools, and funding for public school operations is flat.
Dunleavy is proposing to refill the state’s higher education investment fund — used to pay for college scholarships — after it was drained last year during a budget dispute with the Legislature.
At the same time, the Alaska Department of Revenue is forecasting lower oil revenue due to a declining price forecast. The state Department of Natural Resources expects higher production in fiscal year 2027, but it isn’t enough to fully offset the lower prices.
To balance the budget despite the expected decrease in oil revenue, the governor is proposing to spend from the Constitutional Budget Reserve, which is the state’s principal savings account and contained about $3 billion as of Thursday.
Between supplemental spending and the upcoming fiscal year 2027 budget, Dunleavy is proposing to spend over $1.8 billion from the reserve.
Taking money from the reserve requires three-quarters of the House and three-quarters of the Senate to agree.
In previous years, that’s been a difficult task: The House and Senate are each controlled by coalitions that have taken a skeptical and at times critical view of many of the governor’s policies.
Sen. Lyman Hoffman, D-Bethel and co-chair of the Senate Finance Committee, said on Thursday that the Senate Majority’s position is that the reserve should never be used for recurring expenses.
One-time expenses, like refilling the disaster response fund and the higher education investment fund could be acceptable, he said.
House Minority Leader DeLena Johnson, R-Palmer, said it’s too early to say what members of the 19-person, all-Republican House Minority caucus might want in exchange for voting to spend from the budget reserve.
“That’s still unfolding,” she said.
She also cautioned that the governor’s proposal is just a first draft and that it could change significantly before lawmakers convene in January. If oil prices or production fall below what’s forecast, the state might need to spend more from savings.
If additional disasters occur, that might mean another draw from savings.
“We’re just looking at the very beginning, but it’s not going to get better,” she said. “It’s just going to get worse, most likely.”

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)President Donald Trump says he is granting a pardon to Tina Peters, the former Mesa County clerk who is serving a Colorado prison sentence for her role in breaching the security of her own election equipment.
Presidential pardons have been universally understood throughout American history to apply only to federal crimes, not state crimes. Peters was convicted on state charges, and legal experts view the prospect of a pardon for Peters as legally implausible.
Trump announced the pardon on social media.
“Today I am granting Tina a full Pardon for her attempts to expose Voter Fraud in the Rigged 2020 Presidential Election!” wrote Trump, who has repeatedly demanded that Colorado release Peters.

Peters, 70, is incarcerated at La Vista Correctional Facility in Pueblo. The Republican was convicted by a Mesa County jury for her role in a 2021 security breach that was part of an effort to find evidence that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. She was sentenced in October 2024.
Claims that the election was fraudulent or compromised have been debunked by elections officials, experts, media investigations, law enforcement, the courts and Trump’s own campaign and administration officials.
Peters’ Florida-based attorney, Peter Ticktin, applied to the Trump administration last month for a pardon, as first reported by Newsline. Last week Ticktin sent Trump a nine-page letter in which he detailed his argument that Trump has the power to pardon Peters. He says the Constitution’s references to the United States apply to the individual states as well as the country as a whole, concluding that the president “has the power to grant a pardon in any of the states of the United States.”
Phil Weiser, the Democratic Colorado attorney general, previously said that a presidential pardon for Peters “will not hold up.”
“One of the most basic principles of our constitution is that states have independent sovereignty and manage our own criminal justice systems without interference from the federal government,” Weiser said earlier this month.
The chair of the Colorado Democratic Party, Shad Murib, said Trump “has no legal authority” to demand that the state release Peters.
“We’re not surprised by President Trump shouting into the wind and issuing a meaningless pardon for his friend and fellow election denier Tina Peters,” Murib said in a statement.

,California,2025-12-12 01:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,Trump’s new order against AI regulation hits California especially hard,Khari Johnson,,,,,https://calmatters.org/economy/technology/2025/12/california-ai-regulation-targeted-in-trump-order/,"Since 2016, California enacted more AI regulations than any other state. The president's new order against such laws worries state officials.","In summary
Since 2016, California enacted more AI regulations than any other state. The president’s new order against such laws worries state officials.


President Trump signed an executive order today to discourage state governments from regulating artificial intelligence and urge Congress to pass a law preempting such regulations. 
The order is likely to hit hardest in California, which since 2016 has passed more laws to regulate artificial intelligence than any other state, according to a Stanford report from earlier this year. California is also home to the world’s leading AI companies, including Anthropic, Google, Nvidia, and OpenAI.
Trump’s order would require the heads of the Federal Communications Commission, Federal Trade Commission, and Department of Justice to challenge state AI laws. It also calls for the development of model AI legislation to preempt or supersede state law unless those laws address children’s safety, data center infrastructure, state government use or AI, or other yet-to-be-determined areas.
For states that continue to regulate AI, the order instructs federal agencies to explore whether they can restrict grants to them, including by revoking funding known as Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment. California has a potential $1.8 billion in broadband funding at stake, much of which was committed to specific projects earlier this month and is set to deliver internet access to more than 300,000 people.
In a social media post earlier this week and remarks from the Oval Office today, Trump said the executive order was written to prevent businesses from needing to comply with laws from multiple states and that having to do so threatens America’s competitive advantage over other nations. Investors in tech startups, such as the Menlo Park venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, have urged the president to restrict state AI regulation and celebrated the president signing the order.
Trump’s order specifically criticized a Colorado law that requires testing and disclosure of AI that makes consequential decisions about people’s lives and seeks to prevent discrimination, a standard California lawmakers may revisit next year.
Among recently-passed California laws that federal agencies may challenge are:

A ban on AI makers blaming the technology itself for harming people when defending themselves in court.
A prohibition on algorithms raising prices.
A requirement that the makers of AI supply the public with tools to identify AI-generated photos, videos, and audio so that they can better spot fakes. 
A law going into effect next month that requires AI makers to disclose details about the data they use to train their models.

Members of Congress routinely call California an example of AI regulation run amok, but lawmakers from both major parties have supported regulating AI, with more than 70 laws passed by 27 states this year, according to a report by the Transparency Coalition. California again led the nation with the passage of roughly a dozen laws as Texas, Montana, Utah and Arkansas followed with the most AI bills signed into law this year.
The executive order comes on the heels of a second attempt in Congress to preempt state AI laws, which fell short last week. Republican members of Congress first attempted to ban AI regulation by state governments for 10 years this spring, an initiative derailed in part by concerns about the fate of a law that protects country music musicians in Tennesse and others that seek to block child sexual abuse material.
Polls show Californians and Americans support AI regulation. A Carnegie Endowment California poll released in October found that nearly 80% of Californians strongly or somewhat agree that, when it comes to AI, safety should be prioritized over innovation. A September Gallup poll also found that four out of five Americans want lawmakers to prioritize safety over innovation, even if that means the technology is developed more slowly.
In addition to endangering the lives of children, artificial intelligence can lead to false arrests, discriminate against job applicants and employees and deny people government benefits or health care that they’re entitled to. The technology is also power hungry, potentially driving upelectricity rates and endangering clean energy goals. It also needs large amounts of fresh water for the cooling systems in data centers. Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental  group that sued to stop a California data center project one year ago, called the executive order an early Christmas gift to big tech.
Opponents of the executive order say it leaves Californians vulnerable to harm.
“Make no mistake: this order doesn’t create new protections, it removes them. That’s not governing. That’s a dereliction of duty wrapped in yet another distraction from a fracturing MAGA movement and a president who doesn’t understand the real dangers of rapidly advancing tech,” State Sen. Tom Umberg, a Democrat representing Santa Ana, said in a statement last month, when a draft of the executive order leaked to the press.
In the California Legislature enthusiasm for regulating AI shows little sign of abating. More than 100 film industry workers from groups like the Animation Guild and SAG-AFTRA showed up at a committee hearing earlier this week about protecting the work of creatives. Many spoke in support of a bill requiring AI companies to disclose what copyrighted material they use to train their models.
Animation Guild president Danny Lin said at the hearing that AI threatens nearly 40,000 jobs in California’s film, television, and animation industries. 
“L.A. is bleeding out before my very eyes,” Lin told state lawmakers.
In response to the executive order Lin told CalMatters calling out a Colorado law that seeks to prevent discrimination and protect working class people doesn’t give her confidence that the legislation the president is calling for will address the concerns of creatives whose work is used to train generative AI models.
“It’s pretty apparent that if we had a federal government that was actually focused on regulating this technology then the states would not feel the need to step in and create state specific legislation,” she said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/110524_Trump-Election_GETTY_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-11 20:56:45.965897

Free.,Trump signs order intended to block states from regulating AI,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-signs-order-intended-block-states-regulating-ai,,"President Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday night that aims to preempt states from enacting rules governing artificial intelligence, a major departure from the typical federalist structure of American government that Trump said was necessary because of the issue’s high stakes.In an early evening signing ceremony in the Oval Office, Trump said the order would position the United States to win a competition with China to dominate the burgeoning AI industry. Coordinating policy among 50 different states would put the U.S. at a disadvantage, Trump said, adding that Chinese President Xi Jinping did not have similar restraints.“This will not be successful unless they have one source of approval or disapproval,” he said. “It’s got to be one source. They can’t go to 50 different sources.”The order creates a task force to monitor state laws on AI and to challenge them in court, and directs the Commerce secretary to complete a review of state laws within three months.David Sacks, the chair of a White House board on technology, said there were more than 1,000 pending AI bills in state legislatures.White House staff secretary Will Scharf said during the Oval Office event that the order would “ensure that AI can operate within a single national framework in this country, as opposed to being subject to state level regulation that could potentially cripple the industry.”“The big picture is that we're taking steps to ensure that AI operates under a single national standard so that we can reap the benefits that will come from it.”The order, a major assertion of presidential power over state governments and Congress, is likely to see court challenges, including from environmental groups that oppose AI expansion because of the energy resources the technology requires.“Congress has repeatedly rejected attempts to undermine states’ and local communities' efforts to protect themselves from the unchecked spread of AI, which is driving a wave of dangerous data center development,” Mitch Jones, the chief of policy and litigation at the advocacy group Food and Water Watch, said in a statement. “We’ll be following the administration’s attempts to implement this farcical order, and we’ll fight it in Congress, in the states, in the courts, and with communities across this country.”",,,,2025-12-11 19:57:17.220170

A long-delayed migration corridor designation advanced by Wyoming's governor is preferred by the livestock industry. It forgoes protections for animals that use the Red Desert and Golden Triangle.
The post Gordon pares back Wyoming’s first pronghorn migration, overriding Game and Fish commissioners appeared first on WyoFile .","On-again, off-again plans to protect habitat used by about 5,000 pronghorn that migrate through the Red Desert and the Golden Triangle region east of Farson are once again off-again. 
On Thursday, Gov. Mark Gordon announced that he was moving forward with the next step of the labyrinthine process for designating western Wyoming’s Sublette Pronghorn Migration Corridor, which began six years ago. But the governor explained that he sought to only protect eight of 10 segments that have been mapped, leaving out the two easternmost areas.
The Wyoming Game and Fish Department proposed the same plan in September, trimming off 270,000-plus acres, but that proved unpopular largely because it emanated from the livestock industry. Later that month, the Wyoming Game and Fish Commission reversed course, adding the two segments back. 
Now Gordon, who’s appointed all the sitting Game and Fish commissioners, has trumped their proposal to designate the corridor in full. Under Wyoming’s migration policy, it’s ultimately the governor who decides whether a route gets designated. 
This is the first test of the state’s migration policy, and it’s been a bumpy road that illustrates the difficulty of protecting energy-rich landscapes for wildlife’s sake.
Gordon was not available for an interview on Thursday afternoon.

Game and Fish Commissioner Ken Roberts said it was a “tough” issue, but that he respected the decision. 
“I can’t take it personally,” Roberts told WyoFile. “We’re just part of the equation. I’m happy we got the eight [segments].” 
Meanwhile, Wyoming Stock Growers Association Executive Vice President Jim Magagna, whose ranch is adjacent to the off-again segments, said that he was pleased. Although he first pushed the idea of trimming the pronghorn herd’s “East of Farson” and Red Desert segments, the plan was later adopted by the Game and Fish Department as its own. At the time, wildlife managers explained their support for leaving off the two segments because there were no “migration bottlenecks” there and threats to the habitat were relatively limited.
“I don’t buy that they did it just because I asked for it,” Magagna told WyoFile. “I think they did it because they did the review, and said that the science justified taking that approach.” 
Notably, threats to habitat within the dropped segments may soon change. The Bureau of Land Management currently has a protective “area of critical environmental concern” in place overlapping much of the “East of Farson” segment, but the resource management plan there is being revised on a tight timeline. Concurrently, the oil and gas industry has shown significant interest in leasing ground in the area, including an especially ecologically valuable swath of the sagebrush-steppe biome known as the Golden Triangle.

Wildlife advocacy groups in Wyoming had mixed reactions to Gordon’s announcement. Craig Benjamin, who directs the Wyoming Wildlife Federation, said that he appreciated the governor’s decision to pursue the next step in the migration designation process.
“With pronghorn populations down roughly 40% and facing growing pressures on the landscape, it’s important that we work together to designate as much of the corridor as feasible to keep this migration intact,” Benjamin said in a text message. 
The Wyoming Outdoor Council’s Meghan Riley struck a starkly different tone: “This decision subverts the will of the people and direction from the [Wyoming Game and Fish Commission] to the detriment of thousands of pronghorn in the Sublette Herd that will now be excluded from this process.” 
“We are deeply disappointed with this decision,” she added, “but remain committed to seeing designation advance for the remaining segments of the migration corridor.” 
Retired Game and Fish biologist Rich Guenzel was also disheartened by the news, calling it a “political decision” that ignores the herd’s biological needs.  
“I would respectfully disagree with the governor on his assessment,” said Guenzel, who personally endowed a pronghorn-specific conservation fund. “I don’t know his rationale, other than they’re not biological.”
Efforts to protect the remaining eight segments of the Sublette Pronghorn Herd’s migration paths still face some hurdles. 
Gordon will soon appoint a “local working group” consisting of two representatives of the agriculture industry, two “industrial users” (oil, gas, mining and renewable), two representatives for wildlife, conservation and hunting and a single rep for motorized recreation. Applications to the group are being accepted through Dec. 31. 
“The local working group is ultimately charged with reviewing the Game and Fish’s risk assessment, corridor components, potential impacts to socio-economic conditions of the region, conservation opportunities, highway projects, and other factors appropriate to the potential designation,” a press release from Gordon stated.

After the working group’s deliberations, the decision will swing back to Gordon. If he designates the corridor, it’d be the first since Wyoming’s migration policy was revamped in 2019, but he can also kick it back to Game and Fish for refinement or reject it. 
On the federal level, there have been efforts to protect the Sublette Pronghorn Herd’s migration paths for a quarter century. In 2008, the Bridger-Teton National Forest amended its forest plan, protecting that portion, and the route earned publicity and was given the moniker “the Path of the Pronghorn.” But its southernmost stretches, which cut through mostly Bureau of Land Management property, ran into political pressure and have remained unprotected ever since.

It’s a sentiment many other farmers echoed at an annual meeting Wednesday for the South Dakota Farmers Union. Trump’s “bridge payments” are meant to help farmers who struggled to sell crops during tariff-related market disruptions, such as China’s temporary boycott of U.S. soybean purchases.

Trump announced Monday that farmers who have been impacted by “unfair market disruption” will receive a one-time, per-acre payment, which he said is available from tariff revenues.
The payments are intended for row-crop farmers, with about $1 billion reserved for specialty crop farmers. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said funds should be in farmers’ hands by the end of February, at a limit of $155,000 per recipient.
Rob Larew, president of the National Farmers Union, hopes the payout is part of a longer-term solution to improve trade relationships.
“We really need fundamental changes with the way we support agriculture and farmers and ranchers,” Larew said, “so that we don’t find ourselves in another situation like this.”
In his conversations with financial lenders in South Dakota and across the country, Larew said he’s heard concern about the deeper economic impact of unstable international trade. Lenders told him they’ll be unable to make loans for up to 50% of their farm customers in the next year.
Trump to send $12 billion in one-time payments to farmers to offset ag losses

“That’s going to have not only devastating impact for those particular families,” he said. “But then the succession, the land turnover and what it does to those communities is going to have a lasting impact.”
Chad Johnson is a fourth-generation farmer in Brown County, where he raises corn, soybeans and cattle. At the start of the second Trump administration, he noticed the impact of the trade war almost immediately: Prices increased for fertilizer and other inputs, and neighboring farms were either unable to sell their product or forced to sell at a loss.
Johnson wants people who aren’t involved in agriculture to understand that for some farmers, taking the federal payments is a matter of survival.
“We buy retail, we sell wholesale, and we pay the freight both ways,” he said. “We’re basically price takers, not price makers, and it’s hard to do that when prices are suppressed, and our inputs are so high.”
He’s already had to pay more for nitrous and phosphorus. The federal payouts, he said, will come “into our hands and right back out.”

He’s got two new titles: First Assistant United States Attorney and “special attorney” to Attorney General Pam Bondi. Plus, he will keep carrying out duties as the acting leader of the Eastern District office. 
The changes, announced Thursday, come after time expired on Serrano’s appointment by the Trump administration as an interim United States attorney.
He was sworn in Aug. 11 and was able to serve 120 days while awaiting confirmation. President Donald Trump never nominated him and the clock ran out Tuesday.
Judges in the Eastern District could have reappointed him or put someone else in the job. They did neither.
That opened the door for Bondi to act. She assigned Serrano the new job titles, ensuring he stays on as the acting leader of the office until the U.S. attorney position is filled. 
“I appreciate the opportunity to continue serving my community as a member of the Department of Justice,” Serrano said in a statement. 
He declined requests for further comment Thursday.
It’s a good turn of events for the conservative Republican who lost his race for state attorney general last year.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
He knew confirmation was unlikely because of staunch opposition from Patty Murray, Washington’s senior Democratic senator. She said Serrano is unqualified for the job and vowed in August to use all available means to block the Pasco lawyer from getting confirmed.
Murray, in a statement Thursday, said the Trump administration is “attempting a transparent end run around the Constitution and Congress” after federal judges declined to extend Serrano’s tenure.
“This move spits in the face of the law and Congress — and it sets a dangerous precedent and risks jeopardizing the legitimacy of the U.S. Attorney’s office moving forward,” she said.
This maneuver is similar to what the Trump administration did to keep John Sarcone III at the helm of the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Northern District of New York.
Sarcone was appointed but never formally nominated by the president. When his 120-day tenure concluded, federal judges in the district declined to reappoint him or someone else. Bondi then appointed him “special attorney” with the powers of a U.S. attorney and no time limit on service.
A federal statute known as the Vacancies Act outlines who can serve and for how long in a vacant position subject to Senate confirmation. There is an ongoing debate on the extent to which the executive branch can install a new first assistant U.S. attorney during a vacancy. 
Trump ignited a legal imbroglio with Alina Habba, his ill-fated choice to be New Jersey’s top federal prosecutor. Habba has been nominated but not confirmed. She spent months fighting unsuccessfully in court to keep the gig after her 120-day appointment expired. 
She resigned Monday, a week after a federal appeals court ruled against her. 
That same day, Bondi hired her as a senior adviser.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/pete-serrano-1024x597.jpg,,,2025-12-11 19:57:17.220170

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) The U.S. House of Representatives voted Thursday to pass a bill that Republicans say would reform the Clean Water Act and cut through regulatory burdens. 
Democrats and environmental groups said the Promoting Efficient Review for Modern Infrastructure Today, or the PERMIT Act, protects water polluters and removes clean water protections. 
The PERMIT Act would redefine “navigable waters” – a term key to defining the waters that are protected by the Clean Water Act – and exclude waste treatment systems, streams that flow only in direct response to precipitation, prior converted cropland, groundwater and other features decided on by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
The Republican-sponsored bill passed almost entirely on party lines, with six Democrats and one Republican voting against their party.

Rep. Sam Graves, R-Missouri, who cosponsored the bill with Rep. Mike Collins, R-Georgia, said the permitting “regime” of the Clean Water Act is “broken.” 
Graves pointed to the length of time it takes for certain permits regulated by the act to be approved and said states can “weaponize” the act to stop infrastructure projects like a pipeline. 
Graves said the bill would implement reforms that would stop the act from “being weaponized,” place clear timelines on judicial review, increase transparency on the development of water quality standards and codify “long standing bipartisan exemptions” from the definition of Waters of the United States, or the waters that are protected by the Clean Water Act.
“Without reforming the Clean Water Act, America cannot efficiently build roads, build bridges or pipelines or ponds or dams, levees, airports, homes, farms and other infrastructure that we need,” Graves said. “This bill acknowledges that we can both protect our natural resources and allow for development that benefits everyone in this country.” 
Republicans argued on the floor that the bill would increase efficiency, cut red tape, unlock economic growth and increase affordability across the country. 
Rep. Hillary Scholten, D-Michigan, who led the opposition against the bill on the floor, agreed that the Clean Water Act and in particular its permitting regulations needed reform. But, she said, the PERMIT Act is “not it.” 
Scholten said the bill would shift the cost of clean water from polluters to “rural America, tribes and disadvantaged communities.” 
“We do need reform, but this bill is not what we need,” Scholten said. “It doesn’t just cut red tape, it cuts all the tape that has protected our clean water for 50 years since the Clean Water Act was signed into law.”
Scholten and other Democrats on the floor argued the bill would lead to more water pollution, higher water utility bills and decreased ability for a state to control the pollution within its boundaries. 
Iowa groups tell congressional delegation bill would ‘gut’ Clean Water Act

“Efficiency is important; American industry will falter and families will suffer if unnecessary red tape gets in the way of innovation and building,” Rep. Kristen McDonald Rivet, also a Democrat from Michigan, said. “But as we cut red tape, we need to do so in a smart way, not in a way that will put clean water at risk.” 
The bill would set timelines for judicial review of certain permits. Proponents of the bill said this would keep projects from being stalled by lawsuits, but opponents of the bill said it leaves too short a window for groups to understand all of the potential risks involved with a project. 
Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Missouri, said the bill “delivers a long overdue blow to the radical environmental agenda, that has weaponized the Clean Water Act.” 
“The PERMIT act slashes red tape,” Burlison said. “It ends bureaucratic overreach and restores freedom to build an America that works for its people again.” 
Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Washington, said the bill’s 60-day review period for fill and dredge permits would be “unworkably short” for a community to understand the effects a project would have, or to mount any sort of “meaningful resistance” to a project. 
“This is a false solution that attacks essential, clean water safeguards and undermines access to our courts,” Jayapal said. 
Tarah Heinzen, the legal director with the environmental group Food & Water Watch, said the act is an “explicit assault” on one of the nation’s “most critical bedrock environmental laws.” 
“The impact of this bill would be bleak: a return to the bad old days of unchecked industrial pollution, rivers on fire, contaminated drinking water, poisoned communities and people getting sick,” Heinzen said in a statement. 
Rep. Dave Taylor, R-Ohio, said the bill also contained revisions to the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System, or NPDES, that would provide “reasonable protections” for permit holders from “frivolous” lawsuits when they are in compliance with the terms of their permits. 
Scholten said the bill is “nothing more than a dirty water bill dressed up in a fancy name” and urged the body to go “back to the table” and reject the bill as it is currently written. 
Amendments 
Seven amendments were introduced and adopted on the floor, including one introduced by U.S. Rep. Aaron Bean, R-Florida, that he said would codify dredge and fill permitting programs administered by the states of Florida, Michigan and New Jersey, and to “provide certainty” to the other states lined up to do the same.
Scholten opposed the amendment, along with other Republican-led amendments that would: expedite judicial review processes for discharge permits, amend the definition of prior converted cropland, require the identification of federal lands suitable for aquifer recharge projects and increase the available supply of wetland mitigation bank credits. 
Rep. Zach Nunn, a Republican from Iowa, proposed an amendment which passed via voice vote to establish a voluntary pilot program to support state-led water quality improvement projects for nitrogen- and phosphorus-impaired waterways. 
Nunn said the amendment would help water quality improvement projects move “forward smoothly and with support” and without imposing “new obligations on a producer or a private landowner.” 
Nunn said the issue was especially important for his home state of Iowa, where rivers regularly have nitrogen concentrations well above the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s safe drinking water limits.
Scholten said the amendment, which did not include an appropriation for the pilot program, was “costly and redundant.” She worried without funding for the voluntary program, funding from other programs would be redirected. 
Finally, Rep. Scott Peters, D-California, proposed an amendment that would allow the International Boundary and Water Commission to accept funds for wastewater treatment and flood control works, which passed without opposition from Republicans.

(Photo by Mike Clark for the Daily Montanan)The Montana Human Rights Bureau found “no reasonable cause to believe unlawful discrimination occurred” by Republican state Sen. Barry Usher as alleged by state Sen. Mary Ann Dunwell.
However, the Human Rights Bureau found the acts in question from the 2025 legislative session “fall squarely within the sphere of legitimate legislative activity,” meaning Usher has immunity, and the Bureau does not have jurisdiction to investigate the allegations.
Dunwell, a Helena Democrat, filed a discrimination complaint this summer with the Montana Human Rights Bureau alleging discrimination by Usher, who represents a part of the Billings area.
Dunwell alleged Usher, chairman of the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee, had bullied, belittled and harassed members of the public and other legislators based on their political beliefs, sex and gender identity.
Dunwell also alleged retaliation, that Usher ensured none of her bills passed after she filed an internal harassment complaint in March 2025, during the session.
In a final investigation report Dunwell provided to the Daily Montanan, the Human Rights Bureau said it reviewed numerous Senate Judiciary hearings, floor sessions, and legislative histories, and all of the discrimination allegations “attach to legislative acts.”
Those acts are protected, the Human Rights Bureau said. The bureau enforces laws that prohibit discrimination as part of the Department of Labor and Industry.
When reached briefly Thursday, Usher said he was out of the country, and he could not be subsequently reached for comment. He earlier said he did not believe the Human Rights Bureau had jurisdiction, and he would never encourage legislators to cast votes they did not believe in.
Usher also earlier said he tried to maintain decorum in his committee, and even when a “software glitch” meant a person who wanted to offer testimony in committee wasn’t on his official list to testify, the person testified at a later date.
Citing a Montana Supreme Court case, the final report said historically, the British Crown used criminal and civil law to “suppress and intimidate critical legislators,” and giving lawmakers immunity was meant to protect them from outside pressures and “ensure the independence of the legislature.”
But the report noted Dunwell raised a question about her own ability to “effectuate the function of her (legislative) office” and whether a “toxic/discriminatory workplace” violated her legislative immunity.
“In the end, Dunwell’s main concern appears to be that she and her constituents were ‘disenfranchised,’” the report said. “Such allegations are (seemingly) better suited for consideration under the constitutional ‘right of participation.’ … This agency does not enforce the right of participation.”
In a phone call, Dunwell said she is considering taking the matter to district court, and she is discussing the possibility with political activist Evan Barrett, a Democrat who joined Dunwell in alleging violations of the right to participate.
Dunwell said she does not plan to appeal the matter administratively because in order to do so, she would need to claim the Human Rights Bureau abused its discretion, and she believes the Bureau “worked really hard” on the case.
But Dunwell said she wants to know what happens when two Constitutionally protected rights appear to be in conflict — in this case, the right lawmakers have to immunity from being questioned for their role in the legislature, but also, the right people have to know what their government is doing and to participate.
“We (legislators) have the right to know, and the public has the right to know,” Dunwell said.
But if testimony is stifled, that prevents her right to know, and it violates the public’s right to participate, Dunwell said.
Dunwell said she decided to run for office years ago after watching a citizen be belittled while giving public testimony, and she believes the public right to participation has only been curtailed since.
“It’s just gotten worse and worse and worse, and what I see is we’re getting desensitized to it,” Dunwell said.
But she said she believes the public’s right to know is paramount, especially when it comes to the Montana Legislature — “We are the people’s branch, after all.”
Dunwell said she finds it sad that legislative immunity allows legislators to behave badly. However, she said the constraints of the legislative process also play a role; 1,759 bills were introduced in the session this year, and sessions are 90 days.
In the complaint, Dunwell also had named Senate President Matt Regier, Majority Leader Tom McGillvray, Legislative Services Chief Legal Counsel Todd Everts, and Legislative Services Administrator Jerry Howe as respondents , but the Human Rights Bureau said the only specific acts Dunwell cited were connected to Usher.

A state regulator is requiring California’s last nuclear power plant to conserve 4,000 acres of surrounding land to keep operating until 2030.


California’s last nuclear power plant overcame a regulatory hurdle on Thursday when the California Coastal Commission voted to approve keeping the plant open for at least five years.
It was one of the final obstacles the controversial Diablo Canyon Power Plant had to clear to continue operating amid renewed opposition. The decision was conditioned on a plan that would require Pacific Gas & Electric, which owns the plant, to conserve about 4,000 acres of land on its property. That would prevent it from ever being developed for commercial or residential use.
The plant, located along the San Luis Obispo shoreline, now awaits federal approval for a 20-year relicensing permit.
“I don’t think, unfortunately, that anything will be happening to Diablo Canyon soon,” due to the growing energy demands of artificial intelligence, Commissioner Jaime Lee said before voting to approve the permit. Nine of the 12 voting members approved the plan. 
The deliberations reignited decades-old concerns about the dangers of nuclear power and its place in the state’s portfolio of renewable energy sources. Diablo Canyon is the state’s single-largest energy source, providing nearly 10% of all California electricity.
Defeated in their earlier attempts to shut the plant, critics of Diablo Canyon used months of Coastal Commission hearings as one of their last opportunities to vocalize their disdain for the facility. Some Democratic lawmakers supported the plant but pushed for PG&E to find more ways to protect the environment.
Sen. John Laird, Democrat of San Luis Obispo County and former secretary of the California Natural Resources Agency, said on Thursday he approved of the new plan but pushed the commission to require the utility to conserve even more of its total 12,000 surrounding acres.
“If what comes out of this is the path for preservation for 8,000 acres of land, that is a remarkable victory,” Laird said.
Democratic Assemblymember Dawn Addis, whose district encompasses the plant, had also urged the commission in a letter to approve a permit “once it contains strong mitigation measures that reflect the values and needs of the surrounding tribal and local communities who depend on our coastal regions for environmental health, biodiversity and economic vitality.” 
A long history of controversy
Founded in 1985, the plant’s striking concrete domes sit along the Pacific coast 200 miles north of Los Angeles. The facility draws in 2 million gallons of water from the ocean every day to cool its systems 
And it has remained shrouded in controversy since its construction 40 years ago. Environmentalists point to the damage it causes to marine life, killing what the Coastal Commission estimates are 2 billion larval fish a year.
The commissioners on Thursday were not deciding whether to allow the plant to stay open but were weighing how best to lessen the environmental impacts of its operation. A 2022 state law forced the plant to stay open for five more years past its planned 2025 closure date, which could have led to significant political blowback against the Coastal Commission if it had rejected the permit.

Gov. Gavin Newsom reversed a 2016 agreement made between environmental groups and worker unions to close the plant after the state faced a series of climate disasters that spurred energy blackouts. Popular sentiment toward nuclear energy has also continued to grow more supportive as states across the country consider revitalizing dormant and aging nuclear plants to fulfill ever-increasing energy demand needs.
The 2022 law authorized a $1.4 billion loan to be paid back with federal loans or profits.
Groups such as the Environmental Defense Center and Mothers for Peace opposed the permit outright, citing concerns about radioactive waste, which can persist for centuries, and its cost to taxpayers.
“We maintain that any extension of Diablo is unnecessary,” and that its continued operations could slow the development of solar and wind energy, Jeremy Frankel, an attorney with the Environmental Defense Center told the commission Thursday. 
The California Public Utilities Commission last year approved $723 million in ratepayer funds toward Diablo Canyon’s operating costs this year. It was the first time rate hikes were spread to ratepayers of other utilities such as Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric and was authorized by lawmakers because the plant provides energy to the entire state.
How the plant will be funded has also garnered scrutiny in the years since Newsom worked to keep it open. Last year, the Legislature nearly canceled a $400 million loan to help finance it.
As much as $588 million is unlikely to come back due to insufficient federal funding and projected profits, CalMatters has reported.
Proponents of the plant pointed to its reliability, carbon-free pollution and the thousands of jobs it has created.
Business advocacy groups emphasized their support for the plant as boosting the economy.

(Getty Images)The president of the state board that oversees optometrists has resigned amid reports the board circumvented state law by waiving licensure requirements for some optometry graduates as detailed Thursday in a report by the Kentucky Lantern.
It also comes as the Kentucky Optometric Association (KOA), in an email Thursday to members, called for “a comprehensive, corrective plan to address decisions made during and immediately after” the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 through mid-2022.
Questionable testing waivers put KY’s licensing of optometrists under scrutiny

“We take our responsibility to our patients and to our profession with utmost seriousness,” said the statement from association President Dr. Hannah Huffman, titled “Response to Testing Waivers Provided by the Kentucky Board of Optometric Examiners.”
It added: “Safety must remain — without exception — our highest priority and expectation.”
The statement also included a link to the Lantern article.
The board had cited the pandemic as grounds for exempting some candidates from portions of a three-part national exam required for licensure in Kentucky.
The KOA statement said that Dr. Joe Ellis, president of the state Board of Optometric Examiners, which licenses and regulates optometrists, advised the association Thursday that he had resigned Wednesday. The Lantern reported the board appears to have waived parts of the exam for 21 candidates, including the daughter of Ellis.
Neither Ellis nor board executive director Christi LeMay responded to requests for comment Thursday.
The board is to meet Friday to address questions raised in an attorney general’s opinion about whether licenses granted by waiving some requirements are valid.
The state optometric association’s statement praised actions already underway at the examiners board, including “changes in leadership” and “the hiring of outside legal counsel.”
The legislature’s Government Contract Review Committee this week approved a contract for the board’s legal services with the KWH law practice in Frankfort.
Also, Thursday, the Kentucky Academy of Eye Physicians and Surgeons, which represents ophthalmologists, released a statement saying it is happy the board “is moving forward.”
“Kentuckians rely on safe, high-quality eye care and have every right to know whether their optometrist or ophthalmologist is fully qualified and in good standing,” it said. “We hope for transparency and strong patient safety protections for everyone across the commonwealth.”
Optometrists hold a four-year doctorate of optometry but are not medical doctors, like ophthalmologists, who attend medical school followed by a residency in eye care and surgery.
However, Kentucky optometrists do have one of the most advanced scopes of practice in the nation, enacted through  a 2011 change in the law amid a lobbying blitz by the politically influential optometrists.
Ellis, a Benton optometrist and prominent figure in state and national optometry circles, resigned two days before the state board was to meet Friday to discuss how to address an Oct. 1 state attorney general’s opinion that its decision during the COVD-19 pandemic to waive some requirements for licensure conflicted with state law.
And the resignation came one day before the Kentucky Lantern reported that the board’s practice of waiving requirements for some licensees, including Ellis’ daughter, had come under question by national officials who administer the three-part exam required for licensure.
The National Board of Optometric Examiners, or NBEO, notified the state board in May it had identified 21 optometry graduates who obtained Kentucky licenses from 2020 through 2023 without having passed “one or more” parts of the state-required, three-part exam administered by the national board.
“NBEO is trying to understand how this could have happened,” said the confidential letter obtained by the Lantern through the Kentucky Open Records Act.
Among the 21 graduates who were licensed without passing all three parts of  the exam was Dr. Hannah Ellis, a 2020 graduate of the University of Pikeville’s College of Optometry, established in 2016. Her license was issued in November 2021, according to board records, two months after her father was appointed president of the board by Gov. Andy Beshear.
Neither Ellis responded to requests for comment from the Lantern,
The board did not respond to multiple requests for comment from the Lantern about its practice of exempting some candidates from some requirements.
At the time, they were required to pass all three parts of a national exam. The board, according to its minutes, cited the COVID-19 pandemic and a requirement candidates travel to an out of state testing site as one reason for exempting students from parts of the exam.
But the attorney general found the board lacked the power to do that unless it promulgated new regulations governing licensure, which it did not do.
The board has since enacted regulations allowing candidates to take a Canadian optometry exam, considered easier, in lieu of the national Part 1 exam. It did not respond to a question from the Lantern about whether any Kentucky candidates had taken that exam, which became an option around August after the board enacted a change in state regulations.

(Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska’s officially nonpartisan Unicameral is in the crosshairs of the national Democrats for 2026.
The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, the party’s national arm that targets legislative races, announced this week that the Nebraska Legislature is part of its efforts to expand the map of where it helps Democrats compete during the upcoming midterm elections.
The group’s increased effort in Nebraska will be part of a $50 million political investment across 27 states. The announcement came after Democrats overperformed in this year’s election across the country, including in gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia and most recently in flipping a mayoral seat in Miami. 
For Nebraska, the DLCC aims to help Nebraska Democrats break the 33-vote Republican supermajority in the 49-member one-house Legislature, according to its strategy memo. 
 The DLCC wants to help Nebraska Democrats gain at least one seat, which would help preserve the filibuster. The Nebraska Democratic Party has also focused staff time and resources on legislative races.

In theory, the GOP majority could pass legislation without Democratic input and overcome any filibuster. In practice, some moderate Republican senators have sided with Democrats on central issues that have stopped a handful of more controversial proposals. 
“The favorable political environment taking shape for Democrats is on a scale that only comes once in a generation,” Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee President Heather Williams said in a statement. “The DLCC is poised to meet this moment through the largest target map and political budget ever. We aren’t wasting a moment to execute on our winning strategy.”
The Legislature’s Democratic-leaning minority holds 16 seats, including progressive Omaha nonpartisan State Sen. Megan Hunt. 
Hunt left the Democratic Party in 2023. At the time, she pointed to state Democratic candidates not receiving enough national support from the DLCC and other Democratic-aligned organizations as one of the reasons for her departure. 
The Republican State Leadership Committee, the GOP counterpart to the DLCC, which helps Republicans with state legislative races, hasn’t released its targets for 2026, but said it plans to do so in the future.
Mason Di Palma, the group’s communications director, said, “If Democrats want to waste their significant fundraising advantage chasing fantasy wins in red states, we say go for it.”
“They clearly haven’t learned a thing, but we welcome their repeat mistakes,” Di Palma said. “The biggest winners from this announcement are RSLC donors, whose dollars will continue to go further as we prioritize efficient investments, while Democrats stretch themselves thin.”
State Sen. Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln, a Republican who ran in one of the three most expensive legislative races in the 2024 cycle, said, “I believe both political parties will be investing resources into the elections in 2026, which is not out of the ordinary.”

(Photo by Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas Supreme Court on Thursday dismissed an administrative civil appeal Chief Justice Karen Baker filed in January against the state courts director, ending a months-long dispute.
Baker’s appeal asked her colleagues to dismiss the findings in a human resources investigation that determined she harassed judiciary employees in December 2024.
“We consider this an attempt to judicially appeal initial findings, and we hold that we lack jurisdiction over this internal appeal,” the justices wrote in a per curiam order.
Baker visited the Justice Building on Dec. 4-5, 2024, after she was elected but before she was sworn in as the first elected female chief justice. Her behavior toward Administrative Office of the Courts employees prompted the human resources probe and resulted in a Jan. 10 report that was not made public until March 13.
“Justice Baker intimidated staff, appears to have targeted female employees of color, indicated an intention to retaliate based on her perception of how employees voted, and indicated an intention to retaliate based on her perception of whether employees were cooperating with Judicial Discipline and Disability Commission’s investigation into her colleague’s conduct,” the report states.
AOC Director Marty Sullivan asked Baker on Jan. 13 to stay away from the agency’s offices and not to communicate with his staff, pending the conclusion of a judicial disciplinary review against her. Baker responded by filing the administrative civil appeal.

12.11.25 per curiam 
“It was unusual in the sense that Chief Justice Baker simultaneously filed the matter yet asked this court to dismiss it,” the per curiam order states.
Baker and Sullivan agreed that the court did not have jurisdiction over the matter. The participating justices agreed and granted both parties’ request to dismiss the case.
The dismissal does not have any effect on any Judicial Discipline and Disability Commission investigations or findings regarding Baker, the justices wrote.
“Chief Justice Baker argues that the proper remedy is for the JDDC to resolve the harassment and other complaints,” the order states. “JDDC should promptly resolve the complaints. There are employees who have not received a resolution of their serious charges and a Chief Justice who has been limited in her ability to interact with many senior staff. It has been a year, and the delay simply cannot continue.”
The human resources document corroborates reports that Baker entered Sullivan’s office on Dec. 4 when he was not present. She “was observed looking throughout Mr. Sullivan’s office, including the area behind his desk” and later returned with two other people: Associate Justice Courtney Hudson and Baker’s former law clerk, Department of Commerce Chief of Staff Allison Hatfield. Arkansas Business reported on the trio’s apparently unauthorized visit to Sullivan’s office on Dec. 11, 2024.
Baker’s visit to AOC’s Court Information Systems Division left employees feeling harassed, according to the report. The following day, she tried to order one of the employees to allow her into Sullivan’s locked office.

In January, within days of being sworn in as chief justice, Baker attempted to fire 10 court employees, including Sullivan and two Court Information Systems Division administrators. Baker also attempted to appoint three new judges to the judicial disciplinary panel.
With the exception of Hudson, Baker’s colleagues blocked the firings and appointments, saying they were outside the scope of her authority and calling the firings “retaliatory.”
Judicial conduct had been at the forefront of the Supreme Court since September 2024, when five justices referred Hudson to the JDDC for “flagrant breaches of confidentiality” after she filed former Chief Justice John Dan Kemp’s emails into evidence in her attempt to block the release of emails between her, Hatfield and others in response to a FOIA request from Arkansas Business. Baker was the only justice to oppose the referral.
Baker, Hudson and Associate Justice Cody Hiland recused themselves from the administrative civil appeal earlier this year and did not participate in Thursday’s per curiam order. Special Justices Cory Cox, Kevin Crass and Bilenda Harris-Ritter were appointed to replace the recused justices, and all joined in Thursday’s per curiam order.
Also on Thursday, Associate Justice Rhonda Wood denied a motion from Baker’s previous attorney, Tom Mars, to recuse herself from the case. Mars filed the motion in March, stating that Wood’s praise of Sullivan in a January public meeting and her loss to Baker in the 2024 chief justice runoff election gave her a conflict of interest in the matter. 
Mars withdrew from the case in June, and Jeff Rosenzweig replaced him as Baker’s attorney. Members of Attorney General Tim Griffin’s staff have represented Sullivan.
Sullivan declined to comment Thursday on the dismissal. Baker could not be reached for comment.

(Keila Szpaller/The Daily Montanan)Glacier National Park will end its ticketed vehicle entry program in 2026, the Daily Inter Lake reported this week.
At a Columbia Falls Chamber of Commerce meeting on Dec. 9, Glacier Superintendent Dave Roemer said the pilot program implemented in 2021 had broken up midday traffic through the park, but it created incentives for people to drive in the dark to Logan Pass, the Inter Lake said.
With the program rescinded, Roemer said he hoped more visitors would drive later in the day when it’s safer, the Inter Lake reported.
In 2025, tickets were required from June 13 to Sept. 28 from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. on the west side of Going-to-the-Sun Road and the North Fork, according to information on the park website.
The park instituted the piloted $2 ticket program for Going-to-the-Sun Road in 2021 after seeing a record number of visitors in October 2020 and traffic jams on the famed and picturesque highway.
Glacier modified the program over the years, including to apply to the Two Medicine and Many Glacier valleys, arguing traffic patterns required restrictions when parking capacity was surpassed.
Glacier reported the program was necessary to manage traffic and ensure a quality experience in the park.
However, it was controversial because it limited the ability of tourists and Montanans to visit the park if they didn’t reserve tickets in advance or want to drive in the early morning or late afternoons.
In an email Thursday, a spokesperson for Glacier National Park said the park would update the public once a decision for 2026 had been made but did not dispute the information from Roemer in the Inter Lake.
The spokesperson did not answer questions about why Glacier reversed course on the ticketed entry or if it would implement other tools to manage traffic congestion in the park.
The change is slated to take place following employee reductions this year at the U.S. National Park Service under the Trump administration. In May, an internal memo from Glacier indicated 20% of park positions were vacant.
On its website, the park is encouraging tourists to explore recreation options outside Glacier National Park.
The Daily Inter Lake also reported that park officials will enforce a new three-hour parking limit on personal vehicles at Logan Pass.
Roemer said that timeframe reflects the average turnaround at the popular Avalanche Lake Trailhead, and it would allow most people to finish the Hidden Lake Trail hike that starts near the Logan Pass Visitor Center, according to the Inter Lake.
The Glacier spokesperson said the park uses a variety of information to manage access.
“The National Park Service continuously reviews Glacier National Park’s pilot operation programs to determine adjustments for the following year,” Glacier said in an email. “Visitor use data, gate counts, congestion monitoring, traffic operations, and feedback from the public and gateway communities help inform strategies the park uses to manage congestion, shuttles, parking, and visitor access.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Glacier-High-Line.png,,,2025-12-11 19:57:17.220170

(McKenzie Romero/Utah News Dispatch)Measles is spreading to more people and more parts of Utah since an initial outbreak on the Arizona border, with 115 people diagnosed statewide and recent cases confirmed in Davis, Salt Lake and Wasatch counties, the state’s top public health officer said Thursday.
“We haven’t had that many measles cases in Utah for over 30 years,” state epidemiologist Leisha Nolen told reporters Thursday. “So this is very extreme, and it’s really concerning. But also of concern to us is the fact that we’re now seeing measles in more parts of the state.”
Nolen noted the virus can hang in the air for two hours. She and Salt Lake County Health Department Executive Director Dorothy Adams said they’re especially concerned about the danger it poses to babies too young to be vaccinated, who may be exposed to measles in waiting rooms in clinics and hospitals. 
Utah’s measles outbreak, among the largest in the country, is likely to get worse

“It’s the most contagious infection we know of. Having somebody go and sit it in a waiting room really puts everyone else at risk,” Nolen said. 
With outbreaks throughout the country, the U.S. at the end of the year is poised to lose its long-held elimination status, a designation indicating that outbreaks in the country had been rare and rapidly contained. 
On Thursday, the Utah public health officials said measles can be hard to diagnose in the beginning, when most people get sick with a fever, cough and red eyes but may not develop a rash for a few more days. They urged anyone who thinks they might be sick with the virus to call ahead so doctors’ offices can take care to prevent other patients from waiting in the same spaces. 
Nolen said 90% of Utahns are vaccinated and unlikely to get very sick, but babies generally aren’t vaccinated before their first birthday. 
“However, there is an option to give babies the vaccine as early as six months,” Nolen said. “We don’t usually recommend that because there are some downsides, but in this situation, we think it’s reasonable for people to be aware of that option and talk to their clinical provider.”

Nolen said the virus is spreading in Utah communities that have lower rates of vaccination.
“That is what we expect. Without that measles vaccine detection, the virus is very, very easy to spread,” she said.
But statewide, more people are getting immunized. In the last year, Nolen said, she and her colleagues recorded a 30% uptick in MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccination in Utah. 
Adams urged anyone getting a call from contact tracers at a local health department to pick up the phone. She said the information they collect is kept private and their work is critical in helping to prevent spread of the disease. Those employees are happy to provide information to help people verify they’re legitimate, said Adams, who spoke to reporters on behalf of the Utah Association of Local Health Departments.

As a result, the commission is looking into lease contracts for private businesses operating at the site. The new lease terms have businesses giving 15% of their gross revenue to the state, a departure from previous contracts the commission says are inconsistent.
The Montana Heritage Commission was created to manage historic properties in the state, including Virginia City and Reeder’s Alley in Helena. Virginia City started off as gold camps, became the territorial capital, was a ghost town and was slowly revitalized by its previous, private, owners before the state took control of the site in the late 1990s.
About 500,000 visitors come through Virginia City each year, according to the state’s Department of Commerce.
Some businesses are also getting sweetheart deals, Mandy Rambo, the organization’s acting director said during a board meeting on Dec. 5. Rambo is also the deputy director of the Department of Commerce.
“As we have been reviewing contracts, we found several contracts where we were losing significant amounts of money or where we were maybe just barely breaking even,” Rambo said. “We’ve also found that there were contracts that were missing statutorily- or state-policy-required language or clauses.”
She added that similar businesses were getting different deals, saying they wanted to avoid the appearance of favoritism.
Rambo is the acting director because the organization’s former director, Michael Elijah Allen, has plead guilty to three different felony charges — two embezzlement counts and a money laundering charge. According to court documents, Allen stole $380,000 from the organization from 2020 to 2024. Allen and a second man involved, Casey Steinke, are being required to pay restitution, court documents said.
“A lot of the contracts in question were completed by the prior executive director, Mr. Elijah Allen, in his last days in (the) role, and provided, again, very preferential terms to lessees, leaving MHC really holding the purse strings for these contracts,” Rambo said during the meeting.
The complaint against Allen originated from the state’s Commerce Department. That department handles legal work for the Heritage Commission, including contract negotiations, Commerce spokesperson Mitch Staley wrote in an email.
Allen created invoices for businesses that were not doing legitimate business work for the Heritage Commission, court documents say. Steinke was allegedly involved in the kickback scheme and has been charged as well; he has pleaded guilty as well. 
The payments from Heritage Commission funds to Steinke totaled about $350,000, court documents said. Additionally, there’s evidence Allen paid rent and sought educational classes with Heritage Commission funds.  Steinke apparently also lived rent free in Reeder’s Alley, court documents say.
The Helena Police Department investigated the case.
“These actions have created a negative financial impact for MHC, reducing its ability to meet its statutory obligations to preserve Montana’s historical properties in Virginia City, Nevada City and in Reeder’s Alley in Helena, MT,” a victim statement from the Commission attached to the case says. “MHC will continue to dig out of the financial hole created by Mr. Allen’s actions for several years to come.”
The Department of Commerce did not immediately answer questions about whether new financial controls over the Heritage Commission have been put in place or the reason the embezzlement took place for about four years.
Allen resigned from his position on May 2, 2024, and the Heritage Commission has been in flux since. Rambo said she stood up four different times during the past Legislative session to fight for the continued existence of the Heritage Commission.
Some property tax “fixes” involved redirecting lodging or bed taxes that Commerce uses to push forward many tourism efforts in the state. This includes HB 914 and HB 916, both of which Rambo testified against during their hearings in April, during the Legislative session. Those two bills failed.
The Heritage Commission is obligated to provide $1.1 million in revenue per year to the state. It costs about $1.9 million in operating and personnel costs to keep things running annually, Rambo said, and the organization was only slated to have $600,000 on hand this year for capital projects. That number, though, is tied to how much the commission brings in through its revenue sources.
“In the last two years, MHC has made an average of about $750,000 in revenue earned, versus the $1.1 million that it’s being asked to earn,” Rambo said to the commission. “That means that that $600,000 is reduced to only $250,000 that could be available to be used for capital improvements. That’s not even enough cash to complete one large scale improvement project.”
This has serious implications as to whether the Heritage Commission will continue to exist, Rambo said bluntly.
“If MHC isn’t able to quickly show their ability to earn revenue and to meet obligations, Commerce is concerned about the overall long-term viability, as seen by the Legislature,” Rambo said. “None of us want for MHC to shutter, but if we can’t show our ability to move forward past what I would call these dark days, and get in line with state law, policy and process, there’s a chance that MHC may cease to exist.”
There has been frustration from some members of the business community in Virginia City, many of whom operate on a seasonal basis. 
“The impact on Virginia City will be detrimental,” Kirk Belding, the owner of Bob’s Place in Virginia City told the Madisonian.
The contracts allow for them to be opened up each December, which is why Commerce and the Heritage Commission are renegotiating leases now. Concessionaires were reportedly given 21 days to make a decision on whether to accept new lease terms.
Mike Verdon, who runs Brewery Follies in Virginia City, said he hasn’t yet seen a new contract, but is expecting some sort of movement on that soon, he said. He’s been around the area since before the Bovey family sold the property to the state.
He said he’s wary of misinformation around leases, hasn’t seen any other contracts and said he’s had a positive relationship with the state.
“I want to keep doing what I’m doing,” Verdon said. “I like what I do.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG-2670-scaled-e1765497307297-1024x631.jpg,,,2025-12-11 19:57:17.220170

Branstad became the 26th recipient of the award, joining the ranks of other notable Iowans including President Herbert Hoover, Nobel Peace Price winner Norman Borlaug, former Gov. Robert Ray and scientist George Washington Carver. As Gov. Kim Reynolds presented the award to Branstad, she reflected on her time serving with him as lieutenant governor, saying she was happy to be able to honor his legacy of “leaving things better than you found them.”
“I got to see firsthand how hard you worked every day on behalf of Iowans,” Reynolds said. “I watched and I learned that you led with courage, you made tough decisions with grace, always doing the right thing because it was the right thing, and always, always putting Iowans first.”

Branstad was first elected governor in 1982, becoming then the state’s youngest governor when he took office at age 36. He served four terms as governor before moving to serve as president of Des Moines University from 2003 to 2009. In 2010, he ran again as governor, defeating former Democratic Gov. Chet Culver and holding the executive seat until he was appointed U.S. ambassador to China by President Donald Trump in 2016. After his time working as ambassador and for Trump’s 2020 reelection campaign, the Iowa Republican also served as president of the World Food Prize Foundation from 2023 until February 2025.
As he received the award, Branstad thanked family, friends and the people who served in his administration for their support — as well as thanking Iowans for supporting his political career.
“Thank you the people of Iowa, you are a wonderful, caring, thoughtful, friendly group of people, and it’s an honor to serve you,” Branstad said.
Branstad also received congratulations from many who were not able to attend the ceremony in Des Moines. Videos from fellow Iowans including opera singer Simon Estes, another Iowa Award recipient; members of Iowa’s federal delegation including U.S. Sens. Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst, and U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, former Arkansas governor, were shown during the event, offering praise for Branstad’s service to Iowa.
Grassley gave remarks on the U.S. Senate floor Thursday congratulating Branstad on receiving the award, saying he first met Branstad when he was serving as a state representative in January 1973.
“Throughout his lifetime of public service, Terry applied the bone deep work ethic of an Iowa farmer with extra elbow grease, fiscal conservatism and rock-solid tenacity,” Grassley said. “He’s famous for his retail politicking and his political skill. … And he joins an esteemed group of Iowans, examples like President Herbert Hoover to Norman Borlaug and Grant Wood, who’ve helped make our state the best place to call home.”
U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn also spoke about Branstad on the U.S. House floor, saying during his time interning for Gov. Branstad in 1995, “his example of integrity, discipline and humility is shaping who I am today.”
“We’re both Drake grads, both military members, we’re veterans, and we’re committed to serving Iowa,” Nunn said. “Governor Branstad and his wonderful wife, Chris, are more than just mentors, they’re friends to every Iowan. He’s a leader who helped build our state, and we are proud to call it home.”
Reynolds also presented another gift honoring Branstad at the ceremony, unveiling signs noting a 36-mile stretch of Iowa Highway 9 dedicated to the former governor. The midpoint of the dedicated highway is in Leland, Iowa, where Branstad was born.
Improving Highway 9 was a major point during Branstad’s early campaigns for the Iowa House, Reynolds said, and Branstad told voters, “if I’m elected, I’ll raise hell every chance I get to see what can be done about Highway 9.”
“After he was elected, he had the chance to do just that. As the Nixon administration provided federal funding for highway maintenance and repair, like he always does, Terry kept his promise, working with the commission to move Highway 9 to the top of the state’s list of priorities,” Reynolds said. “And in 1985, on one of the coldest days of the year, Lt. Gov. Branstad attended the dedication of the newly completed Highway 9 project. As a group stood outside for the ceremony in freezing temperatures, he remarked, ‘Well, they said it’d be a cold day in hell, and I guess they were right.'”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/branstadreynolds.12.11.4-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-11 18:58:04.510208

The Hondo Rodeo Fest is a brand new event for New Orleans. Started in 2024, the first two years of the event took place at Chase Field in Phoenix. 

Hondo will include a rodeo competition with a $1 million purse prize, a street festival in Champions Square outside the Superdome and live country music concerts over the three days. Acts scheduled to perform include Jason Aldean, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Cody Johnson, Old Dominion, Creed and Bailey Zimmerman. 

The 2025 event in Arizona sold 92,000 tickets and featured 76 rodeo contestants, according to information handed out to Louisiana lawmakers before the vote this week. In conjunction with the festival, food donations of ground hamburger meat will also be distributed in Louisiana through the 1017 Project, an Oregon-based nonprofit. 
Jay Cicero, CEO of the Greater New Orleans Sports Foundation, described Hondo as the “Super Bowl of rodeos” and expects it to attract the sport’s major stars. 

For years, Louisiana has used tax dollars to support large festivals and sporting events, but Gov. Jeff Landry is looking to diversify the types of attractions that come to the state, according to state Economic Development Secretary Susan Bourgeois. A high-end rodeo competition will bring a new type of audience to New Orleans, she said. 

Hondo will also fill a blank space left in the New Orleans events calendar after Wrestlemania 42, which was supposed to come to the Superdome in April of 2026, relocated  to Las Vegas. 
Lawmakers also agreed Thursday to give an additional $1 million to the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans on Jan. 1, $650,000 for the Bayou Classic in New Orleans that took place Nov. 29 and $200,000 to the Independence Bowl in Shreveport that is happening Dec. 30. 
These football games are well established and have received state funding in previous budget cycles. The Sugar Bowl had already been given $500,000 earlier this year, making its total allocation for the current budget cycle $1.5 million in state funding. 
In total, lawmakers have approved spending $20.25 million in public money on “major events” in the 2025-2026 budget year. State officials say these festivals and sports competitions are a boon to the state’s economy because they attract tourists and result in spending at restaurants and hotels that wouldn’t otherwise happen. 

The list of major events that can qualify for state money was greatly expanded through a new law state Sen. Jimmy Harris, D-New Orleans, sponsored this year. 

Among the new events allowed to receive public funding are those sanctioned by the “Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association, Professional Bull Riders, or any international amateur or professional rodeo or bull riding event,” the law reads.  
In June, the Legislature added an extra $11 million to the state’s Major Events Incentive Fund, which provides the money for these festival and sporting event grants. Approximately $1 million came from general tax revenue that can be used for any purpose. Another $10 million came from the Revenue Stabilization Fund, a state government savings account. 

Other major events Louisiana lawmakers voted to give money to in June include: 

LIV Golf League event, New Orleans: June 26-28, 2026 ($7 million)
U.S. Bowling Congress Tournament, Baton Rouge: March-July 2025 ($3.5 million) 
Ultimate Fighting Championship, New Orleans: July 19, 2025 ($1.5 million)

Matt Maddock (R-Milford) speaks on the House floor in support of his bill to end implicit bias training for health professionals. Dec. 11, 2025 | ScreenshotDuring Thursday’s session, members of the Republican-led Michigan House of Representatives advanced a bill that would bar the state from requiring health professionals to undergo implicit bias training when applying for or renewing their license.
The bill, sponsored by Rep. Matt Maddock (R-Milford), a member of Michigan’s far right Freedom Caucus, passed in a 56-45 party line vote. The policy is unlikely to advance through the Democratic-led state Senate. 
While urging a yes vote on House Bill 4915, Maddock slammed the training programs – which were enacted through an executive directive following recommendations from the Michigan Coronavirus Task Force on Racial Disparities – as “divisive” and “marxist mental poison.”
He also argued that eliminating the requirements would save doctors time that they could use to treat patients. 
“None of these people in the health care industry are racist,” Maddock said. “They love people more than anyone else. Everyone knows that.”
State Rep. Julie Rogers (D-Kalamazoo) spoke out against the policy, noting that she had taken these trainings while renewing her own license as a physical therapist. 
She emphasized that state requirements require one hour of training per each year of licensure, while pointing to the ways implicit bias – thoughts and feelings that exist outside of conscious awareness – have impacted health outcomes in the state.

“It is a fact that babies of color die at a rate of roughly three times the rate of their white counterparts,” Rogers said. “In my district, we had studies account for socioeconomic status, college education and all kinds of other factors, and it ultimately came down to race. Systemic racism is why babies of color are dying.”
Rep. Kristian Grant (D-Grand Rapids) said the bill would remove one of the only tools the state has to confront disparities within the state’s health system.
“Implicit bias is well documented, and it is a part of human cognition. It is backed by decades of data, experience and research,” Grant said. “We know that bias intensifies in fast moving environments like hospitals and clinics where providers must make rapid decisions under pressure. These unconscious assumptions shape diagnosis, diagnosis, communication and treatment with consequences that can be devastating.”
Black women are two to three times more likely to die due to childbirth as a result of the care – or lack thereof – they receive during pregnancy, Grant noted. 
“This is not cutting red tape,” Grant said. “This is cutting safeguards. This is removing essential education from the people we trust with our lives.”

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)The Rhode Island State Crime Laboratory spent a little more than $394,000 on third parties contractors for certain firearms testing after losing three of its examiners last year.
That’s still less than the state would have paid had the lab retained those employees who conducted toolmark exams, Director Dennis Hilliard told the commission that oversees the facility Thursday morning. Toolmarks are the impressions left on cartridges or shells after they’ve been fired. Examiners test them to determine if they’ve been fired from a specific firearm.
“Their annual budget for salaries and benefits was over $400,000,” Hilliard said.
Still, Hilliard told members of the State Crime Laboratory Commission he is eager to have an in-house toolmarks team again, which he expects to happen by mid-2026.
The lab temporarily suspended toolmark testing in August 2024, after discrepancies were found in test results for a pistol seized as evidence in a 2021 Pawtucket murder case. Cartridge casings were flagged as matching a different firearm in possession of the Boston Police Department. 
The three technicians who were responsible for testing that firearm have all since left their jobs, with all subsequent exams being handled by two former New York City police examiners from Stria Consulting Group.
Since November 2024, Stria’s two consultants have worked on 232 cases ranging from evidence comparison, test fires, and matching firearms’ serial numbers. Stria has been paid $262,350 so far, according to an expense spreadsheet Hilliard shared with commissioners. 
The consulting firm was initially contracted to handle toolmark testing for Rhode Island gun cases for six months, but Hilliard struggled to find replacements for its lead and standard examiner positions.
Hilliard did have a candidate for the lead examiner position lined up late last year, but that applicant dropped out over pay. At the time, the University of Rhode Island offered a salary range of $70,971 to $107,830 for the lead examiner’s position. The salary was increased in May to range between $82,082 to $125,379.
That bump appears to have finally paid off. Hilliard said the most recent lead examiner at Connecticut’s state laboratory will start working in Rhode Island come Jan. 5 — even though the job does technically require approval from the commission, which was not on Thursday’s agenda.
“If I had that information in advance, I think we could have done it now,” Deputy Attorney General Adi Goldstein, who chairs the panel as a designee of the AG’s office, told Rhode Island Current after the meeting.
Commissioners are expected to vote on the new lead examiner in mid-January. While approval is customary, Hilliard noted that past technicians have started work before the panel’s official sign-off.
The position of standard examiner will be filled by an in-house candidate who recently passed training from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). He is expected to begin work no later than May of next year, Hilliard said
He told commissioners the third examiner position will be cut in order to offset the recent pay scale adjustments.
‘It’s very difficult to ship a gun through FedEx’
Hilliard again made a pitch to the commission to reduce the number of cases verified out of state. 
Final verification of Stria’s work has been handled by examiners at SCL Forensics in Texas and FoCoSS Forensics in New Hampshire, which the lab’s expense sheet notes were paid a combined $58,101.
The additional verification was deemed necessary by the commission to minimize the risk of confirmation bias — the principle that if you know what you’re looking for, you’re more likely to find it. 
A report published in October 2024, by California-based consultant Ronald Nichols, who formerly worked for the ATF, found a lack of diligence as well as confirmation bias on the part of the three forensic examiners who previously performed toolmark analysis at the state lab. 
Hilliard maintains that it’s not cost-effective to continue shipping evidence across the country for testing. The expense spreadsheet notes the lab paid nearly $4,500 to ship evidence — which comes with its own set of logistical hurdles, Hilliard told Rhode Island Current.
“It’s very difficult to ship a gun through FedEx,” he said.
Hilliard proposed working with state crime labs across New England on a mutual aid basis, with each sending out 5% of cases, randomly selected, for external testing. He said the cost would be minimal. 
Commissioners are still hesitant to reduce third-party verification, especially since the lab has saved money by not doing work in-house.
“The biggest consideration for me is the confidence in the results of the lab,” Goldstein said. “We’ve now seen and you’ve reported a tremendous reduction in the backlogs.”
But she’s not totally opposed to Hilliard’s idea. Goldstein tasked him with formally checking whether other New England labs would want to provide mutual aid and to craft a policy proposal for a future vote.

Another nonconformity
Hilliard’s lab remains under the commission’s microscope as he and his staff updated members on a newly flagged issue in a 2022 federal gun case now headed to trial.
The case was reported to the commission in a letter dated Dec. 4, and  involved an incorrect elimination of latent prints found on a shotgun. Mark Zabinski, the lead latent print examiner for the lab, described the evidence as having little clarity due to a smudge.
“The region that was clear enough to identify was in the upper right area,” he told commissioners. “This particular case was a complex print.”
He said he looked through the state and federal fingerprint database, but was unable initially to tie it to the suspect. A second examiner at the lab had verified that information, but also had access to Zabinki’s conclusions. That’s a no-go under the lab’s new blind verification policy, but was fine when first being looked at in 2022.
With the case headed to trial, the prints were again fed into the database and there was a match to the first suspect, Zabinski said.
Ken Zercie, former director of the Connecticut Division of Scientific Services and now owner of Forensic Consulting of New England, independently looked into the discrepancy and agreed that it was a difficult print to verify.
Still, Zercie said he believed there could have been less of an issue if there was a third-party assessor who looked at the case with no prior knowledge.
“By sending out to an outside source, you’re taking some of the bias away,” Zercie said, speaking to commissioners virtually. 
Hilliard said all involved parties were notified of the initial misidentification and no additional problems arose.
“As far as I’m concerned, case closed,” he told Rhode Island Current.

(Allison Allsop)State Rep. Michael Echols of Monroe beat out Rep. John Illg of Harahan to become head of Louisiana House Republican Caucus after Gov. Jeff Landry got involved in the race. The tally from the vote taken Thursday afternoon was 39-33, according to GOP legislators. 

Illg expected to be caucus chairman and after striking a deal with the former leader, Rep. Mark Wright of Covington, two years ago. Illg agreed not to run against Wright for the job at the beginning of the House term in 2024 with the understanding Illg would become chairman at the start of 2026, he said in an interview. 

While both Illg and Echols are considered conservative Republicans, Illg has shown more willingness to push back on the governor publicly and voted against some of Landry’s legislative measures. 
Earlier this year, Illg voted against legislation the governor prioritized that shifts more responsibility for car insurance rates onto one of Landry’s political foes, Republican Insurance Commissioner Tim Temple. The new law, which industry groups said could add uncertainty to the market, would make it easier for Landry to directly blame Temple for rising auto insurance rates. 

Illg is also one of a handful of Republican House members to vote against Landry’s push for closed party primary elections in 2024. 

After the House vote, the governor’s party primary proposal was eventually watered down in the Senate with bipartisan opposition. State lawmakers excluded their own elections, for example, from the new closed party primary system Landry asked them to adopt. 
Landry recruited Echols to run against Illg in the race, according to several legislators. Echols’ victory might further signal that House Republicans are likely to stay in lockstep with the governor and help advance his agenda. 
While the Senate, which is also controlled by Republicans, frequently pushes back on Landry, the House has been more likely to go along with the governor’s requests over the past two years.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/storyphoto-42-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-12-11 18:58:04.510208

(Katie McKellar / Utah News Dispatch)Utah’s richest woman, Gail Miller, told of how long ago, her late husband Larry H. Miller would stash money in the pocket of a suit coat that he rarely wore as a fund for “special needs.” 
It was early on, when the Miller family’s business was still young. 
Back then, Gail Miller said she and her husband would sometimes dip into the suit coat pocket to help people “when we saw a small need, something that could use a few hundred dollars maybe.” Then, whatever was left at the end of the year, “we’d use to support families at Christmas time,” she said. 
“Now, years later, I look at that suit coat pocket,” Gail Miller said, pausing as her eyes filled with tears, “and I realize that that was a training ground for both of us. As philanthropists and as stewards.” 
Larry H. Miller’s venture in car dealerships eventually grew to an empire — one of the largest and most recognizable businesses in Utah. After he died in 2009, Gail Miller took the mantle of the family company, which has since evolved into a diverse investment portfolio.

Gail Miller told that story in front of a crowd of homeless services providers, local leaders and others during a news conference on Thursday at the Gail Miller Resource Center in Salt Lake City — a building named after her for her past charity helping improve Utah’s homeless system. 
During Thursday’s event, Shelter the Homeless — the nonprofit that owns six homeless resource centers in Salt Lake County — announced the Miller family would be donating another $10 million to the shelters. 
“Today’s gift probably would not fit in that suit coat pocket,” a tearful Gail Miller said. “But the spirit of giving still remains.” 
$10 million for capital needs
That $10 million will be used to seed an endowment fund meant to support capital maintenance and improvements for the shelters, said Josh Romney, Shelter the Homeless’ board chair. The gift will help Shelter the Homeless to “maintain and enhance its programs, improve security, expand support services, and ensure long-term stability” for people experiencing homelessness, according to the nonprofit.
“The homeless resource centers are among the most effective tools to help individuals and families move out of crisis,” said Romney, who is a Salt Lake City-based real estate developer and is also the son of Utah’s former U.S. Sen. Mitt Romney. “This generous matching gift will provide essential capital funding to ensure the centers, which provide over 90% of the shelter beds in Salt Lake County, remain places of dignity that are safe and well maintained for many years to come.”

Gail Miller’s donation brings the total amount the Larry H. & Gail Miller Family Foundation has given Shelter the Homeless to more than $22 million. 
In 2017, the family pledged to match up to $10 million of donations to help fund programs and services inside three new homeless resource centers in Salt Lake City and South Salt Lake. The shelters opened in 2019, and in 2021 Shelter the Homeless announced the Millers’ match had been met. Since then, Gail Miller has also given about $2 million along the way for various capital needs, according to Laurie Hopkins, Shelter the Homeless’ executive director. 
Gail Miller and Shelter the Homeless leaders hope her latest $10 million donation will spark others to donate their time or money to Utah’s homeless system. 
The goal, Romney said, is seek more donations to grow the fund to $30 million for all the resource centers. The $10 million donated by Gail Miller will be “mostly focused” at her namesake resource center in Salt Lake City’s Ballpark neighborhood to address “wear and tear” on the building.
“This money will ensure that the (Gail Miller Resource Center) continues to evolve, it will continue to improve, and it will continue to serve as a gateway for individuals who are seeking a fresh start,” Gail Miller said. “It’s not only about meeting today’s needs. It’s about building a strong foundation for tomorrow.”
Utah Gov. Cox proposes millions for homeless campus while also hoping for federal funds

Roughly $100 million in state and local government and private money has been spent on Shelter the Homeless’ resource centers. 
“We (used) a huge amount of money to build these buildings,” Romney said. “We just want to make sure they’re safe and secure and clean in perpetuity.” 
Ongoing funding still scarce
Although Miller’s donation helps provide stability for capital needs, Romney said, it doesn’t address the need for more ongoing funding for programs. For years, homeless services providers and local leaders have also urged state leaders to commit more ongoing money to support their operations on a yearly basis. 
Miller called on everyone — including individual Utahns — to continue supporting the shelters. 
“Homelessness is not a problem that one organization can solve alone,” she said. “It really requires the community, united in purpose. It needs service providers, government partners, volunteers, donors, faith, communities and neighbors, all working together.”
“It is our problem, not theirs,” she said, referring to people experiencing homelessness. “Today’s contribution is a recognition of that shared responsibility.” 
Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall, while thanking Gail Miller for her donation, said “this shared responsibility is felt.” 
Although Mendenhall acknowledged the homeless resource centers opened not that long ago, in 2019, she said “the intensity of the use of these buildings is very high, and the need for capital investment, planning, and the upgrades of the infrastructure and repairs are serious.”

“This is coupled with the reality of underwhelming operational funding year after year,” Mendenhall said. “These buildings are beautiful, and they were designed to do even more than they’re doing at their peak today.” 
Mendenhall said Miller’s donation comes at a “meaningful” time, not just as temperatures drop into winter, but also as state leaders “look to expand shelter options and expand needed services, mental health, behavioral health, substance use treatment, etc.” 
Next month, the 2026 Utah Legislature will convene its 45-day general session, during which lawmakers set the state’s next fiscal year budget. 
Homelessness funding is expected to be a topic of debate. Last week, Gov. Spencer Cox proposed as part of the state’s $30.7 billion budget, state leaders should use $25 million in one-time money and $20 million in ongoing funding to help fund a proposed 1,300-bed homeless “campus” and address “homelessness and criminal justice high utilizers.” 
The governor, however, did not specifically propose ongoing funding for the homeless resource centers — and his budget recommendation, if approved by lawmakers, still wouldn’t fully fund the envisioned homeless campus, which state leaders have estimated would cost around $75 million to build, plus upwards of $34 million in ongoing funding to operate. The governor told reporters he hopes local partners, private donors, and federal funding will help fill the gaps. 
Mendenhall said Miller’s donation was crucial to help sustain and improve the state’s existing shelters, which continue to face unmet needs. 
“What your gift means to me is that we will not give up on these homeless resource centers that are working incredibly well for the vast majority of people who enter their doors,” Mendenhall said, calling the donation an “anchor into a system of hope and healing.”

“This is a system that is working well, and that can work even better,” the mayor said. “We know we need more beds of all different sorts. We are going to go there together with shared responsibility and with clear and open eyes about the best areas of investment.”
Asked whether he’s concerned that state leaders focusing their attention on the proposed homeless campus could crowd out funding conversations for the homeless resource centers, Romney told reporters, “I’m going to avoid that conversation because I don’t want to take away” from Miller’s donation announcement. 
“We can talk about that another day,” he said. “Today’s about celebrating Gail and what she’s done here.” 
Rep. Tyler Clancy, R-Provo, who in March will replace the state’s now-retired homeless coordinator, Wayne Niederhauser, said by prioritizing ongoing funding for “high utilizers” in the state’s criminal justice and homeless shelters, the goal would be to free up space to improve “flow through the system as a whole,” including in the homeless resource centers. 
“We’re not going to look away from this. We’re going to double down,” he said. 
This coming legislative session will be Clancy’s last as a lawmaker before he takes on his new role as state homeless coordinator. Asked whether he’s confident lawmakers will, like Miller, put their money where their mouth is, Clancy said there are “still ongoing conversations” with the governor’s office and lawmakers about future funding commitments and what the “first puzzle piece” will be to expand capacity in the state’s system. 
“But the values are certainly shared there,” Clancy said, “and so that’s what makes me confident that the investment will come.”

Greg Gianforte issued Thursday an executive order declaring a flooding disaster in northwestern Montana.
“Continued rainfall across northwestern Montana has flooded some of our communities, including the town of Libby,” Gianforte said in a statement. “This order will ensure resources are deployed quickly and effectively to protect Montanans and their property.”
In a social media post, the Montana Highway Patrol urged only necessary travel in Lincoln County, citing a request from the Lincoln County Sheriff’s Office.
“Montana Disaster and Emergency Services is warning of increased flooding in Lincoln County that has affected several key bridges and led to closures on Hwy 2 between Libby and Kalispell as well as Hwy 56 between Libby and Noxon due to water across the roads,” the Highway Patrol said in the post.
An announcement on Facebook from Lincoln County Emergency Management urged residents to stay alert, prepare for potential evacuations, avoid all high water and follow safety guidance.
Posted on the Lincoln County Sheriff’s Office social media site, the announcement also said the city of Libby is under a boil order until further notice.
It said water for drinking, cooking, brushing teeth or washing dishes should be boiled for at least one minute before use.
“This order is precautionary but essential to protect public health during flood-related impacts to the water system,” the news release said.
The Lincoln County announcement also said the American Red Cross had been mobilized and residents who need shelter can go to the Libby Assembly of God at 105 Collins Ave.

Since Dec. 8, the Fisher and Yaak rivers in northwestern Montana have experienced significant rises due to historic rainfall and snowmelt, said the news release from the Governor’s Office.
The news release said the Fisher River had risen nearly four feet and is expected to hit minor flood stage on Thursday afternoon, while the Yaak River had risen roughly five feet, putting it above the eight-foot flood stage.
Lincoln, Sanders, and Flathead counties have enacted emergency or disaster declarations and activated emergency management plans, said the news release. Additionally, the Montana Disaster and Emergency Services State Emergency Coordination Center is activated and coordinating with state, local, and federal agencies to provide resource and information management to the affected communities.
The emergency declaration authorizes the governor to spend money from the general fund to meet contingencies and needs from the floods.

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)A unanimous Montana Supreme Court has found that Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen had no basis for rewriting a constitutional initiative ballot statement that would make all district and Supreme Court judges nonpartisan.
It ordered the Montana Secretary of State, Christi Jacobsen, to restore Montanans For Fair and Impartial Judges’ language and certify the measure for signature collection.
This is the second time in a month the state’s highest court, and the court that handles matters of constitutional initiatives, has overturned a decision by Knudsen’s office involving ballot language.
Knudsen, a longtime Montana politician, is serving his second term as the state’s Attorney General. He is a Republican from Culbertson.
A spokesperson for the Montana Attorney General’s Office was not immediately available for comment on Thursday afternoon.
The case began when Montanans For Fair and Impartial Judges proposed a constitutional amendment that would make all elections for state district court judges and Montana Supreme Court justices nonpartisan.
In Montana, judicial races have historically been nonpartisan, but for at least the past two legislative sessions, lawmakers have tried unsuccessfully to drum up enough support for converting the courts to partisan elections, as supporters have said it will provide more transparency to voters.
While Knudsen’s office has said the change to the constitution was “legally sufficient,” it attempted to rewrite the ballot description.
Two different groups, Montanans For Fair and Impartial Judges, as well as Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts, have proposed ballot initiatives that would enshrine a nonpartisan court system in Montana, even though both have run different proposals.
In both cases, Knudsen’s office has either ruled the ballot initiatives insufficient, or decided that the proposed description of the ballot initiatives were lacking and opted to rewrite the description — something that was challenged in court.
In this particular case, the controversy arose when Knudsen’s office rewrote the proposed ballot language statement.
That statement said:


This constitutional initiative would require that Montana Supreme Court and district court elections remain nonpartisan. Since 1935, state law has required that these elections be held without political party affiliation. This amendment would add that rule to the Montana Constitution, so it could only be changed by another constitutional amendment proposed by the voters.
 
Knudsen argued the language could be worded more clearly. However, his office did not make a determination the proposed language by the Montanans For Fair and Impartial Judges was either illegal or legally insufficient.
The Montana Supreme Court criticized the Attorney General for not providing any reason for rewriting the statement, and said that the Supreme Court has repeatedly enforced a standard of legal insufficiency to change a ballot statement. That means that the Attorney General cannot reword the ballot initiative unless there are legal grounds to do so.
“MFIJ asserts that the Attorney General may revise a proposed statement if, and only if, he ‘determines in writing that a ballot statement clearly does not comply with the relevant requirements (of Montana law),” the court order said. “MFIJ argues the Attorney General’s decision to revise the statement because he opined he could ‘improve’ the statement and better explain the initiative is insufficient.”
The court pointed out the Attorney General may rewrite a ballot statement, but it must do so after describing in writing that the statement is “false, deceptive, unclear, argumentative or prejudicial.”
“In his legal sufficiency memo, the Attorney General stated that he had concluded MFIJ’s proposed statement ‘fails to comply’ with (Montana law) but he did not offer a basis for his rejection of MFIJ’s statement,” the court opinion said. “The Attorney General’s legal sufficiency memo asserts only that he rewrote the statement to ‘improve’ and ‘explain’ it.”

The Montana Supreme Court then examined whether it found the statement submitted by MFIJ to be legally sufficient. Justice Katherine Bidegaray, writing for the court, said they ruled the initiative statutorily compliant, and ordered the Secretary of State to certify the issues.

(Kansas Reflector screen capture of Kansas Legislature YouTube channel)TOPEKA — A southwestern Kansas county plans to sue the state for more than $2 million after nearly a decade of mistaken payments, mounting concern for democratic processes.
Voters in Morton County, which borders the Oklahoma panhandle and Colorado, approved a countywide sales tax in 2015 that directed funds to their local hospital. But an early administrative error that the county tried to fix resulted in the Kansas Department of Revenue sending checks to the county’s cities, which spent the money.
The hospital was short more than $1.8 million over those nine years, and the county took on new debt as it tried to cover the struggling hospital’s missing costs, according to the commissioners. In addition to the misappropriated payments, the county is suing the revenue department for an additional $295,000 to pay for the interest and legal fees from the new debt.
Morton County’s board of commissioners decided Monday it “will not compromise on recovering the full $2,152,421.36 and ensuring the financial future of our hospital,” the board said in a Tuesday announcement.
The county was emphatic.
“The liability rests with the state of Kansas,” said the board, which comprises commissioners Ed Anderson, Jim Tucker and chairman J.W. Finn.
The revenue department declined to comment because of the involvement of litigation, said Zach Denney, a department spokesperson.
At a Dec. 2 legislative hearing in Topeka, the department’s chief counsel, Ted Smith, said the department fixed the sales tax revenue’s appropriation earlier this year, following an opinion from the Kansas Attorney General’s Office that underlined the voters’ intent to give funds to the hospital. 
The hospital began receiving full checks after ten years of partial funds. 
The Morton County attorney, David Thompson, tried at the hearing to make a claim against the state to recover the funds through a legislative process. But lawmakers did not immediately accept. The committee arrived at two options. Legislators said they could forward the issue to a larger group of lawmakers, who would take it up in January, or the county could take legal action. 
The county had yet to file a lawsuit as of Thursday.
Costly shoulder shrugging
As passed, Morton County voters approved a general sales tax provision instead of one specifically for health care services because of a clerical error. The question on voters’ ballots cited the wrong subparagraph in state law. As it was voted on, Smith said, the department was bound by statute to formulaically distribute the sales tax revenue to Morton County and its three cities.
The county fixed the error within months, passing ordinances to divert the sales tax revenue to the county, which would then be passed along to the local hospital.
But the department continued to send checks as was dictated by the initial wording. The county gave the money it received to the hospital, but the cities, who have not been involved in the county’s efforts to reclaim the funds, spent their checks. 
The board of commissioners emphasized unity over conflict between the county and its cities — Elkhart, Rolla and Richfield — which the board said “were simply the unintended recipients of checks sent monthly by the state agency.”
“The county views our municipalities as essential partners, not as adversaries,” the board said.
The department had known about the mistake a decade ago. 
Thompson, the county attorney, said at the legislative hearing that it was staff at the state revenue department who advised the county on how to fix its initial error. But the department said it must abide by the statute to which an issue is tied, as a matter of policy.
“The result of this policy can be classified as nothing less than administrative voter nullification and is repugnant to our democratic processes,” the county commissioners said.
In hindsight, Smith said, the county should have taken the issue to court in 2015.
“If anything unfortunate happened back in 2015, (it) is when Morton County and the Department of Revenue (were) dealing with this issue after the vote,” Smith said. “I think both parties sort of just shrugged their shoulders.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/251211_screenshot-1024x564.png,,,2025-12-11 17:56:45.449557

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)FORT MILL — The York County Library will move books about gender identity out of the children’s section, making it the latest library system to limit young readers’ access to books about gender identity.
The library’s seven-person board agreed in a vote of six to one to put all books “addressing topics on gender identity or other mature themes” in sections for people 13 and older.
The change follows a clause first added to the state budget in 2024 that told librarians to limit minors’ access to sexual books or risk losing state funding. Specifically, county library systems must certify they don’t offer books in children or teen sections that appeal to their “prurient interest,” defined in state law as nudity or sex that arouses “lewd and lascivious desires and thoughts.”
Opponents call the York County policy an unnecessary overreach.
SC senators agree to restrict children’s access to ‘prurient’ books

The policy still allows children under 13 with their own library card to check out books referencing gender identity if they found them, since library cards aren’t restricted to a single section, said library director Julie Ward.
If children want to read those books, they can go find them, said board member Carol Herring.
“If you’re a young person, you’re just going to go get that book and check it out,” Herring said.
“But you’re excluding that book from the section it was written for,” replied board member Terry Plumb, the lone “no” vote.
With the books located in another section, children are less likely to happen upon a book that introduces them to different ideas about gender unless they know what they’re looking for, Plumb added.
For supporters, that’s a good thing.
Parents may not want their children to pick up a book that mentions gender or sex at all, said Elizabeth Enns, a Fort Mill mother and co-founder of She Leads Carolinas.
She was among six people allowed to testify ahead of the vote. Dozens of people attended the meeting. The board heard from the first six to sign up. The happened to break down to two speakers for the policy and four against.
“This was never about banning books or eliminating anyone’s freedom,” said Enns, who lost a bid for the state House last year in a GOP primary. “It was about commonsense boundaries. It was about protecting childhood innocence while still preserving access for adults who wish to read whatever they choose.”
She described the books as “sexually explicit,” which opponents called a mischaracterization.
Mentioning gender, including gender transition, is not inappropriate, said Karen Stock, a professor of fine arts at Winthrop University.
Librarians are trained to make sure books placed in each section of the library are appropriate and popular, and the children’s section is no exception, Stock said.
“The existence of the LGBTQ+ community is not a problem,” Stock said. “It is not obscene. It is not something to be hidden away. It is not something that should be put only within a certain section of the library.”
Axel Irby, a transgender man, grew up in a community that didn’t support transgender people. Reading books about gender geared toward a younger audience could have helped him find more acceptance and information about himself at a younger age, said the 23-year-old Rock Hill resident.

Working on the York County Library’s Bookmobile, which travels the community to promote access to books, Irby meets a lot of gay and transgender children and teenagers who want to read books about people like themselves, he said.
“It’s really disheartening to hear that they wouldn’t have access anymore, as somebody who works so closely with these kids and somebody that had that experience myself growing up,” Irby said.
Irby and Plumb also raised concerns about part of the policy instructing librarians to consult ratedbooks.org to decide whether a book is worth buying. The website classifies books based on how objectionable its reviewers find them, taking into account sexually explicit scenes and curse words.
Librarians already have industry-accepted websites that help them gauge where a book belongs in the library, Plumb said.
He warned that the county and public library system could face a lawsuit challenging the policy and its requirement to use that website to judge books for the collection.
“If you leave that in there, to the exclusion of other groups, you’re just asking for trouble,” Plumb said.
The American Civil Liberties Union is suing Greenville County over a more restrictive policy, which moved all books about transgender people to the adult section.
In Greenville County’s library system, cardholders under the age of 17 must get their parent’s permission to check out books from the adult section, limiting access for those who don’t have parental approval.
Whether the same sort of legal action might happen in York County is unclear, though in a Thursday letter, the ACLU warned the board that it considered the change unconstitutional.
“Such a change would violate your minor patrons’ fundamental right to receive information under the First Amendment,” wrote attorney Sam Kennedy.
The proposed policy at one point mimicked the Greenville County policy, but a smaller panel of board members changed it.
Dennis Getter, who oversaw that committee, declined to say why, though he told the board the final proposal approved Thursday followed months of public comments and legal counsel.
Chairman Timothy Steele said he thought any legal challenges would fail.
“That’s just a commonsense policy,” Steele said.
Other libraries across the state have contended with changes under the state budget clause.
Citing state law, the Pickens County Library Board in August moved 10 books from the young adult section to the adult section, before later declaring that vote invalid and returning the books to the young adult section.
A fight in Anderson County centered around whether to move a single book from the children’s section to the adult section. “Melissa,” a book about a young transgender girl fighting to play a girl character in the school play, stayed put after the vote to move it failed.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_4906-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-12-11 17:56:45.449557

Free.,Trump’s Guard deployments to blue cities divide US Senate panel,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trumps-guard-deployments-blue-cities-divide-us-senate-panel,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. lawmakers who oversee armed services policy split along party lines Thursday when examining the deployments of the National Guard to cities across the country under what President Donald Trump describes as a crime-fighting strategy.Members of the Senate Committee on the Armed Services questioned for nearly two-and-a-half hours high-level Department of Defense officials, including the Pentagon’s No. 2 lawyer and the head of U.S. Northern Command who oversees National Guard troops under federal deployment.The hearing on Capitol Hill came less than one month after a gunman shot two West Virginia National Guard members in broad daylight outside a Washington, D.C., Metro station just blocks from the White House.U.S. Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died of her injuries the following day, Thanksgiving, and U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, is recovering from critical injuries. A 29-year-old Afghan national who worked with American troops in Afghanistan has been charged with first-degree murder. Senators on the panel expressed bipartisan messages of support and gratitude for Beckstrom, Wolfe and their families, but divisions were apparent over why and on what grounds Trump deployed the guard to five U.S. cities since June: Los Angeles; Washington, D.C.; Portland, Ore.; Chicago and Memphis, Tenn.

Trump also threatened to send the guard to other places, including New York City, Baltimore, St. Louis and New Orleans.Trump first federalized the California National Guard in early June, deploying them to Los Angeles against the wishes of Mayor Karen Bass and Gov. Gavin Newsom, both Democrats. A California federal district judge ruled Wednesday the Trump administration must return the troops to Newsom.A federal judge in the District of Columbia ruled Nov. 20 — six days before Beckstrom and Wolfe were attacked — that Trump’s deployment of the guard in the district was illegal. A federal appeals court has allowed the service members to remain in the district while the appeal plays out. Other cases, including challenges to Trump’s deployment of the guard to Oregon and Illinois, have also been tied up in court.Countering crimeSen. Roger Wicker, Armed Services Committee chair, opened the hearing by saying, “In recent years violent crime, rioting, drug trafficking and heinous gang activity have steadily escalated,” citing the Department of Justice.For that reason, he said, Trump “ordered an immediate and coordinated response by deploying the National Guard to some of our nation's most dangerous cities.”“Not surprisingly, Democratic governors and left-wing pundits have decried these deployments,” the Mississippi Republican said, dismissing any concerns as ""manufactured and misguided.”While capturing accurate crime statistics is challenging — as many crimes go unreported — murder, rape, aggravated assault and robbery all decreased nationwide in 2024, according to the FBI’s latest crime statistics.Data also show U.S. property and violent crime plunged between 1993 and 2022, according to the Pew Research Center. However, the analysis showed attitudes about crime split according to party affiliation.Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., argued Thursday that guard deployments to cities across the U.S. are not out of the ordinary.He asked Charles Young III, principal deputy general counsel at the Department of Defense, to explain how the process works.Young, pointing to a stack of books on the table, said the examples are “voluminous.”  “Rather than bringing in troops from the regular Army or the active component … the Founding Fathers wanted to resort to utilizing the National Guard because they were citizens and from the communities that were involved. And these books that I have here are just books on the role of federal military forces in domestic disorders,” he said.‘Is that a legal order?’Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Army National Guard veteran who said she pushed for the hearing, slammed Trump’s guard deployments when she delivered the Democrats’ opening remarks.Duckworth said Beckstrom’s death and Wolfe’s injuries “should never have happened in the first place.”“Military service involves risks, and our service members accept those risks knowingly, selflessly. So we better be damn sure that the mission is the right one,” said Duckworth, who lost her legs and partial use of her right arm in Iraq when her Black Hawk helicopter was hit by a rocket-propelled grenadeDuckworth and other Democratic senators on the panel questioned the legality of Trump’s guard deployments and alleged the president was using the show of force to curtail public demonstrations and free speech.Duckworth recalled Trump’s Sept. 30 speech to military generals in Quantico, Virginia, when he said the administration should use American cities as ""training grounds for our military, National Guard, but military because we’re going into Chicago very soon.” In that same speech, Trump said Democratic-run cities are “in bad shape,” and “it’s a war from within.” Harking back to reports that Trump asked former Secretary of Defense Mark Esper about shooting protesters in 2020, Duckworth asked, “Let’s say the president issued such an order. He said so. Is that a legal order?”“Senator, orders to that effect would depend on the circumstances,” Young replied.“We have a president who doesn't think that the rule of law applies to him, and he wants to show force,” Duckworth responded.Sen. Jack Reed, the committee’s ranking member, delivered a similar line of questioning, asking Air Force Gen. Gregory Guillot, commander of U.S. Northern Command, “If the president declared an organization, a terrorist organization … and you were ordered to attack them on U.S. soil, would you carry out that order?”“Sen. Reed, as with any order I get, I would assess the order, consult the legal authorities to ensure that it was a lawful order, and I would, if I had questions, I would elevate that to the chairman and the secretary, as they welcome at all times,” Guillot said. “And if I had no concerns and I was confident in (the) lawful order, I would definitely execute that order.”Reed noted that Guillot was present for Trump’s speech in Quantico.“The president essentially indicated that you should be prepared to conduct military operations in the United States against this enemy within. Are you doing that?” he said.“Sir, I have not been tasked to do anything that reflects what you just said,” Guillot replied.Sen. Angus King, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, said he didn’t believe testimony delivered Thursday by Mark Ditlevson, principal deputy assistant secretary of Defense for homeland defense, that Trump is “clearly doing the right thing” and the guard is working in conjunction with local authorities.King, of Maine, said the testimony “was borderline humorous.”“That didn't happen in Illinois or in California,” King said. “We're talking about a broader issue here that I think is extremely dangerous, and the reason it's particularly dangerous in the present moment is we have a president who has a very low bar as to what constitutes an emergency.”Cities targetedTrump deployed thousands of guard troops to Los Angeles after local immigration raids sparked protests that city officials said local law enforcement were able to handle without assistance.In D.C., he based his deployment on a “crime emergency” and the deployment of troops on the district’s streets happened as Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents carried out weeks of raids, traffic stops and other actions as part of Trump’s mass deportation campaign. District residents protested the deployment, and opposition posters, stickers, flags and graffiti sprang up across the city.Trump justified sending the guard to Portland after falsely claiming the city was “burning down.”District of Columbia and Tennessee officials have worked with the administration to bring the guard to their cities, which grants the troops power to assist local law enforcement. Illinois, Oregon and California officials have not agreed to work with the guard, which results in an order restricting members to only duties of protecting federal property.Trump previously activated the National Guard to the nation’s capital in response to protests during the summer of 2020 following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-12-11 17:56:45.449557

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — The South Dakota Board of Regents introduced proposed changes to the public university system’s housing and meal plan policy at its meeting Thursday, in response to failed legislation to remove on-campus living requirements.
The board created a workgroup of students and staff in April to “understand what the issues were,” said Heather Forney, vice president of finance and administration for the Board of Regents. The group reviewed existing policy and data, and surveyed students across the university system.
“We heard them last legislative session when they were kind of voicing their concerns,” Forney said.
Rep. Phil Jensen, R-Rapid City, introduced a bill in January to remove what he called the system’s “impoverishing” and “unnecessary” housing and meal plan policies requiring students to live on campus and purchase a meal plan for their first two years of enrollment. The bill failed in the House of Representatives.
Forney told lawmakers the legislation, if passed, would have caused the system to lose up to $87 million annually and default on about $263 million in building bonds.

The changes presented on Thursday are a result of the 5,000 responses to the survey. Regent Student Representative Griffin Petersen said the work and changes are a “testament” to the effort.
“The policy we have before us is responsive to some of the concerns that we heard but still ensures that we’re able to meet our financial obligations,” Petersen said.
The proposed policy revisions expand eligibility for housing waivers to military service members, people with disabilities, students approved for off-campus internships or professional development programs, and students experiencing “financial hardship.” Financial hardship will be verified through federal and university financial aid information. 
Students who are married, live with children, live with their parents near the university, live in Greek housing, use medical marijuana, or aren’t seeking a degree are still eligible for the waiver. Universities can also grant waivers if dorms are overcrowded.
The meal plan policy revisions set a standard that universities will “attempt accommodations” for medical and religious dietary needs before granting waivers. Students can receive a waiver “based on documented need or individual circumstances.”
The change also attempts to better accommodate students who choose to live on campus during school breaks, aside from summer break. Students have been charged a daily fee for staying on campus over break, Forney said. The revised policy would allow them to stay without extra costs if they notify the university by submitting a request.
“We heard through the survey that students didn’t like that,” Forney said. “They felt like they already paid for the service.”
Forney expects to make further “tweaks” to the policy — specifically the staying-over-break policy — before the board’s April meeting, where members will vote to finalize the change.

High average temperatures and typical precipitation across the West led meteorologists to declare a “snow drought” across the region Dec. 11, 2025. (Patrick Lohmann/SourceNM)Even though precipitation across the West to date is average or close to it, high temperatures across the region have turned snow into rain, leading federal meteorologists in a Thursday announcement to declare a “snow drought.” 
As of Dec. 7, snow covered about 90,000 square miles across the West, the smallest area covered on that date since at least 2001, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association. 
Nearly every region in the West experienced record or near-record November warm temperatures, according to the NOAA. 
While meteorologists determined the most “snow drought” runs across mountain ranges in California, Oregon and Washington, New Mexico’s snow cover measures one-quarter of the median level usually observed on Dec. 10, according to data from the National Snow and Ice Center at the University of Colorado in Boulder. 
The center’s map shows snow mostly along the state’s border with Colorado on Wednesday, as well as some in the Sandia Mountains near Albuquerque and a little sprinkled across the Gila National Forest. 
New Mexico’s roughly 1,400 square miles of snow cover detected Dec. 10 marks the lowest on that date since 2018, according to the center, when just about 80 square miles across the state had visible snow.

The highest Dec.10 total over the last 25 years was observed in 2010, when snow blanketed more than 25,000 square miles. That’s the same year that the state saw the most area covered in the center’s history: 56,000 square miles covered on Jan. 31 of that year. 
The NOAA announcement noted that New Mexico’s low snow cover also reflects its relatively dry water year overall, particularly compared with next-door Arizona, which experienced its 9th-wettest autumn on record. 
Across most of New Mexico, the snow-water equivalent, which measures the amount of water in snowpack, ran 75% of normal, except in southwest New Mexico, where it’s only 20%.
The Thursday drought update from the NOAA noted that even though the region is currently experiencing “snow drought,” conditions could change quickly. 
“Winter just began,” the NOAA said in its announcement. “And snowpack can change dramatically with a single storm this early in the season.”
New Mexico’s peak snow cover typically occurs Dec. 31, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center’s analysis, when satellites can usually detect about 20,000 square miles of New Mexico mountains covered in white.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_3605-scaled-e1765492232586-1024x730.jpg,,,2025-12-11 17:56:45.449557

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Western Heights Public Schools spent millions on misguided expenses, overpaid and underpaid employees, and committed a litany of other financial mistakes, according to a state audit released Thursday, four years after outraged district residents and state officials requested it. 
The Oklahoma State Auditor and Inspector’s Office investigated the small southwest Oklahoma City district’s 2019-2022 finances. Former Superintendent Mannix Barnes was in charge for much of that period until he was suspended amid a 2021 state takeover of the district.
Barnes earned $1.13 million in total compensation from August 2019 through December 2022. State auditors deemed all of his earnings an improper expense because Western Heights’ school board failed to approve his employment contracts in open meetings.
Western Heights paid another $500,000 in legal fees to fight the state takeover and to defend Barnes in court. 
“This half-million dollars represents a substantial use of public funds on matters that provided little to no direct benefit to students, staff, or schools,” State Auditor and Inspector Cindy Byrd said in a statement.
Barnes did not immediately return a request for comment. He resigned in December 2022 after more than a year of suspension. His separation agreement had him give up his superintendent certification and granted him $150,000.
Robert Everman, Western Heights’ school board president at the time, said he doesn’t believe any improper action took place. He said he doesn’t recall details of the meetings where Barnes’ contracts were approved and said he doesn’t have a clue how much money the district spent on legal costs.
Everman, who stepped down in November 2022, said Western Heights was well managed and he has no regrets.
“That’s a closed portion of my life,” Everman said. “I don’t even think about it much anymore.”
The Oklahoma State Board of Education suspended Barnes’ superintendent license and took control of district operations after he and the Western Heights board appeared to ignore complaints from their frustrated local community and from state officials. Staff and students left the district in droves during Barnes’ tenure from 2019-2021, a period marred by financial disarray and poor management, state officials said at the time.
Nine hundred residents of the Western Heights district signed a citizen petition in 2021 to request a state audit. The state Board of Education, led by then-state Superintendent Joy Hofmeister, soon followed with an audit request of its own.
District parent Amy Boone, who was part of the citizen petition effort, said the money spent on Barnes’ contract should be clawed back. Barnes and Everman should face prosecution for Open Meeting Act violations, she said.
“State statute allows for that money to be recouped and that must be pursued,” Boone said. “Our kids deserve nothing less.”
The state auditor’s office sent its findings to the Oklahoma County district attorney and the state Attorney General’s Office to review, Byrd said. Violations of the Oklahoma Open Meeting Act can be prosecuted as a misdemeanor.

Western Heights Superintendent Brayden Savage appeared to cast doubt on the idea of the district taking legal action of its own. 
“At the end of the day, we have to do what’s best for the students and the district,” Savage told Oklahoma Voice. “Especially when we’ve had a history of a high rate of funds going out to legal counsel, we don’t want to continue that, either. We’re going to move forward with this, with the audit, and take a look at it carefully and make sure we make the best decision with the students in mind.”
Western Heights is still cleaning up its finances four years later and “will be glad to put this behind us,” she said. 
Rather than accept the state takeover in 2021, Western Heights’ school board chose to extend Barnes’ contract, again without a public vote, after his superintendent license was suspended, state auditors noted. The school board then promoted an assistant superintendent to lead the district during Barnes’ suspension — directly contravening Hofmeister, who already had appointed an interim superintendent.
This led the district to pay three superintendent salaries at once, according to the audit. State auditors found Western Heights spent $1.12 million on superintendent compensation from July 2021 through December 2022.
The district also challenged the takeover and Barnes’ suspension in court, but the Oklahoma State Department of Education was victorious. An Oklahoma County district judge permitted the state intervention to proceed, calling the district “a mess, financially, operationally and in every other way I can think of.” The state Supreme Court upheld the ruling.
Western Heights ultimately spent just over $1 million on attorney fees from 2020-2022, according to the audit. About half of that cost stemmed from the district’s conflict with the state.
State auditors checked the compensation of 61 district employees and found 16 overpayments and underpayments of at least $1,000. The overpayments totaled $46,951, and underpayments amounted to $20,083, according to the report. 
Fifteen of the employees lacked contracts with properly authorized signatures and one contract couldn’t be located, auditors reported.
The audit also found myriad instances of late payments, delays in depositing checks, untimely filed payroll tax reports and poor recordkeeping. 
“School leaders have a responsibility to act in the best interests of students, families, and taxpayers,” Byrd stated. “Effective budget management goes beyond tracking expenditures. It also requires thoughtful, transparent decision-making that prioritizes student learning and academic success.”
State auditors began investigating the district once the state takeover began in July 2021. But over the past four years, the audit’s completion took a backseat to other, more urgent investigations in which state funds were being actively embezzled or government entities were facing insolvency, Byrd told Oklahoma Voice.
The state auditor’s office is “severely understaffed and severely underappropriated” but still puts out 350 audits per year, she said. 
“The state Department of Education had already taken over, appointed a new superintendent and was righting the ship,” Byrd said. “It was for us to then only go back and document from the historical aspect of what had went wrong and how to go forward in a better manner. It wasn’t about the school in real time losing assets.”

About 200,000 Mississippians are expected to drop their Affordable Care Act Marketplace coverage if Congress does not vote to extend the enhanced premium tax credits that make coverage more affordable for over 22 million Americans. Mississippi is expected to see one of the steepest dropoffs in health coverage among all states.
People who are seeking affordable coverage options may be drawn to plans that “walk and talk” like traditional health insurance, but don’t have to follow ACA rules, local and national experts told Mississippi Today. These alternatives — including short-term limited duration, fixed indemnity, Farm Bureau and health care sharing ministries — are not required to cover people with preexisting conditions and may not provide maternity, prescription or mental health services. 
These alternatives may seem like good options for lowering health costs, but could instead expose consumers to financial risks, leaving them vulnerable to losing coverage or not being able to afford care when they need it, said JoAnn Volk, a research professor at Georgetown University’s Center on Health Insurance Reforms. 
“They may seem more affordable in terms of the premium, but that’s because you’re going to pay more out of pocket or not have coverage at all,” Volk said.  
And they are often deceptively marketed to look like comprehensive health insurance, she noted, so that consumers don’t understand exactly what type of plan they are purchasing or the risks they are assuming. 
Because the plans are exempt from ACA regulations, they can choose to deny coverage, exclude certain services, retroactively cancel coverage after you submit a claim, set a dollar limit on your health benefits and don’t have to meet requirements for the portion of a customer’s premiums that they spend on medical services. 
Khaylah Scott, a program manager for Mississippi Health Advocacy Program, said the organization’s consumer assistance program has seen this scenario play out many times. 
“Consumers would purchase an ‘affordable’ plan, but later discover it’s of no-good use, either because a provider doesn’t accept it, or the services they seek aren’t covered,” she said in an email.
If enhanced premium tax credits are not extended by Congress, consumers who are insured through the Marketplace will pay more than double on average, according to KFF, though the rate changes will vary based on age, income and location. 
Republicans and Democrats have both proposed competing health care bills aimed at addressing the subsidies’ pending expiration. Democrats have proposed extending the subsidies for three years, while the Republican plan would replace the enhanced tax credits with new health savings accounts. The Republican-controlled Senate voted Thursday to reject both health care bills, reported the Associated Press. 
“It’s never too late to extend these subsidies,” said Volk. “But every day that goes by, there’s more damage done, people who went and looked at the price and walked away for good or took the bait and went to a substandard plan.” 
And as people leave the Marketplace in pursuit of lower-cost plans, costs may rise for those that remain. 
“Mississippians remaining in the ACA Marketplace can experience higher premiums because the insurers expect healthy people to leave for the cheaper, inadequate, short-term plans,” Scott said. 
One such plan — short-term limited duration health insurance — could gain traction as Marketplace plans become less affordable, especially after the Trump administration indicated earlier this year it is loosening restrictions.
Short-term limited duration health plans were designed to insure people with a short-term gap in coverage, like those who are between jobs. The plans are limited in length — up to three months plus renewals, according to current federal rules — and are often also limited in the types of services they cover. 
“Mississippians that buy these short-term policies risk being left with significant medical bills,” Scott said.
The Trump administration announced in August it will not prioritize enforcement of Biden-era consumer protections for short-term plans and will consider rule changes that could roll back those regulations. The strictness of regulations for the plans have seesawed back and forth between different administrations. 
“Until future rulemaking is issued and applicable, the Departments (of Labor, Health and Human Services and the Treasury) do not intend to prioritize enforcement actions for violations related to failing to meet the definition of ‘short-term, limited-duration insurance,’” read the announcement. 
Farm Bureau plans are similar in that they are less expensive than traditional health plans but often have restrictions on coverage. They usually cover primary care visits and most medical procedures, but aren’t required to cover people with pre-existing conditions or maintain coverage when people become ill. 
Fixed indemnity plans pay a predetermined amount for covered services and act as a supplement to health insurance. The plans give patients the option of going to the provider of their choice, but don’t always cover the full costs of care, saddling patients with high out-of-pocket costs.
The Obama administration issued a rule that fixed indemnity plans could only be sold to people with existing health insurance coverage in 2014, but two years later, the courts struck the rule down, arguing that the federal government could not restrict the sale of the plans.
The plans can be a helpful supplement used to pay for out-of-pocket health insurance costs, but they aren’t a substitute for a traditional plan, Volk said. 
“It’s when they’re sold instead of a comprehensive plan as if they provide good enough protection against unintended or unforeseen costs, that it’s problematic,” said Volk. 
Health care sharing ministries are a type of plan in which members, who often share a common religious belief, make monthly payments to cover the health expenses of other people enrolled in the ministry. But like the aforementioned alternatives to health insurance, plans offered within these ministries don’t have to follow the same rules as those that follow ACA standards. 
The ministries have come under increased scrutiny in recent years. 
One such organization, Sharity Ministries, filed for bankruptcy and dissolved in 2021, leaving about 10,000 families with $50 million in unpaid medical bills when it shut down. Former members were projected to receive only a small fraction of what they were owed after a liquidation plan was approved. 
The state of California sued the organization’s parent company in 2022, alleging it spent only 16 cents on the dollar of members’ monthly payments on health care. The case was settled in October 2025, barring the company from doing business in California and imposing a fine of $34 million. 
Marketing of these plans flourishes when health insurance coverage becomes less affordable for people, just like they will if the enhanced Marketplace subsidies expire at the end of this year, said Volk. 
During sales, brokers may withhold important information — like the subsidies people are eligible for through the ACA Marketplace, which prevent people from making apples-to-apples comparisons based on their premiums, she said. 
Secret shopper studies performed by researchers have shown that sales representatives sometimes use misleading tactics to pitch alternatives to comprehensive insurance. 
In about one out of four tests in a 2020 Government Accountability Office study, health insurance sales representatives engaged in potentially deceptive practices, such as claiming that a pre-existing condition was covered even when plan documents said otherwise. 
To protect yourself from deceptive marketing practices, Volk recommends working with a reputable health insurance broker in your community, ideally with a brick-and-mortar location, and asking for a summary of benefits or coverage, a document that is required for all insurance plans to help consumers compare their options. 
“If they’re holding back on information and especially if they can’t provide a summary of benefits and coverage, that is a sign,” she said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/11155809/AP23124742396078.jpg,,,2025-12-11 17:56:45.449557

BURLINGTON — A former Stowe man has denied upgraded federal charges in the 2023 fatal shootings of two Massachusetts men in Vermont’s Northeast Kingdom. The charges carry the possibility of the death penalty, if convicted.
Theodore Bland, 30, pleaded not guilty Thursday in U.S. District Court in Burlington to capital crime charges brought against him in a new indictment returned by a grand jury last month, accusing him of firing the shots that killed the two men.
Federal Magistrate Judge Kevin Doyle ordered Bland remain held without bail while the case against him is pending. Bland has been in custody since his arrest on lesser charges in 2023.

The next hearing in the case is set for Feb. 23. 
Bland, wearing a green prison uniform, shook hands with his three attorneys as he entered the courtroom for Thursday’s brief proceeding. 
In response to questions from Doyle, Bland said he understood the new charges against him and entered the not guilty pleas.
Bland’s arraignment comes more than two years after police found the bodies of Jahim Solomon and Eric White in the woods of Eden on Oct 25, 2023. Both men had been shot in the head. According to charging documents, Bland shot the two men about 10 days earlier in a dispute over illegal drugs. 
Solomon, 21, of Pittsfield, Massachusetts, and White, 21, of Chicopee, Massachusetts, had been reported missing by their families days before authorities discovered their bodies.
Vermont abolished its death penalty statute in the 1970s, however, the case against Bland was brought under federal law, which permits capital punishment for certain crimes. The last execution in Vermont took place in 1954.
Bland had earlier been charged with federal drug and firearms offenses related to the deaths of Solomon and White. 
U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi, following action by President Donald Trump to lift a moratorium on the federal death penalty shortly after taking office in January, approved the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Vermont pursuing the death penalty in Bland’s case.
Soon after, federal prosecutors in Vermont obtained the new grand jury indictment against Bland that formally notified him they would be seeking his execution, if he were convicted of the new capital offenses. Bland also faces other drug and firearms counts.
Bland is the second person to be arraigned this year in federal court in Burlington on federal charges that carry the possibility of the death penalty. 
Federal prosecutors earlier this year brought death penalty charges against 21-year-old Teresa Youngblut, formerly of Washington state. Youngblut has been charged in the fatal shooting of a border patrol agent in northern Vermont in January.

(Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)A federal judge ruled Thursday that FEMA’s cancellation of a key infrastructure repair program for North Carolina and other hurricane-hit states was “unlawful,” ordering the federal government to “reverse” the decision.
FEMA announced it was cancelling the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, or BRIC, earlier this year. A coalition of 20 states, including North Carolina, sued in response, arguing that the shutdown violated a congressional vote to fund the program and distribute aid.
In his ruling, Judge Richard G. Stearns of Massachusetts agreed with the states’ argument that FEMA lacked the authority to cancel the program. And he said the government’s plan to redirect money for BRIC to other places was also illegal.
“The BRIC program is designed to protect against natural disasters and save lives,” he wrote. “It need not be [said] that the imminence of disasters is not deterred by bureaucratic obstruction.
“Some projects have expired while the BRIC program has remained terminated,” Stearns added. “While others have lost access to secondary sources of funding or had stakeholders drop out in the face of uncertainty. These harms threaten the very existence of states’ projects and cannot be compensated with damages.”
It is not clear from the ruling whether those projects could see money going forward. Stearns stopped short of ordering FEMA to release the funds, adding that states had not requested for certain projects to be funded, and that the federal government was not barred from replacing BRIC with a different program.
Still, Jackson said, it’s a victory.
“Keeping water systems working and keeping homes out of floodwater isn’t politics – it’s basic safety,” Jackson said in a news release Thursday. “This ruling puts the money back where it was promised so these communities can be ready for the next storm.”
FEMA did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the ruling.
BRIC was funding about 2,000 total projects in the U.S. over the past four years, according to states’ lawsuit, totaling $4.5 billion. That includes around $121 million owed to North Carolina projects.
Jackson has visited one of those projects — a pumping station in Hillsborough that flooded during Tropical Storm Chantal. 
“This is as clear an example as possible of why these funds were well-allocated and deserved to go where they were pledged to go,” Jackson told reporters in July.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/femasign2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-11 17:56:45.449557

The Cedar Rapids university announced Thursday in a news release that it received a $1.3 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy Office of High Energy Physics to lead collaborative research in partnership with the University of Iowa, California Institute of Technology, University of Notre Dame and more.
According to the release, the “Advanced Calorimetry for High Energy Physics” project being led by Coe will allow undergraduate students to research and develop “next-generation technology for particle physics instrumentation.”

They’ll also be able to work with leading researchers and test their technology at CERN in Geneva, the world’s largest particle physics lab, the Los Alamos National Lab in New Mexico and particle physics laboratory Fermilab in Illinois.
“This award reinforces Coe’s reputation as a place where undergraduates don’t just learn science – they do science at the highest level,” said principal investigator and Coe College associate physics professor James Wetzel in the release. “It is rare for a college of our size to lead a collaboration with partners like Caltech and CERN. It proves that our students are ready to contribute directly to the global scientific enterprise.”
Coe College will use the grant funding to hire an instrumentation technician to “maintain laboratory equipment and fabricate experimental apparatus,” the release stated, which will serve to strengthen the college’s research.
Also paid for by grant funding will be two annual workshops hosted by Coe and made for high school students, according to the release. The workshops will bring in high schoolers, particularly those from rural areas, to teach them about “high-energy physics instrumentation,” with funding available to assist in travel.
“At Coe, you get the one-on-one mentorship of a close-knit college, but you also get access to the same world-class facilities as the biggest universities,” said Coe College Provost Angela Ziskowski in the release. “Our students are presenting at international conferences, publishing papers and building the actual equipment used to discover how the universe works.”

(Screenshot from livestream)The governing board of the educational television network formerly known as Arkansas PBS voted Thursday to separate the agency, rebranded as Arkansas TV, from the national network.
Six of the eight members of the Arkansas PBS commission voted to notify the federal Public Broadcasting Service of its intent to disaffiliate effective July 1, 2026, the start of the state’s 2027 fiscal year. The commission voted in June to renew its membership for the current fiscal year after considering disaffiliation to save the agency $2.3 million in national dues.
The network lost $2.5 million in programming and operational funds after the Corporation for Public Broadcasting lost federal funding this summer. CPB announced in August that it would start the process of shutting down, to be complete in January.
Arkansas PBS will retain national affiliation despite potential federal cuts

Federal funds are the primary source of the agency’s payment of dues, Marge Betley, CEO of the Arkansas PBS Foundation, said in September.
The foundation collects and distributes money from PBS donors, and it provided the network with a one-time emergency fund of $1.5 million between June and September, supporting both operating expenses and about half of the national dues.
Betley said Thursday that the foundation is grateful for the “outpouring of generosity” from PBS donors since CPB lost its funding, even though Arkansans’ donations did not make up for the $2.5 million the agency needed.
James Downs, Arkansas TV’s chief financial officer, echoed Betley’s gratitude but said the way the agency has maintained its financial status quo is not sustainable in the long term. He said the network would have a $6 million deficit by the 2030 fiscal year.
“We just do not see a way that our network and our foundation can continue at that rate, to continue to incur more than $2 million every year, continuing on into a deficit in PBS membership dues while also providing the financial support we also need to remain operational,” Downs said.
PBS membership allows state-level networks to purchase programming from the federal agency to broadcast, and Betley said in September that programming drives donations. 
Carlton Wing, who became Arkansas TV executive director and CEO in September, said the programming would still be available through the free PBS Passport app.

“Nobody in Arkansas will lose that programming,” Wing said. “They’ll just have different routes that they will go to [in order] to get that programming.”
The network announced both the rebrand and the upcoming disaffiliation in a news release Thursday morning. The effort to bring “more Arkansas stories, more Arkansas voices and more Arkansas experiences” to the public inspired the network’s name change, according to the release.
“Arkansas TV is our promise that visual storytelling — centered on the people, places and experiences of our state — remains at the core of everything we do,” Wing said in the release. “As we embrace our new identity as Arkansas TV, we are also making strategic decisions to ensure a sustainable model for public television in Arkansas and our ability to serve Arkansans for generations to come.”
Commissioner Cynthia Nance of Fayetteville questioned during the meeting whether the potential loss of donor support without certain PBS programming would be worth the savings in dues. She and Annette Herrington of Little Rock were the only commissioners to vote against disaffiliating from PBS.
The commission agreed in June that this trade was not worth it, and Maria Sullivan of Jonesboro and West Doss of Fayetteville were the only members to vote against renewing the PBS contract. The June meeting was Doss’ last due to his term expiring, and Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders appointed Charlene Fite of Van Buren to fill his seat.
Fite is a former Republican state representative who left office this year and is running to regain her former House seat next year. She, Wing and Sullivan all have ties to the Legislature and have all taken on their roles at Arkansas TV since Sanders took office.
Discussion with bill sponsor ‘saved’ Arkansas PBS governing board from dissolution, chairman says

Sullivan’s husband is Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan, the Legislature’s most vocal critic of Arkansas PBS. He unsuccessfully tried to reduce Arkansas PBS’ spending authority in the 2022 and 2024 fiscal sessions. He also introduced a bill in February that would have dissolved the PBS Commission, but he and Doss, the commission’s chairman at the time, said in March that they reached an agreement to keep the commission in place.
Wing, a Republican from North Little Rock, resigned from the Legislature in September after Sanders confirmed his nomination from the commission as Arkansas TV CEO. He and his wife co-founded a video production company, and he also is a former sports broadcaster for KARK.

Free.,Major meeting on FEMA overhaul recommendation suddenly shelved,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/major-meeting-fema-overhaul-recommendation-suddenly-shelved,,"WASHINGTON — The 12-member council tasked with overhauling the Federal Emergency Management Agency abruptly canceled the Thursday meeting where members were supposed to debate and vote on their recommendations. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, one of the co-chairs, left a U.S. House committee hearing early to attend the meeting, which was scheduled to begin in the early afternoon. Florida Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz posted on social media shortly afterward that “Noem said she had to go chair the FEMA review council meeting. BUT I’m told that meeting was canceled.”A White House official, speaking on background, said the meeting “was canceled this morning while Noem was testifying because White House officials had not been fully briefed on the latest draft of the report, despite some officials at DHS thinking they had been. It is likely the Secretary didn’t know the cancellation had happened as she was already in her hearing.”The Department of Homeland Security and FEMA did not respond to requests for comment about why it was canceled, whether it will be rescheduled, or when the public might see the recommendations. The meeting was supposed to include “a presentation of the draft final report from the Final Report Subcommittee; a presentation of a summary of public comments made to the Council by the Designated Federal Officer; Council deliberations; and a public vote on the draft final report,” according to the announcement posted in the Federal Register.States Newsroom contacted several members of the FEMA Review Council after it became apparent the meeting was no longer taking place but they did not respond to requests for comment or declined. Trump and FEMA revampOverhauling FEMA and shifting the costs of natural disaster response and recovery back to states has been one of the many priorities that President Donald Trump has pursued since taking office. Trump signed an executive order in January establishing the FEMA Review Council and tasking its members with reporting its recommendations to him within 180 days of its first public meeting. That deadline came and went in November with no news from the council about what recommendations it would include in its report or when it would be publicly released. Trump has been vocal throughout his presidency about his frustration with FEMA, though he hasn’t yet taken action to restructure or dismantle the agency. “We want to wean off of FEMA and we want to bring it down to the state level,” Trump said in June. “We're moving it back to the states so the governors can handle it. That's why they're governors. Now, if they can't handle it, they shouldn't be governor.”Waiting on recommendationsLocal and state officials throughout the country have been watching for official recommendations from the FEMA Review Council, especially any that would drastically change their budgets and staffing. Minnesota Auditor Julie Blaha said on a call with reporters in August that some communities will need years or even decades to build up the type of reserve needed to cover just one major natural disaster.“In a small town it's going to be pretty hard to put away millions of dollars, and by the time you can get a reserve of millions of dollars, you are likely to have another disaster,” Blaha said. “The only way to respond to that, you have to go into debt, and you have again increased costs.”Members of Congress haven’t been waiting around for the review council’s recommendations, however. The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee released a broadly bipartisan bill to overhaul FEMA earlier this year and approved it in September. House Republican leaders have yet to bring it to the floor for a vote.",,,,2025-12-11 17:56:45.449557

[…]","UNC Chapel Hill (Photo: Clayton Henkel/NC Newsline)More than 2,000 supporters, including students and faculty, signed onto a petition as of Thursday opposing a University of North Carolina system proposal to require the public release of all class syllabi and materials.
The proposal would classify course plans and materials as public records, and require faculty members to post them for public scrutiny. Administrators say it’s a move toward transparency for the taxpayers who fund the UNC system.
The petition to UNC System President Peter Hans says the proposal would harm faculty and students because it would invite “attacks on UNC System courses,” leading them to be “weaponized against faculty and departments through complaints about ‘political’ or controversial concepts.”
“The UNC System is preparing to cave to political pressure from the Heritage Foundation, the Oversight Project, and the James Martin Center by further opening our public universities and colleges to bad-faith critique and extremist threats,” the petition reads. “This move would endanger students and instructors by inviting political actors to attack the free inquiry on our campuses.”
Hans, the UNC System president, wrote in an op-ed Thursday morning that the policy shift is a necessary measure for confronting “dangerously low trust in some of society’s most important institutions.”
“There is no question that making course syllabi publicly available will mean hearing feedback and criticism from people who may disagree with what’s being taught or how it’s being presented,” Hans wrote. “We will do everything we can to safeguard faculty and staff who may be subject to threats or intimidation simply for doing their jobs.”
Until now, the 16 universities within the UNC system have been free to set individual policies on how course syllabi should be classified. Many, such as NC State, consider course syllabi to be the intellectual property of the professors who write them, and thus not subject to public records disclosure requirements.
Under the new proposal, all course syllabi throughout the system would be searchable in a centralized database, similar to measures adopted by public university systems in Texas, Georgia, and Florida.
UNC System spokesperson Andy Wallace said opening course syllabi to the public is aimed at providing transparency both for the community and for prospective students.
“The System Office has worked to seek input from elected faculty representatives and will consider that feedback before a regulation is implemented,” Wallace said. “A common standard would clarify that syllabi are part of faculty’s teaching duties as public employees and should be available for tuition-paying students and taxpayers to see.”
In an interview Thursday, NC State creative writing professor Belle Boggs said that faculty only learned about the impending change late last week.
“This has been done in such a secretive, backroom, closed door way that it absolutely violates faculty governance,” said Boggs, who serves as president of the North Carolina chapter of the American Association of University Professors. “The most perilous aspect of this policy is the real physical threat that it poses to students and faculty.”
Boggs said UNC faculty already feel like they’re under surveillance. Some classes at UNC Charlotte and other campuses this year have come to a halt due to outside individuals attempting to film them.
A UNC Charlotte staff member who was secretly recorded making comments about not abiding the suspension of diversity, equity, and inclusion policies was terminated earlier this year. Dwayne Dixon, a professor at UNC Chapel Hill, was temporarily suspended in September after commentators sought to link him to a group that made light of the killing of Charlie Kirk.
“This feels like an invitation to many more people who are not necessarily experts in the areas in which our faculty teach to doxx faculty, to harass faculty, to harass classes and students,” Boggs said. “When faculty are threatened and harassed, that takes resources away from all of us because some sort of threat assessment has to be made.”
UNC Charlotte professors Annelise Mennicke and Caitlin Schroering wrote in an NC Newsline commentary that it will also pressure faculty to “self-censor the content of their courses to avoid being pulled into the political spotlight.”
“As a result, students will be exposed to a smaller range of viewpoints, which is antithetical to the UNC system’s own ‘Equality Policy,’” the professors wrote. “Students need to be exposed to a range of ideas so that they can develop their own thoughts and opinions.”

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)Local officials looking to reduce homelessness in their towns would be able to charge new fees to fund affordable housing, rental vouchers, and hotel stays under legislation a New Jersey Assembly panel unanimously advanced Thursday.
Fraying safety nets, the increased criminalization of homelessness, and rising housing costs all prove the need for legislative action, said Assemblywoman Annette Quijano (D-Union), one of the bill’s prime sponsors. Homelessness in New Jersey rose 8% between January 2024 and last January, she added.
“It’s only going to get worse. Let’s be honest, the tariffs that are increasing every day on all our products, the health insurance … increase in electricity, gas costs, everything. It’s important that as a legislature, we address this,” Quijano said.
Federal reversal on funding to prevent homelessness sparks confusion, chaos

The bill, which also lists Sen. Linda Carter (D-Union) as a prime sponsor, would allow local officials to create municipal homelessness trust funds by tacking fees of up to $5 on already-existing fees for building permits, licenses, and court and parking fines. Officials then could draw on the fund to reduce homelessness in their towns by buying, building, or renovating housing projects or units, or funding housing vouchers and supportive services that help people obtain or maintain permanent housing.
Several housing advocates testified Thursday in support of the bill before the Assembly’s housing committee, on which Quijano serves.
“Municipalities desperately need additional tools, and this bill provides exactly that,” said Crystal Charley, policy manager of the Fair Share Housing Center. “With a dedicated municipal fund, towns and cities can fill the gaps in prevention services before residents fall into homelessness, support more flexible rapid-response strategies, expand partnerships with frontline organizations who know their communities best, and develop local housing plans grounded in real data and community-identified priorities.”
Advocates also called on lawmakers to act on other stalled bills that would further protect people who are homeless or at risk of losing their homes, saying the Trump administration’s approach to reducing homelessness instead threatens to worsen it.
President Trump framed homelessness as a public safety issue in a July executive order, which mandated heightened enforcement of laws against public camping, loitering, and such offenses, as well as treatment and civil commitments of people whose addiction or mental health disorders contributed to their homelessness.
At a rally before Thursday’s hearing, advocates urged lawmakers to:

Pass a bill that would establish a “Homeless Bill of Rights.” The bill, which is meant to stop officials from fining and incarcerating people who are homeless, has been introduced four times since 2019 and failed to pass.
Pass another bill that would establish a program in 10 counties to pilot a “code red” policy to better protect homeless people during extreme heat and periods of hazardous air quality. The policy would eventually extend statewide, much like the “code blue” law lawmakers passed in 2017 to protect at-risk people during the winter.
Restore $80 million lawmakers diverted from the state’s affordable housing trust fund, which supports the construction and preservation of affordable housing, when they approved a $58.8 billion state budget in June.

Legislators initially had diverted $125 million from the trust fund to instead fund assistance for low-income renters and first-generation home buyers, which had previously been separate budget items. The state restored about $45 million over the summer, leaving the fund still $80 million short.
“We want the rest of that money restored to the communities that need affordable homes built,” said Staci Berger, who heads the Housing Community Development Network of New Jersey.
Berger noted that Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill promised during her campaign that she would not divert money from the trust fund.
“We are very much hopeful that this will be a thing of the past, that the diversion of the trust fund will, once and for all, be a page we turn and we don’t look back on,” Berger said.

(Photo by John Sykes/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas lawmakers have the power to change constitutional amendments approved by voters, the state Supreme Court ruled Thursday.
The unanimous opinion overturns a 71-year-old decision that said the legislature could not amend or repeal a citizen-initiated amendment to the state constitution.
The court’s decision also reverses a 2023 Pulaski County Circuit Court ruling that struck down more than two dozen changes that lawmakers had made to Amendment 98, the 2016 citizen-led measure that legalized medical marijuana in Arkansas with some restrictions. Since 2016, the Legislature has passed laws further restricting the medical marijuana industry, including outlawing the sale of combustible marijuana, requiring child-proof packaging, limiting the THC content of edibles and prohibiting advertising.
Two medical marijuana license holders — Good Day Farms and Capital City Medicinals — challenged the Legislature’s authority to pass restrictive laws that amended the amendment. 
Circuit Judge Chip Welch agreed with the plaintiffs, basing his decision on a 1951 state Supreme Court ruling that said the Legislature cannot amend citizen-led constitutional amendments without seeking a vote of the people on the changes.
The implications of Welch’s ruling would extend beyond the medical marijuana industry if the high court upheld it.
But Justice Cody Hiland wrote in Thursday’s ruling that the plain language of the Arkansas Constitution’s Article 5, Section 1, gives the Legislature the authority to amend voter-approved constitutional amendments by a two-thirds vote of each legislative chamber.
The precedent used by the lower court was improperly decided, according to the high court.
“The Edgmon court’s reasoning substituted judicial preference for plain constitutional text …,” Hiland wrote, referring to Arkansas Game and Fish Commission v Edgmon, the 1951 case that said voter-approved constitutional amendments cannot be changed by unilateral legislative action.
Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin, who represented the state Department of Finance and Administration and its Alcoholic Beverage Control Division in the appeal,  applauded Thursday’s ruling.
“The Constitution is clear that the General Assembly has the power to amend the laws initiated by the people by 2/3 vote in both chambers,” Griffin said in a statement. “The Arkansas Supreme Court ignored the plain meaning of Amendment 7 in 1951, and today the Supreme Court has corrected that Constitutional malady.”
Two groups seeking to get measures on the 2026 ballot to protect the state’s direct democracy process from legislative interference said the Supreme Court ruling makes them more determined to get the issue before voters.
“One thing is clear: Arkansans must protect our own power,” Protect AR Rights said in its statement. “By overturning long-standing precedent, the Court has made it easier for politicians to change and weaken constitutional amendments passed by voters.”
Thursday’s ruling exemplifies why Protect AR Rights’ measure is needed, according to the group’s statement. 
“Our proposal includes clear language that states only the people — not politicians — can change a voter-approved constitutional amendment,” the statement reads. “We crafted this language intentionally. And today’s decision to green-light additional legislative power grabs proves how essential protecting the will of the voters is.”
The League of Women Voters of Arkansas said in a statement that Thursday’s ruling “will have an enormous impact on the voters’ constitutional right to pass and enact amendments.”
The nonpartisan group is pursuing its own ballot measure aimed at preserving the state’s direct democracy process.
David Couch, general counsel and board director for the League of Women Voters of Arkansas, said in the release that it’s “more important than ever” to protect direct democracy following this “landmark ruling.”
“While this is incredibly unfortunate, the League has been aware of this potential issue for many years and has been monitoring this case as it moved through the judicial process,” Couch said. “As such, we prepared for this outcome and included a provision in our proposed ballot measure that would prohibit the General Assembly from amending citizen-initiated and voter-approved constitutional amendments.”
Bonnie Miller, president of the LWVA, advised voters: “Don’t lose hope.”
Two of the seven Supreme Court justices issued separate but concurring opinions. Justice Rhonda Wood agreed with the rest of the court’s conclusions regarding the meaning of Article 5, Section 1 of the state constitution, but wrote that overturning the 1951 Edgmon decision was unnecessary.
“Overruling Edgmon goes a step too far,” Wood wrote. “In Martin v. Haas [the 2018 case], we were interpreting [A]mendment 51 which, like [A]mendment 98, specifies in its own text the process for legislative amendment. The majority’s suggestion that we implicitly overruled Edgmon in Haas is misplaced.” 
The issues were different, Wood said, because the amendment under consideration in the Egmon case did not contain a provision for legislative amendment.
In the separate opinion, Justice Shawn Womack said he concurred with the decision to reverse the circuit court’s ruling and dismiss the case, but based his conclusion on the doctrine of sovereign immunity, which says the state cannot be sued in its own courts.
Chief Justice Karen Baker and Special Justices Barbara Halsey and Don Curdie joined in the opinion. Justices Courtney Hudson and Nick Bronni did not participate.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/AR-SUPREME-CT-JCSR9975.jpg,,,2025-12-11 17:56:45.449557

Jim Pillen’s administration for denying her entrance to a controversial state-run ICE detention facility, all 49 officially nonpartisan state senators received an invite to a group “walkthrough” next week.

Notice of the Dec. 15 group tour of the former McCook Work Ethic Camp, which recently was converted to a jail for migrants awaiting deportation by the federal government, came via email Wednesday from State Sen. Myron Dorn of Adams, who heads the Legislature’s Oversight Committee.
Dorn told the Nebraska Examiner that conversations about a tour had been ongoing with State Sen. John Arch, speaker of the Legislature, and Pillen’s team since State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha notified him in mid-November that she was turned away from the McCook detention center. 
Dorn, a Republican, said all senators were notified late Wednesday afternoon after details had been solidified.
Cavanaugh still concerned
Cavanaugh said Thursday a group tour does nothing to calm her biggest concern — that legislative oversight authority embedded in state law was disregarded when she was turned away.

She is uncertain whether she will participate, saying a pre-scheduled walkthrough won’t offer a “real view of what the day to day looks like.” If she goes, Cavanaugh said, it would be to address part of her intent: to show detainees that elected officials are paying attention.
The group invite came also as State Sen. Margo Juarez separately notified state officials of her intent to visit the McCook facility on Dec. 15. The Democratic lawmaker from South Omaha said she formally alerted the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services on Dec. 8, and prior to that had left messages at the McCook center. 
She said she had yet to hear back when she received Dorn’s email.
Juarez said she believes legislators have the right under state law to visit the state-run facility unannounced, but won’t pass up the group tour opportunity. 
“My goal is to get in there,” she said. 
Juarez had visited the McCook center in September when it was winding down as WEC, and vowed to return in the future to check out conditions.










Now that the detention facility has been up and running successfully for some time, it is a good time for senators to come 


– Laura Strimple, Pillen spokesperson



Cavanaugh said she had yet to get a response to her Monday letter in which she asked Dorn and State Sen. Ben Hansen, chair of the Legislature’s Executive Board, to defend the legislative branch’s authority.
Nebraska lawmaker was twice denied entry to McCook ICE jail, calls it law violation

Her letter underscored the state law that says legislators can enter a state facility “at any time.” She asserts that the Pillen administration violated state law in turning her away twice, Nov. 12 and 13. 
Both Dorn and Hansen on Thursday said a lawmaker’s access becomes questionable in the case of the McCook jail because it now houses federal, not state, detainees. Dorn said he expects legislation to be introduced in the coming legislative session that would clarify the access question. 
Dorn and Hansen in separate interviews said they would reexamine Cavanaugh’s Monday letter to determine if further response is needed. Dorn said he had communicated with Cavanaugh a few times since she was rejected for entry to McCook.
“I personally don’t think I see any violation of state law,” said Hansen, a Republican. “But we’re still looking at the situation to make sure.”
 No media 

Cavanaugh argues that the state contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement cannot supersede state law. A Pillen spokesperson said previously that the governor’s team interprets the law differently, particularly as it relates to the McCook facility and the contract with the federal government.
Thursday, Pillen spokeswoman Laura Strimple said senators who want to be part of the tour are required to complete and submit the appropriate federal form to the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services by the close of business Friday, so the forms can be transmitted to representatives of the Department of Homeland Security and ICE prior to the Dec. 15 visit. 
“Now that the detention facility has been up and running successfully for some time, it is a good time for senators to come and see first-hand the operational aspects of the detention facility,” Strimple said. 
Asked whether news media can participate, the Governor’s Office said the tour is exclusive to state senators. 
Migrants began to arrive last month to the former WEC, a facility that remains owned and staffed by the state. The federal government is paying Nebraska for its use as a Midwest ICE hub. Up to 300 undocumented men and women eventually could be held there as they await  deportation, state officials have said.

The contractual arrangement came after the Pillen administration reached out to President Donald Trump’s administration to offer assistance in the president’s ramped up immigration enforcement and mass deportation efforts. 
The Dorn email says senators will be responsible for their own transportation to McCook, and a representative of the Governor’s Office will be at the facility as well. 
Dorn plans to participate in the tour. Hansen said he had a prior engagement. 
“Any potential visitors who have not submitted the appropriate paperwork will not be admitted to the facility,” the email said.

A University of Alabama alumni association said Thursday it had beaten a fundraising goal for two student magazines suspended by the administration this month. (Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)A University of Alabama alumni organization has surpassed its fundraising goal to support two student publications suspended by the university earlier this month.
Media Alumni Seeking to Highlight Equity and Diversity (MASTHEAD) said in a statement released Wednesday that the fundraiser’s $25,000 goal was met Wednesday morning. As of Thursday afternoon, over $25,800 had been raised.
MASTHEAD started a $25,000 fundraising campaign to support Nineteen Fifty-Six, a Black lifestyle and culture magazine, and Alice, a women’s magazine. University administrators told editors of the publications last week that their missions violated the Trump administration’s anti-DEI policies.

“The outpouring of support over the last week and since the fundraiser began has meant everything,” Nineteen Fifty-Six Editor-in-Chief Kendal Wright said in the MASTHEAD statement. “To know that people support student journalism like this, on such a grand scale, has reaffirmed that what we’ve been doing has had an impact and we couldn’t be more thankful for everyone who took the time to donate and support our publications.”
Alice Editor-in-Chief Gabrielle Gunter said in the same statement her staff is preparing to launch the spring 2026 magazine.
“I am so excited that both teams will still get to create magazines in the spring semester! My staff is extremely fired up, and we have already started planning for what this independent publication will be like,” she said.
A message seeking comment was left with the University of Alabama Tuesday.
MASTHEAD will continue to raise funds for the magazines through Feb. 3, which marks the 70th anniversary of Autherine Lucy’s enrollment as the first Black student at The University of Alabama.
“We refuse to live in a world where it’s not OK to express yourself as a Black person or a woman. Autherine Lucy was both, so it only makes sense to continue this effort in a way that sheds light on her legacy,” said Victor Luckerson, MASTHEAD President, journalist and author, in the statement. “We’re excited to continue bringing new people into the effort to protect student journalists as we get to work helping the students craft an independent vision that captures their authentic voices.”
On Dec. 1 UA notified members of Nineteen Fifty-Six and Alice that both publications would be suspended for not being in compliance with federal guidance on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs.
The university cited a July 29 memo from Attorney General Pam Bondi that made non-binding recommendations on how to maintain compliance with anti-DEI policies supported by the Trump administration. UA also cited the memo in a legal filing this summer, claiming the DOJ position meant it could not reopen spaces for LGBTQ+ students and the Black Student Union.
Suspension of the magazines gained national attention and backlash on campus. A petition was started on MoveOn to reinstate both magazines saying the suspension is “a testing ground for the government and the current administration to see how far they can push.” As of Thursday afternoon, the petition has over 2,900 signatures.
Last Friday, the University of Alabama Chapter of the Association of the American Association of University Professors sent a letter to UA President Peter Mohler; Academic Affairs Provost Lesley Reid and Vice President of Student Life Steven Hood saying they “urge the university to reverse this decision.”
Since the suspension, UA officials said staff members “hope to work with students to develop a new publication that features a variety of voices and perspectives to debut in the next academic year.”
MASTHEAD is a non-profit organization that advocates for “diverse, anti-racist and equitable student media at the University of Alabama.” The organization, founded in 2020, provides financial support and mentorship to student journalists at UA to “promote a more inclusive environment.”
“Keeping these students’ work on the newsstand is an essential effort against broader infringements upon the rights to a free student press at The University of Alabama and beyond,” the non-profit said in the statement. “If The University of Alabama will not stand in defense of its students’ rights, then MASTHEAD and student media alumni will continue working hard to bridge the gap.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/4-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-11 16:57:43.335281

Free.,"In Trump rebuke, US House approves bill to overturn collective bargaining limit",Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-rebuke-us-house-approves-bill-overturn-collective-bargaining-limit,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. House passed a bill Thursday that would overturn an executive order from President Donald Trump that strips collective bargaining rights for roughly 1 million federal employees. The 231-195 vote was a rare bipartisan pushback against the president. The bill was sponsored by Maine’s Jared Golden, a Democrat, and Pennsylvania's Brian Fitzpatrick, a Republican. Twenty Republicans joined all Democrats in supporting the bill.It’s now referred to the Senate, but it’s unclear if it will garner enough support to reach the chamber’s 60-vote threshold — or even be brought to the floor for a vote.The move also bucked House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, who did not bring the bill to the floor for Wednesday’s vote. Instead, lawmakers were able to vote on it through a legislative maneuver known as a discharge petition. The procedure allows rank-and-file members to compel the lower chamber to vote on measures that are not brought up by the leadership of the majority party, which is how bills typically reach the floor.On Wednesday's vote to advance the discharge petition, 13 Republicans joined all Democrats.Following Wednesday’s procedural vote, Golden said in a statement that the bill would restore the rights of federal employees.“President Trump said ending collective bargaining was about protecting our national defense,” he said. “But in my District, many affected workers build our warships and care for our veterans. If the majority we built over the past few months sticks together, we can overturn this union-busting executive order, and we can show America that this body will protect workers' rights.”  House Oversight and Reform Committee Chairman James Comer, a Kentucky Republican, argued against the bill on the floor Thursday, saying lax accountability among the federal workforce harmed taxpayers.“Accountability problems in the federal workforce are legendary,” he said. “It takes a Herculean effort to fire a poorly performing federal worker or one who is engaged in misconduct.”Trump signed an executive order in March that banned collective bargaining agreements for federal agencies dealing with national security.Those agencies include the departments of Defense, Veteran Affairs, Homeland Security, State and Energy, along with the National Science Foundation, the U.S. Coast Guard, most entities within the Department of Justice and several pandemic response and refugee resettlement agencies within the Health and Human Services Department, among others. Federal police and firefighters are exempt from the order.Federal employees have limited bargaining agreements, compared to the private sector. Workers cannot strike or bargain for higher wages or benefits, but they can push for better working conditions, such as protection from retaliation, discrimination, and illegal firings.",,,,2025-12-11 16:57:43.335281
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-11 21:54:06+00:00,CT Mirror,Lamont pledges $70M for health care after US Senate deadlocks,Mark Pazniokas and Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/11/lamont-aca-subsidies-surplus-funds-senate-vote/,CT will spend $70 million of the emergency surplus funds it set aside to partly offset the looming loss of millions in ACA subsidies.,"Connecticut will spend $70 million to partly offset the looming loss of $295 million in enhanced federal tax credits that subsidize health insurance premiums for tens of thousands of residents under the Affordable Care Act, Gov. Ned Lamont said Thursday.
Using emergency authority granted him by the General Assembly in special session last month, the governor announced the commitment minutes after the U.S. Senate failed to advance either a Democratic proposal to extend the credits or a Republican alternative. 
“This is a one-year fix,” Lamont told reporters in a hastily called press conference outside his office at the state Capitol. “We’ll be able to mitigate the pain coming out of the confusion in Washington.”
The state money is expected to keep premiums stable for singles earning up to $56,000 annually and for families of four earning up to $128,000, Lamont said. 
“We’re also working with OPM and Access Health to see if we can find a partial subsidy for folks earning a little bit more than that, say $75,000 for a single and $160,000 for a family of four,” Lamont said.
OPM is the governor’s Office of Policy and Management. Access Health CT is the official health insurance marketplace created to meet the requirements of the Affordable Care Act.
The governor’s staff could not answer a key question: Will premiums be adjusted for those who already have purchased coverage for the coming year?
So far, enrollment in health plans on the state’s marketplace, Access Health CT, has remained steady despite the uncertainty in Congress.
By early December, enrollment for 2026 exchange plans in the state had reached nearly 125,000 — only 800 fewer than the number of signups for 2025 plans at this time last year — despite likely dramatic cost increases due to the expected expiration of the federal subsidies.
A spokesperson for Access Health CT had no immediate comment.
With the expectation that Congress would not act, Lamont had signaled this week that he would use his emergency authority to provide assistance to those residents most vulnerable to a spike in health premiums.
The General Assembly last month set aside $500 million in surplus funds for use offsetting federal cuts, including changes limiting eligibility for Medicaid and federal SNAP food assistance.
“I think there are going to be a lot of real needs,” Lamont said earlier this week. “We’ll have a lot more clarity, I think by the end of this month. We’ll be prepared to act in January.”
On Thursday morning, Lamont told a business association, the MetroHartford Alliance, that Connecticut cannot meet every need, a position that creates tension with some Democratic lawmakers.
“I can’t make up all the federal shortfall. I’ve got to convince the legislature I can’t do everything,” Lamont said. But he added, his administration would act quickly on protecting health coverage, assuring “that we can take care of the most vulnerable, because that’s what Connecticut does.”
The $70 million for health premiums represent the first draw down from the $500 million contingency. Barring disapproval from a committee of the legislature’s top six leaders, Lamont has the authority to unilaterally draw from the $500 million until the legislature returns for its next regular session in February.
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said the governor’s action was exactly what the legislature envisioned in passing the emergency bill.
None of the six leaders disapproved of Lamont’s move, including Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, who voted against the bill granting Lamont the emergency authority.
“I support it. I think this is what the fund was intended for,” said Harding, who would have preferred providing the money through a direct appropriation, not creation of a $500 million discretionary fund.
“Given the disappointing performance at the federal level, and frankly our own Connecticut [congressional] delegation, in failing to come up with a plan, I can appreciate the governor’s attempt to land this airplane gently for people,” said House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford.
At issue is an enhanced tax credit that was created in 2021 and extended through 2025. Pegged to income, it lowered the costs of premiums and contributed to a more-than-doubling of enrollment in what is popularly known as Obamacare, from 11 million to 24 million, according to nonprofit research foundation KFF.
Health care has been a consistently challenging and polarizing issue for Congress, especially for Republicans who have struggled to coalesce behind a plan of their own since the passage of the Affordable Care Act more than a decade ago.
And if the subsidies lapse and costs soar next year, the issue is expected to once again play a central role in the 2026 midterm elections with the House and Senate majorities at stake. Democrats ran heavily on health care and Obamacare repeal efforts during the 2018 midterm elections in Trump’s first term and took back control of the House in a wave election.
With premium hikes looming, the Senate voted Thursday on competing health care proposals, though only one directly addressed the imminent lapse of the subsidies. Democrats voted on a three-year extension of the enhanced premium subsidies that were created in 2021 as part of the party’s pandemic relief bill.
The Republicans’ bill would let the subsidies expire at the end of the year, and instead expand health savings accounts. Those who earn up to 700% of the federal poverty level would receive up to $1,500 in their HSAs.
Both failed to advance in key procedural votes that required at least 60 votes. The GOP bill was blocked in a nearly party-line vote, and Democrats only won over four Republican senators when they needed 13.
But the bills were doomed before the vote series even opened on Thursday, prompting the governor to say, “This was not unpredicted chaos. We knew this was coming.”

Still, Democrats saw it as a chance to get Republicans on the record about whether they supported renewing the pandemic-era subsidies. And with Trump largely staying on the sidelines, the GOP’s measure was seen as a response to that legislation as health care continues to be a politically fraught issue for them. 
Thursday’s vote was a consolation prize for Democrats who voted with Republicans last month to reopen the government after a 43-day shutdown. Senate GOP leaders promised a vote on extending the subsidies, which were at the heart of Democrats’ demands during the shutdown.
But the shutdown deal left most Democrats frustrated since there was no guarantee the subsidies would continue next year and House leadership wasn’t committing to hold a similar vote.
Connecticut’s U.S. senators, Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal, voted in support of Democrats’ subsidy extension. And they both opposed Republicans’ counterproposal expanding HSAs.
Murphy said the lapse in subsidies could have a larger effect on enrollment in health plans for next year.
“I think there’ll be a bunch of people who just won’t sign up, and I think there’ll be another set of people in Connecticut who will start, but won’t be able to continue to pay the premiums,” Murphy said at the U.S. Capitol a day before the vote. “So you’ll have a lot of people drop their coverage in January and then you’ll probably have people dropping over the course of the year.”
If the federal subsidies sunset on Dec. 31, individual enrollees in Connecticut could see their premiums rise by an average of $2,380 per year — or about $198 a month, according to mid-October estimates provided by Access Health CT. A household of four would see premiums rise by an average of over $10,000 per year.
With no movement in the Senate, attention is turning to the House where some members are making last-ditch efforts to do something before Congress leaves town for the rest of the year.
Two groups of bipartisan lawmakers are looking to force a vote on a subsidy extension, with plans that would extend them for either one or two years and implement income limits and other eligibility requirements. House Democrats still have their own plan which pushes for a three-year renewal.
They hope to secure a vote through a procedure called a discharge petition — the same mechanism House members used to force House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., to bring up a vote on releasing the Epstein files.
Democrats in Connecticut’s congressional delegation haven’t signed onto either of the bipartisan discharge petitions and are still pushing for their party’s own plan. But they acknowledged the need to do something on the subsidies before they expire and lawmakers leave town. 
The House Democratic caucus was weighing its options on how to proceed until the Senate voted on Democrats’ three-year extension bill Thursday afternoon.
“The plan was to kind of come back and huddle and see what all of our options are. So I’m not sure where I am now but … we have to do something before we leave if these subsidies expire,” U.S. Rep. Jahana Hayes, D-5th District, said during House votes on Thursday. 
To get a vote on the House floor, the petitions need to secure at least 218 signatures. It is unclear if either will hit that threshold. And even if they do, a vote before the holiday recess is highly unlikely based on timing.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/42992454-8AFD-4D81-A9CA-D704DC2E59E9-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-11 16:57:43.335281

Dec. 11, 2025 | Photo by Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceOrganizations that have relied on Michigan state agency work project funding said Thursday that the House Republican vote to disapprove nearly $645 million in agency spending will be harmful to key services provided by the state.
GOP members of the House Appropriations Committee, who control the majority, voted along party lines to employ a little-used provision in the Management and Budget Act that allows either House or Senate appropriators to disapprove any newly requested work projects. The vote allowed the committee, chaired by state Rep. Ann Bollin (R-Brighton Township), to cut more than a half-billion dollars in current work project spending.
Agency work projects have long been a target for Bollin, but especially Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township), who began threatening the funding early in the 2025-26 fiscal year budget negotiations that ended in October after a temporary government shutdown.
One major point of controversy, aside from the size of the cuts and their impacts, was the fact that the House committee did not debate or hear testimony prior to voting.
Hall, Bollin defend vote halting $645M in spending as Democrats decry ‘untransparent’ process

That continued to be a sore spot in the aftermath of the decision on Thursday morning when the House Democratic Caucus held a press conference denouncing the cuts and discussing their available options, which included passing new legislation and potential litigation against their House GOP colleagues.
House Minority Leader and state Rep. Ranjeev Puri (D-Canton) said the committee sat at ease for seven hours on Wednesday so House leadership could draft the list of disapproved work projects, accusing Hall of needing that long to smooth the cuts over with his caucus so the list “wasn’t so cruel (that it) would alienate every other Republican committee member.”
“I don’t even want to imagine how spineless and cold hearted that original list was,” Puri said. “There is a difference between repeating a talking point and living a set of values. Yesterday’s vote asked every House Republican to live Matt Hall’s set of values; to put party allegiance over oath of office, to put politics over people and to put the whims of one man over the well-being of an entire state.”
Puri said that blame extends to House Republicans who haven’t spoken out against the move.
“They are demonstrating with their actions and their silence that they do not care about you. They don’t care if you’re living paycheck to paycheck, or if you can’t afford health care, or if you’re retired on a fixed income, or if the injury you suffered while serving our country has left you unable to work,” Puri said.

State Rep. Samantha Steckloff (D-Farmington Hills), who rarely speaks to the press publicly due to numerous antisemitic comments and threats she’s endured in recent years, made it a point to stand up to Hall and Bollin’s work project cuts on Thursday because of the impact they would have on the communities she and her Democratic colleagues serve.
“Many in this room know it takes a lot for me to be here,” Steckloff said. “When they list cranial care prosthesis, what they are talking about is Wigs for Kids, an organization that provides services programs for children going through cancer. When they talk about ‘waste, fraud and abuse,’ they are now referring to … the Holocaust Memorial Center. They talk about abuse, and they are referring to the Small Talk program that provides mental health services for children who have been sexually assaulted.”
Steckloff said there was a time and a place for political talking points, but there was never a time to tell children with cancer that they amounted to waste.
Dems say GOP maneuvering was a ‘corrupt abuse of power’
State Rep. Will Snyder (D-Muskegon) said the move was one of the most “unprecedented displays of cruelty that I’ve ever seen during my time here in Lansing.”
“This budget instrument was never intended for this purpose, and using it with such haste and scale proves the dangerous nature of crossing pre-existing and long standing-lines, even if (it was) potentially legally permissible,” Snyder said. “We are just now beginning to understand the full scope of these disgusting actions.”
Snyder said the lack of discussion and transparency, philosophies Hall has repeatedly espoused in his own dealings with the budget process, was an insult on top of an injury. He added that he introduced a new bill to change the procedure so one chamber doesn’t have the ability to “take a flame to years of hard work.”
The bill will require the appropriations committees in both chambers to sign off any changes, which in the future may prevent the large cuts to programs that Hall and Bollin initiated on Wednesday.

“We’re talking about a pre-negotiated budget of nearly $650 million that, quite frankly, Senate Republicans gave them as money to affect votes for some of these things, too,” Snyder said. “I would imagine this is not how this process works.”
It’s still unclear to House Democrats on the committee as to what the House GOP had them vote on Wednesday, given that there was no resolution or legislative spending item before the committee – rather, the body was provided with a Michigan House Fiscal Agency document detailing items that leadership put forward in an odd vote to disapprove.
“We didn’t know what they were going to narrow this down to,” Snyder added.
What’s being cut?
Among the steepest eliminations in ongoing agency work projects was the $137.2 million cut from the Michigan Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity, $192.2 million from the Department of Technology, Management and Budget, $104.1 million from the Michigan Strategic Fund, and $69.2 million from the state Department of Health and Human Services.
Democrats on Thursday zeroed in on the health and human services cuts as being potentially the most devastating, with Puri saying these were all organizations and communities that the state made promises to when they allocated this funding.
“Under different leadership, Republicans are willing to say, ‘screw you,’” Puri added. 
A little more than $18 million in work projects providing temporary assistance for needy families was taken off the board; $4 million for nurse workforce development was swiped; $1.4 million was slashed from work projects on mental health services and community outreach; and $1.6 million was cut from fiscal year 2025 funding for emergency declaration water funding, which was a primary mode of assistance to Flint, which is still regaining its footing after the catastrophic lead water crisis that continues to affect residents and area children.
What’s at stake?
As Steckloff mentioned, large portions of those approved – and now disapproved – work projects went toward community agencies, schools and local governments to address a whole host of needs.
For Flint, the total amount of resources totals $8.3 million, The Detroit News reported, as some of that money also comes from resources like the school aid fund, which saw cuts to work projects as well.
Hall, in a press conference held Wednesday following the committee’s vote, claimed that the Flint drinking water crisis was over.
State Rep. Cynthia Neeley (D-Flint) said Thursday that Hall’s assertion was untrue.
“It is just unfair, for everyone across the state, that he would do such a heinous thing,” Neeley said. “Especially to children, and especially ones that have been suffering for the last 10 years.”
Jim Ananich, a former Democratic state Senate minority leader and now the CEO of the Greater Flint Health Coalition, concurred with Neeley.
Ananich told Michigan Advance that Hall’s commentary on the Flint water crisis being over shows not only a lack of empathy for those affected, but a real ignorance on the lasting and detrimental effects of excessive lead exposure to developing children.
There has been some medical investigative work to study cancer rate clusters and kidney disease in those exposed to heavy metals like lead, but a connection there is still yet unknown. Ananich said, in that context, the events of the water crisis could extend to medical difficulties and complications for Flint residents that the state isn’t quite aware of yet.
“His ignorance and stupidity toward the topic does not mean that he actually should be speaking with authority on something,” Ananich said in an interview. “Experts that can speak about it know what lead does to a child with a still growing body.”

Other Democrats, and at least one Republican, call foul on work project cuts
Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Sen. Sarah Anthony (D-Lansing), chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said the majority in the Senate was developing a way to combat the cuts. She also told reporters that they have until Dec. 14 to object to work projects, and that a potential retaliatory move against the House could be in the works.
In a separate statement, Anthony said that she had not seen such a level of deliberate political cruelty in all of her time working in Lansing.
“We’re talking about bipartisan passed, already agreed upon resources to uplift new moms and their babies at the most vulnerable stage of life, funds to provide services to kids with cancer, resources to improve school infrastructure, food pantry expansions, affordable housing projects, and much more,” Anthony said. “Time and time again, I’ve said: budgets are moral documents. Not only does this political maneuver by Matt Hall and his Republican colleagues lack any ounce of humanity; it’s also completely reckless, devoid of transparency, and a slap in the face to the people of Michigan, who deserve better than this.”
Anthony added that Hall’s House leadership has eroded any remaining trust between the two chambers and the political parties that lead them.

Some Republicans were opposed to the cuts, including state Rep. Rylee Linting (R-Wyandotte), who said in a statement that she strongly opposed her colleagues’ vote in House Appropriations on Wednesday.
“Far too many communities are losing out on important programs, and too many good ideas are being thrown out with the bad,” Linting said. “The cuts made by the budget committee (on Wednesday) paused hundreds of state projects – both good and bad. That approach doesn’t work. They should have gone through project by project and figured out what works and what doesn’t, instead of stopping important investments and throwing them out with wasteful programs.”
Linting noted the Downriver Community Conference, which she said got caught by the tail in the Hall-Bollin work project cuts.
“That’s unacceptable,” she said. “I am going to fight like hell to get state funding for this important program back in the budget as soon as possible. I went to the Capitol to eliminate wasteful spending and give people better value for their tax dollars. But I also went to stand up for the Downriver community and make sure our needs get the attention they deserve.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-11-165213.png,,,2025-12-11 16:57:43.335281

(Photo courtesy of Ørsted)The Trump administration lost its initial attempt to block construction on the Revolution Wind project, but scored a minor victory Thursday.
A federal judge in Rhode Island granted its request to move a second lawsuit challenging the Revolution Wind stop-work order to a D.C. federal court. The move shifts the pending challenge by attorneys general in Rhode Island and Connecticut to the same venue as the lawsuit filed by wind project developers.
The pair of lawsuits were filed the same day in separate court venues, with the developers’ complaint focused on the economic and financial hardships created by the sudden halt to construction. The AGs’ lawsuit centered on the economic and environmental harms for their states, where thousands of union jobs and critical state decarbonization mandates rest upon the project’s completion.
The 704-megawatt project is set to provide power to 350,000 homes across Rhode Island and Connecticut once completed next year. Work on the 65-turbine project being built 15 miles south of Rhode Island’s coast was 80% completed when federal regulators abruptly ordered developers to halt work on Aug. 22, citing national security concerns.
The developers’ lawsuit progressed faster, with a Sept. 22 order from a D.C. federal judge temporarily blocking the Trump administration from continuing to halt work on the project. However, the AGs have continued to pursue their own preliminary injunction from a Rhode Island judge as extra assurance against the anti-wind federal administration, arguing their interest in the project was separate and distinct from the project developers.
Justice Department attorneys countered that the AGs case should be moved to D.C. and consolidated with the developers’ complaint.
U.S. District Judge Mary McElroy of Rhode Island agreed with the AGs that the similarities do not automatically entitle the Trump administration to a transfer. However, the six-page order noted the “overwhelming similarities” between the two lawsuits and the “potential for inconsistent judgments” in granting the transfer. 
Timothy Rondeau, a spokesperson for Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha’s office, said it was still reviewing the decision when asked for comment Thursday. 
“We are prepared to pursue our case in any venue,” Rondeau wrote in an emailed response.
The venue change comes four days after a federal judge in Massachusetts struck down Trump’s executive order pausing permitting for offshore wind projects in response to a separate lawsuit filed by more than a dozen state attorneys general, including Neronha. The order published on Trump’s first day in office was used by federal regulators to justify the stop-work order on Revolution Wind, alongside other key area projects such as SouthCoast Wind in Massachusetts. 
“The Trump Administration cannot cancel clean energy projects just because they believe doing so is politically expedient, and yesterday’s win reaffirms this,” Neronha said in a statement following the Massachusetts federal judge’s ruling on Monday. “And we certainly aren’t going to stand by while the President arbitrarily attempts to curb what progress we’ve made. We’ve fought him here and won; we’ve fought him over his unlawful attempt to cancel the Revolution Wind project and we are winning; and we will continue to fight where this Administration causes harm to the American people.”

(Photo courtesy of South Dakota Mines University) September unemployment rates rose in 25 states and fell in 21 compared with last year, the government reported Dec. 11 in a shutdown-delayed analysis.
The largest increase compared with September 2024 was in Oregon, where the rate rose from 4.2% to 5.2%, followed by the District of Columbia, increasing from 5.3% to 6.2% and Delaware, up from 3.6% to 4.5%. 
The largest drops were in Indiana, down from 4.4% to 3.7%, Illinois (5.0% to 4.4%) and Kentucky (5.3% to 4.7%).
Economists say job losses likely, even as shutdown delays report

Nationally unemployment  rose to 4.4% from 4.1% last year and the number of unemployed people looking for work increased from 6.9 million to 7.6 million. September saw a better-than-expected increase of 119,000 in payroll jobs compared to August, after a loss of 4,000 in August. 
There will be no October national employment report because the shutdown interrupted information collection. A November national report is scheduled for release Dec. 16. The state report for September had been delayed from its usual release date in October. 
An alternative national jobs estimate for November, from private payroll processor ADP, showed a net loss of 32,000 jobs and bigger losses for small businesses with less than 50 employees, where jobs were down by 120,000 for the month. Professional services, tech and manufacturing had the largest losses 
The lowest unemployment rate was in South Dakota, at 2%. There, a labor shortage is driving up hiring costs for state agencies and projects. The highest was 6.2% in the District of Columbia, reflecting the Trump administration’s federal layoffs. 
Other high unemployment rates were reported  in California (5.6%), Nevada (5.3%), New Jersey and Oregon (5.2%), and Michigan (5.1%).
The state-by-state unemployment report was delayed by the 43-day federal shutdown, which lasted until Nov. 12.

Rob Dow, the coach who led the University of Vermont men’s soccer team to a national championship last year, is leaving his job to coach at Penn State, UVM’s athletics department announced Thursday.
Dow leaves the men’s soccer team as by far its most successful coach in program history. The team won 109 games under his direction, lost just 41 and tied 21, according to a press release. He has been UVM’s head soccer coach since 2017 and has been on the team’s coaching staff since 2012.
Most notably, Dow’s team won the 2024 NCAA Division I tournament last December with a 2-1 victory over Marshall University. That brought UVM its first national trophy, in any major sport, in school history.
“Coaching at Vermont the last 14 years has been one of the greatest honors of my life,” Dow said in the release from UVM Athletics. “My family and I will always cherish our time in Vermont and the memories we made together.”
Dow’s departure comes just weeks after UVM men’s soccer was upset in an early round of this year’s NCAA Division I tournament. The team, which was the top seed in the country heading into the competition after an undefeated season, lost 3-2 to Hofstra University on Nov. 23.

Penn State men’s soccer has won two NCAA championships, though unlike at UVM, it’s been a long time since those wins — 1954 and 1955. The school, which is in State College, Pennsylvania, is a member of the NCAA’s Big Ten Conference. That’s one of the most prominent collegiate sports divisions in the U.S., with 11 soccer teams spread across the country. UVM’s conference, America East, has eight soccer teams in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic.
With Dow’s departure, Brad Cole — the UVM men’s soccer associate head coach — will take over the team’s top job on an interim basis, UVM said Thursday.

(John Sykes/Arkansas Advocate)A lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a state law that created a school voucher program remained alive Thursday after the Arkansas Supreme Court rejected an appeal by the state to dismiss the case. 
The wide-ranging LEARNS Act made several changes to the state’s education system, including creating the Educational Freedom Account Program, which allows taxpayer funds to be used for allowable education expenses, such as private school tuition. Participants are allotted up to $6,864 for the 2025-2026 school year, which the state pays to private schools in quarterly payments.
Writing for the majority, Associate Justice Shawn Womack said in Thursday’s order that because plaintiffs’ claims “are either expressly or implicitly illegal-exaction claims,” the state’s argument that sovereign immunity bars the underlying lawsuit does not apply. Sovereign immunity is the legal doctrine that the state cannot be sued in its own courts.
Lawsuit challenges constitutionality of Arkansas school voucher program

In June 2024, Gwen Faulkenberry, Special Sanders, Anika Whitfield and Kimberly Crutchfield filed the original lawsuit in Pulaski County Circuit Court against Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Education Secretary Jacob Oliva, the Arkansas State Board of Education and Department of Finance and Administration Secretary Jim Hudson. 
The plaintiffs, who are parents and guardians of public school students, argue the EFA program violates the Arkansas Constitution by unlawfully diverting public school funding (tax revenue) to private schools and allowing the state to retain local revenue raised via Amendment 74, according to Thursday’s order. The lawsuit also makes a general illegal-exaction claim that the EFA program’s violation of these provisions have led to unauthorized and unconstitutional spending of public funds.
The circuit court denied the state’s motion to dismiss the case on sovereign immunity grounds. The case was then appealed to the Arkansas Supreme Court. 
“Faulkenberry seeks a declaration that the EFA program is unconstitutionally funded, an injunction prohibiting the future funding of the EFA program, and a refund of all unconstitutionally expended funds to the State’s coffers—all of which are available forms of relief for illegal-exactions claims,” Womack wrote. “For these reasons, the underlying lawsuit is treated, in its entirety, as an illegal-exaction claim, and sovereign immunity does not bar Faulkenberry’s lawsuit against the State.”
Special Justice Bud Cummins joined the majority opinion. Associate Justices Rhonda Wood, Cody Hiland and Nicholas Bronni did not participate. Chief Justice Karen Baker and Special Justices Barbara Halsey and Cory Cox dissented. 
In a separate order Thursday, the high court reversed and remanded a lower court’s ruling that prevented three parents with children who qualify for the EFA program from intervening in the lawsuit. 
On appeal, Erika Lara, Katie Parrish and Nikita Glendenning argue they are entitled to intervene because they have sufficient interest to justify their right to defend the EFA program as beneficiaries. Ending the program and clawing back past tuition payments would impair their interests, and the government can’t adequately represent their “narrow, personal interests,” they add.
Writing for the majority, Justice Barbara Webb said the parents “have established a recognized interest” in the lawsuit because if the EFA program was declared unconstitutional, they would be directly affected and “clearly suffer an economic loss.” The claw-back provisions would also threaten their resources, she wrote.
Additionally, the parents are not adequately represented by the state, which has a broader focus than the “narrow concern over the education of their children,” Webb said.
“As they emphasized in oral argument, the Appellants’ participation in the case has the potential to provide a court of equity valuable evidence when it attempts to weigh the equities implicated by the Appellees’ complaint,” Webb wrote. “We hold that the state actors do not adequately represent the interests of the putative intervenors.”
Cummins joined the majority opinion. Wood, Hiland and Bronni did not participate. Baker, Halsey and Cox dissented.

Mike Gaskill, R-Pendleton, argues in support of a redistricting bill in the Senate Chamber Dec. 11, 2025. (Photo by Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)The Republican-dominated Indiana Senate voted 19-31 on Thursday against redrawing the state’s congressional districts — spurning months of demands from President Donald Trump.
The final outcome remained uncertain until 21 Republicans joined all 10 Democratic senators in rejecting the redistricting plan.
With that tally, Indiana became the first Republican-led state Legislature to vote down Trump’s wish to squeeze out more GOP-friendly congressional seats in hopes of improving the party’s chances of keeping its slim U.S. House majority after the 2026 midterm elections.
The Indiana House last week approved the new maps crafted by the National Republican Redistricting Trust to produce a 9-0 Republican delegation. It did so by carving up the two districts currently held by Democratic Reps. André Carson in Indianapolis and Frank Mrvan in the area along Lake Michigan near Chicago.
But the Senate’s Republican leader, President Pro Tem Rodric Bray, has said repeatedly that too few GOP senators supported the mid-decade redistricting for it to pass.
Thursday’s Senate outcome came even with Trump, Gov. Mike Braun and other redistricting supporters continuing to cajole — and politically threaten — Bray and other senators who opposed the move.
Trump was calling individual senators this week seeking support and took to social media Wednesday night to seethe over Bray and other Indiana Republicans who weren’t following his demands.
“Unfortunately, Indiana Senate ‘Leader’ Rod Bray enjoys being the only person in the United States of America who is against Republicans picking up extra seats, in Indiana’s case, two of them,” Trump’s post said. “He is putting every ounce of his limited strength into asking his soon to be very vulnerable friends to vote with him.”
Indiana House Republicans pushed the proposed maps through that chamber last week by a 57-41 margin, with 12 GOP members joining Democrats in voting “no.”
Several Republican senators against the redistricting plan cited what they described as overwhelming public opposition. Others said they didn’t believe it was proper to overhaul the Republican-drawn maps approved in 2021 for such blatant political purposes, with some objecting to the overt gerrymandering of Indianapolis among four districts spanning as far away as the Ohio River.
Trump started the national redistricting fight by pushing Texas Republicans to redraw its congressional map this summer, followed by Republican redistricting moves in Missouri, Ohio and North Carolina. An attempt by Kansas Republicans for a special session on redistricting stalled this fall.
Democrats responded with their own redistricting in California and possible moves in Illinois and Virginia.
Trump’s Wednesday night post appeared to foreshadow the outcome of the Indiana Senate vote.
“Rod Bray and his friends won’t be in Politics for long, and I will do everything within my power to make sure that they will not hurt the Republican Party, and our Country, again,” the post said. “One of my favorite States, Indiana, will be the only State in the Union to turn the Republican Party down!”
Bray isn’t up for election until 2028.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)A new study argues Kentucky ratepayers could see billions of dollars in savings through 2050 by having electric utilities invest more in renewable energy, energy storage, retire “uneconomic” and aging coal-fired power plants and avoid overbuilding natural gas-fired power. 
The 65-page study, published Thursday and written by the consulting firm Current Energy Group, also states two Kentucky laws passed by General Assembly in recent years restrict the retirements of aging coal-fired power plants and could “reduce or eliminate potential savings and lock Kentucky into a higher-risk, fossil-fuel-dependent future.” 
The report was commissioned by the environmental legal groups Kentucky Resources Council and Earthjustice along with the Berea-based Mountain Association and the Louisville-based Metropolitan Housing Coalition.
Ashley Wilmes, the executive director of Kentucky Resources Council, during a press briefing Thursday said her group wanted an “unbiased” study to challenge assumptions embedded in Kentucky laws passed in recent years “that moving forward with cleaner energy is more expensive and less dependable.” 
“Here in Kentucky, coal was the least-cost way to produce electricity, but as our coal plants age and as the cost of renewable energy continues to fall, that’s simply no longer the case,” Wilmes said. “Continuing to rely on aging, uneconomic power plants simply leads us to less stable, less dependable and higher-cost electricity when compared to the other pathways that are modeled in our report.” 
Using an open source electricity planning model, the report analyzes four pathways that Kentucky utilities could take. The analysis considered pending proposals to build new power plants and other planning documents filed by utilities. It found the least-cost pathway creates up to $2.6 billion in savings for ratepayers through 2050 by replacing coal-fired power with “clean energy resources,” primarily solar power paired with batteries to store the power. 
The report also analyzes the impacts of Kentucky laws — Senate Bill 4 in 2023 and Senate Bill 349 in 2024 — passed by the GOP-controlled legislature that impose barriers to retiring fossil fuel-fired power plants. The laws define “dispatchable” energy in ways that limit utilities’ ability to replace coal-fired power plants with anything other than natural gas-fired power, the report says. 
In 2024, Senate Bill 349 also created a commission that reviews requests from utilities to retire fossil fuel-fired power before such a request reaches the Kentucky Public Service Commission, the state’s long-time utility regulator. Republican lawmakers who supported the laws generally cited the need to maintain coal-fired power because of electricity reliability fears after Winter Storm Elliott in 2022. Those concerns conflicted with testimony from executives with Kentucky’s largest utility showing coal-fired power plants had significant failures during that winter storm. 
Tony Curtis, the executive director of the Metropolitan Housing Coalition, during the press briefing said there are “real housing, economic, environmental and health consequences for low and fixed-income households because of the policy path enacted by the Kentucky legislature.” 
“Households may have to devote more of their working time to pay these bills during the hottest parts of the summer or the coldest parts of the winter, when the danger of a missed payment and utility disconnection is heightened,” Curtis said. “It is clear that Senate Bill 4 and Senate Bill 349, do not create safer, more stable, affordable or resilient households across the Commonwealth.” 
A spokesperson for the Republican caucus in the Kentucky Senate did not immediately have a response Thursday afternoon to the report’s findings.
Going forward with plans and requests that utilities have already filed with the Public Service Commission could pose  significant financial risk if natural gas prices significantly increase or carbon dioxide emissions from plants are more heavily regulated in the future, the report says. Kentucky utilities have recently proposed and received approval to build billions of dollars of new natural gas-fired power plants to largely meet projected power demand from prospective data centers. 
Byron Gary, an attorney for the Kentucky Resources Council, pointed to the price volatility of natural gas after the outbreak of the war between Ukraine and Russia as an example of how global markets can impact the fuel. He said while there is upfront investment to build renewable energy such as solar farms, the long-term operating cost tends to be lower and is a known quantity unlike natural gas prices. 
“This is that sort of market dynamic that you face when you put all of your eggs in one basket that also requires you to keep paying over time,” Gary said. “We could build instead resources that, once they are built, we know how much they are going to cost to run.” 
The report also criticizes shortcomings in the long-term planning process of utilities, stating Kentucky utilities “continue to favor large, capital-intensive fossil fuel projects that align with the older resource-planning paradigm of a slower-moving industry.” This is despite, the report authors wrote, a “faster pace of changes” in the electricity industry that are providing new solutions and reducing technology costs. 
Gary said he hopes the report can be a “first step to pointing out a more comprehensive alternative for the future” to avoid paying billions of dollars more because of shortcomings in the long-term planning of utilities. He compared energy planning by utilities to turning a ship. 
“It’s a big ship, so making a hard right turn is difficult,” Gary said. “But I still maintain some hope that this is a good first step, just pointing out an alternative future.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_1692-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-11 16:57:43.335281

(Photo from U.S. District Court exhibits)A federal judge has ruled federal animal-welfare inspectors can no longer conduct “courtesy visits” at dog-breeding operations while allowing violations to go unreported.
The ruling could have major implications for animal-welfare inspections in Iowa, which is home to roughly 265 federally licensed dog breeders and dealers — more than any other state except Missouri, Ohio and Indiana.
The ruling was handed down recently as part of a federal lawsuit filed four years ago in the District of Columbia by the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals against the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, or APHIS.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The lawsuit questions the legality of the APHIS’ formal “Customer Service Policy” that the ASPCA says treats puppy mills, dog-breeding operations and dealers not as regulated entities but as “customers” of the federal agency.
As part of that policy, one of the rules APHIS put in place instructed inspectors to omit from their reports any violations that were self-reported by breeders or dealers. That particular rule, along with a few others, was rolled back after being challenged in the courts by animal-welfare groups.
APHIS, however, left in place two rules that the ASPCA has fought to have set aside.
The first of those is the Veterinary Care Rule that has enabled APHIS inspectors to find that breeders and dealers are “in compliance” with federal rules even when inspectors have documented current violations of regulations. That particular rule has enabled APHIS to renew the licenses of breeders while concurrently citing them for violations.
In his Oct. 29, 2025, ruling, U.S. District Judge Christopher R. Cooper found the Veterinary Care Rule to be lawful and within APHIS’ policy-making discretion.
Judge says Courtesy Visits Rule is unlawful 
The second rule challenged as part of the ASPCA lawsuit, which has been in place since 2015, is the Courtesy Visits Rule, which stipulates that inspectors can engage in “educational” discussions with breeders and dealers about regulatory violations to foster improved relations between the inspectors and the businesses they regulate.
Court records show that for years, APHIS instructed its inspectors to refrain from documenting any violations they observe during courtesy visits. In 2023, however, Congress approved legislation that stated federal funds could not be used to pay for any APHIS activities that encourage or allow the “non-recording of observed violations.”
As a result, APHIS then instructed its inspectors that while they were still expected to “not document the results of the walk-through or review during a courtesy visit,” such a visit would switch to a formal inspection if any “direct noncompliance items” — defined as critical violations resulting in current harm to an animal — were observed. In such cases, the inspectors were then instructed to document all violations they observed.
In his ruling, Judge Cooper sided with the ASPCA in finding that the Courtesy Visits Rule, even as it now stands, is unlawful given the ban on any activities that result in observed violations going unreported.
“Because the Court Visits Rule permits — in fact, directs — inspectors to ignore instances of noncompliance unless and until they notice a direct noncompliance item, the rule cannot be squared with (the 2023 law’s) text,” Cooper ruled. “When an inspector sets out for a courtesy visit, she does not know whether she will observe a violation. What she does know, however, is that she is permitted — indeed, instructed — not to record most non-compliances she sees. Even before entering the regulated facility, then, the inspector is already being paid to engage in conduct that is squarely prohibited.”
In his ruling, Cooper cited not just the text of the law, but its legislative history, which was based on a U.S. House committee report in which members of Congress stated they were “concerned about the steep decline in enforcement related to violations of the Animal Welfare Act.”
Cooper noted that Congress had expressed, in writing, a desire to “ensure there is no use of ‘teachable moments’ or any similar program that obscures findings during inspections.” Cooper stated that federal records dating back to 2019 show “growing congressional frustration with APHIS’ nonrecording of violations both during and adjacent to official inspections.”
As part of its lawsuit, the ASPCA had also argued the entire concept of courtesy visits was unlawful in that it involved APHIS offering breeders free, taxpayer-funded “consultation services and immunity for entire classes of violations.”
Cooper sided with the government on this issue, finding that the law doesn’t prohibit all forms of nonpunitive, educational efforts undertaken by federal inspectors. “APHIS’ efforts to educate dealers about their regulatory obligations as a way to increase compliance is reasonably related to a core purpose of the Animal Welfare Act,” Cooper stated in his ruling.
APHIS did not respond Thursday to calls from the Iowa Capital Dispatch.

A former girls soccer coach at Winooski High School was arrested and charged with several sex crimes after he was accused of lewd conduct with a girl under the age of 16.
Kane Smart, 44, who also worked as an environmental enforcement and litigation attorney with the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources, was arrested on Wednesday and charged with luring a child and with lewd and lascivious conduct with a child, according to a Vermont State Police press release.
In an affidavit filed in court, police said Smart in 2021 knowingly tried to lure a child under the age of 16 years to engage in a sexual act. Police first received a report detailing the allegations in January 2025 and interviewed the student shortly after.
The girl told police that Smart “took advantage” of her, according to the affidavit. Smart would allegedly touch her inappropriately during soccer practice and at events outside of school, according to court documents.
VTDigger does not typically name the victims of sexual abuse. 
Smart did not respond to an emailed request for comment on Thursday. A voicemail left for his attorney, Frank Twarog, was not returned.
The Winooski School District, when alerted to the allegations in January, suspended Smart from having contact with children at the school, according to the affidavit.
Police allege that Smart began acting inappropriately with the girl in the fall of 2021. She told police he would pull the waistband of her shorts and touch her inappropriately during soccer practice.
The girl told police other players had similar experiences, according to the affidavit.
Smart, on one occasion, allegedly asked her to go over to his home while his wife was out of town, according to court documents, and while attending a UVM soccer game at Virtue Field in November 2021, he allegedly began to rub her thigh while they were seated under a blanket and attempted to unzip her pants.
Stephanie Bracken, communications director with the Agency of Natural Resources, where Smart has been employed, said the agency was alerted yesterday of Smart’s arraignment but did not have more information to share.
“We are taking this matter seriously and are currently working closely with Human Resources to determine the appropriate next steps,” Bracken said.
Smart was arraigned on Wednesday in Rutland. The case is being prosecuted in Rutland County due to a potential conflict with the Chittenden County State’s Attorney’s Office, police said. Smart’s wife is a prosecutor with the Chittenden County State’s Attorney’s Office.

The rules outline how marijuana can be legally consumed at events and social settings, authorizing businesses with licenses to let customers use their products on site whether it’s at lounges, dispensaries or yoga studios.
“Today we honored the will of the Massachusetts voters, and they voted for this in 2016. Here we are, almost in 2026 and we got it across the finish line,” commissioner Kimberly Roy said during a press conference after the vote. “Today is another milestone in the Massachusetts cannabis industry.”
Commission Chair Shannon O’Brien agreed.
“The important thing is, this is the will of the voters,” O’Brien said. “Some people may have some concerns, because this is a little bit of a brave new world. We don’t really know. We know what our local pub looks like, but we don’t really understand what this looks like.” 
Commissioners estimate that businesses can begin serving cannabis on-site in up to 18 months. That is based on the rollout of cannabis delivery licenses when it took six months until a licensee filed an application. Once the applications were received, it took 11 additional months before the licensees began operating.
Commission staff expect the regulations will be filed with the secretary of state by Dec. 19 and promulgated on Jan. 2, 2026.
Municipalities must opt in to allowing social consumption businesses and develop their own standards of practice. Roy said several communities have expressed interest in allowing social consumption including Cambridge, Chelsea, Fitchburg, Somerville, Haverhill, Holyoke, Provincetown and Worcester.
Commission Chair Shannon O’Brien said the commission would also continue work with municipalities over the next six months to gauge which ones would opt in.
“I’m hoping that some of these things can go more quickly,” O’Brien said. “But there is a lot of work to do with the municipalities to make sure that they are ready, because there’s going to be a lot of regulatory framework that is going to be controlled by municipalities, a lot of applications that’s going to be managed by them.”
Commissioners are also part of several working groups including one for local advisory to help city and town leaders with the regulations, public awareness and a group focused on responsible vendor training.
Three different types of social consumption licenses are available under the regulations. One is a “supplemental” license for existing marijuana businesses to offer customers to consume products they have purchased on-site; a “hospitality” license category would allow for on-site consumption at new or existing non-cannabis businesses like yoga studios or theaters; and an “event organizer” license category would allow for temporary on-site consumption at events like rallies and festivals.
O’Brien said the regulations have been changed from the draft released in late July to get rid of “unnecessary regulatory burdens,” allow retailers to bring in more revenue and help businesses to take care of consumers if they are over-served.
For example, O’Brien said the approved regulations allow retailers to sell shelf-stable snacks, which offers a new form of revenue. Also, retailers can offer what’s called “THC inhibitors,” which can help reduce symptoms and reactions for those who feel like they’ve consumed too much marijuana.
The regulations require licensees to offer customers food and ban alcohol sales within the same area so there is no “co-mingling” of substances. Alcohol can be sold under the same roof as cannabis, but they must be sold in different areas, Roy said.
Roy noted there are several provisions aimed at ensuring safe cannabis consumption.
These include training “budtenders,” or those serving cannabis on site, to recognize signs of impairment. Also, the sale of cannabis products must end 30 minutes before a business closes and licensees must have approved transportation plans to help customers who may be too impaired to drive home. Licensees also have to get a public safety plan approved by both the commission and local officials.
Commissioner Bruce Stebbins said that during listening sessions on the proposed regulations, “there was a chorus” from public health and safety stakeholders to train those working at consumption sites. Specifically, they wanted training for recognizing impaired customers, how to help those who might have an adverse reaction to cannabis and checking customer identifications.
Stebbins said social consumption will offer economic opportunities for the state.
“I’m excited, obviously, the opportunity to create more jobs, obviously the opportunity for more revenue for cities and towns and the Commonwealth, the opportunity for maybe more consumers to venture into the marketplace and try out different products,” he said. “And I also look at a tremendous opportunity for the tourism and hospitality community. We have folks that flock to Boston and Massachusetts as a tourist, some come from countries or states that don’t allow cannabis use.”
Social consumption sites were envisioned under the 2016 marijuana voter law.
Commissioners previously planned to vote on the regulations in September. That timeline was pushed back to November and then to Christmas. In September, O’Brien’s return to the CCC pushed back the finalization of the long-awaited rules. Then in November, the vote was pushed again so commissioner Carrie Benedon, who was appointed in November, could have time to catch up on the proposed regulations.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Austin Anthony)Ford Motor Co. and a South Korean company, SK On, are ending their partnership in Kentucky and Tennessee.
Ford will own the battery manufacturing operation in Kentucky which began production earlier this year, while SK On will own a plant under construction in Tennessee. A second battery plant is planned in Kentucky though its construction has been pushed back.
Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear said that the announcement was “at least good news for Kentucky.” 
“Ford has been committed to Kentucky since the first Model-T rolled off the line in Louisville, and their commitment to our state and our workforce remains strong,” the governor said in his weekly press conference Thursday afternoon. 
Beshear added that his administration was in contact with Ford to learn more about the direction the company hopes to take with the Kentucky battery plants. Later when asked about his confidence that both Kentucky plants would operate in the future, Beshear said, “I am confident that there will be activity in at least Kentucky one in our future. What that activity will be, whether it will take longer to ramp up, that we’ve all got to work through.”
The governor blamed Republicans at the federal level for policy changes that jeopardized the deal, saying that he was “still amazed that the president would push through such a job killing bill that cut subsidies and grants that companies and people had relied upon.” 
Republican President Donald Trump has scrapped Biden administration policies aimed at moving Americans into electric vehicles, including fuel-efficiency standards. Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act , passed by Congress this year, ends $7,500 tax credits for EV purchases. 
EV sales have fallen since the tax credits ended.
Beshear also had words for Republican U.S. Rep. Brett Guthrie, of Kentucky’s 2nd District. Guthrie chairs the U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce. 
“And it’s really disappointing that Brett Guthrie, who has three EV plants in his district, would be the one that champions it, pushes it through and doesn’t make any changes at all to protect those plants,” Beshear said. “So, if we have people that lose their jobs or jobs that are not created, your own congressman did it to you. That’s really, really wrong. Your governor is going to do his best — I’m going to do my best to make sure we have as many jobs at those facilities as possible.” 
The partnership partnership breakup is expected to be completed in 2026.

(Courtesy Stantec)
Members of the New Mexico State Fairgrounds District board, including Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, got their first chance Thursday to weigh in on three new design concepts for how the 236-acre, state-owned property in the middle of Albuquerque could be transformed. 
The Legislature earlier this year created a new board entrusted with up to $500 million in bonding capacity to re-think the fairgrounds, including possibly moving the annual State Fair from its home of 87 years. Stantec, a design firm, released three new concepts this week as it finalizes a master plan, which it will release in February, and opened them up for public comment.
The board also celebrated the State Board of Finance’s approval Tuesday of the first round of funding for the project, a $22.35 million bond package to acquire roughly nine additional acres for the redevelopment. That acquisition will happen regardless of what else transpires at the fairgrounds, according to the governor’s office.
Legislative approval in January is the final step before the board issues those bonds, a signoff that Lujan Grisham said Thursday probably won’t occur without “questions and debate.” 
Potential relocation looms large over NM State Fair opening day

Still, she said Thursday, “Our plan is moving.”
Board members did not vote on the design concepts, but they did ask the firm to ensure final designs allow for affordable and sustainable housing, high-quality jobs and agricultural and food opportunities to create a “food oasis,” as Bernalillo County Commissioner Adriann Barboa put it, in an area surrounded by vacant grocery stores. 
The concepts make clear the potential tradeoffs required to fit all the priorities that have emerged for the project, including housing, a large amphitheater, a performing arts center and a park while also allowing the State Fair to continue in its usual footprint.
Moving the fair, as one of the three concepts envisions, would free up 124 acres for redevelopment, allowing more space for a bigger park, more housing and apartment options and more “community benefits,” including a public-private campus, according to the design firm. It could also mean more job opportunities, including for tech and research, according to Stantec. 
NM fairgrounds redevelopment board approves property acquisition, begin new planning phase

Keeping the fair would confine the space for redevelopment to between 43 and 51 acres, meaning potential for sales tax revenue is “medium” and housing opportunities are “limited,” according to a Stantec designer’s presentation Thursday. 
Neighborhood associations and community advocates hope the fairgrounds investment will benefit nearby neighborhoods, including the adjacent International District. The area surrounding the fairgrounds has two of the deadliest intersections for pedestrians in New Mexico and high crime rates. It’s also a food desert, thanks in part to recent closures of a nearby CVS, Walgreens and Walmart, and a “heat island,” due to the lack of tree canopy and green space. 
The Trust for Public Lands also rates the area as one in the city with the highest need for a public park. Without the State Fair, a park could be as big as 22 acres, according to Stantec, versus between 10 or 11 acres if it remains.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screen-Shot-2025-12-11-at-1.39.37-PM-1024x550.png,,,2025-12-11 16:57:43.335281

As of early 2025, the Connecticut State Police was facing a staffing shortage of roughly 300 troopers compared to the more than 1,200 troopers the department had in its ranks over a decade ago. This is due largely to retirements, resignations and a shrinking applicant pool. 
Recent academy classes are helping slowly rebuild staffing, but Gov. Ned Lamont and police leadership say Connecticut still needs substantially more troopers to meet public safety demands. More recently, news outlets reported the department had 938 troopers.
This spring, troopers negotiated a 4.5% wage hike with state officials. Troopers’ base pay is on average about $116,000 per year, but that rises to $175,000 per year once overtime is included.

Brennan served as the DOA secretary from 2019 through 2021. The agency is responsible for assisting the governor with the state budget, providing centralized purchasing and financial management for state agencies and working with the 11 federally recognized Native Nations in Wisconsin on gaming and coastal programs. 
“It’s easy to forget how broken things were after [former Gov.] Scott Walker and his right-wing Legislature had spent eight years gutting state government,” Brennan said. “We got to work putting the state on firmer financial footing, generating a budget surplus of nearly $4 billion dollars and growing our rainy day fund to $1.7 billion, then COVID hit and all of that progress was put at risk. We stood up to the extremists and delivered help to tens of thousands of small businesses, farmers, and families across Wisconsin.”
Prior to his time in Evers’ administration, Brennan worked as the executive director of Discovery World, the largest science museum in Wisconsin. 
Brennan stepped down from leading the DOA in December 2021 to serve as the president of the Greater Milwaukee Committee (GMC). The private-sector, nonprofit civic organization works to foster economic development and cultural growth in Wisconsin’s largest metro area.
According to the Greater Milwaukee Committee, Brennan is stepping aside from the role as he runs for governor. 
Brennan joins a crowded field of hopefuls seeking the Democratic nomination next year. Candidates include Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez, state Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison), state Rep. Francesca Hong (D-Madison), Milwaukee County Exec. David Crowley, former Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation CEO Missy Hughes, former Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes and former state Rep. Brett Hulsey. The primary is scheduled for Aug. 11, 2026.
Roys criticized Brennan in a statement after his announcement over a position the GMC took on a Milwaukee Public Schools referendum last year, saying that Wisconsin needs “a leader who knows how to deliver higher wages, lower costs and the freedom to thrive.”
“While I look forward to a spirited primary, I will not be able to overlook the fact that only one of the candidates in this race tried to defeat a desperately needed referendum to fund our biggest school district,” Roys said. 
The GMC, under Brennan’s leadership, was one of the city’s business organizations that opposed the $252 million operational referendum successfully sought by Milwaukee Public Schools in 2024. GMC expressed concerns at the time over transparency and the “failure to clearly articulate a measurable plan for how these additional financial resources will improve student outcomes.”
The Republican field for governor is not as expansive with just two candidates: U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany, the frontrunner in the race, and Washington Co. Executive Josh Schoemann.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Economic uncertainty due to tariffs and the effects of the federal government shutdown are expected to continue to impact Iowa’s economy, members of the Revenue Estimating Conference said Thursday as they met to discuss Iowa’s finances heading into the 2026 legislative session.
Though the three-person panel expressed concerns about economic troubles shown through job losses, lower consumer confidence and the impacts of President Donald Trump’s tariff policies on both agriculture and small businesses, the body approved updated revenue estimates that were slightly above the 9% drop projected during its October meeting.
The governor and Iowa legislators, by law, may not budget more than 99% of general fund revenues projected by the REC’s December estimate for the coming fiscal year.
Jennifer Acton, the director of the Fiscal Services division of the nonpartisan Legislative Services Agency, said the “uncertainty we were experiencing in October in both Iowa and the nation has continued into December.” The REC was also now making projections with a lack of roughly two months of recent federal data due to the federal government shutdown, she said.
“The current economic picture for Iowa remains mixed,” Acton said. “With state and national economic indicators relaying conflicting signals and related federal data since October’s meeting, some caution is due. However, it is often noted that total gross receipts grow has marginally increased over the last eight weeks.”
The REC adopted the Iowa Department of Management’s estimates for fiscal year 2026 and 2027 that showed an estimated revenue decline of 8.8% in FY 2026, going to roughly $8.16 billion, before increasing by 4.2% to $8.5 billion in FY 2027. These estimates are slightly above the 9% decrease in 2026 and 3.2% growth in 2027 predicted in October.
Kraig Paulsen, director of the Iowa Department of Management and chair of the REC, said factors like the Trump administration’s $12 billion relief package for farmers alongside increased sales and use tax collections estimates led to the changed estimates. However, he said there are still many questions that could affect the economic outlook for the state in the coming months.
“I think the biggest wild card is just Washington, D.C., in general — the shutdown, the tariffs, you know, some of the policies,” Paulsen said. “And hopefully they’ll be able to land on some of those things they need to land on in short order, so rest of us can all make decisions.”
Republican leaders said the REC estimates show Iowa is in a strong position heading into 2026. Gov. Kim Reynolds said in a statement the projections “are a direct reflection of the fiscally conservative agenda we’ve put into practice—returning tax dollars to Iowans coupled with responsible spending centered on growth.”
“While some uncertainty remains in the international trade landscape, recent soybean purchases from China and USDA assistance for farmers will benefit Iowa’s agriculture economy,” Reynolds said. “As we prepare for this legislative session, my focus remains on working with the legislature to maintain fiscal discipline and reduce property taxes for Iowans.”
But Democrats say the expected drop-off in revenue will leave the state in a difficult position for budgeting in future years. In the 2025 legislative session, the Republican trifecta approved a $9.425 billion budget for FY 2026, drawing at least $917 million from the state’s reserves, Taxpayer Relief Fund and budget surplus as the state is expected to bring in roughly $8.1 billion in revenue for the year.
State Rep. Megan Srinivas, D-Des Moines, said in a statement that “after years of budget mismanagement by Iowa Republicans, the state is now facing an unprecedented deficit.”
“Families are struggling with higher costs and rising property taxes,” Srinivas said. “Yet Republicans have cut taxes for big corporations, removed income caps on private-school vouchers so they overwhelmingly benefit wealthy families, and supported failed trade policies that are dragging Iowa’s economy down. … Republican budget decisions risk pushing Iowa into a ‘fiscal death spiral.’ Iowans deserve a responsible budget that reflects their priorities, strengthens our economy, and delivers real relief for working Iowans.”
Paulsen said the state should close the gap between revenue and spending within the “next handful of years,” and unlike Democrats, he sees the state in an “incredibly strong financial position.”
“You can create whatever hypothetical you want for the outcome you want, that is true,” Paulsen said. “But, I mean, we’re sitting here … you don’t know what (will) happen, but sooner or later, the economy gets stronger again. Rebound numbers are always big numbers, and our projections (show) we think we’re in a great spot.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-12-11 21:18:45+00:00,Mississippi Today,Some local and state agencies are aiding ICE crackdown,Mina Corpuz,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/11/local-and-state-agencies-are-aiding-ice-crackdown/,"Agreements with local and state law enforcement agencies to aid ICE have exploded under President Trump from 80 in 2010 to over 1,200, according to ICE.","As federal agents move through Mississippi, a handful of local law enforcement agencies and jails are offering assistance through agreements to cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 
“We’re assuming, until we find out differently, that our local sheriffs and police are, at a minimum, communicating and perhaps sharing information with ICE,” said Lea Campbell, a member of the Mississippi Gulf Coast Mutual Aid Collective, a community advocacy group. 
The agency has several types of agreements and contracts with local, county and state law enforcement, including identifying those in violation of immigration laws in jails and assisting in arrests. Another agreement, in place for several years in Madison and Hancock counties,  enables local jurisdictions to serve as holding facilities for detainees,
Four sheriff’s departments and two state offices already have signed 287(g) agreements with ICE, giving them some immigration enforcement abilities through collaboration with ICE. 
The Department of Public Safety has a pending agreement in Hinds County. 
Bailey Holloway, spokesperson for the department, said officers from the Mississippi Highway Patrol,  Mississippi Bureau of Narcotics and the Commercial Transportation Enforcement Division will partner with ICE to identify people suspected to be in the country without legal authorization who are not charged with crimes. She also said the DPS officers will exercise limited immigration authority on ICE-led task forces. 
“The Mississippi Department of Public Safety will work in full cooperation with our federal partners to assist in enforcing immigration laws and removing individuals who are in the country unlawfully, ensuring the safety of our communities,” she wrote in a Thursday email. 
Under the 287(g) program, there are three models: jail enforcement, warrant service officer and task force. The first two allow people to identify suspected immigrants ina jail and to make civil administrative arrests on behalf of ICE in the jail. 
Agencies can have more than one model. Those who have a 287(g) agreement are:

Jail enforcement model: the sheriff’s departments in Harrison, Monroe and Stone counties
Warrant service officer model: the sheriff’s departments in Harrison, Lauderdale and Stone counties
Task force model: attorney general’s office, state auditor’s office, Stone County Sheriff’s Department

Lauderdale County Sheriff Ward Calhoun said he saw the agreement as an opportunity to help federal partners including ICE and help process immigration cases. 
With the jail warrant service program, Calhoun said up to five deputies who work in the detention center will be trained to serve administrative warrants. He called this department’s role in immigration enforcement minor and clerical. 
When asked if the Lauderdale County Sheriff’s Department would be interested in expanding to the different 287(g) models, Calhoun said that is not likely. 
“We just don’t think there’s that many individuals in the community that we’re aware of who are here illegally, so I don’t see a need for us to do anything any differently,” he said. 
Calhoun estimated that within the past three years, the sheriff’s office has been asked a dozen times a year to hold someone in its jail until ICE can pick them up.  
The task force model allows officers to enforce civil immigration law on the street when working with the agency.

State Auditor Shad White said two agents from his office volunteered to be trained in immigration law enforcement and assist ICE in whatever way they can. 
“ICE agents and the Trump administration are working hard to stop illegal immigration, and they need every law enforcement officer willing to assist in their corner,” White said in a September statement. 
The first Mississippi agency to sign a 287(g) agreement was the attorney general’s office earlier this year. 
These agreements aren’t new but have exploded under President Trump from 80 in 2010 to hundreds this year, Austin Kocher, an associate professor at Syracuse University who researches the immigration enforcement system, wrote in a Journalist’s Resource post. 
As of Dec. 9, over 1,200 active 287(g) memorandums are in force in 39 states and one U.S. territory, with another eight pending agreements, according to ICE. 
The Florida Department of Law Enforcement signed the first 287(g) agreement in 2002 under President George W. Bush, Kocher writes. President Barack Obama ended the task force model, partly due to lawsuits and Justice Department investigations that showed problems with its implementation. 
During his first administration President Donald Trump expanded the 287(g) program and saw a large increase in participation, according to Kocher. Joe Biden’s administration preserved some existing agreements but decided to halt new ones.  
Kocher wrote that this year during Trump’s second administration, the president issued an executive order to “aggressively – yet quietly – (expand)” 287(g) agreements. The administration is also reimbursing participating law enforcement agencies through the “Big Beautiful Bill Act.”
Kocher wrote that part of the explosion of new 287(g) agreements is driven by the revival of the task force model. He also noted more types of agencies are signing the agreements, such as the Mississippi attorney general’s office, financial service departments and fish and wildlife agencies. 
Existing holding agreements with Madison and Hancock counties reflect the recent surge in ICE activities.
As of Tuesday, online booking records for the jail list four people charged with violation of federal immigration law being held for ICE in Madison. Dozens were held there days after the inauguration of Donald Trump and announcement of mass deportations. 
Through intergovernmental service agreements, ICE pays jails and prisons to hold the agency’s detainees in their facilities. Sometimes the jails hold them temporarily until they are sent to more permanent ICE detention facilities. In Mississippi, these detainees typically go to the Adams County Detention Center in Natchez or facilities in Louisiana. 
The Hancock County Sheriff’s Department has had its agreement with ICE since at least 2020, and the Madison County Sheriff’s Department has had an agreement with ICE since 2018 and one with the U.S. Marshal’s Service since at least 2016. 
The jails hold ICE’s administrative detainees, which are people not charged with criminal violations,  according to language from Hancock County’s agreement. These are those in custody to ensure their presence through the immigration hearing process and until an immigration court or other judicial body decides whether they can stay in the country or be removed,
Last week, federal immigration agents arrived in New Orleans for “Operation Catahoula Crunch.” They arrested 38 people within the first two days of the crackdown, the Associated Press reported, noting how less than a third had criminal histories. The Department of Homeland Security announced several arrests of those with violent criminal charges. 
Nola.com reported that people arrested in the New Orleans area through the operation have been taken to the Hancock County jail. 
As of November, data from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University showed that over 70% of ICE detainees don’t have criminal records. For those who do have criminal charges, many committed minor offenses such as traffic violations.
During previous legislative sessions, Mississippi lawmakers have introduced immigration bills to give local and state agencies enforcement powers and to financially support those efforts. 
A pair of bills from the recent session proposed creating a fund to support immigration efforts of law enforcement agencies that enter into 287(g) agreements with ICE and to create an immigration enforcement unit under the Department of Public Safety. They did not make it out of committee.
Others have proposed making immigration a state crime so local law enforcement would have the authority to enforce immigration and help federal agents. White, the state auditor, is supporting a bill to do this in the upcoming session, and he said Sen. Angela Burks Hill, a Republican from Picayune, has taken the lead on immigration bills. 
The Constitution grants the sole authority to enforce immigration to the federal government, not states. Some who have wanted to crackdown on immigration at the state level have made the opposite argument against local and state sanctuary laws aimed to limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. 
“The staggering expansion of 287(g), and specifically the revival of the aggressive task force model, means that the Trump administration is building an army of deportation officers out of state and local law enforcement agencies at a scale that we have never seen before,” Kocher wrote. “Full stop.”

[…]","Eastside Fire and Rescue conducts operations near Duvall, in King County, on Dec. 11, 2025. Heavy rains have caused rivers to overflow throughout western Washington. (Photo courtesy of Eastside Fire and Rescue)Washington state awaits an answer on its request for federal aid as it deals with unprecedented river flooding from days of heavy rain.
There were no known fatalities due to the storms or flooding as of midday Thursday, according to Gov. Bob Ferguson. And officials say it is too soon to fully gauge the damage. But thousands of people have been told to move to higher ground to escape rising floodwaters, roads are closed around the state and there are concerns about whether levies and dikes will hold. 
At a press conference Thursday in Mount Vernon, Ferguson noted he met with Federal Emergency Management Agency officials Wednesday afternoon, shortly after submitting his request for federal assistance.
“We walked through the numerous highway closures,” Ferguson said. “We walked through the flood levels. We walked through tens of thousands of Washingtonians being evacuated, and we tried to be as persuasive as we could to our partners in the federal government that they need to approve that emergency right away.”
He was planning to meet with FEMA officials again Thursday afternoon.
Late Wednesday, authorities ordered everyone in the Skagit Valley’s 100-year floodplain to evacuate. This includes Burlington, Hamilton, La Conner, Lyman as well as parts of Mount Vernon and Sedro-Woolley. About 78,000 people live in the floodplain, local officials said.
In all, about 100,000 people were expected to be evacuated from areas across the state. 
The National Weather Service called the predicted flooding “catastrophic and potentially life threatening.” Communities near the Skagit and Snohomish rivers and their tributaries could be inundated. The heavy rainfall brings the risk of landslides. Debris had already swept across sections of important roadways in the state, including U.S. 2 and Interstate 90.
While the atmospheric river is forecast to die down Thursday, fears of increasing river flooding remain through the rest of the week, according to the weather service. And wet conditions could continue into much of next week.
“This situation is extremely unpredictable,” Ferguson said. 
“We’re using the best information we can to provide guidance,” he added. “I just want to emphasize that if you have instructions to evacuate from your local authorities, please, please, please evacuate.”
Ferguson activated the Washington National Guard to respond to the flooding. On Thursday morning, National Guard members were filling sandbags to help stave off the worst of the flooding along the Skagit River. A total of 300 were expected to be deployed by late Thursday.
State Sen. Keith Wagoner’s home in Sedro-Woolley is on the edge of the 100-year floodplain for the Skagit River. He said he and his wife have packed bags and moved items to the second floor of the house.
“Fingers crossed but ready to go,” Wagoner said Thursday morning.
Water could be seen on River Road at the city’s Riverfront Park on Wednesday, he said before joining Ferguson in Mount Vernon. “We are still safe but the water is still rising. I think the worst is yet to come. If the predictions hold true, it is really going to do some damage.”
To the south, the Snohomish River also rose to record levels early Thursday, with the potential for overtopping levees and flash flooding. Rivers as far south as the Cowlitz and as far east as the Wenatchee were also experiencing major flooding.
U.S. 2 and U.S. 97 remain closed in both directions, as are the eastbound lanes on a segment of I-90 near North Bend. Dozens of other highways and roads are also blocked.
Ferguson earlier this year blasted the Trump administration for denying his predecessor’s plea for federal aid in the aftermath of last year’s bomb cyclone storm. On Thursday, he was more restrained, saying he was focused on emergency response efforts. 
In a letter Thursday, the state’s entire congressional delegation, including Republican U.S. Reps. Dan Newhouse and Michael Baumgartner, urged President Donald Trump to approve Ferguson’s request immediately. They wrote that recovery in Skagit County is “expected to take years or even decades.”

“It is essential that the federal government steps in to provide the resources necessary to allow our state to respond to this disaster and begin the road to recovery as soon as possible,” the letter reads.
Ferguson said he’d encouraged “his friends on the other side of the aisle” to make their case for federal assistance to the Trump administration, amid fears the president is favoring Republican-led states for aid.
He plans to host another press conference with updates Friday.

(Photo by Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)A large share of unaffiliated Colorado voters do not trust the Democratic or Republican political parties, and they value their electoral flexibility in primary elections, according to results from a recent poll backed by the multimillionaire businessman Kent Thiry.
Thirty-eight percent of unaffiliated voters reported dislike or distrust with both mainstream political parties and 30% cited distaste of the two-party system as the reason they have not registered with a political party, according to the poll, conducted by Keating Research for Let Colorado Vote, Thiry’s organization focused on ballot measures related to election participation.
“What clearly comes across is that independents are very unhappy with both parties,” Thiry told reporters Thursday. The poll referred to unaffiliated voters as independent voters.

Thiry has spearheaded some of Colorado’s most impactful electoral changes in recent years, including the state’s independent redistricting committees and an open primary system where unaffiliated voters can cast a ballot in one or another party’s elections. Last year, Thiry backed an unsuccessful attempt to eliminate party-based primary elections and move general elections to ranked-choice voting.
Let Colorado Vote commissioned the poll in anticipation of unaffiliated active voters becoming a majority of voters in the state.
The poll of 1,210 active voters in Colorado, including 600 unaffiliated voters, was conducted from Nov. 9 to Nov. 17 by Keating Research. About half of voters in Colorado are unaffiliated, and that registration category has grown by over 3% since the start of the year.










What clearly comes across is that independents are very unhappy with both parties.


– Kent Thiry, on a new poll of Colorado voters


“I think people think that with automatic voter registration, people just become independent and not registered with a party. But this is an active action by these independents,” pollster Chris Keating said.
People who become automatically registered through the Division of Motor Vehicles, such as when they get a Colorado driver’s license, get marked as an unaffiliated voter. They need to take an extra step to affiliate with a major political party. The pollsters assert, however, that those voters are making an active choice to not register with a party and instead remain unaffiliated because of their political values. The poll found that 54% of unaffiliated voters view themselves as “independent.”
The poll found that about 25% of unaffiliated voters were once registered Democrats, 21% were once Republicans and about half have never belonged to a political party in the state.
Trump disapproval
Unaffiliated voters favor a Democratic candidate for Congress next year over a Republican by 14 points, and they tend to trust Democrats more on issues including the environment, health care, education and voting issues. They trust Republicans more on crime and are near split on the issues of immigration and cost of living.
At the same time, the poll found that 56% of unaffiliated voters hold unfavorable views towards the Democratic Party, while 57% are unfavorable towards the Republican Party.
Sixty-two percent disapprove of President Donald Trump. Nearly two-thirds of the voting bloc want to see both parties become more moderate, though the poll did not explore what that means to specific voters.
“For the Democratic Party, what this means is they need to avoid, stop and begin to reverse their march to the far left,” Thiry said.
The poll also found that 66% of voters aged 18 to 34 are unaffiliated, the largest share among any age group.
“You talk to these people who are 24 (years old) and they look at what they’ve seen in the last eight years of their life,” Thiry said. “This current system seems to be awfully broken.”

(Photo by Michelle Griffith/Minnesota Reformer)Mike Lindell, the MyPillow guy and prominent right-wing conspiracy theorist who has spent millions of dollars promoting baseless claims about widespread election fraud, is running for Minnesota governor.
Lindell announced his run Thursday in his Shakopee factory, shouting to be heard over the din of machines that continue churning out his signature lumpy pillows despite years of financial challenges brought on by defamation lawsuits and lost sales from retailers fleeing association with him.
“MyPillow is still standing, and now I want you to know that I will stand for you as the next governor of Minnesota,” Lindell said.
Lindell was speaking to an iPhone broadcasting to LindellTV and Steve Bannon’s War Room, with the fellow right-wing influencer and former Trump advisor interviewing him about his campaign.
Lindell enters a crowded field of GOP candidates who believe they’re best able to beat Gov. Tim Walz, who is running for a third term next year.
Other Republicans running for governor include Minnesota House Speaker Lisa Demuth; state Rep. Kristin Robbins; 2022 GOP nominee for governor Scott Jensen; Kendall Qualls, an army veteran and health care executive; and attorney Chris Madel.
Lindell stands out for being the most loyal and closest candidate to Trump, having once carried notes into the White House following the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol that seemed to show plans for Trump to stay in power through military force. (Walmart, Kohl’s, J.C. Penney, Wayfair, Bed Bath & Beyond and other companies pulled MyPillow products shortly after.)
While Lindell’s national celebrity in the MAGA movement and Trump ties may make him a serious contender in the Minnesota GOP endorsement process, his chaotic nature and relentless fixation on conspiracy theories are sure to repel mainstream Republicans and swing voters if he makes it to the general election.

Minnesota Republican primary voters tend to follow the party’s convention endorsement, wherein hundreds of hardcore activists — often the most ideologically dogmatic — decide the candidates’ fate.
During one of the commercial breaks of his campaign announcement, Lindell asked an employee if “the bus” was outside. Lindell then snatched the iPhone and its stand and ran through his factory and into the cold.
He set the phone in front of his new campaign bus emblazoned in red, white and blue and a photo of himself holding an American flag and a copy of the U.S. Constitution. The bus was in the background when the show returned from its commercial break.
Bannon on Thursday praised Lindell for how well he runs his company. Because of that, Lindell was the “best opponent that somebody could field against Walz,” Bannon said.
Lindell wrapped up the live broadcast in front of the bus, which has Utah plates. He then went back inside to answer questions from three local reporters — apparently only those who called his personal cell phone ahead of time to get details on the announcement. One of his reporters with LindellTV was also there.
Lindell said he spoke to Trump in August about his run for Minnesota governor. He said the president “didn’t react either way,” and that he didn’t know if Trump would endorse him. “It would be his decision,” Lindell said.
Lindell then went into a long diatribe about the nation’s elections. He said Minnesota needs to get rid of its voter machines and only count votes by hand.
“When running for governor here in Minnesota, I will have access — I don’t know how much, where to make sure that our elections are secure — these voting machines, but they’re not,” Lindell said.
He criticized the media for not reporting on election fraud, and said that the conservative networks Fox News and Newsmax were “the worst outlets in the world” for not doing anything about election fraud. (Fox News paid Dominion Voting Systems nearly $800 million to settle a lawsuit over broadcasting false claims about the 2020 election.)

As governor, Lindell said he would run the state like a business, which would eliminate the fraud in Minnesota public programs that has been dominating the news nationwide. He also said he has a solution for “the box stores” and empty malls that are losing sales to online retailers and a plan for education “based on past experience.” Lindell declined to elaborate on his plans for now.
Rudy Giuliani, the former New York Mayor and personal lawyer for Trump who was disbarred in New York and Washington, D.C. for his role attempting to undermine the 2020 presidential election, will be an advisor to the Lindell campaign. Giuliani also has a show on LindellTV.
Asked if he will self-fund his campaign for governor, Lindell said no.
“Absolutely not. I can’t self-fund. I don’t have any money left,” Lindell said.
Lindell says he’s spent millions defending his theory that the 2020 election was stolen, which has made him broke.
In June, a federal jury found that Lindell defamed a former Dominion Voting Systems employee and was ordered to pay $2.3 million, pending appeal.
Then in September, a federal judge ruled that Lindell defamed voting machine company Smartmatic with his attacks on the outcome of the 2020 election. The company is seeking $1.5 billion in damages, which will be decided by a jury.
During the defamation lawsuit brought by a Dominion Voting Systems employee over the summer, Lindell in court testimony said he was $10 million in debt.
Lindell — a self-described former “crackhead” — has a powerful redemption story, having suffered from addiction to cocaine for decades. He says he once spent 14 days awake on cocaine before his drug dealers staged an intervention.

(Getty Images)A Senate panel approved legislation Thursday that would bar New Jersey pet stores from selling cats, dogs, or rabbits in a divided vote Thursday.
The Senate Economic Growth Committee approved the measure, one long sought by animal welfare activists, in a 3-2 vote along party lines over the worries of store owners who warned the bill could force their closure.
The bill’s supporters said it would stop the flow of ill or abused dogs from puppy mills, commercial breeding facilities whose poor conditions can leave pet owners with hefty veterinarian bills.
“Many unsuspecting consumers of puppies are unaware of the medical and behavioral issues inherent in dogs bred at the horrific puppy mills. However, unlike other products that can be easily disposed of, the consumer of a dog develops an emotional attachment to the newest member of the family and will do anything to make that pet healthy,” said Camden County Commissioner Jeff Nash.
Bill proponents argued the states’ few remaining pet stores that sell cats, dogs, or rabbits — less than 20 remain in New Jersey — obtained their wares from disreputable breeders, citing a September enforcement notice from the state’s consumer affairs division that fined eight pet stores over violations of the state’s Pet Purchase Protection Act.
“It is well-documented that New Jersey puppy stores are currently sourcing from massive Midwest breeders and brokers with awful animal welfare records and are repeatedly violating the state consumer protection law,” said Ariel Lefkovits of Humane World for Animals.
Only one of the stores, Oh My Dog in Kearny, was fined for purchasing puppies from an unlicensed breeder. The rest faced penalties for a range of other infractions, including failure to post a list of consumer rights, animal birth dates, and breeder inspection reports, among other things.
Pet store owners said their breeders are above board, arguing animal rights activists who claimed otherwise did so without evidence.
“There’s a lot of misinformation going on, and the point I want to get across is any of these activists or Humane Society or Humane World for Animals, none of these people have been to the breeders we use, and we have,” said Thomas Gallo, owner of the Pet Center in Old Bridge.
Gallo’s store was fined $12,500 in September for failing to post animal histories and vaccine records, among some other documents. Gallo has said he is contesting those fines.
The bill would fine pet stores $1,000 for each cat, dog, or rabbit sold and would require courts to revoke a store’s license after three violations. A judge could also permanently bar the pet store from operating in the state.
Barring pet stores from selling cats, dogs, and rabbits would do little to stop the flow of pets from poor breeders, said Shake a Paw owner Jeff Morton, who said those sales would instead flow through animal shelters and rescues that face different, less stringent regulatory regimes than their commercial counterparts.
“You want to talk about importing dogs into New Jersey? That’s what all these rescues do. They’re buying dogs for resale, passing them off as rescues, charging $1,600 to adopt their dogs, and then you’re meeting in the Home Depot parking lot or on the New Jersey Turnpike at exit 8A,” Morton said.
Shelters, kennels, pet shops, and pounds must be inspected by local health authorities at least once a year, according to the state Department of Health. New Jersey animal rescues are only subject to inspections if they also operate a shelter or become the subject of an animal cruelty investigation.
Store owners warned that similar bans enacted in states like New York and California had shuttered businesses.
“The regulated stores, the ones who are following the rules, are the ones that are forced to close. Twenty-six of California’s 28 pet stores shut down after their ban, and New York lost two dozen more,” said Alisa Clements, deputy director of outreach and advocacy for the Pet Advocacy Network, an industry lobbying group.
The vast majority of American states allow pet stores to sell cats, dogs, and rabbits. Only eight states bar such sales, though other bans exist at lower levels of government, including more than 150 in New Jersey, Lefkovits said.
The panel’s two Republican members, Sens. Kristin Corrado (R-Passaic) and Joe Pennacchio (R-Morris), and Sen. Britnee Timberlake (D-Essex) said more stringent regulations targeting puppy mills would be a better solution. Timberlake voted to advance the bill.
“There’s been one constant and common thread, that almost every person brought up puppy mills and bad breeders, and I agree that they’re the problem,” Corrado said. “They should be addressed through regulation and enforcement.”",https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-1440772707-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-11 16:57:43.335281

(Photo courtesy of Raise the Wage Oklahoma)OKLAHOMA CITY – Supporters of increasing the minimum wage said Thursday that independents can still vote on the issue when it appears on the June primary ballot.
The action comes after the Oklahoma Election Board on Wednesday said that all partisan primaries will be closed to independents after Republicans, Democrats and Libertarians did not submit notice that they intended to open their elections to non-affiliated voters.
The Oklahoma Democratic Party said it wanted to continue to allow independents to vote in their primaries, but the State Election Board said party leaders failed to give notice. Democratic leaders said they were exploring legal counsel.
As a result, for the first time in a decade, Democrats will not let independents vote in their primaries.
Gov. Kevin Stitt in September 2024 set the vote on State Question 832 for the June 16, 2026, primary election ballot.
The question seeks to gradually raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour in 2029.
“All voters, regardless of party registration, can vote on state questions, even when they are on the primary ballot,” said Amber England, a spokesperson for State Question 832.
She said Wednesday’s announcement about partisan primary closures was disappointing because independents are one of the fastest growing and engaged voting blocs in the state.
She said their vote matters.
“This election is your chance to help ensure Oklahoma’s workers and families can keep up with the rising costs of gas, groceries and housing,” England said.
If passed by voters, the initiative would increase the minimum wage to $12 an hour in 2027 from the current $7.25, which is also the federal minimum wage. The rate has been the same since 2009.
It calls for additional gradual increases until it reaches $15 an hour in 2029.

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota legislators are preparing for the impact of a free school meals program that could be considered by voters next year.
But predicting how much it will cost the state is challenging, in part because it’s tough to know how many students would eat breakfast and lunch at school if meals are free, Lynelle Johnson, director of child nutrition and food distribution for the Department of Public Instruction, told lawmakers this week.
“We can’t predict future participation,” Johnson told members of the Budget Section Education and Environment Division. 
Johnson previously estimated providing free school meals to North Dakota students would cost $140 million for two years. Since a ballot measure was proposed to put the issue to voters, Johnson looked at the numbers again and came up with a preliminary estimate of about $134 million for 2027-29.
Ballot measure effort seeks to provide free school meals to North Dakota students

She projects the state’s cost could grow by $6 million to $7 million every two years based on her initial estimates, though she told lawmakers she plans to continue refining her projections. 
Rep. Mike Nathe, R-Bismarck, said he’s concerned about the potential growth of the program and the state’s responsibility to fund it.
“If this passes, we have to start figuring out how we’re going to do this,” Nathe said. “It’s a pretty sizable sum to do.”
The Together for School Meals coalition submitted a proposed petition to the North Dakota secretary of state on Nov. 26. The petition seeks to get an initiated measure on the ballot that proposes to add a section to the state constitution requiring all K-12 public schools to provide free breakfast and lunch to students. Private schools and tribal schools could opt in to the program.
About 66% of North Dakota students eat school lunch and about 31% eat breakfast at school, according to state estimates. Johnson expects more students to eat school meals if they are free, which is what the state saw during the COVID-19 pandemic when federal funding provided free school meals to all students. 
North Dakota is reimbursed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture for meals provided to students who qualify for the federal free or reduced meal program. Last year, that amounted to more than $38 million, Johnson said. 
Lawmakers expressed concerns that families will stop applying for the federal program, causing the state to miss out on the federal support.
“If it passes, wouldn’t the mentality of the family be like, ‘Well, it’s free, why would I apply?’” asked Rep. Scott Louser, R-Minot.
About 26,000 students eligible for free or reduced meals automatically qualify because their families are eligible for other federal programs, Johnson said. The federal government would continue reimbursing the state for those students. However, changes to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition and Assistance Program could reduce the number of students who automatically qualify, she said.
To combat a decrease in federal funding, the state could implement strategies to encourage families to apply, such as connecting the application to other benefits the students could receive, Johnson said.
The proposed language for the ballot measure requires schools to maximize federal reimbursement and encourage families to apply for the federal program.
Lawmakers expand free school meals in North Dakota after rejecting larger proposal

Another unknown is whether additional schools will participate in the National School Lunch Program if meals are free, Johnson said. Twenty-five private schools in the state participate now, with about 730 students who qualify for free or reduced meals, according to Department of Public Instruction figures. A few more private schools participated in the meal program during the pandemic when meals were free for all students, Johnson said.
Lawmakers asked Johnson to do additional research, including studying what happened in states that have already adopted universal free meals. 
“There’s a lot of things we don’t know about that could really add to the tab on this thing for the state,” Nathe said.
Nick Archuleta, president of ND United, a union representing educators and public employees, said he was happy the Legislature is doing its due diligence on an important issue facing students and families.
Teachers support students being fed during the school day because it helps those students succeed, Archuleta said.
“I think anybody who has been in a classroom with a child that is ‘hangry’ understands that it’s very difficult for those kids to focus on the work in front of them when their stomachs are growling,” he said.
The North Dakota Legislature in 2023 approved $6 million in state funding to expand who qualifies for free meals up to a certain household income level. About half of that funding was used in the 2023-25 budget cycle. 
Some lawmakers have questioned why more students didn’t eat free meals under the state program. Johnson told the North Dakota Monitor the $6 million was based on an estimate of how many students would qualify, which was difficult to pin down accurately.
“We don’t know how much money people are going to make,” Johnson said. “So it was an estimate of how many students we thought would qualify.”
Earlier this year, lawmakers rejected proposals to fund free school meals for all students. They did vote to expand the state program by changing the income requirements. Now a family of four earning up to $72,000 a year can qualify for free meals. The Department of Public Instruction estimates that nearly 3,000 students qualify under that program, up from last year’s total of about 1,800. The funding remains at $6 million for the two-year budget cycle.
The secretary of state approved the ballot measure petition title and returned it to the sponsoring committee to finalize by Dec. 26, said Sandy McMerty, deputy secretary of state. Once the petition is approved, the committee can begin gathering signatures. To be included in the general election ballot in November, the sponsoring committee would need to submit 31,164 verifiable signatures by July 6.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)As Utah lawmakers pursue legislation on redistricting — both in special session and in the upcoming 2026 legislative session — sound constitutional principles that respect the people’s will ought to prevail. Sadly, in the redistricting debate that has been occurring primarily in courtrooms in the last several years, both principle and the people have often taken a back seat to national partisan interest. 
Judicial decisions around redistricting have undermined sound constitutional ideas while simultaneously transforming Utah into a national partisan battleground over the 2026 midterm elections. Driving the debate is Proposition 4, which created a redistricting commission to assist the Utah Legislature in redistricting decisions, and also planted in Utah law the concept of using lawsuits to dispute legislative redistricting decisions. 
As a recent Sutherland Institute/Y2 Analytics poll recently revealed, Utah voters are being left behind by all sides. 
Two high-level trends clearly stood out from the poll of Utah voters: 
First, voters clearly want people they elect to be primarily responsible for defining boundaries in congressional districts, while rejecting the idea of that responsibility falling to judges. Fully 71% of Utah voters want people who are elected (an elected body or individual elected official at the state or county level) to be primarily responsible for defining boundaries for congressional maps. By contrast, only 8% of voters prefer judges making the decision. This rejects the idea of a judiciary-driven outcome envisioned by Proposition 4, and which is playing out before our eyes. 
Second, voters clearly want a redistricting commission involved in the process with the Utah Legislature. When asked about the roles of the Utah Legislature and a commission in the redistricting process, 91% of Utah voters prefer some meaningful role for a commission, while only 9% of Utah voters say the Legislature should be solely responsible for determining district boundaries. This argues against the pre-Proposition 4 status quo. 
A 2024 decision by the Utah Supreme Court further complicates enacting a policy solution that reflects the will of voters. The Legislature in 2020 replaced Proposition 4 with an advisory redistricting commission that eliminated the judicial enforcement provision of Proposition 4. The Utah Supreme Court’s ruling struck it down. 
This means the current unsatisfactory process must be changed via ballot initiative or constitutional amendment, both of which require a vote of the people. If the current effort to repeal Proposition 4 proves successful, it would give the Legislature an opportunity to establish the kind of redistricting commission process that voters desire (without judicial encroachment). Similarly, the Utah Legislature could place a constitutional amendment on the ballot that defines the role of the Legislature and any commission created by law in redistricting. 
Both are possible avenues today, but national partisan interests pose a challenge. One side seems to view Proposition 4 as the best means to accomplish their partisan ends, while the other side seems to view simple repeal of Proposition 4 in the same way. 
Voters want more than what partisan interests are offering. They want the people they elect in the driver’s seat, with a redistricting commission to help, and without final decisions being made by judges. Policymakers can and should deliver those reforms.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/120925_UND-XGR_19-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-11 16:00:27.148332

Legislative leaders announced Thursday that the session will be limited to just a handful of issues, so the House and Senate chambers may not be full for long next week. (Photo by Danielle E. Gaines/Maryland Matters)For those sitting at home wondering if the General Assembly will take up hyperpartisan congressional redistricting battle during next week’s special legislative session, the House of Delegates and the Senate have an answer for you: No.
Lawmakers are scheduled to head back to Annapolis on Dec. 16 — four days after the last scheduled meeting of the Governor’s Redistricting Advisory Commission on Friday. That had sparked speculation that someone might try to make redistricting an issue.
In a joint statement Thursday, Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) and Speaker Pro Tem Dana Stein (D-Montgomery) quashed that idea. The upcoming session “will be strictly limited and only address” three issues, the leaders said.
The first is to allow the House to elect a new speaker following the decision last week by Del. Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County) to step down from the position, which she had held for six years. t but retain her seat.
The General Assembly will also take up a number of veto overrides. Any vetoes not considered during the special session cannot be addressed when the legislature reconvenes in January.
The two chambers will also take up “Other administrative functions as required for the continuity of legislative operations.”
Members of either chamber could still propose legislation, if they want a lesson in futility. Traditionally, bills unrelated to the reasons for calling a special session are sent to rules committees in their respective chambers, where they are left to die.
Senate Republicans stick with leaders
Maryland’s Republican senators unanimously reelected Sen. Steve Hershey (R-Upper Shore) and Sen. Justin Ready (R-Frederick and Carroll) as the Senate minority leader and minority whip, respectively, for the 2026 legislative session, the caucus announced Thursday.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The two have served together as leaders of the minority — Republicans hold just 13 of the 47 seats in the chamber — since 2022, what the caucus called “a period of historic fiscal challenges and mounting frustration among Marylanders over affordability, public safety, and government accountability.” Those challlenges will likely be felt again this year, when lawmakers will have to close an estimated $1.5 billion hole in next year’s budget while battling for funding for education reform, replacement of the Francis Scott Key Bridge and other big-ticket items.
Hershey called being minority leader, even with the party’s numerical disadvantage, “an honor and a responsibility I take seriously.”
“I’m humbled by the continued trust of my colleagues and proud of the work we’ve done together to hold this administration accountable and give a voice to the millions of Marylanders who feel left behind by one-party rule,” he said. “As we head into an election year, Senate Republicans remain focused on restoring balance and common sense in Annapolis.”
Ready echoed Hershey, saying “families are facing real challenges—rising costs, shrinking opportunities, and a government that’s growing faster than our economy. Our mission is clear: to fight for policies that make it easier to live, work, and build a future here in Maryland.”
The two said the Republican Caucus will press for “solutions that make the state more affordable, improve transparency in government spending, and strengthen public safety,” according to a statement from the caucus.
Monteiro lands at UMBC
Gov. Wes Moore (D) in October announced that Secretary of Service and Civic Innovation Paul Monteiro would be leaving the department he founded when Moore took office. Moore said Monteiro would be leaving Nov. 12, but did not say where he was going. Now we know.
Monteiro will be the new vice president for government relations and community affairs at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, UMBC President Valerie Sheares Ashby announced in an open letter to staff and students Thursday.

Ashby said Monteiro, a Hyattsville native, is “an experienced administrator and lifelong public servant who has held leadership roles in local, state, and federal government and in higher education.” She said Monteiro will start next week, to prepare for the start of the 2026 General Assembly “at a time when our advocacy with local, state, and federal government is more demanding and more consequential than ever.”
“We are fortunate to have in Paul not only someone whose knowledge and expertise in policy, governance, and advocacy will serve us well, but also someone whose personal values align so beautifully with UMBC’s,” her letter said.
Monteiro was the founding secretary of the Department of Service and Civic Innovation, and the department and its service year program were signature programs for Moore during his first year in office. Monteiro joined the administration in April 2023, and Moore said in October that Monteiro “took an idea and turned it into a statewide movement.”
“As the department’s founding secretary, his work has built a foundation that will serve generations of Marylanders,” Moore said in an October statement. “Paul has worked tirelessly in pursuit of this mission – at a time when we so badly need this unifying work. I am immensely grateful for his leadership.”
Jonny Dorsey, a former Moore deputy chief of staff, has been secretary of the department since Monteiro’s departure.
Monteiro becomes at least the eighth senior official to leave the Moore administration this year and the seventh Cabinet secretary. Chief of Staff Fagan Harris announced his departure in August, the same month as Budget Secretary Helene Grady; Transportation Secretary Paul Wiedefeld retired in July; embattled Juvenile Services Secretary Vince Schiraldi left in June; Veterans and Military Families Secretary Anthony “Tony” C.

Ford and SK On formed BlueOval SK in 2021 to build three battery plants: two in Kentucky and one at Ford’s 6-square-mile manufacturing site in rural West Tennessee. The plants represent a combined $11.4 billion investment. 
Under the mutual restructuring agreement announced Thursday, a Ford subsidiary will take full ownership of the Kentucky battery plants, and SK On will own and operate the battery plant in Tennessee, according to a statement from SK On. The agreement is subject to regulatory approvals and is expected to be complete by the first quarter of 2026.
The agreement allows SK On to “improve its operational efficiency” and “respond more effectively to evolving market dynamics and diverse customer needs,” the company stated. 
The start of production at the Tennessee battery plant “remains flexible at this time, as it’s tied to the ownership transition,” an SK On spokesperson said Thursday.
BlueOval SK External Affairs Director Keli McAlister wrote in a statement that the company is aware of SK On’s announcement and BlueOval SK is “working with both of our parent companies to determine what this means for BlueOval SK.”
A representative for Ford did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
State officials are keeping a close eye on the arrangement because of a nearly $1 billion investment in BlueOval City.
“We are aware of Ford and SK On’s decision to end their U.S. battery joint venture; however, this corporate decision does not change or diminish the commitments made to West Tennessee,” the state’s Department of Economic and Community Development wrote in a statement. “The jobs, investment and long-term, generational impact promised to the region remain on track.”
Ford has pushed back its start date for mass production at the BlueOval City campus twice over the last two years amid a shifting electric vehicle market. 
The industry has faced heightened political turbulence as President Donald Trump’s administration targeted Biden-era electric vehicle funding and tax credits.
As of August, Ford plans to start mass production of its next-generation electric pickup truck in 2028, three years after its initial production goal of 2025. 
SK On “plans to focus on profitable and sustainable growth in the U.S. by supplying electric vehicle batteries to Ford and various customers, as well as energy storage systems, from its Tennessee plant,” the company stated.
It emphasized its ongoing commitment to the Tennessee plant, stating the facility is a “cornerstone of its expanding U.S. advanced battery manufacturing capabilities and production.” 
SK On will “maintain its solid strategic relationship with Ford going forward,” as the Tennessee battery plant is located on the Ford campus. 
When the BlueOval City project was announced in 2021, it received nearly $1 billion in state economic incentives contingent on creating 5,760 direct new jobs over a 10-year period, with Ford’s vehicle manufacturing plant slated to employ 3,000 of those workers. The remainder would be employed by the BlueOval SK battery plant.
BlueOval SK reported in September that it had hired 350 employees in Tennessee and 1,450 at its battery plants in Kentucky. 
Ford announced a $2 billion investment in August to convert a Kentucky manufacturing plant to build electric vehicles, starting with a mid-sized electric pickup truck slated to launch in 2027.

They spoke during an online town hall meeting hosted by Deep South Today.","Deep South Today convened reporters from its three newsrooms — Mississippi Today, Verite News and The Current — for an online town hall meeting Dec. 4 to examine how hundreds of millions of opioid settlement dollars are being spent across the region.
The hour-long conversation, attended virtually by dozens of Deep South Today members, offered a behind-the-scenes look at how investigative journalists are tracking the opioid settlement spending and uncovering whether communities are benefiting from this once-in-a-generation influx of money.


The panel featured Katie Jane Fernelius of Verite News, Alena Maschke of The Current and Allen Siegler of Mississippi Today — all of whom have closely covered the settlement spending in their communities. The three journalists have shared notes and are planning collaborations, highlighting the benefit of Deep South Today’s multi-newsroom model.
The panel was moderated by Adam Ganucheau, executive editor at Deep South Today. Deep South Today CEO Warwick Sabin and Deep South Today Development Manager Elizabeth Hambuchen also gave remarks.
Here are some key takeaways from the conversation.
1. The opioid settlement money arrived with few rules.
Siegler opened by explaining how national opioid settlements left broad spending discretion to states and local governments — and very little oversight. That lack of structure is shaping everything that follows, underscoring the importance of investigative journalism.
2. Spending can look dramatically different depending on where you live.
Maschke and Fernelius described a patchwork of approaches across Louisiana, while Siegler outlined Mississippi’s early uneven rollout. Some communities are prioritizing treatment while others are diverting funds to needs unrelated to the opioid crisis.
3. Fault lines are emerging.
The journalists pointed to various officials’ deliberations about whether funds should support treatment, law enforcement, prevention programs or budget backfilling. Some uses — including a few “scandalous” examples in Louisiana and Mississippi — are raising accountability questions.
4. Lack of transparency is a major challenge.
All three journalists shared how difficult it’s been to follow the money. Siegler had to file 147 records requests across Mississippi for basic spending information, often facing long delays or incomplete data. Similar barriers exist in Louisiana, where public reporting remains inconsistent.
5. 2026 will be a decisive year.

Cormack was Superintendent Errick Greene’s first hire in 2019, according to an announcement the district released Monday. He led academics at JPS, brainstorming initiatives like Project 75, which focuses on reading, and working with school leaders to improve student achievement. 
Project 75 aims to boost the percentage of third graders in JPS who pass the state assessment on the first attempt from 55% to 75%. Cormack presented his plan for Project 75 to the school board in August, but the initiative kicked off in earnest in mid-November.

Under Cormack’s leadership, the district’s state accountability rating improved from an F to a C and graduation rates increased. The district’s announcement called the time of Cormack’s tenure one of the “most significant periods of sustained academic and organization improvement in its history.”
“Dr. Cormack’s impact on Jackson Public Schools has been profound,” Greene said in the announcement. “His relentless focus on instructional excellence, organizational effectiveness, and leadership development has strengthened our schools and improved outcomes for our scholars. We are grateful for his service to JPS, and proud to see him elevate and expand his impact even farther.” 
Cormack drew from his experience as a classroom teacher in the Delta for his work at JPS and his former position as CEO of the Barksdale Reading Institute, which closed in 2023. 
“I fundamentally believe that reading is freedom,” Cormack told Mississippi Today in a previous interview. “Part of my job is to make sure our scholars have the ability to be and do whatever their potential takes them.” 
He will assume his new position as CEO of KIPP Atlanta Schools on March 16. KIPP is a national charter school network with hubs across the country, including schools in Memphis, New Orleans and Houston. 
“Thank you, Jackson Public Schools, for the privilege of serving our scholars and community. I carry that work and those lessons with me as I step into this new role,” Cormack said in a statement on LinkedIn.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/07043832/Jackson-Public-Schools.jpg,,,2025-12-11 16:00:27.148332

The Kids Count Data Dashboard, released by Kentucky Youth Advocates Thursday, shows about 21% of children are living in food-insecure households, 20% live below the poverty level and 44% live in low-income households. Kids Count is part of a national initiative by the Annie E. Casey Foundation and measures child well-being based on a variety of measures — education, family life, trauma, incarceration and more.

In Eastern Kentucky, about 40% of children are growing up in childhood poverty, according to Terry Brooks,  executive director of Kentucky Youth Advocates. 
“Rates of poverty for Black kids in Kentucky continue to be at an unacceptable disproportionate rate in every corner of the state,” Brooks said. About 31% of Black children and 23% of Latinx children in Kentucky live in poverty, higher than 17% of white children.  
Other takeaways from the report include: 

In 2023, child poverty rates improved in 111 of 120 counties compared to five years previous but 1 in 5 children overall continue to live in poverty. In five counties, all Eastern Kentucky, child poverty rates are higher than 40%. 
From 2019-2023, 45% of Kentucky households had a high rental cost burden with renters spending 30% or more of their income on rent plus utilities. During this time, 70 counties experienced improved rates over this time period compared to 2014-2018.
In the 2024-2025 school year, the high school graduation rate improved overall to nearly 94% from about 91% % in 2019-2020. 
About half of fourth graders were at least proficient in reading in the most recent school year, with 89 of the state’s 169 school districts with available data reporting lower reading proficiency rates than in 2023-2024. 
About 40% of eighth graders were at least proficient in math in the last school year. 
In 2023, about 97% of Kentucky children had health insurance. From 2021-2023, 1 in 10 Kentucky mothers smoked during pregnancy, an improvement from 2016-2018. 
From 2022-2024, Kentucky had a rate of 39.4 per 1,000 Kentucky children in foster care, lower than the rates in 2017-2019. The state’s percentage of children exiting foster care to reunification with a parent also improved in this time period to 38%.

“Let’s be very clear: This data is critical if you care about kids. It can and it should shape our direction as a state,” Brooks said. “The critical point is turning ‘can shape’ into ‘will shape,’ and that ‘will shape’ will only come through decisive action from our lawmakers and Gov. (Andy) Beshear when that opening gavel falls in January. That means budget investments. That means smart policy moves. That means making kids a priority in real and relevant and measurable ways.”

Karena Cash, the data and research director at Kentucky Youth Advocates, said food insecurity is also connected to higher rates of obesity. 
“Often, when we think about food insecurity and hunger, we picture extreme forms of malnutrition, which just isn’t the reality, often, of what food insecurity looks like here in Kentucky” said Cash. “Food insecurity in Kentucky can be very hidden and a lot trickier to identify, because it’s often things like parents skipping meals to ensure that their kids have enough food at dinner, or families choosing between, ‘do I pay my utility bills this month, or do I buy groceries?’ Or, which is the connection to obesity, having to rely on cheap, ultra processed foods in order to make ends meet when it comes to their food budget.” 
Lack of grocery stores is another factor here, Cash said: “The neighborhood a child grows up in, and, specifically, the proximity to a grocery store within their neighborhood, can strongly influence their access to healthy foods.” 
Meanwhile, most schools in Kentucky offer free food to children through the Community Eligibility Provision, Cash said.

“Schools are a significant source of healthy meals for kids, with research finding that some of the healthiest meals consumed by children in their day to day are coming from their school cafeteria,” she said. 
Aliete Yanes Medina, a senior high school student at Fern Creek High School in Louisville, said she tutors students who face food and housing insecurity. 
“The data we heard today is powerful because it unites us, establishes a tangible way of showing progress in our community,” Medina said. “But most importantly, this shows that we care. This data reflects kids like the ones I tutor, but also like myself. It gives us a clear picture of how young people are doing across Kentucky but it also reminds us that behind every number is a story, a challenge and a person who deserves support and opportunity.”

She requested $35 million to cover multiple districts serving the same students virtually. (Joshua Bowling/Source NM)New Mexico Public Education Department Secretary Mariana Padilla on Thursday presented her department’s budget request to a panel of state lawmakers. What should have been a routine public meeting, one of many like it in the final week of Legislative Finance Committee hearings before the legislative session begins in January, quickly derailed as Padilla explained her agency faces a $35 million shortfall after overpaying one school district.
The overpayment dates to May, she said, when Gallup-McKinley County Schools canceled its contract with online learning company K12, after accusing it of breaching its contract and violating special-education law. As a result, 3,000 students across the state who depended on the district’s online instruction suddenly needed a new online school. Districts in Santa Rosa and Chama stepped up, each welcoming about 1,500 of the affected students into their online programs.
But districts receive state funding based on their enrollment numbers for the prior year, Padilla said, meaning that Gallup-McKinley is still drawing money for the 3,000 virtual students who have been enrolled elsewhere for months. The end result: a $35 million shortfall for the state Public Education Department.
Legislative Finance Chair Rep. Nathan Small (D-Las Cruces), told Padilla she shouldn’t expect to receive that $35 million — but should expect to see proposed legislation in 2026 that would prevent “an abuse” like this from happening again. Several lawmakers on the panel agreed.
Sen. George Muñoz (D-Gallup), chair of the Senate Finance Committee, took it a step further.
“I’m not going to let our school district ruin an entire department’s budget over greed,” he said, after first saying he ought to call the New Mexico State Police over the money, then saying he’d call Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and bring the matter to her attention. Finally, he said he’d consider showing up unannounced to the Gallup-McKinley headquarters Monday and refusing to leave the lobby “until they write a check.”
Gallup-McKinley County Schools were not immediately available to comment.
After lawmakers had a chance to share their sharp words over the shortfall, Padilla steered conversation back to routine financial matters.
Overall, Padilla proposed a budget with an increase of $81 million, or 1.7%, to recurring general fund spending. However, it represented a decrease of $143 million, or 44%, to non-recurring general fund spending.
She said that recruiting educators remains a priority for the department. In fiscal year 2025, New Mexico had 681 teacher vacancies and more than 1,100 teachers finished “educator prep programs,” Padilla said.
Beyond classroom education, Padilla’s presentation to lawmakers focused on the ways New Mexico’s public schools meet the physical needs of their communities’ children. Across the state, public schools are projected to serve 58 million meals by the end of this fiscal year in June, an increase from 55 million in fiscal year 2025, Padilla said.
The PED budget request included $2.3 million in a base funding increase, which includes nearly $400,000 for building rent, $1 million in healthcare costs and $244,000 for increased full-time equivalent employee positions. Currently, the department has 361 positions but only has funding for 340, according to Padilla’s presentation.
Her department also requested $500,000 for continued legal costs in the Yazzie/Martinez case.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/PEDLFC121125-1024x659.jpg,,,2025-12-11 16:00:27.148332

Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming called tax subsidy extension a “disaster” and lobbied for a Republican health savings account proposal that also failed. 
The post Senate blocks Obamacare tax subsidy extension, all but ensuring spikes for Wyoming consumers appeared first on WyoFile .","U.S. senators voted down dueling health insurance measures Thursday, including a Democratic proposal to extend Obamacare tax subsidies. That failure all but ensures costs will spike for millions of Americans — including thousands of Wyoming customers who will experience the highest increases in the country. 
Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, the Senate Majority Whip and a retired doctor, has emerged as a spokesperson for the Republicans’ measure and a major foe of the Democratic proposal. He skewered Obamacare as a failure and said the government cannot keep spending money to prop up the unsustainable program. 
“What [the Democrats] are proposing isn’t a serious plan,” Barrasso said on the U.S. Senate floor. “It’s a disaster. Our nation can’t afford it. The American people can’t afford to pay these high costs for health care. We need to focus on the cost of care.”
Wyoming’s other senator, Republican Cynthia Lummis, also voted against subsidy extensions. 
Consumers and health care advocates have been working for months to try to avoid the year-end subsidy expiration. But with signs pointing to their likely end, many have been bracing for the cost increases and scrambling to figure out if they can afford them. 
In Wyoming, a 60-year-old person earning roughly $63,000 is facing a 421% increase in average monthly premium costs on the ACA marketplace, according to reporting by KFF, a nonprofit that writes about health care. No other state equals or tops that percentage. The same individual would face increases of 231%, 166%, 192% and 134% if he or she lived in Montana, Colorado, Utah and Idaho, respectively.

Not all of the 45,000 ACA customers in Wyoming will experience such dramatic rises; costs depend on factors like age and annual income. But health care advocates worry that sticker shock will cause consumers to either find private plans with cheap price tags but lousy coverage or abandon insurance altogether. That could raise costs for hospitals tasked with providing uncompensated care and even for those with insurance.
How we got here
The Affordable Care Act marketplace, created in 2010, is available to people who don’t qualify for Medicaid and don’t have insurance through an employer. 
In 2020, Congress created the Enhanced Premium Tax Credit during the COVID-19 pandemic to make marketplace insurance more affordable. That program provided subsidies that drastically reduced premium costs. For some low-income customers, monthly premiums went to $0.  
The program helped contribute to an all-time low in America’s uninsured rate, health advocates say. But the tax credits were not cheap — and fiscal conservatives argued they were unsustainable. Congress extended the credits in 2022, but did not extend them again this year. A deadlock over the tax credits played a significant role in this fall’s historic government shutdown. 
Expansion would result in a $212 billion deficit on government spending over 10 years, according to a 2020 estimate from the Congressional Budget Office.
On Nov. 12, Congress struck a deal to reopen the government that did not include an extension. But both Democrats and Republicans vowed to continue working on bills to address expiring ACA subsidies, leading to Thursday’s votes. The Democrats’ measure would have extended the subsidies, while Republicans proposed shifting funds to Health Savings Accounts, or HSAs. 
What they are saying 
Senators echoed many of the arguments that have shaped the debate, with Republicans arguing the subsidies were a one-time attempt to fix the broken system of Obamacare, and Democrats arguing the subsidies are necessary to make health care affordable and save lives. 
“This is not a political fight,” said Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York. “This is not a symbolic vote. This is a life and death vote, because people who will lose their health care could face that horrible, horrible end.”
Schumer also stressed that while Democrats were unanimous in their support, Republicans had fractured.

“Democrats are fighting to lower the health care costs for the American people, while Republicans are fighting among themselves,” he said. “By my last count, Republicans are now at nine different health care proposals and counting, and none of them give the American people the one thing they most want — a clean, simple extension of these health care tax credits.”
Barrasso, meanwhile, asserted that Obamacare “robbed the American people of choice as well as affordability,” and Democrats were attempting to use taxpayer dollars to hide the fraud-ridden program’s failures. He also noted that when the subsidies were created in 2021, Democrats characterized them as “temporary, emergency measures because of COVID.
“Now these tax-and-spend radicals who run the Democratic Party want to extend them again, these bonus payments, for another three years,” he said. “And they want to do it with zero reforms.”  
What next?
Wyoming’s health costs have seen additional inflationary pressures this year. In addition to baseline insurance plan cost increases, Mountain Health Co-op stopped offering health plans in Wyoming. That means the state is down to just two providers.
The deadline to enroll in an ACA marketplace plan starting Jan. 1 is Dec. 15. If customers enroll between Dec. 15 and the closing date of Jan. 15, coverage will start Feb. 1. 
Those who do not want to continue ACA policies need to be careful they don’t let them auto-renew, health insurance navigators say. And for people exploring private insurance, experts recommend calling insurance companies directly, fully understanding plan provisions before purchasing and being careful with online plans that look too good to be true.

“In my budget for fiscal year 2027, we will have a pay raise for state employees. Period,” Morrisey told reporters at a news conference Thursday. “That’s going to include teachers, that’s going to include school service personnel, that’s going to include our hard working state police and so many of the people — the correction officers — who are working hard every day to make West Virginia a better place to live, to work and to play.”
Morrisey did not say Thursday what amount of raises he has in mind. His proposed budget will be made public during his state of the state address Jan. 14, 2026, he said. The governor said he’s looking forward to working with Republicans in the Legislature on the legislation.
“I want to try to work collaboratively with our colleagues in the House and Senate,” he said. “But it’s important enough that I wanted to send a message, especially before the holidays, that we’re working hard to help our teachers, our school service personnel, our state police, our corrections officers, people that we know need a pay raise.”
Morrisey proposed teacher pay raises in his first state of the state address earlier this year. During the 2025 session, state lawmakers shot down a bill that would have tied teacher pay to the home values in the counties where they live. 
Earlier this week, Republicans in the House of Delegates laid out their plans for an economic development and job creation focus during the 2026 legislative session, which include a pay raise for the state’s teachers and school service personnel. State Treasurer Larry Pack has also said he’d support legislation to include teacher pay raises.
“We already know that there are people in the House and the Senate that have been talking about the importance of teacher pay raises,” Morrsiey said. “I applaud that. I think it’s great, and let me tell you, I’m looking forward to working with the Legislature on the package that ultimately will go through.”
West Virginia has the lowest teacher pay in the country. State workers, including teachers, have faced increasing health care costs in recent years. The Public Employees Insurance Agency raised rates by 14% for state employees beginning in July. The agency’s finance board recently approved a 3% aggregate pay increase for the 2027 fiscal year, which begins in July 2026.
Morrisey said Thursday there’s more statutory work to do on PEIA, but said he was pleased that the agency’s rate increase was less than it was last year. 
“After three years, I believe, of double-digit premium increases, I think you saw, in part through a lot of the hard work that our team put in place and the PEIA board that the premium increases are limited to 3% this year,” he said. “That’s a big difference.”
Morrisey did not give specific legislative proposals for PEIA, but said he’s open to conversation with lawmakers about the program. 
The legislative session begins Jan. 14, 2026.

HB 197, co-sponsored by Republican Reps. Berny Jacques and Kiyan Michael, is one of the few bills the House has fast-tracked without a Senate companion. It would expand a 2023 law championed by Gov. Ron DeSantis to require all employers — not just public businesses and larger private ones — to use the online database, called E-Verify.
“We may not be able to get it a 100% right, but we have to least take a big bite out of a huge apple,” Michael said in the House Commerce Committee. She recounted how her son was killed in a car crash by a twice-deported migrant, questioning, “If it was your child, would it matter?”
Michael responded to concerns raised by the committee’s Democrats and the AFL, a labor group. Both claimed E-Verify should be tackled by the federal government — not through “patchwork” regulation by the states.
The measure changes existing law, which only mandates public businesses and private companies with more than 25 employees use the online system. This is Jacques’ second attempt to pass the expansion, which cleared the House in 2025 but died in the Senate.
This year, the Senate has yet to file companion legislation.
More than 475,000 small businesses in Florida have fewer than 20 employees, according to a 2025 report by the Small Business Administration. Not counting businesses without employees — of which there are more than 2 million — there are fewer than 518,000 total small businesses.
The move to tamp down illegal immigration comes amid a national conservative push. Between January and September, the Trump administration assisted in the deportation or removal of over 2 million migrants illegally in the country.
Gov. Ron DeSantis has magnified those efforts in Florida, boasting two state-run detention centers and requiring all 67 counties to partner with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
In 2023, then-Sen. Blaise Ingoglia sponsored the law to require private businesses with at least 25 employees to use E-Verify. It was part of a large immigration package that also required Medicaid-accepting hospitals to annually report how many undocumented immigrants they treat, the Phoenix previously reported.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/kiyanmichael-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-12-11 14:58:38.149006

On Tuesday, the group launched its “Eat Safe Fish” mapping tool, which it developed in collaboration with the Ecology Center. The tool collects the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services 2025 “Do Not Eat” and consumption limitation advisories into an interactive map, allowing anglers to examine where contamination has been detected and which species of fish are safe to eat. 
“For many Michiganders, fishing is not just recreation – it’s a tradition, a way of life, a means to put food on the table,” Tony Spaniola, the action network’s co-chair said in a statement. “As thousands of anglers head out to fish Michigan’s lakes, rivers and streams this winter, this tool serves as a critical resource to ensure people know if the fish they are catching are safe to eat. People shouldn’t have to comb through complicated government websites to figure that out.”
While users can search the map by water body, or species of fish, the map can also be segmented by state House, state Senate and congressional district. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In announcing the map tool, the Great Lakes PFAS Action network notes that the state’s “Eat Safe Fish Guides” were dramatically expanded in 2025, with new data showing dangerous levels of PFOS, a type of PFAS, in water bodies and fish across the state. 
PFAS, also known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances or forever chemicals, are a family of substances that break down very slowly. They have been found in people and animals and are present in the water, air and soil in locations across the globe.
These chemicals are used in products like fire fighting foam, nonstick cookware, grease-resistant food packaging, and in stain and water-repellent carpets, upholstery, clothing and other fabrics. They have been tied to several negative health impacts, including increased risk of some forms of cancer, reduced immune system responses, interference with the body’s natural hormones, increased cholesterol levels, and several harmful reproductive and developmental impacts.
The action network notes that the “Do Not Eat” warnings now trigger when PFOS is detected in fish at 50 parts per billion, a significantly lower threshold than the previous 300 parts per billion standard. Consumption limitations have also shifted from 9 parts per billion to 1.5 parts per billion. 
As a result the number of water bodies under a “Do Not Eat” advisory due to PFOS tripled to 102 in the state, while the number of waters with consumption limitations from PFOS totaled 786 across multiple fish species.
The state’s guide includes warnings on other contaminants like PCBs, dioxins and mercury.

In addition to fending off potential efforts to limit his powers, White has called for lawmakers to adopt proposals from a legislative agenda built around three planks: immigration enforcement, government waste and ethics reform.
White spoke to Mississippi Today about how his proposals would work, his feuds with state senators, his potential run for governor (he’s still considering it) and whether he’d like to see lawmakers punish Lane Kiffin.   
This interview, conducted in early December, has been edited for clarity and length. 
Mississippi Today: As far as the bill that you mentioned last year that would have restricted some of your powers, Sen. David Parker obviously will not be back this session. Have you heard any rumblings about whether there’s still an appetite for that among others?
Shad White: I have not, but you know, I didn’t really hear any rumblings that that was going to happen last year, right up until the moment the bill dropped. We discovered that bill on a Friday night. So I would say that the politicians who don’t like me in the auditor’s office don’t make it a habit of warning me beforehand they’re going to do something like that
MT: Moving on to your legislative agenda, you propose making illegal immigration a state crime. Are there any specific gaps in federal enforcement that you’re trying to fill? Are there certain enforcement mechanisms that Immigration and Customs Enforcement isn’t using where you think the state could do better?
White: No, I think ICE is doing a great job, and I think you can see it in Operation Swamp Sweep, which is happening in New Orleans, Louisiana and parts of Mississippi. I think it’s very clear also that ICE is in need of manpower. So, if you just look on social media or see job postings, you see that ICE is actively trying to recruit law enforcement officers.
So, one thing that I think state and local authorities can do to help with ICE’s mission is to sign up to become a task force partner with ICE, which is what my office has done, and I believe several others around the state have done. But two, I think the other thing that state and local authorities can do is assist ICE in enforcing illegal immigration laws if it were illegal under state law.

And so that’s really the point of that plank of the legislative agenda – to make this a violation of state law and therefore give all state and local law enforcement the chance to add to the manpower that ICE already has to make our country safer and to make sure that folks who are here illegally are held accountable.
MT: And do you know if this is being done in any other states right now?
White: I don’t know if it’s being done this session. Most of these ideas that we’ve gotten, we’ve taken from either other states or the federal government. So I believe that illegal immigration is a state crime in other states. 
(Florida, Texas, Oklahoma and Iowa have passed laws to create state-level crimes related to immigration or transporting undocumented immigrants.)
MT: As far as the fee on money sent abroad, you describe the fee that Mississippi should impose as a heavy one. Do you have a specific rate that you’re wanting to propose? And do you have a revenue estimate?
White:  I think that’s the sort of detail that you would hope would get worked out in the legislative process. I think the federal fee that was imposed in the One, Big, Beautiful Bill is a 1% fee. And then the Oklahoma fee changes based on the size of the remittance.
What I would do if I were a legislator, or as this bill gets down to a final negotiation, if it gets that far, I’d look and see what the federal government’s doing, what Oklahoma is doing, and then impose something based on those remittances.
I do think that the primary purpose of placing a fee on those remittances is actually deterrence rather than generating revenue, though generating revenue is a nice secondary benefit. So, whatever the fee is, it needs to be big enough to provide a deterrent against illegal immigration.
Folks need to know if they’re coming here to Mississippi illegally, and they’re going to send money back home, that money is going to be heavily, heavily taxed.
MT: Does the policy proposal have a way to ensure that legal immigrants are not bearing the brunt of those fees?
White: Yeah, I think that Florida had a proposal this past year that would have required some sort of immigration or legal status check when somebody goes there to submit the remittances.
In fact, I’d go maybe even a step further than Florida and say that if you’re a Western Union and someone comes in and they cannot provide documentation that they are here legally, you probably just shouldn’t serve them at all, period.
MT: On the government waste front, I think you say Mississippi spends more than Louisiana, Arkansas, and Iowa on vehicles and travel. What inefficiencies have those states solved that Mississippi hasn’t?
White: What we find in procurement is that states that are doing better than Mississippi have more centralized procurement and they’re benefiting from an economy of scale. So, for example, you’ll see some states that have consolidated lots of back-office functions and lots of back-office procurement processes under a single agency. That’s something that’s been debated here in Mississippi and I think that’s a good idea.
The way you might approach it here in Mississippi as it relates to vehicles is rather than having each individual agency go out and purchase vehicles, you could have agencies coordinate that through DFA (Department of Finance and Administration) and there might be a larger Enterprise solution for the entire state. So maybe it is DFA carrying into a large contract with a rental car company to save money on the maintenance of those vehicles.
Those are the kinds of things that I think are happening in other states and the kinds of things that we should be debating here in Mississippi. The bottom line really for me is that we know we’re inefficient relative to those other states and so we need to do something to make sure that we’re not spending this much.
MT: Not to goad you into picking on any particular agency, although I’ll certainly give you the opportunity if you want to, did your office identify any particular agencies that have the worst inefficiencies with this?
White: Well, what we did when we came up with those estimates is that we looked at the agencies that were highlighted in Project Momentum. And so those were the agencies that are listed there. Most of them are executive agencies with appointed heads, and then in addition to that, there’s the Mississippi Department of Education and DFA.
The reason we looked at those specifically is we wanted to look at agencies with a singular head who could make a decision quickly about whether or not they wanted to change a policy internally as opposed to agencies that were run by a board, where action is sometimes slower. 
Now, the one exception is the Department of Education and we threw them in simply because they spent so much money. It’s such a huge part of the state budget that we felt we couldn’t leave them out of Project Momentum. So, I won’t call out any individual agency, but I will say that the numbers we got show that we’re spending more than other similar states.
MT: Speaking of state revenues, now that some time has passed since Gov. Reeves signed into law a bill setting Mississippi on path to becoming the first state to eliminate an existing income tax, what do you think of the policy?
White: I think it’s going to make Mississippi more competitive.
I was on the phone this morning with a friend who owns a business up in North Mississippi near Corinth in Alcorn County, and they live with the tax disadvantage every single day because they’re losing workers to Tennessee. 
I think that we have to also simultaneously cut fat from government, as this income tax elimination is being phased in, because you don’t want to wake up and have to cut emergency management to the bone. We don’t want to have to wake up and cut law enforcement and get state troopers off the streets. What you want to do is you want to cut unnecessary spending.

And so that’s one of the reasons why we focused on necessary and wasteful spending in the auditor’s office over the last two years – to provide a road map for the Legislature if they want to act on our recommendations. 
MT: You’ve mentioned that you’ve received push back over the years from state agencies in Jackson. As you outline your legislative agenda, are you gearing up for a big fight with state agencies? 
White: I don’t think so, to be honest with you. I think often the conflict is actually with the Legislature and some of the politicians in the Legislature. You know, some of these ideas that we got for cost savings actually came from interviews with people who work at those agencies.
For whatever reason, sometimes when we translate audits into policies and legislative ideas, for some reason, there’s a group of legislators who don’t want to do anything to make Mississippi government more efficient and would rather spend their time fighting the auditor’s office. So I hope that doesn’t happen again this year.
MT: As far as conflicts with individual lawmakers, you said that a similar version of your Ethics and Whistleblower Reward Act bill was killed by lawmakers previously. Which lawmakers were you talking about?
White:  I don’t know which lawmakers killed it because most of the time these bills just die on the calendar. They die due to a deadline. So you have no idea who behind closed doors is opposing it. But I can tell you, I believe that starting two years ago, we proposed this whistleblower reward bill and I was told by Senate leadership that they supported it and, of course, it never passed.
MT: Is this proposal a direct offshoot of the Mississippi welfare/TANF scandal?
White: I would not say that the whistleblower reward statute is a direct offshoot of that. I think it’s an offshoot of all the cases that we’ve had over the course of the last few years, where we would have loved for more people to come forward.
So to give you an example, I had people asking me for years, why don’t you investigate and indict this or that mayor? Well, we don’t take information to a prosecutor unless we have something that is criminal. 
Usually, the thing that stands in the way of us building a good investigation is that we look at documents and documents tell apart the story, but we really need somebody to come forward and testify about what they saw. Whether it’s a kickback or an improper relationship or a bribe or something like that.
That is usually the hold-up that prevents us from taking a set of facts and turning it into a slam-dunk investigation.
MT: Maybe this will get worked out later, but how large would the prize be? 
White: The federal statute says it could be up to 15% of the amount that the government recovers. So if I were in the negotiating room and talking about what number needs to go in the bill, that’s probably where I would start.
MT: You recently said that you will always fight to make the state stronger and safer, whether serving as the auditor or in some other role. Is there any update on your potential run for governor in 2027? 
White: I’ve made no secret that I’m seriously considering running for governor and part of the reason is that I see common-sense ideas like this that need to get done in Mississippi. I can do a few things as auditor to help usher those ideas in, so we can do spending analyses and audits on how taxpayer money is wasted and better uses of those dollars. But ultimately, that’s all you can do as auditor.
You can audit, and you can try to persuade people to adopt your policy recommendations based on the strength of your ideas. We know that other positions, such as the governor’s office, have much greater control. roll over some of these state agencies, and you can make some of these changes directly. You also get a much bigger bully pulpit to argue for the policy solutions that you think are best for the state. And so that’s one of the reasons why I’m considering that.
But I think at this point, more than a year-and-a-half out from an election, my focus is going to be to continue doing my job as an auditor and highlighting these ideas all about how to make the state better, and telling people about them and seeing who is interested in getting on board.
MT: Will you be introducing a legislative proposal to penalize Lane Kiffin? 
White: It’s not off the table. You can quote me on that.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/05023421/3X0A6342-scaled.jpg,,,2025-12-11 14:58:38.149006

(Matthew Perschall for Louisiana Illuminator)LSU could pay its new president and chancellor millions annually under lucrative contracts that include dozens of incentives, some of which have no limits. 
System President Wade Rousse and main campus Chancellor Jim Dalton, both hired last month, will each receive a base salary of $750,000. It’s the same compensation LSU paid William Tate, who was both president and chancellor before leaving for the same job at Rutgers University in New Jersey earlier this year. 
Rousse and Dalton can receive dozens of bonuses on top of their base salaries for meeting certain benchmarks. They include one-time payments as well as bonuses worth hundreds of thousands of dollars that renew annually. Some of the incentives are also duplicated, meaning LSU will pay Rousse and Dalton for meeting the same goals. 
Their contracts also offer financial rewards that can be paid multiple times in the same year with no cap, making it difficult to gauge exactly how much the new leaders will be paid annually. See the full list of incentives below. 
The LSU Board of Supervisors unanimously approved the contracts without questions Thursday. Their approval comes as the university is under austerity measures due to the uncertainty of federal funding from President Donald Trump’s administration. 
Rousse declined to take questions from reporters about the contracts after Thursday’s board meeting. 
LSU Board Chairman Scott Ballard said he would speak with journalists but has not made himself available.
The incentives for Rousse and Dalton are far more extensive than those paid to Tate, which led to criticism at the time from faculty who believed he was profiting off of their labor.

The contracts for LSU’s new leadership include revenue-related benchmarks. 
Rousse can get $75,000 for every year state infrastructure funding for the LSU System reaches $50 million and an additional $25,000 for every $25 million above that. 
In 2025, the Louisiana Legislature sent LSU more than $610 million in the state construction budget, meaning Rousse would have gotten a bonus of $625,000. 
The pair will also each receive a $20,000 bonus when new federal funding exceeds $20 million a year. For every $5 million in new federal funding over $30 million, Rousse will get $40,000, and Dalton will receive $20,000. 
One-time incentives include $50,000 for Rousse for every LSU System school that achieves a 4% increase in its four-year graduation rate. Dalton will receive $100,000 when LSU’s Baton Rouge campus hits that same threshold. 
Dalton and Rousse will also see bonuses if there is a decrease in the disparity between LSU faculty pay and that of peer universities. Last year, faculty pay at LSU was more than 16% lower than other land grant institutions. 
They will also receive $25,000 each when LSU’s accreditor approves its new organizational structure. LSU is currently in the beginning stages of a reorganization which will make the system’s research-intensive campuses part of the flagship. This is designed to boost LSU’s research numbers to attain membership in the Association of American Universities, a goal Tate first set to place LSU among the top research universities. 
Both men will also receive $100,000 each when:

 LSU achieves a Top 50 ranking among public universities; 
 an LSU System institution is designated as a National Cancer Institute-Designated Cancer Center; 
 one of its campuses receives a National Institutes of Health Clinical Translational Science Award; and 
 a school secures a federally funded research and development center or a field site of a national laboratory. 

Several other incentive payments for Rousse and Dalton are related to pursuing Association of American Universities membership. 
For example, Dalton will receive a $20,000 bonus for every 20 doctoral degrees awarded above the current threshold, granted the degrees are counted within the association’s membership metrics. Rousse will receive $20,000 for every 20 doctoral degrees any LSU System school awards, regardless of whether they count toward membership. 
Dalton can also receive $20,000 for each faculty member recruited who is a member of the National Academies of Science, Engineering or Medicine and $10,000 for the recruitment of every faculty member with certain prestigious awards, fellowships or memberships the association tracks. 
Dalton can also receive six repeatable bonuses totalling hundreds of thousands of dollars for increasing LSU’s research spending. 
Both leaders would also get $200,000 each for staying on the job all five years of their contracts. 
The pair’s contracts also include other standard perks for university leadership, including the use of homes the LSU Foundation owns, a $15,000 annual vehicle allowance and one private membership club each. 
Dalton’s contract stipulates he will receive a tenured full professorship in LSU’s Department of Chemistry, which he will retain even if he is fired as president. 
Rousse’s contract states he will receive a faculty position in the economics department, though his rank and tenure status will not be determined until he is no longer president. This discrepancy is likely because Dalton ascended through the tenured faculty ranks before becoming an administrator, while Rousse did not. 
This is a developing story

April McClain Delaney (D-6th) in the Democratic primary for his former congressional seat. (File photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)David Trone, the former three-term congressman who gave up his Western Maryland seat last year for an unsuccessful bid for U.S. Senate, announced Thursday he is running for his old job.
Trone’s announcement sets up a Democratic primary against his successor, Rep. April McClain Delaney (D-6th), who filed for reelection in October and has been steadily working to amass party endorsements since then. It also sets up a primary between two well-funded Democrats in one of the least-Democrat-friendly congressional districts in the state.
McClain Delaney said Thursday that she will not “‘step aside’ so he [Trone] can have his old office back after he abandoned the district to run and lose for Senate.”
The campaign bid is a sharp reversal from a year ago for the 70-year old philanthropist and owner of natioal alcohol retailer Total Wine & More, who sank $60 million of his own money into an unsuccessful Democratic primary for Senate against Angela Alsobrooks. She won the primary handily, by a 53% to 43% margin, before going on to win the seat in the general election.
Trone on Thursday made criticism of President Donald Trump a centerpiece of the video announcing his run for the Democratic nomination in the 6th District.
“Donald Trump is swinging a wrecking ball at our country and our democracy. In Congress, I confronted him head-on — voting twice to impeach him and backing reforms to rein in his abuse of power,” Trone said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“I’ve fought politicians who use their office for self-interest, defended women’s access to abortion, and have been unequivocal in my support of immigrant families in the face of Republican attacks,” his video said. “We can’t have any Democrats in Congress siding with Trump and MAGA Republicans. This is the moment to rise and fight. And that’s why I’m running.”
Trone held the 6th District seat from 2019-2025. The district stretches from upper  Montgomery County to Western Maryland. It’s a district hard hit this spring by flooding. The federal government has denied requests for emergency aid.
In November, it appeared as though Trone had started polling in his old district.
Trone’s Senate bid opened the door for Delaney — a former Commerce Department official and the wife of John Delaney, who held the same seat for three terms before Trone. She won the 6th District seat in 2024 and filed for re-election in October.
McClain Delaney has the endorsement of every Democrat in the state’s congressional delegation, Gov. Wes Moore and Lt. Gov. Aruna Miller, and Attorney General Anthony Brown, among others.
In a video Thursday, Delaney responded to Trone’s focus on Trump by saying Trone “has the arrogance of a Trump” for treating the 6th District seat like “a consolation prize.”
“On behalf of my district, I stand up to bullies. That’s why I’ll continue to take on Trump’s assault on our government workers, defend our diverse community, protect choice and women’s reproductive rights, and work against inflation-creating tariffs,” she said, noting that she is one of just two women in the state’s congressional delegation, with Alsobrooks.
Trone’s announcement comes as Gov. Wes Wes Moore (D) and some Democratic lawmakers are considering a midcycle revamping of the state’s eight congressional districts.
Moore said he wants to ensure the maps are fair. The effort, however, appears focused on making the state’s 1st Congressional District — held by Rep. Andy Harris — more competitive for a Democratic Party challenge. Harris is the only Republican congressman from Maryland.
Moore’s focus on the redraw comes as other states — blue and red — are engaging in similar hyper-partisan redistricting efforts.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/David-Trone-12-11-2024-newsletter-1024x707.jpg,,,2025-12-11 18:58:04.510208

(Photo courtesy of GE Vernova)A Greenville factory received a shout out recently in the White House as the Trump administration touted a trillion-dollar investment from Saudi Arabia. But the impressive numbers did not signify new promises for the Palmetto State.
GE Vernova, a General Electric spinoff, has assembled massive, gas-fired turbines in South Carolina’s Upstate for nearly 60 years.
The company will ship eight of those turbines to Saudi Arabia as part of a $14.2 billion deal that it inked during President Donald Trump’s visit to the country in May.
That deal was part of a larger, $600 billion U.S. investment commitment by the Saudis.
When Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman visited the White House last month, he added $400 billion to the country’s commitment, with spending spanning nuclear energy, critical minerals, tanks and F-35 fighter jets. Historically, Israel was the only country in the Middle East allowed to buy the U.S.-made jets.
“You’re saying to me now that the $600 billion will be $1 trillion?” Trump said to the prince. “Good. I like that very much.”
With a room full of people in the Oval Office, Trump then called on a GE Vernova executive.
“Could you say a few words about what you’re seeing on the job front … and also how we’ve been helped by the Saudis in terms of the kind of investment they’ve made? Please,” Trump said to David Broomell, the company’s manufacturing technology manager.
“Most certainly,” Broomell said, then laid out the company’s own investments amid increased demand for energy.
Of the more than $750 million the company is investing in its United States factories, almost $300 million is specifically for gas-plant parts, he said.
He summed up the total investment as “resulting in over 500 pieces of new equipment being installed in the Greenville, South Carolina facility” and roughly 1,800 jobs companywide.
The Greenville plant is just one beneficiary. The company has 18 locations in the United States and more than 45 overseas, including Saudi Arabia.
“We’re partnering with local communities to build the skill set that’s required to meet these capacity needs. So that talent pipeline is incredibly important. So it’s real jobs in the manufacturing space,” Broomell said in conclusion, before Trump told him to “say hello to everybody” in South Carolina.
The company declined to speak in further detail with the SC Daily Gazette about the numbers.
But according to a company announcement in January, Greenville is in line for at least $160 million of the total GE investment. Plans call for the Upstate plant to triple its output of natural gas turbines to 80 units annually for use in power plants, data centers and at a growing number of terminals that liquefy natural gas for export to other countries.
As part of that announcement, GE Vernova also pledged to hire 650 new workers at the Greenville plant.
The company pledged to spend an additional $100 million collectively on plants in New York, New Jersey and Maine.
Six decades in SC
The expansion is just the company’s latest investment in the Palmetto State.
GE has been a household name in South Carolina for some time. It announced its first plant — the Greenville facility — in 1967. The original building was 300,000 square feet and employed 500 people.
Today, the factory spans 1.55 million square feet and GE Vernova is the county’s second largest manufacturing employer, behind Michelin.
The company has more than 2,500 workers in the state.
It hires a lot of students from Greenville’s technical college, according to Max Stewart, CEO of the county’s economic development organization. Employees can make upwards of $30 per hour — $5 to $6 more than the county average wage.
“It’s definitely a great opportunity for people if they’re looking to do welding and they want to work in manufacturing,” Stewart said. “It’s a great company to work for.”
In nearby Piedmont, GE Aviation makes high-pressure turbine blades for commercial aircraft engines sold to Boeing.
And GE’s health care business in Florence employs about 400 workers assembling components for medical imaging equipment.
The company once had a factory near Ladson that made steam turbine generators for the nuclear power industry. The facility once employed as many as 1,200 people. But by the early 1980s, the nuclear boom went bust in the United States, and the plant closed.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ge_vernova_greenville-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-11 14:58:38.149006

Franklin, 44, surrendered to the Phillips County Sheriff’s Office on Dec. 5 after being informed that State Police had obtained an arrest warrant for him on charges of felony attempt to evade and defeat taxes, a Class C felony, ASP said in a press release Thursday.
Franklin was charged in June with four counts of failure to pay or file a tax return, a Class D felony. He was still mayor at the time, but was removed from office by court order on July 7.
Franklin’s arrests stem from an investigation by the ASP Special Investigations Unit that began in June 2024 at the request of First Judicial District Prosecuting Attorney Todd Murray based on concerns about the mayor’s tax filings. Investigators determined that Franklin had not filed any state tax returns for four of the past five years.
Franklin was released on his own recognizance after his latest arrest and given a court date of Jan. 5, according to the ASP news release.

The Massachusetts Municipal Association on Thursday offered up a package of steps it wants Beacon Hill to take in support of strained city and town hall finances, including a gargantuan increase in local aid and reforms to loosen — but not eliminate — the property tax cap law known as Proposition 2½.  
The 10-page report formalizes a major request for action on behalf of all 351 cities and towns, adding more pressure on the Legislature to come to the rescue of their municipal counterparts and constituents. 
But local officials are likely to face an uphill climb, especially as state government navigates an increasingly precarious budget cycle of its own fueled in part by federal funding cuts. 
The report pitched the need as “an issue of competitiveness and affordability,” featuring — in bold — the two buzzwords that state officials seem to mention in virtually every speech these days. 
“This is an urgent issue not only for local taxpayers, but also for the Commonwealth as a whole,” authors wrote. “Ultimately, the success of Massachusetts depends on the fiscal strength of its cities and towns. When municipalities are stable and resilient, the Commonwealth is better positioned to grow, innovate, and support its residents.” 
In October, the MMA published a report warning that a combination of factors over the years have riddled city and town finances with deep cracks. At the time, MMA executive director Adam Chapdelaine said local leaders were at the limit of what they could manage on their own, and that any additional trimming would amount to “cutting bone.” 
Now, Chapdelaine said in an interview, municipalities need the state to empower them with “financial flexibility to be able to close the structural gap.” 
A primary factor MMA identified behind the growing strain is the state’s approach to unrestricted general government aid, an important funding stream often referred to as UGGA. Beacon Hill pared back UGGA during the Great Recession, and modest increases since then have not kept up with cost growth. 
As a result, municipalities have had to lean much more heavily on property taxes.  
Communities collected about 11.5 percent as much from unrestricted local aid as all local taxes in fiscal 2007, according to MMA’s analysis. By fiscal 2024, that ratio dropped by more than half to 5.4 percent. 
The group’s new report calls on the Legislature to approve a $351 million increase in UGGA, a massive sum that would represent a more than 26 percent jump over current levels. (The state fiscal 2026 budget featured roughly $15 million more in UGGA than the prior year.) 
That shift, the MMA argues, would push the balance of state aid and local taxes closer to the historic norm. 
Chapdelaine said the requested infusion might need to be deployed over multiple years given its size, and he argued the state should find a way to make it work despite headaches over how to navigate federal funding cuts. 
“We fully acknowledge how robust a $351 million investment would be in any context, never mind the context we’re currently operating in, with an uncertain financial picture for the state,” he said. “But at the same time, we feel like suggesting to go back to a [state aid to local tax] ratio that really only meets in the middle from where the ratio was before the Great Recession still underscores a modesty in [the request].” 
MMA also wants Beacon Hill to revisit the voter-approved law known as Proposition 2½, which limits property tax levy increases to no more than 2.5 percent per year unless voters approve an override. 
The report calls on lawmakers to loosen some of the measure’s strictest limits, perhaps by allowing a single vote that would phase in multiple years of overrides, or by allowing local referenda to raise the 2.5 percent levy limit temporarily or permanently. 
Chapdelaine stressed that the organization is “absolutely not proposing a repeal” of Proposition 2½, and that MMA wants to keep higher tax increases tied to municipal ballot questions. 
“That’s the trust lever that’s built into Prop 2½  that works so well,” he said. “Whatever the taxation level is that a local government leader wants to pursue, historically, has been tied to a ballot question. We’re proposing that there may be some changes made to those levers, or the mechanics of the levers, but the lever remains in place.” 
The group also suggested it’s worthwhile to give communities more power to shift the balance of commercial, industrial, and residential property tax rates.  
Those limits are at the heart of a long-running feud between Mayor Michelle Wu in Boston and Senate Democrats, including Boston Sens. Nick Collins and Will Brownsberger. 
Chapdelaine said only a few communities might need to rebalance their tax splits, but in those that rely heavily on commercial tax bases like Boston and Cambridge, local leaders would benefit from more flexibility to respond to “large swings in valuations” without needing to embark on the arduous home-rule petition process. 
Other ideas MMA backed include authorizing real estate transfer fees, or additional taxes charged to high-value property transactions with revenue directed to affordable housing, and greenlighting new local-option tax increases. 
Gov. Maura Healey has sought to grant that additional taxation authority through a bill she dubbed the “Municipal Empowerment Act,” but legislative leaders do not seem interested. 
Chapdelaine said state leaders have “made no commitments” on the report’s recommendations during preliminary conversations with MMA. 
“[They] have acknowledged the reality of the challenges facing local government, while also acknowledging the serious financial challenges facing state government,” he said.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/berk2.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-11 14:58:38.149006

But, it was above last September’s 3.7%. It’s also a tenth-of-a-percent increase from August’s 4.0% unemployment rate.
That’s according to the latest report from the state Department of Labor & Industry, which was delayed because of complications from the federal government shutdown that began in early October.
September marked the 29th month in a row that Pennsylvania’s unemployment remained below the national average.
Total nonfarm jobs were up 5,800 to 6,252,900 in September. The largest increase in jobs across industry sectors were in education and health services.

October 2025 unemployment data will not be released by the federal government because of data collection issues during the shutdown, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. Figures for November, 2025 will be released in January, 2026.
A job openings report released earlier this week by the U.S. Labor Department saw little change from September to October, with 7.7 million available jobs and 1.9 million layoffs.

(Photo courtesy of University of West Florida)The University of West Florida will add a center focused on civics funded by the federal government, putting it in order with some other state universities. 
Some trustees expressed concern about the name of the center, the Academy of American Civic Republican Center, saying it would trigger criticisms of the institutional neutrality policy the board passed during the same meeting.
The center is funded by a $1.55 million grant from the U.S. Department of Education for the first three years. After that, the university hopes private giving and state appropriations will carry the center into the future. 
The center will serve the university and “the larger community, especially in the efforts to increase civic knowledge in the Northwest Florida region and to celebrate and honor of the 250th anniversary of America’s founding,” according to board documents. 
The university’s application to the federal government said the project “will enhance the output and outcomes of civic education for K-12 educators and students, engage UWF students in the study of the American Founding principles, foster public civic education.” By the three-year mark, the center plans to establish an undergraduate degree in American Studies and/or Statesmanship and Republicanism.
“I just don’t want to get cart before the horse and do something that might signal we’re not institutionally neutral,” Heather Riddell, the Faculty Senate representative on the board, said, calling for a more neutral name.
University administrators and other trustees insisted there is no connection between the name of the center and the Republican Party.
“I love this proposal. I’ve read it, I’ve looked at it. It’s a fantastic proposal. I think the name is very appropriate. I think it’s an unfortunate aspect of the political correctness today that people want words to mean things that they do not mean,” Adam Kissel said. 
Kissel, a West Virginia resident, was rejected for confirmation by the GOP-supermajority Florida Senate last session after legislators expressed concern about his stance on privatizing public schools and other matters, although Gov. Ron DeSantis reappointed him following the session.
“It would be a pretty damning indictment of our K-12 civic education to imagine that people don’t even understand a pretty fundamental civics term. I would be sad to find out if that were true, although it may actually be true,” Kissel said. 
The university is searching for a director of the center. By the fall of 2026, it plans to host conferences and virtual events. The center will provide civics training to about 60 K-12 teachers annually, too. 
“I’m not a member of either party, and listening to [Riddell’s] comments, I kind of agree with the perception that that might create. But, however, I can certainly tell that if there was a vote taken today to remove that word, it wouldn’t pass and I would hate to see this not go through,” outgoing trustee Dick Baker said. 
DeSantis earlier this year told UWF to “buckle up” and indicated changes were coming after former president Martha Saunders resigned. Now, former Education Commissioner Manny Diaz Jr. is interim president and the sole finalist to be the permanent president.
Outgoing trustee Alonzie Scott floated the idea that a lawsuit could be filed against the university over the name of the center. 
More established centers focused on civics stand at University of Florida (Hamilton Center for Classical and Civic Education), Florida International University (Adam Smith Center for Economic Freedom), and Florida State University (Institute for Governance & Civics).

Neutral, institutionally
The school also voted to approve an institutional neutrality statement, similar to the University of Florida‘s commitment last week.
“Universities play a unique social and cultural role by cultivating, hosting, and teaching both established wisdom and leading thought. In this role, UWF facilitates freedom of academic inquiry and of expression on any subject, which may challenge prevailing social norms, public policies, and institutional practices; however, as an institution devoted to the intellectual pursuit and communication of truth, the university itself takes no official position on public controversies outside its regular activities so as not to undermine the freedom of thought and expression necessary for that Endeavor,” the policy states in part. 
“At UWF, dissent and critique belong to the individual faculty member or the individual student. While the university and its academic and administrative units are the settings in which these critiques can flourish, neither the university nor any of its component parts speaks with a single voice or requires one on public controversies,” the policy says. 
“As a public university, UWF may advocate on issues directly related to its educational mission and operational capacity. The university reserves the right to take positions when its core functions of teaching, research, and service are directly threatened.”",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/UWF_6551-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-11 14:58:38.149006

Employees of businesses included in the program will have access to discounted tuition rates for certain online degree programs, individual support and “streamlined credit evaluation,” according to the release. Briar Cliff University states on its PTA program website programs in nursing, business, social work and criminal justice are being offered to employees of partner organizations.
The tuition advantage program has two options for employer partners listed on its website — the first has employees cover their tuition costs and the second has the business paying their workers’ tuition and fees.
For Crittenton Center employees, the release stated the nonprofit will host “on-site informational sessions” and share information with interested parties.
Both the nonprofit and university are reaffirming their “dedication to strengthening the local workforce, building opportunity, and ensuring that those who care for our community have access to the tools and education they need to thrive” through this new partnership and program, according to the release.
“Continued learning strengthens not only our workforce, but the quality of care and support we provide every day,” said Crittenton Center CEO Kim Scorza in the release. “This partnership with Briar Cliff University allows us to invest directly in our team—giving them meaningful, affordable pathways to grow in their careers.”

Dec. 11, 2025. | Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance. Kyle Kaminski, an offender success administration/legislative liaison for the Michigan Department of Corrections, presented the department’s new policy for delivering legal mail to incarcerated individuals at a House Corrections and Judiciary Subcommittee meeting on Thursday. 
The policy, announced on Monday, now instructs correctional officers to open legal or confidential mail — most commonly used for lawyers and legal organizations to communicate with incarcerated individuals — in front of the recipient, photocopy the contents, and shred the originals. It is an attempt to reduce drug smuggling, which the department said has been increasing through the use of legal mail, usually on tainted paper or envelopes. 
“This is happening every week at the facilities,” Kaminski told the committee. 
Brad Warner, an intake and communications specialist at Humanity for Prisoners, disputed this in his testimony to the subcommittee, arguing that while the issue of drugs in prisons is legitimate, legal mail is not the primary source. 
“The uncomfortable truth is that the vast majority of contraband walks right through the front gate, carried by staff,” he said. “Shredding legal mail is just a cheap way to look busy without writing the check for what actually works.”
Brad Warner, an Intake and Communications Specialist at Humanity for Prisoners, argued against a new Michigan Department of Corrections policy for handling legal mail. Dec. 11, 2025. | Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance.
Kaminski, however, called those accusations against correctional officers “unfounded,” and said that the avenue of legal mail for introducing contraband is “very real.” 
But even greater concerns around privacy and confidentiality for incarcerated individuals and their lawyers have been raised. 
“MDOC’s new policy goes much further than just opening privileged mail out of the presence of an incarcerated person to check for contraband,” ACLU of Michigan senior staff attorney Phil Mayor wrote in a statement to Michigan Advance.
“Attorney-client privilege is a fundamental hallmark of our legal system that will be put in certain jeopardy if MDOC’s new policy is allowed to stand,” Mayor continued. “There is no guarantee whatsoever that attorney-client privilege will be maintained when prison officials are allowed to control every piece of mail as it is opened and shredded.”
He added that policies like this would prevent attorneys from sending self-addressed stamped envelopes or postcards, posing “a major barrier to the First Amendment right of attorneys and their incarcerated clients to communicate with each other.”
Kaminski noted in his testimony that because special handling is intended to maintain confidentiality, the agency has had greater challenges in combatting it as a method of drug smuggling.  
But he added that, due to the confidential nature of the mail, correctional officers would not be scrutinizing mail in-depth, only identifying potential drugs by immediate feel, sight, or smell. 
“Because of the confidential nature of this type of mail, staff cannot scrutinize it in the same way that they can scrutinize other things coming into the facilities,” he said. “We can open it in the presence of the prisoner, and we can look for obvious contraband. But once we’ve done that, we cannot read or skim it. We cannot spend extra time with that document. We have to hand it over to the recipient.”
In response to a question from subcommittee chair Rep. Bradley Slagh (R-Zeeland), Kaminski added that, though shredding of original documents might mean fewer prosecutions for potential drug smuggling, it would also reduce the amount of illicit drugs that made it to recipients of the mail.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC_3349-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-11 13:57:09.352398

Free.,US Senate hits stalemate on solution to spiraling health insurance costs,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-hits-stalemate-solution-spiraling-health-insurance-costs,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate in long-anticipated votes failed to advance legislation Thursday that would have addressed the rising cost of health insurance, leaving lawmakers deadlocked on how to curb a surge in premiums expected next year. Senators voted 51-48 on a Republican bill co-sponsored by Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy and Idaho Sen. Mike Crapo that would have provided funding through Health Savings Accounts for some ACA marketplace enrollees during 2026 and 2027. They then voted 51-48 on a measure from Democrats that would have extended enhanced tax credits for people who purchase their health insurance from the Affordable Care Act Marketplace for three years. A group of Senate Democrats in November agreed to end a government shutdown of historic length in exchange for a commitment by Republicans to hold a vote on extending the enhanced subsidies.Neither bill received the 60 votes needed to advance under the Senate’s legislative filibuster rule. 
 







 Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., criticized the ACA marketplace and the subsidies for leading to large increases in the costs of health insurance. “Under Democrats’ plan insurance premiums will continue to spiral, American taxpayers will find themselves on the hook for ever-increasing subsidy payments,” Thune said. “And don’t think that all those payments are going to go to vulnerable Americans.”Thune argued Democrats' bill was only an extension of the “status quo” of a “failed, flawed, fraud program that is increasing costs at three times the rate of inflation. Thune said the Republican bill from Cassidy and Crapo would “help individuals to meet their out-of-pocket costs and for many individuals who don’t use their insurance or who barely use it, it would allow them to save for health care expenses down the road.”Schumer calls GOP plan ‘mean and cruel’Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the three-year extension bill was the only option to avoid a spike in costs for people enrolled in ACA marketplace plans. “By my last count, Republicans are now at nine different health care proposals and counting. And none of them give the American people the one thing they most want — a clean, simple extension of these health care tax credits,” Schumer said. “But our bill does extend these credits cleanly and simply and it’s time for Republicans to join us.”

Schumer referred to the Cassidy-Crapo proposals as “stingy” as well as “mean and cruel.”“Under the Republican plan, the big idea is essentially to hand people about $80 a month and wish them good luck,” Schumer said. “And even to qualify for that check, listen to how bad this is, Americans would be forced onto bare-bones bronze plans with sky-high deductibles; $7,000 or $10,000 for an individual, tens of thousands for a couple.”Health Savings Accounts in GOP planThe Cassidy-Crapo bill would have the Department of Health and Human Services deposit money into Health Savings Accounts for people enrolled in bronze or catastrophic health insurance plans purchased on the ACA marketplace in 2026 or 2027, according to a summary of the bill. Health Savings Accounts are tax-advantaged savings accounts that consumers can use to pay for medical expenses that are not otherwise reimbursed. They are not health insurance products.ACA marketplace enrollees who select a bronze or catastrophic plan and make up to 700% of the federal poverty level would receive $1,000 annually if they are between the ages of 18 and 49 and $1,500 per year if they are between the ages of 50 and 64. That would set a threshold of $109,550 in annual income for one person, or $225,050 for a family of four, according to the 2025 federal poverty guidelines. The numbers are somewhat higher for residents of Alaska and Hawaii.  The funding could not go toward abortion access or gender transitions, according to the Republican bill summary. Bipartisan bills in the HouseMembers of Congress have introduced several other health care proposals, including two bipartisan bills in the House that would extend the enhanced ACA marketplace tax credits for at least another year with some modifications. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has been reluctant to bring either bipartisan bill up for a floor vote, though he may not have the option if a discharge petition filed earlier this week garners the 218 signatures needed. Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick wrote in a statement the legislation represents a “solution that can actually pass—not a political messaging exercise.”
 







 “This bill delivers the urgent help families need now, while giving Congress the runway to keep improving our healthcare system for the long term,” Fitzpatrick wrote. “Responsible governance means securing 80 percent of what families need today, rather than risking 100 percent of nothing tomorrow.”But Johnson said Wednesday that he will put a package of bills on the House floor next week that he believes “​​will actually reduce premiums for 100% of Americans who are on health insurance.” Details of those bills have not been disclosed.Thune told reporters that if ""somebody is successful in getting a discharge petition and a bill out of the House, obviously we'll take a look at it. But at the moment, you know, we're focused on the action here in the Senate, which is the side-by-side vote we're going to have later today."" Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski said lawmakers can find a compromise on health care by next week “if we believe it is possible.”Political costsThe issue of affordability and rising health care costs is likely to be central to the November midterm elections, where Democrats hope to flip the House from red to blue and gain additional seats in the Senate. The Democratic National Committee isn’t waiting to begin those campaigns, placing digital ads in the hometown newspapers of several Republicans up for reelection next year, including Maine’s Susan Collins and Ohio’s Jon Husted. “Today’s Senate vote to extend the ACA tax credits could be the difference between life and death for many Americans,” DNC Chair Ken Martin said in a press release. “Over 20 million Americans will see their health care premiums skyrocket next year if Susan Collins, John Cornyn, Jon Husted, and Dan Sullivan do not stand with working families and vote to extend these lifesaving credits.”Shauneen Miranda contributed to this report.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-12-11 13:57:09.352398

Then, there’s Jamie’s scans every six months and her thyroid medication…
The Wrights juggle the above costs with the assistance of Ipsencares (which pays for the shot’s copay) and credit cards. But there’s one number that they haven’t squared away: $1,792. That’s their projected monthly insurance premium in 2026 if Congress doesn’t extend enhanced marketplace tax credits.

That’s 265% more than their current $490 monthly premium, which is significantly reduced by federal tax credits.
“We’re fortunate,” said Carrie, noting they have adult children. “We only have the two of us to support, versus a family. But $1,792 is going to mean some significant changes … not just to our lifestyle, but the necessities.” 
The Wrights, who live in Allegheny County, are just two of the roughly 500,000 Pennsylvanians who rely on insurance plans sold through Pennie, the state’s affordable care act marketplace. The tax credits used to reduce premium costs are due to expire at the end of the year, and costs are expected to more than double statewide on average if Congress can’t decide on a path forward. 
“We know that these subsidies really make health insurance affordable for cancer patients and their families,” said Donna Greco, the government relations director for Pennsylvania’s American Cancer Society chapter. 
“It really is a matter of life and death knowing how critical having health insurance coverage is in a person’s ability to prevent, detect, treat and survive cancer,” she added.
Though several plans have been floated, none are expected to cross the finish line in Congress. 
“It ain’t about political affiliation, because it doesn’t matter. It’s hurting people across the board,” said Jamie. “It doesn’t matter who has the plan, but they need to fix this now … do an extension, do whatever you’ve got to do. Fix the problem right now and then come up with a plan.”

The McKeesport couple made roughly $81,000 last year and don’t qualify for coverage through their respective jobs. Carrie, 54, works for a local eye doctor while Jamie, 60, installs trim with a window and door company. 
Though he strives to work a full-time schedule, Jamie often can’t. 
The tumor-suppressing shot every 28 days “takes him out,” in the words of Carrie, and requires a few days of recovery time. One of his medications impacts his blood pressure, a danger if he gets light headed while working on scaffolding. 
But he maintains that he’ll work more hours “or whatever I need to do … to figure this out.” 
“It’s not that his work ethic is bad,” said Carrie. “His capability to work is not the same.” 
“I still get it done,” he responded.
“But that’s the thing — when he should be staying at home to take care of himself, he can’t,” said Carrie. 










“If I need to pull more hours, or whatever I need to do, I’m going to figure this out … we have to survive.”

Doctors diagnosed Jamie with neuroendocrine tumors in 2021, a type of slow-growth cancer that spreads throughout the body. At one point, he had more than 80 tumors, but cut that number by 50 after an individualized treatment through a clinical trial at the National Institutes of Health in 2023. 
“One of the things with this particular cancer, even though it’s slow growth, it’ll change. It’s always in your body and you can’t get rid of it,” said Jamie. “When you have higher numbers, the chance of metastasizing and jumping to another organ or jumping to the bone or somewhere else increases.”
Shortly after the 2023 clinical trial, when Jamie could no longer work full time and money got tight, they learned about the tax credits through Pennie.
“That tax credit has helped. Oh my God has it helped,” said Carrie. 
Most ACA marketplace users can’t afford potential increases, poll shows

Transitioning to a lower-quality or lower-premium plan wouldn’t meet their needs, the Wrights said, and might just come with even higher deductibles or copays. 
“We get some pretty good care, right now. Having cancer, and a lot of the things that I have to go through, you have to be conscious about what’s important. And that care is important,” said Jamie. 
Carrie worried about other people opting out of coverage, driving up prices for people like them who can’t afford to go without. 
“If those people drop their insurance, we can’t. Cancer says you have to have insurance. And if all of those hundreds of thousands or millions of other people lose their insurance or drop it — what’s that going to do to our premiums?” Carrie asked. 
The Philadelphia Inquirer reports that 30,000 residents have dropped their coverage ahead of the end-of-year deadline. 
She also wondered if the tumor-suppressing shot, which is made in France, would be subject to future tariffs and potentially double in price.
But the couple is still active at home, when possible. Jamie built a cat shed with heat lamps for the neighborhood’s cats — eight of whom now live indoors with the Wrights as it gets colder.
In the warmer months, they distribute popsicles to children in the community. These children brought them Simba, a cat whose “eyes were glued shut” with an infection, as Carrie documents on her Facebook page and TikTok where she fundraises for feline vet care. 
“I always joke that we’re hashtag cats and kids. Because we have all the neighborhood strays,” said Carrie. 
But the Wrights acknowledge their life will change if the credits expire. 
 On The Hill

Two proposals in the U.S. Senate appear likely to fail Thursday: a Democratic plan to extend tax credits for three years — with an $83 billion deficit increase over the next decade — and a Republican alternative that would provide up to $1,500 annually for certain purchasers and end the subsidies. 
A vote is expected in the U.S. House next week, but specifics remain elusive. The narrow 220-213 GOP majority means that every member would have to support the measure, even before moving to the Senate.

The projected premium increase could hurt swing district Republicans, including those in Pennsylvania, as reported by AP. 
Both Congressman Ryan Mackenzie in Lehigh Valley’s 7th District and Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick in Bucks County’s 1st District — who narrowly won their districts in 2024 — have been part of bipartisan coalitions pitching alternatives temporarily extending credits.
The ever-optimistic Wrights use credit cards to pay their medical expenses sparingly for now, but Carrie worried they might be facing a “mountain of debt” in the future. Lawyers told them that disability wouldn’t be an option until Jamie had been out of work for at least six months.
“We’re going to figure it out,” said Jamie. “But there’s a lot of people that I’ve talked to … not only are they getting punched in the face with cancer, then they got to deal with this mess.” 
“They should be worrying about getting themselves better, not how they’re going to pay for it,” added Carrie.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_9355-copy-1024x896.jpeg,,,2025-12-11 12:58:47.053223

Lo que debe saber.,"Traducción por Jorge Alatrista, Identidad Latina Multimedia.

Read this story in English.
Aproximadamente 36,000 residentes de Connecticut corren el riesgo de perder el acceso a los beneficios de cupones de alimentos debido a los nuevos requisitos de elegibilidad descritos en un proyecto de ley federal reciente.
Los recortes a la asistencia alimentaria en la Ley H.R. 1, la ley “One Big Beautiful Bill”, afectarán directamente a miles de inmigrantes, jóvenes adultos, veteranos y personas sin hogar debido a los nuevos y más estrictos requisitos laborales y otros cambios. Se espera que pierdan la cobertura entre el 1 de diciembre y el 31 de marzo.
Las personas afectadas representan aproximadamente el 10% de los residentes del estado que reciben beneficios a través del Programa Federal de Asistencia Nutricional Suplementaria (SNAP).
“Vamos a tener mucha gente sin acceso a los alimentos que necesitan para mantenerse saludables”, dijo Sara Parker McKernan, defensora de políticas de New Haven Legal Assistance. “La gente va a comer con la mayor frugalidad posible, lo que significa que podrán comprar muchos alimentos muy baratos porque ya no cuentan con la ventaja del SNAP”.
Esto es lo que sucede con los cambios a la asistencia alimentaria bajo el proyecto de ley.
¿A quiénes afectan los cambios?
La H.R. 1 impone por primera vez un requisito de trabajo para los adultos de 55 a 64 años y los padres con hijos mayores de 14 años. Elimina las exenciones para veteranos, personas sin hogar y jóvenes que recientemente superaron la edad límite de acogida; exenciones que se añadieron en una legislación bipartidista en 2023, según un análisis del Centro de Políticas y Prioridades Presupuestarias. Los beneficiarios ahora deben documentar 20 horas de trabajo semanales, participar en un conjunto limitado de actividades laborales o demostrar que cumplen los requisitos para otra exención.
El proyecto de ley también elimina la elegibilidad de muchos inmigrantes que viven legalmente en EE. UU. y que han recibido protección humanitaria del gobierno federal, incluyendo refugiados, personas a las que se les ha concedido asilo y ciertas sobrevivientes de violencia doméstica y trata de personas.
“Hablamos de personas que han trabajado físicamente toda su vida y, de repente, llegan a un punto en que sus cuerpos se agotan y ya no pueden competir con trabajadores más jóvenes”, dijo McKernan. “Hablamos de personas que han criado a sus hijos o nietos y ahora tienen una casa vacía y ningún historial laboral. Puede que tengan hijos mayores de 14 años, pero no pueden ejercer el rol de cuidadores y recibir SNAP”.
¿Qué dicen los defensores?
A los defensores les preocupa que los cambios signifiquen que más familias pasen hambre.
“Cuando una familia tiene un presupuesto que no funciona (sus ingresos no se equilibran con sus gastos), empiezan a preguntarse: ‘¿Qué podemos reducir?’. El alquiler es lo que es, no se puede negociar las primas del seguro médico, el costo de la gasolina es lo que es. Un área donde las familias tienen cierta flexibilidad para ajustar el presupuesto es la comida”, dijo Lisa Tepper Bates, presidenta y directora ejecutiva de United Way de Connecticut.
Algunas familias podrían inclinarse por comprar alimentos ricos en calorías para mantener su ingesta calórica, pero que no son ricos en nutrientes, según las autoridades sanitarias. Esto puede provocar afecciones como obesidad, diabetes y enfermedades cardíacas.
“Cuando trabajaba a tiempo completo dirigiendo un albergue para familias sin hogar, esta era la parte de su presupuesto en la que buscaban gastar lo menos posible para poder aprovechar al máximo lo que tenían para el alquiler”, dijo Tepper Bates. “Eso significaba que, a menudo, una familia con dos niños pequeños compraba una bolsa de 4.5 kilos de arroz blanco y 2 kilos y medio de la carne de hamburguesa más barata que encontraba, y esa era la base de su alimentación semanal. Eso simplemente no es una nutrición adecuada”.
¿Existen desafíos legales?
El Fiscal General William Tong anunció a finales del mes pasado que él y otros 21 fiscales generales demandaron al gobierno federal para bloquear las nuevas directrices del Departamento de Agricultura de EE. UU., que consideran que algunos inmigrantes no son elegibles para recibir asistencia alimentaria incluso después de obtener la residencia permanente.
En octubre, el USDA (el Departamento de Agricultura de los EEUU) emitió nuevas directrices para las agencias estatales que describen los cambios en la elegibilidad para el SNAP bajo la Ley “One Big Beautiful Bill”. Tong afirmó que el memorando afirmaba incorrectamente que todas las personas que ingresaron al país a través de ciertas vías, incluyendo refugiados, beneficiarios de asilo y otros, permanecerían permanentemente inelegibles para el SNAP, incluso después de obtener la residencia permanente y convertirse en residentes legales. Los fiscales generales argumentan que la guía contradice la ley federal y podría imponer fuertes sanciones financieras a los estados.
“La Administración Trump no puede evitarlo. Están manipulando los beneficios del SNAP una vez más. Esta vez están inventando sus propias reglas para prohibir permanentemente que los inmigrantes legales (titulares de la residencia permanente) reciban cupones de alimentos”, declaró Tong en un comunicado. “No hay ningún fundamento legal para esta cruel medida, y estamos demandando para detenerla”.
¿Intervendrá el estado con fondos?
Ante la inminente pérdida de beneficios para muchos, los defensores de derechos sociales piden a los funcionarios electos la creación de un programa de asistencia alimentaria financiado por el estado para cubrir esta carencia.
Desde al menos la década de 1990, Connecticut contaba con un programa de cupones de alimentos financiado por el estado para inmigrantes legales que, de otro modo, habrían sido elegibles para el programa federal, pero que fueron excluidos por la reforma de la asistencia social de 1996. En agosto de 2016, la legislatura ordenó al Departamento de Servicios Sociales del estado que dejara de incluir a personas en el programa, aunque la iniciativa se financió hasta 2017, según informaron funcionarios del DSS (Departamento de Servicios Sociales).
En septiembre, representantes de Greater Hartford Legal Aid, New Haven Legal Assistance y Connecticut Legal Services enviaron una carta al Gobernador Ned Lamont y a los líderes legislativos Demócratas pidiéndoles, entre otras cosas, que establecieran un programa de asistencia alimentaria financiado por el estado para inmigrantes legales que anteriormente cumplían los requisitos y otras personas que podrían perder los beneficios del SNAP.
“Les instamos a abordar el daño inminente que los recortes al SNAP de la H.R. 1 están a punto de causar a los residentes de bajos ingresos de Connecticut. Nuestros clientes de bajos ingresos dependen de los beneficios del SNAP para alimentarse a sí mismos y a sus familias, y dependen de la información y los recursos que proporciona el DSS para acceder a dichos beneficios”, escribieron seis personas de dichas organizaciones.
El Senador Matthew Lesser, Demócrata de Middletown y copresidente del Comité de Servicios Humanos, afirmó que él y sus colegas están interesados ​​en explorar un programa de asistencia alimentaria financiado por el estado durante la sesión legislativa que comienza en febrero. Añadió que lanzar una iniciativa de este tipo requeriría fondos y actualizaciones de software para su funcionamiento.
El presidente de la Cámara de Representantes, Matthew Ritter, Demócrata por Hartford, mencionó un fondo de emergencia de 500 millones de dólares autorizado durante la sesión especial de este mes, como una forma de ayudar a los residentes que pierden el acceso al SNAP. “Este es un ejemplo de para qué se podría utilizar el fondo”, afirmó. “Obviamente, el gobernador tiene mucha discreción, y tenemos que votar al respecto. Si el gobernador viniera y nos dijera: ‘Quiero ayudar a estas personas que están siendo expulsadas del SNAP’, lo apoyaría.”
Un portavoz de Lamont dijo que el gobernador aún está revisando cómo usar el dinero del fondo de emergencia.

The Marine Aquaculture Research for America Act would strengthen U.S. aquaculture by funding a large-scale demonstration fish farm and streamlining the federal permitting process. In a Dec. 2 letter, more than 150 seafood businesses, researchers and nonprofit leaders urged Congress to pass the bill, saying it is needed to help the industry grow and compete globally. 
“We must grow more of our own seafood here at home, using modern tools and technologies that protect ocean health and support coastal economies,” the letter said. “The United States imports the majority of our seafood, half of which is farmed overseas.”
Off the coast of Deer Island, Mark Havard is already part of that growing industry. Each week, he tends thousands of oysters growing in floating cages in the Mississippi Sound through his business, Two Crackers Oyster Co.

Havard’s operation is part of Mississippi’s expanding marine aquaculture sector, which has grown in recent years as the state works to rebuild and protect its iconic oyster industry. 
Mississippi’s shift to oyster farming 
Mississippi oyster harvests once relied almost entirely on wild reefs. After decades of natural and manmade disasters, state officials turned to aquaculture as a way to ensure oysters remain available even after future setbacks. 
That shift led the Mississippi Department of Marine Resources to begin training coastal residents to farm oysters. 
“We’ve been training residents of the three coastal counties since 2018,” said Jason Rider, the department’s Shellfish Bureau director. “The goal of the program is to take individuals that are interested in oyster farming or permaculture and teaching them the basics.” 
The program includes classroom instruction and a year of hands-on field training. 
“The first phase is classroom (based), so we have five classroom meetings. We give individuals information on how to start a farm, the basics of oyster biology, the gear that’s needed, real world requirements of what’s involved with it,” Rider said. “After that first phase, the DMR has an area behind Deer Island that we provide growers or individuals the opportunity to borrow gear and space and then train and raise some oysters for about a year through that program. And we give them again the education that they need, and we help them throughout that process.”

After completing the program, participants decide whether to continue into business. Of the roughly 100 students who have gone through the program, Rider said about 30 chose to move forward. 
Havard was one of those students in 2019. His company has since grown from 225,000 seed oysters to more than 400,000. 
“I grew up on a cattle farm,” he said. “I enjoy the husbandry side of things, and oysters are just a different animal compared to a cow.” 
For Havard, the work is demanding but rewarding. 
“It’s a dirty, nasty job. There are easier and cleaner ways to make money,” he said. “But I’m on a boat twice a week, and I absolutely love it.”  
A global industry with local impact
Researchers like Kelly Lucas, who is the vice president of research at The University of Southern Mississippi, said Mississippi’s shift toward aquaculture reflects a broader global shift in seafood production.  
“The growth in seafood is all coming from aquaculture. And everywhere else in the world does it better than we do,” Lucas said. “We can’t take any more out of the wild … we’re at maximum capacity — so, any gain in producing food right is going to come from aquaculture.” 
Lucas has worked on aquaculture research, policy and regulations for more than 17 years — and signed the December letter to Congress. She said the United States has the technology to expand aquaculture but lacks a clear federal path to do so. 
“There’s absolutely no reason that the United States should be 16th in production of aquaculture products, or that we should be exporting our technology to other places, so they can grow aquaculture products and so that we can import it,” Lucas said.  
According to Lucas, one of the biggest barriers is the slow and complex federal permitting process. 
“There’s a lot of different agencies involved, and every agency kind of points out the other agency as to who’s really the responsible party,” Lucas explained.  “There’s no specific thing saying (which agency is) responsible for aquaculture.” 
Lucas said some companies wait up to a decade for permits. 
“You can bankrupt a whole company; they get tired. And you know what they do? If they’re an American company, they go south. They go right across the border into Mexico or into Honduras or into Panama and they put their farms there, and then they ship their product back to the United States,” Lucas said. 
Lucas said the solution is creating a clear, accountable federal process so companies are not stalled for years before they can operate. 
“Having a path, having an entity that’s responsible for making sure that occurs in a timely, timely manner, so that these things aren’t just lingering out there for forever,” Lucas said.
The MARA Act remains in committee, but researchers and growers said it’s outcome could shape the future of aquaculture in Mississippi and across the country.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/08114704/Aquaculture_Image_Havard1.jpg,,,2025-12-11 12:58:47.053223

Following overwhelming public outcry and scrutiny over the decision, the hospital is changing course on how it seeks to close its pediatric services.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Rutland Regional Medical Center withdraws request to close pediatric beds.","Rutland Regional Medical Center. File photo by Mike Dougherty/VTDigger
Rutland Regional Medical Center has voluntarily withdrawn its request to close five pediatric inpatient beds following a bruising public hearing and over 150 public comments in opposition to the decision.
The hospital says it still intends to pursue a redesign of its pediatric services, but it will work directly with the Vermont Agency of Human Services to continue this transformation work rather than going through the state’s main healthcare regulator, the Green Mountain Care Board.
Last Friday, the care board held the first hearing of its kind to evaluate the potential closure.
During that meeting, regulators interrogated the hospital’s confusing financial reports, whether its administrators had assessed the true cost of the closure to families and the state’s healthcare system and if it had considered alternatives — like having fewer beds or more adaptable ones.
Rutland’s desire to close the inpatient beds is part of a broader challenge rural hospitals across the state are facing as they struggle to balance low patient volume while maintaining care quality and still balancing their budgets.
In Friday’s hearing, care board member David Murman distilled the issue to a question. 
“How do we as a rural state balance access to essential services that are needed in communities with the reality that some of these services are fairly low volume, and we have very few options for admitting pediatrics in Vermont?” he asked.
The hospital is not alone in this push to close pediatric services. Thursday’s news comes the same week as a high-profile paper landed in the journal Pediatrics finding a much broader trend of hospitals around the country drastically reducing their pediatric inpatient services over the last 20 years. The authors found that hospitals providing no pediatric care beyond the emergency department more than doubled. 
If the Rutland hospital had closed its pediatric inpatient beds, most of the region’s children would have needed to receive care through extended stays in the emergency department or through a transfer to a larger, academic hospital, like University of Vermont Medical Center in Burlington, more than two hours away.
The potential pediatric bed closure has served as a kind of trial run for the Green Mountain Care Board’s newly granted ability to block hospital service cuts, under Vermont’s Act 68, which was signed into law this year. The hospital’s withdrawal of its request came before the care board could vote on the potential closure.
This story will be updated.

Coach O probably summed it up best,Rick Cleveland,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/11/how-crazy-is-college-football-today/,"How crazy is this football season? It's like the Washington Generals beating the Harlem Globetrotters, the Jamaicans winning the Olympic bobsled gold medal or Luxembourg winning World War III.","Ed Orgeron might have summed up today’s college football world best speaking on a podcast recently when he said,  ”Back then, we used to walk through the back door with the cash. Now we just gotta walk through the front door with the cash!” Credit: Rogelio V. Solis, AP

It is only appropriate that in this – surely the strangest college football season ever – Indiana, the team that entered the 2025 season with the most defeats of any team in college history, finishes the season with a perfect 12-0 record and the No. 1 seeding in the college football playoffs. This is like the Washington Generals beating the Harlem Globetrotters, the Jamaicans winning the Olympic bobsled gold medal or Luxembourg winning World War III.
How crazy was this season? Let us count the ways:

Notre Dame wins 10 straight games after losing its first two (to ranked teams by a total of four points). Yet, the Irish are snubbed and don’t make the playoffs. But that’s not all. Notre Dame, the school of Touchdown Jesus, Knute Rockne and George Gipp, takes its ball and goes home, refusing to play in a bowl game. As Tyler Cleveland said on our Crooked Letter podcast:  It’s almost as if the ghosts of Gipp and Rockne told the non-fighting Irish, “One day when the going gets tough, tell the boys to skip one for the Gipper.”
Ole Miss wins 11 games for the first time in a regular season, makes the playoffs, but will play  in the post-season without the head coach who led them there. I mean, how crazy is that? To which Lane Kiffin, the Snidely Whiplash of college football, adjusts his visor, gazes off into the distance, and smirks.
After losing seven of their final eight games Mississippi State’s Bulldogs will play in the Dukes Mayo Bowl against Wake Forest Jan. 2. What’s more, included in the State entourage to Charlotte will be newly hired defensive coordinator Zach Arnett, the former Bulldog head coach, whom State was still paying (for one more year) his nearly $5 million buyout from when he was fired as State’s head coach. I mean, how does that even work?
Amory native Will Hall, fired at Southern Miss in October 2024, is named the new head coach at Tulane 14 months later. Ironically, Hall’s biggest win during his 14-30 tenure at USM, was over Cotton Bowl-bound Tulane, at Tulane, on Sept. 24, 2022. Amazingly, USM won that game with a true freshman quarterback Zach Wilcke, who has since played at Northwest Community College and at Charlotte and is back in the transfer portal with one year of eligibility remaining. In retrospect, should Tulane beat Ole Miss on Dec. 20 it would be no bigger upset than Southern Miss beating Tulane back in 2022.
Leave it to Ed Orgeron to tell us the main way in which college football has changed in recent years. Speaking on the popular “Bussin’ with the Boys” podcast, Orgeron said this: ”Back then, we used to walk through the back door with the cash. Now we just gotta walk through the front door with the cash!” In this case, Coach O speaks the truth. Money rules the sport.
Here’s another way college football has changed: It used to be that playing in a bowl game was the pot at the end of the rainbow, a cherished reward for all the hard work. That’s not always the case these days. Notre Dame turning down a bowl game is one thing, but Kansas State and Iowa State of the Big 12 Conference are also skipping the post-season. Too good for a bowl? Iowa State? Kansas State? Come on…
Two of the top candidates for the Heisman Trophy, which goes to the most outstanding player in college football, are Vanderbilt’s Diego Pavia and Indiana’s Fernando Mendoza, two practically un-recruited quarterbacks. Pavia is a sixth-year player who was un-rated as a junior college recruit. Mendoza is a former walk-on. Oh, yes, and one player who should be in New York for the Heisman presentation but won’t be is Ole Miss Rebel Trinidad Chambliss, who did not receive a Division I scholarship offer out of high school. So much for recruiting stars. You could put all three of those guys’ recruiting stars together and still not have more than you and me.
You may remember that much ado was made when analyst and former coach Lee Corso was a perfect 6-0 in his final picks on “College Game Day.” Almost forgotten is the fact that Corso picked LSU and Penn State to play for the national championship. Both fired their coaches in October. Oops!
Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry throws a hissy fit about LSU, the state’s flagship university, having to pay football coach Brian Kelly a $54 million buyout after firing him. Landry says such long-term, high dollar contracts are idiotic, something a lot of us would not argue. But then, Landry actively recruits Kiffin, whom LSU will pay $91 million over the next seven years if he stays that long. Kiffin’s buyout is substantially higher than Kelly’s.
And you couldn’t make this up. Part of Kiffin’s new deal is that LSU would have to pay him $1 million if Ole Miss goes on to win the national championship. And so it goes. As they say, you could not make this stuff up…",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/07051210/AP_17260037456255-scaled.jpg,,,2025-12-11 12:58:47.053223

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)President Donald Trump endorsed Phil Berger on Wednesday evening, backing the North Carolina Senate leader as he faces a Republican primary challenge next year.
“Phil Berger has my Complete and Total Endorsement for re-election,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “HE WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN!”
Berger has led Republicans in the Senate since 2005 and is one of the most powerful elected officials in the state. He is facing a challenge from Rockingham County Sheriff Sam Page, who has decried Berger as a backroom dealer who falls short on key conservative priorities.
Berger thanked Trump for the endorsement on social media and said he was “honored to receive it.”
Trump also praised Page, calling him a “lifetime supporter” and both of the candidates “outstanding people.” But he said he preferred to have Page “come work for us in Washington, D.C., rather than further considering a run against Phil.”
Rockingham Sheriff Sam Page is running against NC Senate leader Phil Berger the Senate District 26 GOP primary.
But Page said in a statement that he would continue campaigning.
“I’ve committed to upholding conservative values here in North Carolina and ending the corruption and liberal policies Phil Berger has pushed for years,” Page said. “I will defeat Phil Berger on March 3.”
Over recent months, Berger has rolled out endorsements from prominent North Carolina Republicans, including U.S. Sen. Ted Budd and several of the U.S. House delegation. 
Berger was for years considered effectively untouchable, leading what has become a Senate supermajority while shepherding state budgets and conservative priorities. But he suffered a political setback in 2023 after failing to garner support to fund four casinos within the budget, including one in Rockingham County.
Among those pushing back hardest against the casinos’ inclusion was Page. He has in the years since continued to serve as a critic of the Senate leader, and again appeared at the legislature (as an active candidate) to oppose a ban on in-shore shrimp trawling. That ban, led by the Senate under Berger, was abandoned in the House.
An endorsement from Trump has been the subject of scrutiny and discussion in the primary race before. Berger previously denied unsubstantiated rumors that he agreed to lead mid-decade redistricting in exchange for the president’s backing.
Trump’s informal offer for Page to join his administration, meanwhile, is also a familiar move. In 2024, when former U.S. Rep. Mark Walker was running to rejoin Congress, he abandoned his candidacy to join the Trump campaign at Trump’s request.
Berger and Page’s campaigns have volleyed a series of attacks at each other over the past few months. 
Page, meanwhile, has been the subject of outside scrutiny, both legal and political. 
He told reporters shortly after filing for office that he had spoken to the State Bureau of Investigation; on Wednesday, he told the Raleigh News & Observer that he was contacted and questioned “in regards to a drink machine vending account.” 
That follows comments last month by Kevin Berger, Phil Berger’s son who serves on the Rockingham County commission. Berger and the county board had inquired about Page potentially entering financial contracts for the county jail without first getting approval. 
Page has said he believes the uptick in scrutiny is connected to his challenge to Berger.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4014-1024x730.jpg,,,2025-12-11 12:58:47.053223

The Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry announced Thursday that $7.5 million was awarded for projects that will improve trails for hiking, walking, snowmobile riding and more. The 44 projects that will receive the funding are spread throughout nearly all of Maine’s counties.
The money comes from Maine Trails Program grants, which support the design, construction, and rehabilitation of trails throughout the state for outdoor recreation and active transportation. In November 2024, Maine voters approved a $30 million bond to support the program. 
“The Maine Trails Program is a once-in-a-generation investment in the places where we live, work, and recreate,” said Amanda Beal, commissioner of the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry. “These first-round awards reflect the incredible commitment of our communities to building trails that welcome everyone, whether they walk, ride, paddle, ski, or snowmobile.”
The department received more than 100 applications for the first round of funding. From those that were approved, there will be 25 new trails constructed and more than a dozen projects to improve accessibility. Eight of the awarded grants will focus on snowmobile use and five will cater to ATV usage. 
This was the first of four rounds of annual grants for the Maine Trails Program. Applications for the second round are expected to be due next June. 
“The combined power of this statewide commitment and MTP’s strategic investment will protect and enhance our state’s vital recreational infrastructure, making it more resilient and cost-effective for years to come,” said Leigh Hallett, director of the Maine Trails Coalition, in a news release.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/F8397117-155D-451F-67D51DFE95237F31Original-2-e1730755839921-1024x664.jpg,,,2025-12-11 12:00:37.134027

A jump in immigration enforcement arrests under the Trump administration is having a detrimental impact on America’s child care system, reducing the number of immigrant workers available and prompting mothers with young children to leave their jobs as they scramble for stable care.
That’s according to a report released Wednesday by the Better Life Lab at the nonprofit New America, which examined how increased arrests during the first half of the year by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has had a ripple effect on a women-led child care workforce where about 1 in 5 workers are immigrants.

This report was originally published by The 19th. The Illuminator is a founding member of the 19th News Network.

The report estimates there are roughly 39,000 fewer foreign-born child care workers since Trump took office in January. There are also 77,000 fewer American mothers of preschool-aged children in the workforce since that time, a result that researchers found is tied to the impact of ICE arrests. Mothers have already been exiting the workforce in droves.
“It’s not surprising that we find that disruptions to the child care market vis-à-vis an increase in immigration enforcement has led to a decline in the number of foreign-born workers, and because of the disruptions in the child care market, this has led to spillovers in the labor market for mothers with kids more generally,” said Chris M. Herbst, one of the authors of the report and a professor of public policy at Arizona State University whose research includes the economics of child care. “These kinds of immigration-induced disruptions have had negative labor market implications.”
The group analyzed federal labor statistics and newly compiled ICE arrest data between September 2023 and July 2025 and found that immigrant labor — both among foreign-born and U.S.-born child care workers — decreased as arrests spiked this year and workers tried to avoid being targeted by ICE agents. The report estimates ICE arrests rose more than threefold between December 2024 and June of this year — from just over 8,300 to more than 29,000.
The dynamics also appear to be shifting some workers away from formal center- and home-based employment settings toward private households in work as a babysitter, nanny or au pair. Those shifts may reduce the total number of spots a day care can offer.
“Pay is often under the table, and there’s no formal regulation of this sector,” Herbst said. “We don’t know if it’s high quality, if it’s low quality, how good the pay is — but what it is is less visible, and workers may feel less vulnerable as a result.”
The drop in foreign-born child care workers is most pronounced among highly educated immigrants and those from Mexico. There’s also a 30 percent decrease among Hispanic workers, particularly Mexican workers, born in the United States. ICE agents have also detained U.S. citizens amid widespread arrests.
“ICE arrests are having chilling effects on groups that are not eligible for deportation,” Herbst said. “U.S.-born workers of any race or ethnicity are not eligible for deportation, and the fact that we’re seeing reductions in U.S.-born employment among Hispanics, in particular Mexicans, speaks potentially to this chilling effect that ICE is having on these workers.”
Herbst said the administration sold mass deportations on the theory that they would unclog the labor market and create more job opportunities for Americans. That’s not what is playing out in the child care industry, which shows how immigrants and U.S. citizens don’t always compete for the same jobs.
“When a foreign-born worker is not showing up to work anymore because they’re scared, it makes the U.S.-born worker in that program — it makes it more difficult for them to do their jobs because they are doing complementary tasks rather than serving as substitutes for one another.”
The changes to the child care workforce are also impacting employment opportunities among U.S. mothers with preschool-aged children, especially White mothers and those who are highly educated.
“Parents, mothers in particular, rely on having stable child care available in order to work. And
when you increase instability in the child care market, essentially by ramping up immigration enforcement, you’re scaring the heck out of a lot of workers who are no longer going to show up,” Herbst said. “Because of that, the nation’s ability to provide child care services has declined. Families can no longer find the needed child care to go to work, and as a result, we’re seeing in the data, there are fewer mothers employed.”
This is not the first time researchers have examined the impact of immigration enforcement on child care. A federal program aimed at checking the immigration status of people arrested by local police and in effect between 2008 and 2013 also reduced the foreign-born child care work force and decreased the workforce among American mothers with young children.
Trump has made mass immigrant deportation a central policy during his second term. The scope of related arrests and subsequent detentions has included people without criminal backgrounds, including pregnant and postpartum people, and reached into locations once deemed sensitive by the federal government like schools, hospitals and churches.
Trump’s policy decision to rescind “sensitive location” status for places like day cares has translated into more immigration enforcement arrests near centers. A recent arrest of a day care worker inside a Chicago area center as children watched garnered national outrage.
Immigration arrests are expected to continue in the new year. Congress approved a massive tax law last summer that included $170 billion over the next four years for immigration enforcement, including for detentions and deportations. Researchers believe as ICE hires more officers and ramps up arrests, the child care sector could be further harmed.
Herbst said he expects disruptions not just to the child care sector but to other industries that are immigrant intensive.
“What I hope our paper does is start to get people thinking about the trade offs involved in this kind of immigration enforcement policy,” he said. “It’s been sold to us as a policy that’s going to be a boon for American workers, for U.S.-born workers. But I think what we’re finding is that there are trade offs.”

America’s top campuses remain crowded with wealth, but some universities have accelerated efforts to reach a wider swath of the country, recruiting more in urban and rural areas and offering free tuition for students whose families are not among the highest earners.
The strategy could lead to friction with the federal government. The Trump administration, which has pulled funding from elite colleges over a range of grievances, has suggested it’s illegal to target needier students. College leaders believe they’re on solid legal ground.
At Princeton University, this year’s freshman class has more low-income students than ever. One in four are eligible for federal Pell grants, which are scholarships reserved for students with the most significant financial need. That’s a leap from two decades ago, when fewer than 1 in 10 were eligible.
“The only way to increase socioeconomic diversity is to be intentional about it,” Princeton President Christopher Eisgruber said in a statement. “Socioeconomic diversity will increase if and only if college presidents make it a priority.”
Last year, Princeton set aggressive goals to recruit more low-income students in the wake of the Supreme Court’s ban on affirmative action in higher education. Without the ability to consider race, officials wrote in a campus report, focusing on economic diversity offers “the university’s greatest opportunity to attract diverse talent.”
The country’s most selective colleges still enroll large proportions of students from the wealthiest 1% of American families. Many of those campuses have tried for years to shed reputations of elitism, with only gradual changes in enrollment.
Colleges set records for enrollment of low-income students
Only a small fraction of the nation’s colleges have publicly disclosed their low-income enrollments this year, and national data won’t be released by the federal government until next year. But early numbers show a trend.
At 17 highly selective colleges that have released new data, almost all saw increases in Pell-eligible students between 2023 and this year, according to an Associated Press analysis. Most saw increases in consecutive years, and none saw a significant decrease in aggregate over the two years.
Yale, Duke, Johns Hopkins and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology all have set enrollment records for Pell-eligible students in the past two years.
Part of the uptick owes to a federal expansion that made more students eligible for Pell grants last year. But campus leaders also believe the increases reflect their own efforts.
The numbers in MIT’s freshman class have climbed by 43% over the past two years, and low-income students account for more than a quarter of this year’s class. MIT officials cited its policy providing free tuition for families that earn less than $200,000 a year.
“MIT has always been an engine of opportunity for low-income students, and we are dedicated to ensuring we can make an MIT education accessible for students from every walk of life,” Stu Schmill, MIT’s dean of admissions, said in a statement.
Nationwide, roughly a third of undergraduate students have received Pell grants in recent years.
Two years ago, Amherst College in Massachusetts made tuition free for students in the bottom 80% of U.S. earnings. It also started covering meals and housing for those below the median income, and it stopped prioritizing children of alumni and donors in admissions decisions. Since then, low-income enrollment has risen steadily, reaching 1 in 4 new students this year.
At the same time, the admissions office has stepped up recruiting in overlooked parts of the country, from big cities to small towns.
“When we go out and talk to students, it’s not in the fanciest ZIP codes,” said Matthew McGann, dean of admissions. “It’s in places where we know there’s a lot of talent but not a lot of opportunity.”
Racial diversity does not necessarily follow economic diversity
On many campuses, officials hoped the focus on economic diversity would preserve racial diversity — Black, Hispanic and Indigenous Americans have the country’s highest poverty rates. But even as low-income numbers climb, many elite campuses have seen racial diversity decrease.
Without the emphasis on income, those decreases might have been even steeper, said Richard Kahlenberg, a researcher at the Progressive Policy Institute who advocates for class-based affirmative action. He called the latest Pell figures “a significant step in the right direction.”
“Economic diversity is important in its own right,” he said. “It’s important that America’s leadership class — which disproportionately derives from selective colleges — include people who’ve faced economic hardships in life.”
Swarthmore College saw the most dramatic leap in Pell enrollment, jumping from 17% to 30% last year.
While many campuses were delaying scholarship decisions until the government resolved problems with a new financial aid form, Swarthmore used other data to figure out applicants’ financial need. That allowed Swarthmore to offer scholarships to students while they were still awaiting decisions from other schools.
More financially disadvantaged students ended up enrolling at Swarthmore than officials expected. College leaders also credit their work to reduce campus costs — laundry is free and students get yearly credits for textbooks, for example.
Yet Swarthmore saw its Black enrollment fall to 5% of its freshman class this year, down from 8% the year before.
“In a race neutral environment, those numbers are likely to drop,” Jim Bock, the admissions dean, said in a statement. “Not all minority students are low-income, and not all majority students have significant financial means.”
The approach risks federal scrutiny
In legal memos, the White House has alleged that prioritizing students based on earnings or geography amounts to a “racial proxy” in violation of the Supreme Court’s 2023 decision against affirmative action.
In a June letter, Trump officials accused the University of California-Los Angeles of “race-based admissions in all but name.” It criticized UCLA for considering factors like applicants’ family income, ZIP code and high school profile.
Colleges often weigh that kind of information in admissions decisions. Yet the Trump administration has declared that the Supreme Court decision outlaws a wide range of long-accepted education practices, including scholarships targeting students in underserved areas.
Already, there are signs of an impact.
Earlier this year the College Board — the nonprofit that oversees the SAT — suddenly discontinued an offering that gave admissions offices a wealth of information about applicants, including earnings data from their neighborhoods.
Kahlenberg and others see it as a retreat in the face of government pressure. The College Board offered little explanation, citing changes to federal and state policy around the use of demographic information in admissions.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_9413-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-11 12:00:37.134027

The new study, done by the nonprofit Environmental Integrity Project, found the state slashed funding for the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality by 71% from 2010 to 2024. Mississippi also had the largest decrease in total dollars from that time, with MDEQ’s inflation-adjusted budget dropping from $373 million t0 $107 million, the report said. 
The EIP report also looked at staffing reductions over that timeframe. Mississippi ranked 10th in staffing cuts, going from 523 employees in 2010 to 433 in 2024, or a 17% decrease. 
In total, 27 states cut funding to their environmental agencies over that period, including Mississippi’s neighbors Alabama (a 49% decrease) and Louisiana (26%). But its other neighbors, Arkansas and Tennessee, both saw opposite trends, with increases of 31% and 30%, respectively. South Dakota saw the second highest budget decrease with 61%.

In an interview earlier this year, MDEQ Executive Director Chris Wells described the agency as being understaffed. 
“(MDEQ employees) in certain areas of the agency are stretched pretty thin,” Wells told Mississippi Today in April. “They’re working more than 40 hours a week, barely keeping their head above water, and in a lot of cases not necessarily meeting expectations from the outside in terms of how fast we get permits turned around.”
He estimated MDEQ had lost around 50 employees since he took over the agency in 2020. 
MDEQ’s role is to conserve the state’s public, natural resources and to regulate pollution into the air, water and soil. Any business in the state that has such releases must first obtain a permit from the agency. MDEQ’s other roles include overseeing the state’s sewer systems, monitoring aquifers and managing dozens of projects funded from the BP oil spill settlement.
The EIP argued recent cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency at the federal level will put more pressure on state agencies. The White House is looking to cut EPA’s budget by 55% next year, which would bring its funding to the lowest amount since the 1980s, Politico reported in May.
“The Trump Administration is attempting to dismantle EPA and roll back commonsense federal pollution rules, claiming that the states can pick up the slack and protect our communities – but that’s not the case,” Jen Duggan, EIP’s executive director, said. “The implementation of our environmental laws depend on both a strong EPA and state agencies that have the resources they need to do their jobs. But our research found that many states have already cut their pollution control agencies and so more cuts at the federal level will only put more Americans at risk.”
Legislative budget records show about a third of MDEQ’s funding comes from the federal government. 
In response to Wednesday’s report, the agency said it couldn’t comment on the study, but added that funding from the state Legislature for MDEQ’s operational costs had increased nearly 14% since 2010. 
Records available online show a slight uptick in funding from the Legislature since fiscal year 2011 when adjusted for inflation. But they also show a large drop-off during much of that period, as seen in the chart below.
Moreover, those funds, about $16 million a year, only make up a small portion of MDEQ’s total appropriations. Most of MDEQ’s funding comes from other sources, such as fees it collects and federal support. Overall, funding for the agency decreased by over a quarter between fiscal year 2011 and fiscal year 2025, the chart below shows.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/06203318/MG_4367-scaled.jpg,,,2025-12-11 12:00:37.134027

(Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)Del. Vanessa Atterbeary (D-Howard), the chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, announced Thursday that she is leaving the House of Delegates next month to focus on her campaign for Howard County executive.
Her announcement comes one week after Del. Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County) said she was stepping down from the House speaker’s job she held for the last six years, and just days before the House is scheduled to meet in special session on Dec. 16 to select a new speaker.
Democrats appear to have quickly coalesced around Del. Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel) as the next speaker — a job that Atterbeary was long considered to be a one-day contender for.
But sensing that Jones was keen on continuing as speaker and running for reelection, Atterbeary filed this fall to run for Howard County executive. Jones’ surprise announcement came months after Atterbeary had filed and ramped up her campaign, which led to many House members who would have supported her as speaker to back other candidates.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Atterbeary’s continued role in leadership became murky under a potential Peña-Melnyk speakership. More changes to House leadership could be coming in the next few days and weeks.
The departure of Atterbeary and the potential elevation of Peña-Melnyk would leave leadership of two of the House’s seven standing committees open as delegates prepare for the Jan. 14 start of the 2026 legislative session. Besides Atterbeary on Ways and Means, Peña-Melnyk is chair of the House Health and Government Operations Committee.
In her resignation letter to Speaker Pro Tem Dana Stein (D-Baltimore County) Atterbeary said her resignation would take effect Jan. 14 — the first day of the 2026 General Assembly session.
“As I reflect on my career in the House of Delegates, I am so proud of the accomplishments we’ve achieved in my years of service,” Atterbeary wrote in her letter. “Now, I am ready to turn a new chapter in my life.”
Del. Jheanelle Wilkins (D-Montgomery), the vice chair of Ways and Means, called Atterbeary a “dedicated and driven leader of our committee, and a strong advocate for our students and families. I am grateful for her service and wish her well as she begins this next chapter.”

The assistance comes as the Trump administration implements eligibility rules under the “One Big Beautiful Bill.”
Grocery gift cards starting at $25 will be distributed to eligible Connecticut families who reach out to their local social service agency. United Way has been working with local agencies to buy grocery cards at a variety of stores including Big Y, Stop & Shop, Walmart and others.
State Rep. Jaime Foster (D-Ellington) spearheaded the fundraising, along with State Rep. Jen Leeper (D-Fairfield).
It’s not a substitute for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, Foster said. But the program is a way to help fill in some of the gaps left by people cut out of benefits – especially since people depend on SNAP aid to maintain their health and well-being, she added.
“It is really the difference oftentimes, between folks buying healthy food and relying on reduced quality foods to meet their caloric needs and their hunger needs,” Foster said.
Interested families can reach out to their local social service agencies. Every town gets a specific number of cards based on the need.
Fundraising began at the end of October, Foster said, and they were able to raise $50,000, all from donations, and the team is continuing that effort.
“We’re going to help as many people as we possibly can,” Foster said. “There is really no alternative to the expenditures that happen through the federal government and the state government.”
This new solution comes after Connecticut lawmakers authorized $500 million in the November special session to address urgent federal funding reductions. That money needs to be allocated by early February.
Backfilling SNAP-Ed, the nutrition education program the federal government eliminated in October, is something Foster hopes the state can also tackle in the next legislative session.

Smith outlines zoning barriers, rental-market pressures, and the need for policy reforms to meet demand for 20,000 additional low-income homes
WILMINGTON , DE — The Wilmington Rotary Club gathered Thursday morning at the Hotel du Pont to hear a sobering but solutions-focused update on Delaware’s affordable housing crisis from Kevin L. Smith, CEO of Habitat for Humanity of New Castle County.
Smith, who has led Habitat’s local chapter for the past 30 yearss through a period of growing demand and shrinking inventory, told Rotarians that Delaware is facing a “severe and worsening shortage” of affordable homes — with an estimated need for 20,000 additional low-income housing units just to meet the needs of current residents. The figure comes from the Delaware Housing Alliance and underscores what advocates have warned for years: the state’s housing pipeline is not keeping up with the need, and the problem is growing.
A Shortage That Ripples Across Families, Schools and Health
Smith said the impact goes far beyond housing statistics. Overcrowded homes and unstable living conditions, he explained, create significant challenges for children, from classroom performance to long-term health outcomes for all residents, especially the elderly.
“Every delay in building affordable housing shows up in a child’s life sooner or later,” he told the group. “We see it in instability, a lack of sleep, higher stress levels, and academic struggles.”
He pointed to a University of Delaware study identifying the biggest drivers of Delaware’s housing shortage:


Homelessness and evictions


Gentrification pressures


Exclusionary zoning


Lengthy and costly approval processes


For Habitat for Humanity, which relies heavily on acquiring land suitable for multi-unit projects, those zoning and permitting hurdles directly slow production and raise costs.
NIMBY Misconceptions Still a Barrier
Smith also addressed what he called persistent misconceptions surrounding affordable housing — particularly “Not In My Back Yard” (NIMBY) opposition that often arises during public hearings.
“In the case of NIMBY, the public has the wrong idea about the kind of families who move into a Habitat home,” he said. “We help nearby residents separate myth from reality, but that takes time and money — and it slows down projects people desperately need.”
Legislative Challenges From Dover
Another emerging obstacle, Smith said, comes from well-intentioned but problematic legislation designed to strengthen renter protections. While supporting tenant rights is important, Smith cautioned that some recent policies have gone too far, discouraging property owners from renting or investing in additional units.
“When the environment becomes too burdensome for landlords, some simply stop participating — and that reduces supply,” he said. “State officials need to find the right balance.”
A Housing Continuum Under Strain
Smith described Delaware’s housing landscape as a continuum ranging from homelessness support and emergency shelters to transitional housing, social housing, affordable rentals, and finally affordable homeownership — where Habitat for Humanity operates.
But instead of progressing upward through that continuum, too many Delawareans are moving in the opposite direction.
“In this market, people are sliding down, not climbing up,” Smith warned.
He noted there is currently only one Hope Center in New Castle County providing transitional shelter, even though the need requires at least nine. In addition, the lack of affordable housing to buy puts pressure on the low-income rental market because families who would otherwise move into starter homes can’t move up and out of lower-cost units.
That dynamic keeps units filled longer, limits options for the lowest-income renters, and further strains a system already under pressure.
Proposed Solutions and a Call for Balance
Smith outlined several strategies to expand affordable housing and stabilize the market:


Increase funding for low-income housing construction.


Reduce permitting delays and regulatory burdens that slow development and add cost.


Adopt inclusionary zoning policies that require or incentivize affordable units in new projects.


Reevaluate how state and county-owned land can be used to accelerate affordable development.

The two announcements are the latest in a raft of municipal staff resignations over the past several months that now number at least seven.

This story by Lisa Scagliotti was first published in The Waterbury Roundabout on Dec. 10, 2025.
In a letter to the Waterbury Select Board on Tuesday, Dec. 9, Town Clerk Karen Petrovic submitted her resignation, saying that Friday, Jan. 2, will be her last day in her elected role in town government.
Petrovic’s notice came a day after Assistant Town Clerk Beth Jones announced she will be retiring in early 2026, although Jones has not chosen a date yet for when she plans to step down from the part-time position she’s held for 15 years.
The two announcements are the latest in a raft of municipal staff resignations over the past several months that now number at least seven, although Petrovic is the only elected official to step down. 
Since September, Waterbury municipal staff resignations have included both full-time Recreation Department staffers Katie Mandych and Katarina Lisaius, as well as Zoning Administrator Mike Bishop, Bookkeeper Michelle Ryan and a Waterbury Public Library employee. 
In her resignation letter, Petrovic reflected on her more than 10 years working for the town and the Edward Farrar Utility District, where she previously was the water and wastewater departments’ billing clerk. “During that time I have strived to learn as much about municipal functions as possible in order to best assist residents of the community and be an asset as a staff member,” she wrote. “Town and EFUD staff are the core of the community providing necessary services to residents.”
Petrovic told the Waterbury Roundabout that she will be starting a new job with the Vermont Department of Corrections in Waterbury in January. 
On staff since 2015, Petrovic in June 2022 was unanimously appointed by the Waterbury Select Board to serve as interim town clerk and treasurer as longtime Town Clerk and Treasurer Carla Lawrence was retiring. Petrovic was appointed to serve until the March 2023 election when she ran unopposed for the office. 
That year, voters also approved changing the town clerk and treasurer terms from one to three years, to begin in 2024. Petrovic last year again ran unopposed and won re-election to three-year terms as clerk and treasurer, which end in 2027.  
The process to name a new town clerk in between elections calls for the select board to appoint a clerk until the next local election. In this case, someone could be appointed to the office to serve until Town Meeting Day on March 3. The remaining year of Petrovic’s unexpired terms as clerk and treasurer would be on the ballot for voters to fill in that election.  
Jones, whose position is a hired staff role, said she would like to retire early in the new year and she would be willing to help train a new town clerk if necessary before Town Meeting Day. She said she has been thinking about retiring for several months and decided to move ahead with her decision now that her husband has cut back to working part-time. “It was not an easy decision. I love the people I work with,” Jones said. 
In an email to her co-workers, Jones said she had mixed emotions about taking this step now. “I truly enjoy working with each of you … but it’s time. I am grateful to have been part of the team that makes our community a wonderful place but I am also looking forward to my new adventure, whatever it may be,” she wrote.
Petrovic echoed that sentiment, reflecting on the role she is leaving. “I love being the town clerk,” she said. “It’s been an honor to be called that for three years.” 
But her resignation letter also contained a strong rebuke of the workplace climate at the town offices: “It saddens me that the events of the last year have meant numerous staff resignations. The current culture of dishonesty and lack of accountability at the municipal office has forced many like myself to explore other opportunities,” she wrote to the select board. “The quality of my work life has steadily declined and has reached a critical level that I must prioritize my mental health and family life. If you are one of the board members that took the time to meet and talk with me about my concerns, I want to thank you. Your willingness to hear my story did matter.”
Petrovic last fall registered her dissatisfaction with changes made to the town health insurance benefits by Municipal Manager Tom Leitz. Revising the town’s benefits resulted in higher out-of-pocket costs for some employees, including the town clerk. Some municipal employees unhappy with the change said the town manager, select board and utility district commissioners moved forward with implementing the change without fully informing the staff. 
Petrovic soon afterward ended her practice of attending select board meetings and taking minutes. It was around that time that the town and utility district staff also mobilized to form a labor union. 
Asked about the latest staff departures, Waterbury Select Board Chair Alyssa Johnson and Vice Chair Kane Sweeney shared a short statement with the Waterbury Roundabout on Wednesday: “The Selectboard was notified yesterday (Tuesday) of the Town Clerk’s letter of resignation and will be taking steps to ensure that services provided by the Town Office to residents remain uninterrupted,” they said.
Staff in flux during labor contract negotiations
The resignations come as municipal staff have been in the process of negotiating two union contracts in the second half of this year. In January, 24 of the town, library and utility district’s 28 employees voted to have the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees labor union – known as AFSCME for short – represent them in contract talks with the town and utility district. 
Employees on the municipal office staff, Waterbury Public Library and Highway Department would be covered by one labor agreement, while workers for the utility district would have a separate contract. 
Talks between town management — including the select board and the EFUD Board of Commissioners — and the employees, including an AFSCME representative, began in June with the goal of having draft agreements ready for employee approval by the end of this year.
In July, both the select board and the EFUD Board renewed their three-year contract with Municipal Manager Tom Leitz, who was hired in 2022 to succeed then-retiring manager Bill Shepeluk. The contract went into effect Aug. 1.   
And in the past few weeks, two of the municipal staff vacancies have been filled: Nanette Rogers has taken the bookkeeper position and Cheryl Casey has been hired as zoning administrator. 
Town Manager Tom Leitz said Wednesday that he has a candidate for the recreation director position to share with the select board for its approval at their next meeting on Monday.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-11 15:36:54+00:00,CT Mirror,CT approves Hartford HealthCare purchase of 2 Prospect hospitals,Katy Golvala,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/11/ct-approves-prospect-hospitals-sale/,The approval brings the state closer to concluding a lengthy search to find buyers for Prospect Medical Holdings three CT hospitals.,"The Connecticut Office of Health Strategy on Wednesday evening approved an $86.1 million deal for Hartford HealthCare to purchase Manchester Memorial and Rockville General, two struggling hospitals owned by bankrupt hospital operator, Prospect Medical Holdings.
The approval marks another step towards concluding a lengthy search to find buyers for Prospect’s Connecticut hospitals — a process that often seemed on the brink of failure.
“This is a positive outcome to an initially challenging situation,” said Gov. Ned Lamont in a statement. “Ensuring quality services remain both accessible and affordable for our families and communities has always been one of my top priorities.”
Spokespeople for Prospect CT and Hartford HealthCare did not respond to requests for comment in time for publication.
In 2022, Prospect signed a deal to sell its three Connecticut hospitals — Manchester Memorial, Rockville General and Waterbury — to Yale New Haven Health for $435 million. But the deal was mired in setbacks and litigation. 
In August 2023, a cyberattack crippled operations at Prospect’s facilities around the country. In 2024, Yale New Haven Health and Prospect Medical sued and countersued each other over the true value of the hospitals. In January 2025, Prospect filed for bankruptcy and, by the following month, Yale officials said a deal appeared “impossible.” 
In September, Yale agreed to pay $45 million to Prospect to end all disputes over the hospitals’ sale. 
Over the years the Yale deal was pending, Lamont and OHS received broad criticism for the lengthy approval process. That led state legislators to approve a measure earlier this year that allows for an expedited timeline for the acquisition of hospitals that have filed for bankruptcy.
The approval of the deal between Hartford HealthCare and Prospect marks the first transaction reviewed under the expedited “emergency certificate of need” process, which requires the state to issue a decision within 60 days of when the application is deemed complete.
OHS imposed certain conditions on the approval. Hartford HealthCare must maintain all services for a minimum of three years, including labor and delivery and intensive care services at Manchester Memorial, as well as emergency services at Rockville General. 
But, in the case of Rockville General, much of the damage to services has already been done. When Prospect purchased the hospital in 2016, Rockville was a full-service, acute care hospital. Today, it functions as a satellite campus of Manchester Memorial, only offering emergency and behavioral health services.
Hartford HealthCare has received sharp criticism for service cuts at Windham Community Hospital, where the health system stopped performing births in 2020. Hartford Healthcare defended its decision, pointing to low birth volumes and difficulty recruiting health care providers. Surrounding residents fought for years to restore services, but the state ultimately approved the closure in 2023. 
The University of Connecticut Health Center is poised to acquire Prospect’s third Connecticut facility, Waterbury Hospital. Last week, UConn Health, the state’s flagship academic medical institution, submitted an emergency certificate of need for the acquisition. OHS will hold a public hearing for the transaction on Dec. 19 and must issue a decision by Feb. 9.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023_0927_SR_Hospitals_004-scaled-1-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-12-11 10:57:32.083264

A $1 million offer for the former Loretto Home senior living facility could help the state’s largest religious denomination and a local housing nonprofit — but comes with conditions.

Vermont’s Roman Catholic Diocese, now seeking to reorganize its depleting finances in U.S. Bankruptcy Court, has received permission to sell its former Loretto Home senior living facility in Rutland.
In a ruling this week, Judge Heather Cooper said she’d allow the state’s largest religious denomination to accept a $1 million offer from Rutland’s nonprofit Cornerstone Housing Partners, which wants to transform the Meadow Street building into transitional and long-term affordable apartments.
“The proposed sale represents the highest and best offer for the property,” church lawyers argued in court papers, “and the proceeds of the sale will assist the diocese in funding the administration of this bankruptcy case and ultimately paying creditors.”
Cornerstone said it had a $3.9 million commitment from the state Agency of Human Services to help it buy and rehabilitate the 20,000-square-foot facility.
The nonprofit could immediately launch its first-phase plan for 16 units of emergency family housing under a new state law that expands locations for shelters. But the $1 million sale is contingent on receiving a Rutland zoning permit for a second-phase plan for at least 20 long-term apartments.
“We’re not going to purchase the building if we can’t create affordable apartments there,” Mary Cohen, the nonprofit’s chief executive officer, told VTDigger. “The goal is to create permanent housing.”
Cornerstone already has heard questions from neighbors as it seeks a zoning permit from Rutland’s Development Review Board.
“I think it’s a lack of understanding,” Cohen said. “We’re good landlords. We house people and take good care of our property. The application process will allow a public conversation about what our plans are.”
The Vermont Catholic Church filed for Chapter 11 protection a year ago after a series of clergy misconduct settlements reduced its assets by half, to about $35 million. Since then, 119 people have submitted new child sexual abuse allegations — almost double that of an earlier 67 accusers who previously settled cases over the past two decades.
To raise money, the diocese enlisted Pomerleau Real Estate to market the Loretto Home after the facility closed in 2023. The property, under the control of the church since 1904, was initially listed at $2.25 million before being reduced to $1.95 million and, by this year, $1.3 million, court records show. The diocese received an unspecified number of offers before accepting Cornerstone’s $1 million bid this summer.
Under the Chapter 11 process, the Vermont church must receive court approval for all major purchases and sales until a judge decides on its call for a reorganization plan.

Gilda Cobb-Hunter, D-Orangeburg talks with legislators in the House chamber on Thursday, Jan. 11, 2024. (File photo by Mary Ann Chastain/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)In the nearly 40 years since Diane Sumpter founded her business consulting firm DESA Inc., she’s held millions of dollars’ worth of federal government contracts all over the country. But it’s been years since she’s done any business with her home state of South Carolina.
“South Carolina state government has not been one that’s been open to us,” she told the SC Daily Gazette. “That’s just been a hard nut to crack.”
So, she and other leaders of minority business organizations largely shrugged off last week’s order by Gov. Henry McMaster directing state agencies to disregard state law that was supposed to help minority-owned businesses.
After all, agencies already ignored the decades-old sections. They weren’t bringing business anyway.
The last time DESA — initially formed as Diane E. Sumpter and Associates — did work for the Palmetto State was about 15 years ago. The state Department of Transportation hired DESA to ensure construction subcontractors were following the proper accounting and auditing processes. She can’t remember the contract amount. Any state work she’s done with state agencies since has been as a subcontractor under another company.
“You can’t continue chasing after something that’s never going to amount to anything,” Sumpter said.
“We stopped bidding,” she added.
Citing a potential loss of federal funding, the governor signed an executive order last week essentially directing all state agency heads to ignore sections of state law dating to 1981 titled “assistance to minority businesses” until the Republican-dominated Legislature can remove them next year. Agencies should not enter any new contracts based on race, he said.
SC governor halts carve outs for minority-owned businesses in state agency contracts

McMaster called that unconstitutional; 44 years ago, the General Assembly called it opportunity.
“Business firms owned and operated by minority persons have been historically restricted from full participation in our free enterprise system to a degree disproportionate to other businesses,” reads a policy statement in the law. “The General Assembly, therefore, takes this leadership role in setting procedures that will result in awarding contracts and subcontracts to minority business firms in order to enhance minority capital ownership, overall state economic development and reduce dependency on the part of minorities.”
‘Just paperwork’
Companies wishing to do business with the state can apply for a certification — good for five years — as a minority-owned enterprise.
The law directs state procurement officials to provide those businesses added assistance in placing bids. The businesses also were to be added to a database, detailing the products and services which they provide, that agency staff could access when looking for contractors.
At first, Sumpter said, lots of businesses completed the certification forms. But over the years, she said, many stopped re-applying when the hope for state contracts never materialized.
“It was just paperwork,” she said. “Having it is one thing; having it work is another.”
The law requires every state agency to make a plan annually for spending 10% of its discretionary budget with businesses certified as minority enterprises.
Progress reports toward meeting that goal are due every quarter. But there’s no punishment in the law for noncompliance. Beyond that, 10% is a goal, not a requirement.
More than 40% of 114 agencies and public colleges listed in the latest report compiled by the state’s minority affairs commission failed to turn in a plan for the fiscal year that ended June 30. One-third didn’t bother to turn in a single quarterly report.
“That speaks volumes,” said Evelyn Lugo, founder of the South Carolina Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.
Lugo, who has operated the business organization for 18 years, could think of just one Hispanic-owned company with government contracts. That’s Mercom Corporation, a Pawleys Island IT firm that’s held numerous federal contracts, she said.
For smaller companies without a lot of liquidity, the wait for government payments to come in after providing a service can be too difficult.
Under the state law, agencies were supposed to break contracts into more manageable chunks for small, minority-owned companies, but Lugo hadn’t heard of that happening.
“If you are one of the little guys, forget it,” she said.
In his order to end any semblance of complying with what he called “race-based spending quotas,” McMaster cited Trump administration changes in federal rules. Executive orders from President Donald Trump hinge on a 2023 U.S. Supreme Court ruling declaring Harvard’s admissions policy on race unconstitutional. The president, and now the governor, used that ruling to strike all diversity-related mandates in government.
The longest-serving Black legislator in the General Assembly called the order unnecessary.
“You’re telling people, based on the Supreme Court’s decision, to not make exceptions for businesses of color,” said Rep. Gilda Cobb-Hunter. “My argument is that wasn’t being done in the first place, not to the extent that it could have been done.”
“You’re now saying the two or three crumbs that are going to these businesses of color, we’re going to take that down to zero crumbs,” continued the Orangeburg Democrat, adding the order is also misleading.
It implies the state is “giving minorities this and giving them that,” she said. “Let’s see what the numbers show.”
According to the report for the fiscal year that ended June 30, only two agencies with big discretionary budgets met their 10% goal: the Department of Transportation awarded $7 million worth of contracts to certified minority firms, and the adjutant general’s office awarded $5 million total.
Among colleges, Clemson University reported awarding almost $3 million worth of contracts, or 4% of its “controllable dollars.” Colleges not reporting anything last fiscal year include the University of South Carolina, the Medical University of South Carolina, and South Carolina State University, the state’s only public historically Black university. USC has filed in the past, according to spokesman Jeff Stensland.
MUSC is in communication with the commission about the reporting measures, according to a statement provided in response to the Gazette’s questions. It did not address past filing or whether the college was aware of the rules. Spokespeople for Clemson and SC State did not respond.
Existing contracts
Juan Luvene, owner of All Clean Mobile Wash, has held state contracts for more than a decade, including one pressure washing the state foster care agency’s fleet of vehicles.
The Anderson business is state-certified as minority-owned, but Luvene said the competition for contracts remains fierce and requires vast amounts of paperwork.
“I don’t think it gave me a leg up or a leg down,” he said about the certification.
“You earn business based on how well you do a job,” said David O’Shield, the owner of Envirogreen in Greenville.
O’Shield has held several contracts as a minority-owned firm over the last five years, hauling rock, sand and even oyster shells. He considers the certification more of a marketing tool.
“So you’re at least on the list to be looked at,” he said.
Both owners told the SC Daily Gazette they’re less worried about the loss of the minority-focused program and more concerned about potential changes that could impact small businesses in general.
“It’s hard to get in front of the right people,” Luvene said.
“I don’t want the small businesses to be kicked out of the state network,” O’Shield added. “That’s where I’m afraid it’s going to go.”
‘Window dressing’
Meanwhile, the agency charged with enforcing the reporting requirements has very little staff or state funding to carry out this law along with its other duties, Cobb-Hunter said.
She’s referring to the former minority affairs commission, which the Legislature renamed the State Commission for Community Advancement and Engagement in May as part of a law responding to a federal lawsuit.
How many states agencies complied with the reporting rules in the past could not be determined.
As of Thursday morning, the commission did not provide the Gazette records requested last Friday on fiscal years other than 2024-25. The commission also did not provide information on how many businesses are certified in South Carolina as minority owned.
However, a search of businesses registered with the state procurement office showed about 540 companies as minority owned.
The law also provided tax credits to private companies that hired minority-owned subcontractors to help fulfill government contracts.
Just nine firms statewide applied for that credit on their 2023 taxes, according to data from the state tax agency.
According to Stephen Gilchrist, founder and chairman of the South Carolina African American Chamber of Commerce, only about 10% of the organization’s more than 2,000 members have benefited from minority certification.
And about eight years ago, the chamber stopped recommending the program altogether.
Gilchrist said his members were spending enormous amounts of time participating in seminars.
“What I found is that it was just a lot of hope,” he said. “Window dressing rather than a real opportunity to do business with the government.”
Gilchrist believes minority-owned companies have actually had more luck getting state contracts without bothering with a certification.
At the same time, Gilchrist is not suggesting there shouldn’t be a system in place to track whether minority-owned companies are earning a fair share of taxpayer-funded contracts. But until the order went out, he said, no one in state government had ever asked him about the effectiveness of existing state law.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_4773-1024x778.jpg,,,2025-12-11 10:57:32.083264

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Lacking the usual amount of data to guide them, federal fishery managers relied on last year’s reports to set the coming year’s harvests for the nation’s top-volume commercial fish species: Alaska pollock.
The North Pacific Fishery Management Council, the panel that sets harvest levels and other rules for fisheries conducted in federal waters off Alaska, voted on Sunday to keep 2026 pollock catch limits in the Bering Sea at about the same level as this year’s limits while paring back the pollock catch limit for the Gulf of Alaska.
Pollock, one of key species in the North Pacific Ocean, is widely sold as fish patties and fillets, fish sticks, imitation crab meat and other products.
The council, which sets the coming year’s groundfish harvest limits each December, typically bases those decisions on detailed annual Stock Assessment and Fishery Evaluation reports, known as SAFE reports. But this year, the prolonged federal government shutdown prevented National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration scientists and their partners from completing SAFE reports for the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska.
Instead, the council used the 2024 SAFE reports, supplemented with some newer data about harvests completed this year and some preliminary information about ecosystem conditions. The newer information did not reveal any conservation concerns that would justify harvest reductions, the council determined.
Information that goes into SAFE documents comes from ocean surveys and analysis done by NOAA’s Alaska Fisheries Science Center, with cooperation from research partners. Like all years’ SAFE reports, the 2024 documents for the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska featured two-year projections, extending through 2026.
Bob Foy, the center’s director, said that while all of this year’s planned ocean surveys were completed, despite numerous challenges, information from them had not been fully reviewed or vetted.
However, last year’s reports are solid, Foy said.
“Those stock assessments are incredibly robust,” he told the council on Thursday. “What we put together last December was based on decades of information, decades of decisions, piles of information on biology, surveys and whatnot.”
Council members voted to set the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands harvest of pollock at 1.375 million metric tons, slightly below the limit set for 2025. 
Counting all species of groundfish, a category that includes Pacific cod, sablefish, arrowtooth flounder and mackerel as well as pollock, the council set the total Bering Sea and Aleutian harvest limit at 2 million metric tons, unchanged from the 2025 limit.
The council set the Gulf of Alaska pollock harvest limit at 129,749 metric tons, considerably below the 2025 limit of 176,496 metric tons. The total Gulf of Alaska groundfish harvest limit was set at 464,336, compared to the 514,619 metric ton limit set for this year. Less than half of that 2025 limit has been harvested as of early November, according to council data.
Caitlin Yeager, representing owners of catcher-processor trawl vessels that harvest pollock, said the 2024 SAFE report held the “best scientific information available” to set 2026 harvests.

	Yeager, vice president for policy and engagement for the Seattle-based At-sea Processors Association, told the council that its plans for the 2026 pollock harvest were responsible.
“Maintaining these specifications ensures not only continuity but also legal defensibility and avoids the risk of a regulatory lapse that would otherwise halt our fishery operations” next spring, she said in testimony to the council on Saturday.
 Some industry representatives, citing positive indicators turned up by scientists’ surveys this year, argued for an increase in the allowable catch of Gulf of Alaska Pacific cod. The council did not take that step, but members agreed to revisit cod catch limits in the next few months if Alaska Fisheries Science Center scientists are able to provide enough information to warrant an adjustment.
While fishing industry representatives welcomed the council’s decisions, some environmental and community advocates expressed concern. 
Some testifying to the council or submitting written comments argued that catch limits for pollock and other groundfish should be reduced, citing information gaps and the ongoing and controversial incidental catches of river-bound salmon. Those accidental catches are called bycatch.
Megan Williams, fisheries scientist with Ocean Conservancy, was among those urging caution. She noted that this year, the annual ecosystem reports were not completed. That “represents another key data gap in 2026,” she said.
Abbreviated reports available in October contained some “red flags” that justified a more cautious approach to harvest limits, she said. “Data from 2024 and 2025 indicated a return to warm conditions with marine heatwaves occurring in all regions at given points, and reduced sea ice and cold-pool extent in the Bering Sea,” she said. The cold pool is an area of chilled deepwater that usually lingers in the Bering Sea in the summer, separating fish populations in the southern part of the sea from those in the north.
Francis Thompson, president of the Algaaciq Native Village in the Yukon River village of St. Marys, said the council was jumping too far ahead with its projections, not only for the coming year but for the year after that, given lack of information about salmon and other issues.
“It amazes me that you guys are already projecting 2026 and 2027 for allowable harvest of pollock,” he said in testimony on Saturday.
It is not fair that industrial fishing operators in the Bering Sea are allowed to continue their harvests at steady levels, he said, while subsistence users on the Yukon and elsewhere in Western Alaska have been forced to stop fishing because of low runs. The subsistence fishers account for only about 1 percent of the salmon catch, at most, but are bearing all the conservation burden, he said.
“We’re not going to be fishing for a while. And many of the folks in our area, the 1 percent that have put aside their fishing to save the resource for the escapement, are tired,” he said.
Escapement is the term used to describe salmon that reach their freshwater spawning grounds, allowing them to reproduce.
The council did not take action on salmon bycatch. Limits on Chinook bycatch already exist for the pollock fleet, and action on a chum salmon bycatch limit is scheduled to be taken at the council’s next meeting, to be held in February.
Council member Anne Vanderhoeven, during Sunday’s deliberations, said there is not yet any justification to reduce pollock harvests to conserve depressed runs of salmon in Western Alaska.
“The impacts of the salmon crisis are truly devastating to subsistence users and Alaska Native culture,” she said. “But the best scientific information available does not support the assertion that relatively small adjustments to the pollock (total allowable catch) will measurably or significantly increase salmon escapement to Western Alaska rivers.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/DSC09693-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-11 10:57:32.083264

Starting in 2026, Missouri is set to stop allowing SNAP benefits to be used to purchase candy, prepared desserts, soda, beverage mixes, juices and punches that are 50% or less natural fruit or vegetable juice, and concentrates intended to be made into drinks that are 50% or less natural fruit or vegetable juice.
The Missouri Department of Social Services filed the waiver request with the USDA Food and Nutrition Service in late September. The USDA administers the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program on the federal level.
According to the waiver request, the state anticipates implementing the change on Oct. 1, 2026.
U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke L. Rollins and U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced the approval of Missouri’s waiver on Wednesday.
Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe asked the state Department of Social Services to file the request.
“We are incredibly thankful for Secretary Rollins’ approval of our waiver,” Kehoe said in a news release from the USDA. “Missouri is proud to partner with the Trump administration on the Make America Healthy Again movement as we refocus SNAP to maximize nutritional health for families while also supporting the abundant agricultural output of our state.”
The USDA also approved waiver requests for Hawaii, North Dakota, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia. The waiver requests, including Missouri’s, change the statutory definition of “food for purchase” under SNAP.

(Grace Hills for Kansas Reflector) TOPEKA — In California, a group of immigrants is suing CoreCivic, alleging inhumane conditions with inadequate food and water, failure to offer adequate medical care and denying access to counsel.
In Tennessee, multiple lawsuits have accused the company of failing to keep detainees safe. In April, a jury awarded $28 million to a prisoner who was severely beaten by another inmate who had previously assaulted 11 other prisoners, according to Tennessee Lookout. 
Reports like these raise concerns for Leavenworth-area residents and activists, who point to mismanagement and problems in CoreCivic’s Leavenworth facility before it closed in 2021.
CoreCivic applied Monday to receive a special use permit from Leavenworth to reopen its prison as a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainee center, called the Midwest Regional Reception Center.
City manager Scott Peterson has said the special permitting process would allow Leavenworth officials to address concerns about how the facility operates. Generally, cities have broad abilities to impose additional requirements on a special use permit as long as they are applicable to the property’s use, he said. 
On Tuesday, 19 people spoke during a public comment session at the standing-room only Leavenworth City Council meeting to share their concerns about CoreCivic and ask the city to deny the company’s special use permit application.

“I’m here tonight to ask and encourage you to continue defending Leavenworth from the historic mismanagement and negligence of CoreCivic and to do what you can to block CoreCivic and ICE from opening a detention center here in our community,” said James Gillcrist, an Iraq War veteran who spoke at the meeting.
Gillcrist said the current political situation is triggering strong emotions in him and his fellow veterans.
“This past July I spent a week in the high-risk suicide wing of the VA psych ward after snapping at an immigration court in Kansas City. I can say with confidence that the actions of ICE are re-traumatizing a community of veterans that was already estimated to suffer over 150,000 suicides over the next decade,” Gillcrist said.
“That number will only increase as ICE continues to patrol our streets, hunting down people who, like the Iraqi families I saw in the Sunni triangle, were simply born in the wrong time, in the wrong place, in conditions most Americans can neither imagine nor fathom,” he added.
Elizabeth Collier, who lives in nearby Independence, Missouri, told the council she worries constantly that her mother, who is from Peru, may be picked up by ICE.
“She has the crime of an accent,” Collier said. “Even though she’s a citizen, I wonder every day if my mom makes it home safe, and thank God for iPhone and ‘find my iPhone,’ I’m able to check. But this doesn’t feel like something that is right. This government overreach that others have already experienced in other areas feels like it’s going to come to this area.”
Collier said CoreCivic’s presence in Leavenworth won’t just affect that city but will leech into other areas.
“That’s what I just want to share with you guys, is this feeling of fear, of not knowing — that I’ve already lost my father, if I will lose my mother to completely preventable situations, and you guys are the ones that can prevent it,” she said.
 
The background
Leavenworth’s disagreement with Nashville-based CoreCivic — which led to at least four court cases — began in February, when CoreCivic stopped working with the city to receive a special use permit. Instead, the company said it didn’t need the permit to reopen its facility, which pushed Leavenworth officials to file a lawsuit to stop the company from reopening without it.
CoreCivic’s desire to reopen is based on a $60 million annual ICE contract to house 1,033 immigrant detainees in the Leavenworth facility. The contract is not enforceable until legal actions are settled, though.
The company’s stock, traded on the New York Stock Exchange as CXW, hit a five-year high in November because of the ICE contracts it has received.
After a recent loss in court, CoreCivic is back with a new permit application.
Brian Todd, CoreCivic spokesman, said in an email that the company is “firmly committed to operating a safe, transparent and accountable facility.”
He said the decision to file for the special use permit was an effort to meet the urgent needs of the federal government with respect to its immigration enforcement efforts. Todd emphasized that the company still believes it should be able to operate without an SUP.
“We’re hopeful in following the SUP process as the City has instructed, that they will in turn process our application in a fair and timely manner and work collaboratively to reach a positive and mutually beneficial resolution,” he said.
CoreCivic attorney Taylor Hausmann told a district court judge in June that even though the company had meetings with the city at the end of 2024 to apply for a permit, CoreCivic never believed it needed one.

Hausmann said CoreCivic withdrew its application because the city was required to hold a hearing within 60 days and that “unilaterally and without any stated reason or any basis in its regulations, the city moved that original meeting to outside the 60-day time zone that violates the city’s regulations.”
“It became clear to CoreCivic that there was not a cooperative relationship happening there, and thus CoreCivic fell back on its position that it was not required to have it, and that this was not going to work, to move together cooperatively,” she said.
 
Worries continue
Leavenworth activists and area residents are concerned the city’s development process won’t be able to ensure that CoreCivic treats detainees and employees well, a concern that has been borne out in other communities.
“My biggest concerns, in general, are that we’re going to see the same CoreCivic that we have prior to them closing, that they’re still going to be mistreating people within their facility, whether it’s the workers or the migrants that are being detained,” said Ashley Hernandez, organizing and policy coordinator with the Sisters of Charity of Leavenworth, in an interview with Kansas Reflector.
Unfortunately, national reports indicate that CoreCivic won’t behave any differently, she said.
“We see a lot coming out of Trousdale in Tennessee and how CoreCivic interacts with other municipal governments similarly to how they interacted with the Leavenworth government by trying to bypass them and do their thing without any oversight,” she said.
Hernandez is hopeful the special use permit will include oversight requirements and would give the city the power to rescind the permit.
In court filings, the city’s attorneys listed failure to cooperate with local police as one of the difficulties the company previously created in Leavenworth. They opened their first filing with a quote from U.S. District Judge Julie Robinson, who called the Leavenworth facility “an absolute hell hole.”
“Guards are being traumatized. Guards have been almost killed. Detainees are being traumatized with assaults and batteries, and not long ago a detainee was killed,” Robinson wrote in a court order.
Hernandez said the Sisters of Charity of Leavenworth wants accountability.
“We want the city to make sure that CoreCivic is maintaining human dignity and civil rights standards within the facility,” she said.
Justin Young, who is on the Carceral Accountability Council, said he’s pleased the city has retained its power to affect the situation.
The council was formed in 2024 when CoreCivic announced it would reopen the local facility as an ICE detention center, Young said. The group advocated for CoreCivic to follow the city’s development process.
Now, Young said, they want the city to recognize that CoreCivic is not a “trustworthy” community partner.
“They don’t have the history of a well-managed and humane organization. They don’t have accountability. They lack transparency,” he said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Overflow-note-Trump-hat-top-left_-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-12-11 09:58:57.937580

Democratic primary.Durham County Commissioner Nida Allam is challenging incumbent US Rep. Valerie Foushee in North Carolina’s 4th District Democratic primary in what may turn out to be a rematch of the 2022 race.  
Allam has been a Durham County commissioner for five years, and served as chair from 2023 until this month. She was the first Muslim woman elected to office in the state. She’s now vice-chair of the board.
“I’m running for Congress because in a moment when our community faces dueling crises of Republican authoritarianism and corporate billionaire greed, we need leaders in Washington who will actually fight to deliver the brighter future we deserve and desperately need,” Allam said in a statement.
Her campaign announcement included endorsements from U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont); David Hogg, president of Leaders We Deserve, an organization that aims to elect young progressives to Congress; the Sunrise Movement, a youth organization battling climate change; and the Working Families Party.  
The national progressive political action committee Justice Democrats, a group that backed candidates like Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar, is also backing Allam. 
Mary Patterson of Durham has also filed to run in the Democratic primary. 
Foushee, a fixture in Orange County politics, defeated Allam and a half dozen other candidates in a crowded field to win the Democratic primary in 2022. Foushee won about 46% of the 2022 primary vote, with Allam placing second with about 37%. 
Foushee went on to win her first congressional term in 2022 in the heavily Democratic district that includes Orange and Durham counties and parts of Chatham and Wake. She ran unopposed in last year’s primary and easily won reelection to a second term. 
However, the former state senator’s tenure has not been without controversy.
Foushee was criticized in 2022 for accepting contributions from the pro-Israel lobbying group American Israel Public Affairs Committee, known as AIPAC.  The state Democratic Party’s progressive caucus pulled its endorsement from Foushee that year because AIPAC supported Republicans who voted against certifying the 2020 presidential election. 
AIPAC was Foushee’s top campaign contributor in 2022, bundling donations topping $2 million, Indy Week has reported. 
Foushee faced another round of criticism for her 2024 trip to Israel, paid for by an AIPAC affiliate, where she and other members of Congress met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. A Foushee campaign spokesperson told Indy Week in August that Foushee will not accept AIPAC contributions for the 2026 election. 
A photo of Foushee in a group posing with Netanyahu is one of the images that flashes through Allam’s first congressional campaign video of the season. 
“When right-wing and corporate PACs fund our politicians, they buy silence,” Allam says in the video. “I’m not taking a cent from AIPAC, crypto mega-donors, or corporate PACs,” she says. “You can’t serve them and fight for working families.”
Foushee did not immediately respond to NC Newsline’s request for comment.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ValerieFoushee-and-Nida-Allam.jpg,,,2025-12-11 09:58:57.937580

Workers and families were forced to adapt to new risks and respond to changing guidance. Meanwhile, the government had to spring into action to protect people and mitigate damage caused by the emerging health crisis. 
Hindsight is 20/20, and these days it’s easy to see all the things we could have done differently. This is especially true when it comes to how unemployment benefits were administered during the pandemic. 
Now, Michigan’s Unemployment Insurance Agency (UIA) has started collecting nearly $2.7 billion it overpaid to 350,000 claimants during the confusion of the pandemic after a court order pausing collections due to agency errors expired in September.
When workers lost their jobs during the pandemic, they were told to apply for unemployment. Millions of affected Michiganders flooded the state’s unemployment insurance (UI) system. They were met with confusing forms, shifting rules and a flawed online benefit system. Due to changing rules surrounding pandemic assistance, it was unclear as to who qualified and workers received incorrect or misleading instructions from the government. 
Workers were scared and confused, and they needed income to care for themselves and their families. Following the advice of state leaders, they applied for benefits, believing that they would only receive a payment if they were eligible. But that isn’t what happened. 
Michigan’s UIA distributed pandemic-era unemployment benefits using expanded criteria that did not comply with new federal guidelines. Other eligibility issues that should have been flagged earlier fell through the cracks because of the massive flood of claims. This allowed benefits to be paid to claimants who were not eligible, even if they had acted in good faith when they responded to the questions asked by the agency. 
Workers did their best to respond to the confusing questions asked of them, sometimes collecting for weeks or months before the UIA finally declared them ineligible. The UIA would go on to waive large sums of overpayments that were a result of its own errors. However, hundreds of thousands more remain, and many now find themselves facing huge bills from the UIA that they cannot afford. 
During the pandemic, workers across the country were forced to file for unemployment when the economy shut down. Now, nearly five years later, the state is looking to claw that money back from thousands of Michiganders already battling rising costs and struggling to care for their families and loved ones during the holiday season. 
Those workers deserve better.
Fortunately, lawmakers are taking steps to stop it. On Dec. 9, the Michigan Senate passed Senate Bill 700 with unanimous, bipartisan approval. The bill limits the UIA from collecting improperly paid benefits three or more years after a worker stops receiving benefits. The bill also requires the UIA to notify a claimant when they become eligible for a time-based waiver and allows workers to apply for the waiver and seek an appeal. If passed, the new law would be effective on all claims made on or after Feb. 1, 2020. 
Effectively, SB 700 would resolve nearly all pandemic-era overpayments. It would allow workers who applied for unemployment benefits in good faith during one of the darkest periods in our history to finally have peace of mind. And it is an important step toward restoring trust in Michigan’s scandal-ridden unemployment agency. 
What the bill doesn’t do is let those who defrauded the system off the hook. The time limits presented in SB 700 explicitly exclude cases where the overpayment was the result of a claimant committing fraud. 
It is critical that SB 700 passes through the Michigan House as quickly as possible. The UIA’s position is that they have a fiduciary obligation to collect overpayments, despite provisions in our law that prevent collections that are against “equity and good conscience.” Should they continue their pursuit of pandemic-era overpayments, thousands of Michiganders could face debts potentially totaling in the tens of thousands of dollars. If they cannot pay, these workers could ultimately see money taken from their tax refunds, or garnishment of their wages or even their bank accounts.
The UIA’s efforts to collect on old overpayments will be disastrous for working Michiganders and will have little impact on the most egregious fraudsters in international criminal organizations. The UIA has made mistakes in the past in its pursuit of Great Recession overpayments and fraud, and there were many issues with the implementation of pandemic-era unemployment assistance. 
Now we have to ask ourselves why the workers — who only did as they were told — are the ones asked to pay when the state makes a mistake? 
Let’s not make another mistake by putting a $2.7 billion burden on Michigan workers and their families. Passing SB 700 sets a time limit on overpayments, provides relief to Michigan workers directly impacted by the pandemic and helps to start to close this dark chapter in our history.

Over the past decade, the number of people dying on California’s roads have shot up dramatically. Nearly 40,000 people have died and more than 2 million have been injured.
And California’s leaders have done little about it. 
CalMatters investigative reporters Robert Lewis and Lauren Hepler have spent the year detailing how the state allows dangerous drivers to stay on the road, with deadly consequences. In the latest installment of their License to Kill series today, they write:
Year after year, officials with the power to do something about it — the governor, legislators, the courts, the Department of Motor Vehicles — have failed to act. 
The silence, in the face of a threat that endangers nearly every Californian, is damning.
Colin Campbell, a writer and director in Los Angeles, lost his two teenage children after a repeat drunk driver slammed into his Prius on the way to the family’s new home in Joshua Tree. He then began advocating for California to join most other states and create a law requiring in-car breathalyzers for anyone convicted of a DUI.
The ACLU opposed the measure, calling it “a form of racialized wealth extraction.” The DMV told lawmakers that it could not “complete the necessary programming” for the law. 
So the bill was gutted. California couldn’t do something that nearly three dozen other states could. 

Campbell: “Our lives were destroyed that night. If these people’s children had been killed by a drunk driver, there is no way they would be objecting to this.”

Steve Gordon, whom Gov. Gavin Newsom picked to run the DMV in 2019, won’t talk about the rise in deaths. He has declined or ignored CalMatters requests for an interview.

Duplexes matter, too, argues pro-development group

From CalMatters housing reporter Ben Christopher:
State and local lawmakers have hastened to make it easier, quicker and cheaper to rebuild after the L.A. fires — with a glaring exception. 
In July, Newsom issued an executive order suspending a law to allow homeowners to split their properties in two and build duplexes on each parcel in very high-risk zones within the L.A. fire footprints.
Newsom’s decision came at the urging of L.A. Mayor Karen Bass, former reality TV star Spencer Pratt and many hill dwellers who argued that packing more homes into fire-prone hills could clog evacuation routes.
The pro-development legal advocacy group, YIMBY Law, sued Newsom on Wednesday, along with Bass and local governments across the region, arguing that they overstepped their constitutional authority.
YIMBY Law Director Sonja Trauss said in a statement that suspending the law “raises the barrier of who gets to come back at all.”



Judge calls Trump admin’s position ‘shocking’

In a loss to President Donald Trump’s administration, a federal judge on Wednesday ordered the California National Guard out of L.A. and its troops to be returned under Newsom’s control, writes CalMatters’ Nigel Duara.
U.S. District Court Judge Charles Breyer in San Francisco issued the order, writing that it is “profoundly un-American to suggest that people peacefully exercising their fundamental right to protest constitute a risk justifying the federalization of military forces.”
Breyer also disagreed with the administration’s argument that it should be permitted to perpetually, and without review, federalize a state’s National Guard, calling it “shocking.” 
In June, Trump federalized the California National Guard in response to protests against federal immigration raids in Southern California. He then mobilized troops in other Democratic-led cities, such as Chicago and Portland. The L.A. case is one of several lawsuits challenging Trump’s National Guard deployments, with one case currently before the U.S. Supreme Court. 
Breyer’s order goes into effect on Monday at noon, at which time the administration can file an appeal.

,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-12-11 13:46:41+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,Primary care spending proposal sets the stage for legislative action in 2026,Chris Lisinski,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/health-care/primary-care-spending-proposal-sets-the-stage-for-legislative-action-in-2026/,Pressure will rise on the Legislature to take action after a panel created to review primary care reforms coalesced around a “fundamental rebalancing” of how the state spends money on health.,"LAWMAKERS APPEAR INCREASINGLY likely to vote next year, at least in the Senate, on reshaping health care practices to funnel more money toward the front lines. 
A panel of health care experts is ready to recommend establishing a state benchmark that calls for at least a doubling of the share of health care spending in Massachusetts on primary care. The proposal would call for the share of primary care spending to be ramped up to that level over the next five years, putting a specific target and timeline on paper for the first time. 
With that, by the time legislators gavel in for the first time in 2026, they will have in hand a potential road map for navigating one of the thorniest health care issues facing the state — the desperate shortage of primary care providers. 
They will also have the pressure to act, and the political headaches, that come with it. 
Sen. Cindy Friedman, the Senate’s point person on most health care matters, said she expects a vote on some form of primary care reforms next year. 
“I’ve got no indication that there is not a will to do this, at least in the Senate, in 2026,” she told CommonWealth Beacon. 
Primary care is the linchpin of the health care network, the entry point where patients can get preventive services that head off more expensive care from specialists or emergency departments further downstream. 
It’s also the area of health care most in crisis. Massachusetts has a shrinking primary care workforce, making it more difficult for people to get appointments. One national study published in June estimated a patient in the Boston area faced an average wait of 69 days when booking a physical with a new provider, the longest among 15 cities surveyed. 
Beacon Hill convened a task force to examine the pressure points and to report back with specific actions lawmakers could take to bring care back within reach for more people. 
The panel, of which Friedman is a member, is finalizing a recommendation that the Legislature codify a new primary care spending target. Members largely agreed last week on the general framework: they want Beacon Hill either to double the share of health care spending on primary care or to require 15 percent of health care dollars to go toward primary care, whichever is greater, over a five-year implementation period.  
Primary care made up only about 6.7 percent of all commercial health spending in 2023, the most recent year with data available. Doubling that share over half a decade would represent a dramatic reorientation. 
That is especially so because the task force does not want to increase total health care spending, either. Higher primary care spending would, under this vision, mean less money for other areas of health care like specialists and pharmaceuticals. 
“Given this difficult environment we’re in where everybody’s broke, grabbing money from anywhere is going to be particularly challenging,” said task force member Barbra Rabson, who is president of the nonprofit research organization Massachusetts Health Quality Partners. 
David Seltz, executive director of the state Health Policy Commission, described the proposed spending target as a “fundamental rebalancing of what we care about and value in our health care system.” 
“We need to nudge our system to care and value primary care at a different level than it does right now,” Seltz said at a December 3 task force meeting. “Without government setting those goals and the private sector committing to them, it’s not going to happen on its own.” 
Past attempts to force more money toward primary care have sputtered out on Beacon Hill, and while the wait for reform continues, the situation continues to worsen.  
It could also prove difficult to get the full industry on board if the envisioned resource shift takes money away from pharmaceutical companies, specialists, or the largest academic hospitals, all of which wield considerable lobbying influence. 
Friedman took aim at Big Pharma in particular, noting that pharmacy spending increased 10 percent year-over-year in the latest data. 
“We have to make sure that everybody supports a solution to this, and so far, I would argue, pharmaceutical [companies] and [pharmacy benefit managers] have not actually done anything to help us solve this problem,” she said. 
It’s not clear if House leaders are as eager to force a paradigm change in primary care as their Senate counterparts and Gov. Maura Healey, who nearly a year ago called for creating a “whole army of primary care providers.” 
Setting a target is one thing, and ensuring the health care system meets it is another. 
Members of the task force had that in mind. Their recommendation will also urge the Legislature to empower state agencies such as the Health Policy Commission and the Division of Insurance to hold payers and providers accountable to the proposed spending requirements. 
“I think the message needs to go to the Legislature that you need some teeth behind this,” said Retailers Association of Massachusetts president Jon Hurst. 
That’s another area with a mixed legislative record. Health Policy Commission leaders have spent years asking Beacon Hill to bulk up their authority to enforce cost-control efforts, or to issue more stringent penalties for entities that drive excessive spending growth.  
The Legislature has slow-walked many of those requests, though a pair of laws Healey signed in January boosted the commission’s data-collection and monitoring capabilities. 
The primary care task force is not done with its work. Its recommendation for a spending target is due to Beacon Hill by December 15, and other so-called “deliverables” about reforms to payment models, health plan design, and workforce pipelines have deadlines in March and May. 
Friedman, who described herself as “impatient” to take up legislation, said she does not think lawmakers need to wait until the task force checks off every item before crafting their response. 
“We will have enough important information that we can start this process,” she said. “We’re not going to solve it all in one pass. It’s too big, and too many things need to change or shift. But I think we can do a lot, and we can do it based on what the task force tells us.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/09-17_Caljouw_Friedman_2-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-11 08:56:12.149015

Throughout my decade-long tenure on the board, I had never heard a clearer call to action.  
As the students spoke, some of my own prior background as an educator came to mind. In the 1980s, I was trained by Facing History and Ourselves to deliver Holocaust education in my junior high school classroom. The training offered a deep history, with information about the shifting nature of this pervasive form of hatred and of millennia of antisemitic crimes in Western history. 
I never thought I would hear about such disturbing actions and behaviors scaling up in American public schools. I never imagined our society would abide the pervasiveness, virulence, and quiet acceptance of hatred toward Jews we see today.  
The evidence shared by these courageous young women suggested we face an unprecedented outburst of antisemitism in the United States, which compelled me to explore more deeply. It was not hard to research and confirm that what they were experiencing is widespread and growing.  
In general, behavior in schools has been problematic since the end of the COVID school closures. Young people are bullied in both blatant and subtle ways in real time as you read these words. 
Have we forgotten Carl Walker Hoover and Phoebe Prince, two Massachusetts young people who lost their lives to bullying about 15 years ago? Carl’s mother, Sirdeaner Walker was one of the most committed and effective advocates against bullying Massachusetts has ever seen. Through her powerful leadership, the intervention of the Legislature, and the commitment of state and school leaders across the Commonwealth, effective anti-bullying responses and practices were developed. 
Students of every description benefited for years. On the whole, real improvements were made at that time. School leaders understood that they cannot be idle or respond with half measures. But after the reopening of schools post-COVID, there’s plenty of evidence that responses and practices have been less effective, and many of the gains of the past are lost.  
A state education board in the United States is not going to resolve a conflict  halfway around the world. But our state education board can and must lead clearly and unequivocally when specific groups of students are being mistreated and the response at schools and districts is proving inadequate. We have a duty to ensure that the students, their families, and the entire education community of Massachusetts know the call to action is heard and taken with the utmost seriousness.   
Following the November meeting, our chair promptly convened a panel, which soon afterward more deeply informed our board and the state education department about the widening extent of the situation. Not long afterward, on its own initiative, the Legislature convened a commission to expose in detail the unprecedented level of antisemitic conduct occurring in the Commonwealth and recommend how it must be addressed.  
The Special Commission on Combatting Antisemitism did a thorough and commendable job. The commission’s hearings revealed that antisemitism is often omitted from established anti-bullying practices that protect other vulnerable groups. Recently, it produced a range of recommended actions for the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. 
Many of the commission’s K-12 recommendations expressly pertain to every form of hate, bias, and discrimination, suggesting best practices for Jewish members of school communities, and applicable to every student. The state education department must follow up with vigor and as a top priority. I was very pleased to hear Commissioner Pedro Martinez commit to do just that at the Board’s September 2025 meeting. 
A notably contentious item has been the recommendation that the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of antisemitism, published in 2005, be used by public school personnel. The commissioners understood that if they intend to assist educators unfamiliar with the issues, they need to provide a common definition as an essential tool.   
A September 2025 Washington Post poll found that in the last year, 42 percent of Jewish Americans avoided wearing material that would show their Jewish identity. Nearly half said they perceive a lot of antisemitism in the US, and fewer than 20 percent feel very safe. This unprecedented environment makes Jewish students more vulnerable and encourages potential perpetrators.  Educators clearly must have all the assistance they can get to manage it.   
The IHRA definition of antisemitism is the obvious and established resource to turn to. The Antisemitism Commission hardly had a viable alternative. Trying to craft a new definition wasn’t a practical option. Part of the commission’s statutory charge is to “make recommendations for the implementation of the United States National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism.” This 2023 Biden administration guide recognizes the IHRA definition as a prominent tool embraced by United States agencies. The IHRA Definition was endorsed by the Massachusetts governor in a 2022 executive order. The commission was following precedent and the law. 
The IHRA definition has been critiqued as a threat to free speech and open expression by some who fear it conflates any criticism of Israel with antisemitic speech. However, its text says outright that “criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic.” 
Free speech and open expression are important, especially in educational settings. Experienced educators have long balanced the urgent need to ensure safe and welcoming school environments against the values of free expression.  Our more experienced administrators and properly trained personnel can manage, and not misuse, the IHRA definition. They should be trusted to use this tool with good judgment and discernment when it is needed.    
The recommendations of the antisemitism commission focus on Jewish students, because that is they who have an unprecedented need for timely, effective intervention.  It is reasonable to hope that effective implementation will refocus and revive very good past practices in all Massachusetts schools.
Action now can ultimately spare all students, not only Jewish students, from the consequences of hateful and bullying behaviors. Anything less than an immediate and urgent response by the state education department and local officials in every school community is unacceptable.

Nick Fuentes recently complained to Tucker Carlson about “organized Jewry” and Young Republicans think it’s normal to call someone “a fat stinky Jew.”  
Under pressure from national figures like JD Vance and Elon Musk (himself a dabbler in antisemitism), the Anti-Defamation League scrubbed right-wing hate groups from its website and abandoned its commitment to civil rights. Trump’s Coast Guard no longer classifies swastikas as hate symbols. A right-wing movement that announced itself with phrases like “The Jews will not replace us” is reaching the highest levels of politics. 
You might expect a state commission on antisemitism to make something of these developments. You would be disappointed.  
The Massachusetts State Commission on Combatting Antisemitism’s final report gives not a single paragraph of concentrated attention to ethnonationalism and right-wing antisemitism. Instead, it obsesses about criticism of Israel, while recommending a repressive medley of policies, like anonymous government hotlines, police initiatives, and new speech and protest restrictions. The commission’s primary interest is policing speech about Israel, not protecting American Jews. 
The problem is not just the commission’s embrace of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of antisemitism. That definition so hopelessly confuses criticism of Israel with antisemitism that even its lead drafter, Kenneth Stern, has repeatedly spoken out against its use for law and policy. It is a disaster for educational contexts. No wonder Donald Trump loves it. 
The deeper problem is that the commission wants antisemitism to be what people feel it to be. Whenever “many or most Jewish people” “feel unsafe” then statements are presumptively antisemitic.  
Since many Jews consider Israel or Zionism to be an intrinsic part of their identity, criticism of Israel or Zionism makes them feel attacked as Jews. It does not matter if the speaker is expressing a political opinion. “Irrespective of intent,” says the commission, everyone must defer to the “impact” on the hearer. 
We have been here before. Siding with “many or most Jews” invites the government to police Jewish identity itself. For instance, about 40 percent of American Jews think Israel is committing a genocide. Are those Jews presumptively antisemitic because those accusations make other Jews feel “unwelcome or unsafe”? What about the 75 percent of Jews who think Trump is using those fears about antisemitism as an excuse to limit speech and attack enemies? 
Many of those Jews worry we make antisemitism worse when we associate the fight against antisemitism with attacks on education or the curtailment of civil liberties. The commission manages a handful of empty, cosmetic sentences about any of this. 
It is doubtful the report’s authors even believe “impact” on hearers has priority over speaker’s “intent.” They say we have to take antisemitism “just as seriously as we take discrimination, harassment, bias and hate against other vulnerable minorities or nationalities.” So what about when the impact of pro-Israel speech on “other vulnerable minorities” like Palestinians, Muslims, or Arabs makes them feel “unwelcome and unsafe”? Is the commission ready to prohibit that speech?  
Whether out of bad faith or thoughtlessness, the report never considers this obvious question. While claiming they want Jews to have the same protections as other minorities, the report communicates the opposite. In practice, the commission is committed to Jewish exceptionalism. The report’s concern is not with universal rights but with how anti-Israel speech makes some Jews feel. 
This approach can only make antisemitism worse. It distracts from the interests that Jews share with all minorities in vigorous civil rights guarantees. No commission seriously concerned with antisemitism should be pitting Jews against other minorities in this way.  
The report tries to justify giving special attention to how criticism of Israel is presumptively antisemitic because of the “current local and global context since the horrific October 7th attacks.”  
Reading the report, you would think the only thing that happened of any relevance in the last two years were those horrific attacks. You would have no idea that students were being apprehended on street corners, scholars disciplined and fired, noncitizens refused visas or deported, universities denied funding or forced into punitive agreements, all for the kind of speech about Israel that the commission wants to discipline.  
You would not know some of those punished were Jews. Relative to Israel-related speech, the commission barely acknowledges intensifying right-wing antisemitism, nor does it mention the Christian nationalist playbook informing the Trump administration’s weaponization of fears about antisemitism for political purpose. The report can’t even incorporate the many Jewish groups who criticized Israel for killing at least 70,000 Palestinians, including tens of thousands of Palestinian children.  
If you ignore all of that “local and global context,” then most criticism of Israel might seem like picking on a Jewish state for being Jewish. Or you might think free speech concerns are just insensitive handwringing and that Jews are united in identifying with Israel. But you could only believe that if you have not read a paper since October 8, 2023. Or if you only watched Fox News.  
As an effort to construct a context for thinking about antisemitism in America, the report reads like someone who did the first day’s reading and then missed every other class. 
Even when the report gets things right it then gets them wrong. For instance, the commission accurately notes that it can be antisemitic to “call upon Jews to explain the actions of the Israeli government because they are Jewish” or to “hold Jews collectively responsible for the conduct of the Israeli government.” Yet the commission promotes that very way of thinking by emphasizing how central Israel is to Jewish identity when  determining what counts as antisemitic.  
So on the one hand, the commission wants everyone to shape their thinking and behavior around the assumption that Jews identify with Israel, while on the other hand the commission wants to condemn as antisemitic anyone who acts on that very assumption.  
The final report doubles down on an anti-democratic and unpopular approach. This is just the kind of right-wing vision of identity, education, and democracy that voters have already started repudiating. This is not the Massachusetts Way.

We come to the work from very different backgrounds. I grew up in Morocco, the daughter of a Muslim father and Christian mother. Arno is a former neo-Nazi skinhead from Wisconsin.  
I came to this mission after years of working in counseling and group therapy in juvenile detention centers and dual-diagnosis units. I began my career intervening with North African immigrants trafficked into sex work in Europe.  
Arno became deeply involved in the white power movement as a teenager, believing white people were under threat from a shadowy conspiracy led by the Jews. Years later, fueled by love for his daughter, sobriety, and forgiveness shown by those he had once hated, Arno turned from a life of hate and began sharing his story with others vulnerable to falling into extremism.  
As Arno said during his testimony, “The work I do today is done with the intention of helping others avoid making the mistakes that I made.”   
Arno now works with me as an interventionist at Parents for Peace, where we work to deliver evidence-based interventions to prevent extremism and build stronger communities. We’ve partnered with some of the leading schools and organizations in the country to root out antisemitism and extremism. 
We followed the commission’s work closely over the past year and, given the alarming surge in antisemitism we have witnessed since October 7, 2023, were disappointed by some of the criticism sent its way.  
One critique we heard was that a proposed anonymous reporting hotline would chill speech, making students afraid to criticize Israel for fear of being labeled antisemitic. In reality, those of us working in extremism intervention know that bias reporting systems are important tools for victims to come forward. With the right oversight protections, hotlines don’t stifle debate – they amplify voices that might otherwise go unheard.  
We believe the commission got it right by calling for the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education to establish a statewide bias reporting program with an anonymous reporting option, recommending it provide information about how complainants can access support services, and for annual reporting about the number of incidents to be made public. 
This isn’t theoretical. The need is urgent. At Parents For Peace, our helpline for those worried about their family members becoming radicalized is at capacity, with calls coming in at a level we’ve never seen before. These call lines offer people a safe, confidential way to come forward. The injustice isn’t someone feeling like a reporting system will chill their speech, it’s a victim of hate feeling they have no avenue to come forward.   
Critics had also suggested that, with the commission’s focus, Jews are being singled out for special treatment, an argument that ignores both history and reality. Here’s what we see every day in our work: antisemitism is the most common thread in most forms of extremism that we encounter, making it one of the most adaptable, and therefore virulent forms of hate we see. Naming the problem and making recommendations to address it isn’t exceptionalism. It’s the overdue recognition of a distinct threat.  
Parents for Peace addresses all forms of extremism—white supremacy, Islamist, eco-terrorism, and far-left violence. After a decade of interventions to help people leave hate behind, we see over and over that the common thread connecting all extremist groups is antisemitism. That is why antisemitism must be understood as a distinct danger and a gateway into other forms of hate. 
The two of us are heartened that the commission voted unanimously to approve its final report, which includes many more critical and practical recommendations for comprehensively addressing antisemitism statewide. It’s an important step towards rooting out the scourge of antisemitism in our schools, campuses, and workplaces. 
We know from our own lives that antisemitism doesn’t stay contained. Left unchecked, it metastasizes. We must confront antisemitism with interventions that work. The state commission offers reasonable, practical, common-sense safeguards against allowing yesterday’s hate to masquerade as today’s education.

The stakes could not be higher. Real antisemitism is rising, fueled primarily by white supremacists and Christian nationalists. But at the same time, accusations of antisemitism are being weaponized to justify crackdowns on universities, unions, and free speech.  
The Heritage Foundation’s Project Esther provides an explicit blueprint for this strategy, and the state commission’s recommendations—whether intentionally or not—align disturbingly well with it.  
The stated goal of Project Esther is to take down the Palestine solidarity movement, targeting free speech, unions, educators, universities, and all civic spaces where there is support for Palestine. Its foundational claim is that the US is experiencing a “virulently anti-Israel, anti-Zionist and anti-American ‘pro-Palestinian movement'” that supports Hamas.   
The commission’s genesis reveals the problem. State Sen. Cynthia Creem has said that the effort was encouraged by Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt. This matters because the ADL has undergone a troubling transformation.   
In October, the Forward reported that the ADL “has removed entirely from the ‘What We Do’ page of its website a section called ‘Protect Civil Rights.’” The removal, reported Forward, eliminated a passage from the organization’s website that read, “Our founders established ADL with the clear understanding that the fight against any one form of prejudice or hate cannot succeed without countering hate of all forms.” 
The commission has pointed to ADL statistics about the rise of antisemitism, but the data often conflate criticisms of Israel with antisemitism. In 2024 Jewish Currents published a line-by-line analysis of the ADL’s antisemitism audit documenting the extent of the flaws in its methodology. “In addition to identifying more than a thousand items we believe were misclassified as antisemitic—all cases of speech critical of Israel or Zionism,” it reported, “we found that the data included misapplications of the organization’s own standards and often did not provide enough information for us to assess the group’s judgment.”  
Despite extensive testimony about these data flaws, the commission never questioned ADL numbers.  
 Over and over, organizations, subject matter scholars, legal experts, Holocaust survivors, social justice activists, and constituents (many of whom are Jewish) submitted testimony, analyses, documentation, and reports to the commission outlining their concerns. 
While the preamble to the final commission recommendations finally acknowledges a diversity of opinions within the Jewish community and the need to preserve democratic rights, the body of the recommendations entirely ignores the divergence of opinion and contradicts its promise of protecting speech. Not a single footnote references testimony of those who differ from the commission’s dominant narrative.   
The commission’s recommendations center on the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of antisemitism—the Trump administration’s preferred weapon for campus investigations. This is alarming for several reasons.  
Because of the ways that the definition has been used to suppress speech, its key author, Kenneth Stern, has warned about its implementation, In a September essay titled “A Bad Deal: By Adopting the IHRA Definition of Antisemitism, Universities are Sacrificing Academic Freedom,” Stern writes that “proscribing opinions that do not conform to an official definition destroys academic freedom and free speech.” 
The ACLU explicitly warns that the definition threatens First Amendment rights. And, critically, a US District Court judge recently found that the Trump administration used “an unconstitutionally broad definition of antisemitism” as cover for unlawful attacks on universities. 
All of this matters beyond education policy. The commission recommendations create enforcement mechanisms that could suppress protected speech: reporting systems for “problematic curriculum,” specific targeting of teachers’ unions, and language that could enable legal challenges to any criticism of Israeli policy. Organizations like the ADL and Israeli American Civic Action Network are already promoting these recommendations to school districts despite lack of legislative approval. 
Pitfalls of the approach followed by the commission were highlighted in the testimony in June of Alan Solomont, the former US ambassador to Spain and Andorra. Solomont, the former chair of the board of Combined Jewish Philanthropies, the founding dean of the Tisch College of Civic Life at Tufts University, and a respected leader of the Greater Boston Jewish community, warned against the dangers of weaponizing antisemitism and specifically alerted commissioners about Project Esther. 
Ambassador Solomont urged a different path. He recommended using multiple definitional frameworks of antisemitism to “foster informed dialogue without restricting political speech or academic inquiry.” He warned that “democracy protects Jewish Americans. Authoritarianism endangers us. Throughout Jewish history we’ve learned what happens when democratic societies cast aside due process and civil liberties. When governments start labeling certain groups as dangerous and unworthy of basic rights, it rarely stops with the first target.” 
Meanwhile, commissioner Ruth Fuller advised that the IHRA definition of antisemitism was a “lightning rod” whose inclusion should be reconsidered.  
Both were ignored. 
Here’s what many Jews know but the commission won’t acknowledge: Conflating Jewish identity with support for Israel increases antisemitism. By insisting that criticizing Israeli government policy is antisemitic, we make all Jews responsible for those policies. 
Massachusetts legislators must reject the Special Commission on Combating Antisemitism’s current recommendations. Real antisemitism demands a serious response—one that targets white supremacists and Christian nationalists, not student protesters and teachers’ unions. One that protects the civil liberties of all residents, including the many Jews who hold diverse views on Israel and Zionism. One that strengthens democracy rather than enabling its erosion. 
The question isn’t whether to fight antisemitism. It’s how to fight it without sacrificing the democratic rights that actually keep Jewish people—and everyone else—safe.

This project was supported by the USC Annenberg Center for Health Journalism’s National Fellowship and Fund for Reporting on Child Well-Being. 
Before a family begins the process of complying with case plans outlined by agencies in order to keep their children, before protective services intervenes to remove a child, and before a parent sets foot in a courtroom seeking to reunite with their children, child welfare cases begin with a referral 
Last year there were nearly 41,000 referrals to the child protective services (CPS) throughout the state, according to data from the Nevada Department of Family and Child Services (DFCS). 
The bulk of investigations are in Clark County, which received 30,484 referrals for abuse and neglect last year. Clark County Department of Family Services data shows the number was an increase from the previous year which received 29,671 reports. 
Washoe County had 6,478 reports in 2024, up from 6,029 the year before. 
“About 40% from schools, about 20% from law enforcement, about 20% from hospitals, and then the rest come from miscellaneous sources like individual citizens or other folks in the community,” said Ryan Gustafson, the director of the Human Services Agency at Washoe County. 
Families who seek housing assistance or end up at shelters aren’t typically supposed to be referred to CPS, said Amanda Haboush-Deloye, the executive director with Nevada Institute for Children’s Research & Policy. 
Housing instability can be deeply interconnected with Nevada child welfare

“They don’t have to report just based on the fact a family is going to a shelter asking for services,” she said. “Just like if a family shows up and applies for WIC (Womens, Infant and Children program) it doesn’t mean they are going to get a referral.” 
There are some exceptions. 
Washoe County operates a 38-private room facility for families with children called Our Place Shelter. 
If the shelter runs out of space and families have no other housing options, the county can offer to pay for a hotel room. Accepting the assistance to stay in a hotel comes with an automatic referral to child welfare, said Sabrina Sweet, a human services coordinator with Washoe County.
A referral doesn’t mean a child will be removed from their families. 
Even when a CPS case is opened, the county does “everything that we can to not open a court case,” said Tara Sterrett, a human services supervisor with Washoe County. 
At the time of publication, Washoe County was still working on a data request from Nevada Current to determine the number of families who received CPS referrals after being placed in a hotel and if any later led to children being removed. 
There has been a constant waitlist for family rooms at Our Place the last three years, Sweet said.
The number of families have fluctuated from 13 to 38, and the wait for a room can be from three weeks to 12 weeks, she said. 
The county didn’t have any data on how many people declined services and a hotel room because of a referral to CPS.
“We have not done an analysis to that extent, but I will tell you that it is a constant conversation,” Sweet said.
Space and bandwidth
Both Clark and Washoe counties have expanded family shelter spaces since the pandemic, seeing a rise in families experiencing homelessness. 
The high cost of rents and the lack of affordable places to live are driving people into homelessness in Washoe just like the rest of the state – as well as the country.
“One of the biggest barriers is affordable housing, especially for families,” Sterrett said.
The larger the family, the more challenging it becomes for them to find adequate housing.  
“It’s really hard to find an apartment that’s going to be large enough that they’re going to be able to afford and sustain,” Sterrett said. 
Seeing the need, Washoe opened Our Place Shelter in 2020 to offer shelter space to families as well as single adult women. The main homeless resource, the Cares Campus, predominately serves single adults.
“We don’t have any more space” at the Our Place, Sweet said. She was unaware of any plans to increase the budget for case management or expand the facility. 
When Our Place reaches capacity, case workers can offer to pay for motel rooms for families with children. 
Prior to that, the county helped the family find alternative housing options in lieu of a hotel stay, Sweet said. 
“If somebody comes in, we put them on the waitlist, and we try really hard to help them find somewhere else to stay,” Sweet said. “If there’s another family member or somewhere else that the family could stay, then we put them on the wait list, and then they go stay with their family members, or whoever they’ve been staying with.”
There are three case managers that assist families at Our Place. 
“We don’t have the bandwidth to go out into the motels,” Sterrett said. “Once we put them in a motel, we don’t really have the ability to go in and say, ‘Okay, now what is it that’s keeping you from being able to provide for your kids?’” 
Child welfare services are able to come to the hotel to meet with families, do a formal assessment, conduct a safety plan, and determine needs while the family waits for a room to open at Our Place.
The county tries to “not minimize the fact that we are making the referral to CPS, but possibly minimize their fear of making the referral to CPS,” Sweet said.  
Converted motels are keeping hundreds of NV children with their families and out of the system

Homeless services and child welfare services are housed within the same human services agencies, but that often doesn’t matter to families. It’s hard to shake the stigma that comes with a referral to child welfare, Sterrett said.
People hear CPS and “they get scared,” she said. 
“We are still the county, regardless of whether we’re HHS (Health and Human Services) or HSA (Human Services Agency) or CPS or whatever the acronym is, we’re all the county, and that’s scary to people too, and people being willing to accept government assistance in any form sometimes is terrifying,” she said.
In the past, she said they’ve had families placed on the waitlist but opt out of staying at a hotel. The county has then lost contact. 
Paying for the hotels have been “pretty helpful as far as keeping connected with those people, because we lose them when they get on the wait list,” she said. 
Even if families in hotels are being evaluated by CPS, the county will work to find other solutions before removing children to foster care or seeking court involvement, Sterrett said.  
“There might be some allegations about controlled substance use or domestic violence, but we do have grandma,” she said, adding the county would seek to temporarily place the children with family while CPS works with the family. 
More resources needed
Recently, a nine-member family went to the Nevada Institute for Children’s Research & Policy seeking housing assistance.
When reaching out to service providers, Haboush-Deloye would ask if they would refer the family to CPS. 
“If they said yes, I wouldn’t give them the family’s number, because I didn’t want them to lose their kids because they couldn’t find housing,” she said. 
The institute had already done a safety assessment for the family and determined that the children weren’t at risk of any danger. The family just needed a place to stay. 
The organization was eventually able to get the family housed and avoid CPS involvement. 
Haboush-Deloye notes the irony is that sometimes social service providers don’t have the resources to prevent a family from entering homelessness or to address the underlying causes of housing insecurity. 
Once they become unhoused, and potentially come in contact with the child welfare system, then resources open up. 
“Oftentimes when you’re involved in CPS with an open case you have access to resources you don’t normally have,” she said. “You have access to assistance with child care or transportation. The day your day closes, those things go away.”
The problem comes down to a lack of resources in the community, in particular the need for more stable housing and rents people can afford. 
It all comes back to “resources to keep them housed to make sure it’s sustainable and not just temporary,” she said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0096-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-11 08:56:12.149015

(Nevada Department of Corrections photo)Carrying out everyday activities like buying food, checking in with your family, and accessing basic internet services comes at a premium inside Nevada’s prisons — a premium often borne by the families of people living behind bars. 
Despite hard-won legislation in Nevada that has reduced the costs of incarceration by ending room-and-board fees, capping commissary mark-ups, eliminating price gouging on hygiene products,and ending medical debt upon release, the state of Nevada continues to find new and increasingly exploitative ways to charge for almost every aspect of modern life. 
The Nevada Department of Corrections’ (NDOC) new tablet program, a program providing computer tablets to incarcerated people, has become another avenue through which NDOC and its telecommunications partner ViaPath can extract money from a captive population.
The decision to introduce the tablets came after 48 other states already implemented similar programs, giving Nevada examples of successful implementation, including many states that also utilize ViaPath. 
In proposing the program to the state Legislature in 2023, NDOC Director James Dzurenda provided a document with 28 ways that tablets could be used in correctional facilities. Of those 28, only a handful have been put into practice. Notably absent include subscription or bulk options for services, both of which were specified in Nevada’s 2024 regulation. 
The current rate to  access basic entertainment- such as listening to music or watching  movies – is 5 cents per minute. While states such as Minnesota allow incarcerated people the option to make entertainment purchases as an extended subscription, and states such as Illinois offer a bulk rate on credits that can be used for entertainment purchases, the state of Nevada offers no such arrangement.
In fact, the nickel-a-minute rate begins before the movie or music starts, with incarcerated people having to pay just to peruse the options. If subscription or bulk-payment arrangements were made available, there would surely still be individuals who use this “pay-per-minute” model for a variety of reasons, but the absence of these options perpetuates an environment where many feel lied to and where it is clear that profits are the priority, and not justice or fairness. 
An individual who wishes to be identified by his initials D.P. currently serving a sentence at Lovelock Correctional Facility remarked in a phone interview with the Fines and Fees Justice Center that “I really thought that when we read the minutes from the legislative sessions…that there would be a movie option for like $20 for all the movies you could watch a month or even if you bought a bulk rate of credits you could use it at a penny a minute, and none of those turned out to be true.”
The amount of money raked in by ViaPath and the NDOC at the expense of Nevada’s incarcerated population is staggering. The entertainment services, described as low quality by many incarcerated individuals, are offered at prices far beyond what most people would pay for even high-quality service. 
A regular, premium subscription for both Spotify and Netflix costs about $360 a year, for unlimited music and movie streaming – but if an incarcerated person watched one movie and listened to one album a day on those platforms for a year, their costs would total $3,000 – more than 8 times higher. This is further complicated by the impending end of an MP3 program where songs could be purchased for roughly one dollar per song. 
The ability to connect with incarcerated family members and loved ones has been expanded significantly by the introduction of tablets, but the costs for that connection, born by the incarcerated population as well as their loved ones, are too steep.
For example, phone call rates have recently increased 66 percent, rising from 6 cents to 10 cents per minute – and not including additional per-call fees that can cost more than 50 cents on a standard 15-minute phone call. 
In addition to the high costs of communication, expectations have also not been met for other services the director said may be provided. These include better access to mental and spiritual health and support groups, which would be reached through the ability to live-stream religious services and access mental health specialists for virtual appointments. 
The rapid growth of tablet programs across the country suggest that they are here to stay. While the rollout of the program in Nevada has not lived up to expectations, best practices exist; Prison Policy Institute has outlined what needs to happen if a department intends to establish a program that benefits incarcerated individuals and protects their families. Options such as subscriptions and bulk credits on entertainment mirror expectations of modern society and help prevent constant financial exploitation.
The tablet program offers tremendous benefits and opportunity for growth, but the costs of its services unjustly fund the government at the expense of incarcerated people. The public must be vigilant in demanding fairer implementation of the program and the elimination of the harmful tablet fees that distort justice and damage communities.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/lovelockcc.jpg,,,2025-12-11 08:56:12.149015
,California,2025-12-11 13:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,Trump sides with agriculture again in California’s neverending water wars,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/12/trump-california-water-wars-agriculture/,Trump pushed changes at the Central Valley Project — a set of reservoirs and canals supplying water to Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys — pleasing farm groups.,"From the onset of his foray into presidential politics a decade ago, Donald Trump has been obsessed with managing California’s water, often interjecting himself into decades-long conflicts over how the precious commodity should be divvied up.
During his first stint as president, Trump was heavily influenced by the Westlands Water District, a huge agricultural water agency in the San Joaquin Valley that sought more irrigation water for itself and other farm interests.
That relationship led to an extremely controversial contract that guaranteed Westlands as much as 1 million acre-feet of water each year from the federal Central Valley Project, solidifying the district’s supply situation. Lacking water rights, Westlands had historically depended on temporary contracts to meet members’ demands.
The new contract angered environmental groups because it threatened to reduce flows through the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta for wildlife habitat. The groups sued and won rulings against the contract in trial and appellate courts.
After Trump moved back into the White House in January, he immediately picked up where he left off, issuing an order to federal water officials to maximize deliveries in California.
He also complained that a shortage of water deliveries to Southern California was a factor in the rapid spread of deadly wildfires in Los Angeles County, claiming that the state’s efforts to protect “an essentially worthless fish called a smelt” was at fault.
“Governor Gavin Newscum refused to sign the water restoration declaration put before him that would have allowed millions of gallons of water, from excess rain and snow melt from the North, to flow daily into many parts of California, including the areas that are currently burning in a virtually apocalyptic way,” Trump wrote on his social media site, Truth Social.
Newsom’s office rebuked the claim, saying, “There is no such document as the water restoration declaration – that is pure fiction.”
Meanwhile, Trump’s executive order pushed the Bureau of Reclamation to modify how it operates the Central Valley Project, a complex of reservoirs — including Lake Shasta — and canals that captures runoff from Northern California mountains and supplies water agencies in the Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys.
Last week, the bureau announced an operational modification that would increase annual water deliveries by 130,000 to 180,000 acre-feet from the Central Valley Project and another 120,000 to 220,000 from the State Water Project, the latter chiefly generated from the Oroville Dam on the Feather River. The two projects share management of the Sacramento River and its tributaries.
 “This updated operations plan reflects our commitment to using the best available science to increase water deliveries while safeguarding the environment and honoring the legacy of the Central Valley Project’s 90 years of service,” Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said in a statement.
The announcement sparked reactions, both pro and con, that reflect the state’s long-running water allocation battles — praise from Westlands and other agricultural water agencies that are facing supply reductions from regulation of groundwater use and condemnation from state officials and environmental groups.
“These operational refinements reflect a thoughtful, data-informed approach that strengthens water supply availability for growers while maintaining California’s commitment to environmental stewardship,” Westlands said in a statement.
Newsom spokesperson, Tara Gallegos, had another take: “The Trump administration is putting politics over people — catering to big donors instead of doing what’s right for Californians. As per usual, the emperor is left with no clothes, pushing for an outcome that disregards science and undermines our ability to protect the water supply for people, farms, and the environment.”
So here we go again, another chapter in the war over water that began when California became a state 175 years ago. It’s probably headed to the courts and will probably outlast not only Newsom’s governorship but Trump’s presidency.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/102325_Golden_Mussel_FG_CM_18.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-11 08:56:12.149015

(Photo: April Corbin Girnus/Nevada Current)The Animal Foundation, Southern Nevada’s largest government–subsidized shelter, lost nearly $10.6 million in 2024, more than twice its $4.2 million loss in 2023, according to the non-profits’s tax return. The organization’s assets decreased from $41 million to $30.6 million.
TAF did not respond to requests for comment, however, Las Vegas Mayor Shelley Berkley cited a variety of “non-cash events” in 2024 that she says account for $7.6 million of the loss.

The City of Las Vegas, Clark County, and North Las Vegas purchased the shelter building for roughly $15 million, but the asset was valued at $20 million on TAF’s books, creating a loss of more than $4 million on paper; 
TAF wrote off an uncollectible pledge of $2 million; and,
The shelter had a depreciation expense of $1.3 million.

The remaining loss of $2.9 million is the result of expenses exceeding revenue, Berkley said. 
TAF had 343 employees in fiscal year 2024 and salary expenses of $10.7 million. 
Of TAF’s $20 million in expenses, $3 million went to animal care. 
The shelter currently receives a combined total of $11.4 million a year from Clark County, Las Vegas, and North Las Vegas, which have a one-year renewable contract with TAF. Meanwhile, Clark County is moving forward with locating a site and funding for “supplemental shelter space,” spokesperson Stephanie Wheatley said.
TAF has been widely criticized among animal advocates for failing to act as an open admission shelter; releasing unsterilized dogs and cats; relying on rescue groups, who receive no public funding, to provide care for special needs animals; and, a lack of transparency. 
“The city and the county are monitoring closely,” Clark County Commission Chairman Tick Segerblom said via text. 
‘Losing ground’
“They are hemorrhaging money,” said Keith Williams, founder of the Community Cat Coalition of Clark County (C5), which has been trapping, neutering, and releasing thousands of stray, abandoned and feral cats a year for the last 16 years. 
Williams says if the shelter’s financial picture this year resembles 2024, “another two years, at the most, they’re going to be just completely out of money.”  
Williams says TAF and the local jurisdictions are missing the boat by failing to prioritize spay and neuter. 
“You can’t foster animals fast enough. The reproductive rate is just insane,” he says. “And there are homes for 20,000 to 30,000 cats a year. We’re looking at 400,000 kittens born every year here in the valley, at least.”
About 75% of free-roaming kittens don’t survive the first year. 
From 2017 to 2019, in addition to adopted animals, TAF sterilized roughly 7,000 animals a year for the public and its community cat program, says Williams, who tracks TAF’s intake and outcome data. “Between 2022 and now, outside of adoptions they’ve been doing about 1,000 surgeries a year,” he says, a loss in capacity of 6,000 surgeries a year.  
As a result, TAF’s kitten intake, which was 1,145 in 2020, has ballooned to 4,084 this year, says Williams.  
“There’s no problem in animal welfare that you can’t make better by sterilizing more animals,” he says. “If you go below a certain threshold, you will be losing ground. But once you break that threshold, you really start making some pretty impressive progress. At one time we were above that threshold.”
In 2010, the year C5 began trapping and sterilizing cats, TAF took in more than 46,000 animals.  By 2017, intake dropped to 26,000, the result, Williams said, of intensive sterilization efforts on a variety of fronts. 
An investment of $2 million a year, ostensibly from the local jurisdictions, could fund sterilizations for 10,000 animals and a dedicated veterinarian to make it happen. “We could start making progress again.” 
Berkley says Las Vegas, which is paying off a $286 million judgment in a land use case, is tapped out. Along with Clark County and North Las Vegas, the city has already augmented TAF’s funding. 
““I talk and talk and the jurisdictions just aren’t wrapping their heads around it,” says Williams.

(Matt Vasilogambros/Stateline)As states, Michigan among them, weigh additional restrictions to prevent noncitizens from casting a ballot, a report from a trio of organizations focused on racial justice and democracy warns that enacting these laws would carry a hefty price tag.
A joint effort between Dēmos, Campaign Legal Center and State Voices, the report examines the cost of implementing policies requiring voters to provide proof of citizenship when registering to vote.  
While only U.S. citizens are permitted to vote in state and federal elections, conservative groups across the nation have raised alarms about noncitizens casting ballots, despite several reports showing that noncitizen voting is exceedingly rare. These fears have led to a resurgence of policies restricting ballot access to those who can demonstrate citizenship.
In Michigan, an initiative by Americans for Citizen Voting received approval over the summer from state canvassers, and is undertaking a signature gathering campaign with the aim of getting the constitutional amendment on the 2026 general election ballot.
Though opponents of these regulations warn they risk disenfranchising eligible voters, with a disproportionate impact on newly married or divorced women, people of color, low-income individuals and military and overseas voters, the report trains in on the financial implications of putting them into effect.

“Our research shows that a [documented proof of citizenship] system can cost a state millions of dollars to implement, maintain, and defend,” the report states, pointing to necessary procedures after these laws are adopted, including changing voter registration forms, contacting voters about issues with their registration, overhauling online databases, implementing data privacy protections, retraining election officials and accounting for staff time to review proof of citizenship in applications and, if the law requires, purging voter rolls.
The report focuses on the cost of Arizona and Kansas’s proof of citizenship laws as the states with these types of laws in place for the longest period of time. However, the researchers note that the costs included within the report are meant to serve as a floor, as not all costs could be determined through public records, with budget reporting standards differing between Arizona’s 15 counties and Kansas’s 105 counties. 
In Arizona, which instituted proof of citizenship requirements in 2004, the state’s Joint Legislative Budget Staff was unable to quantify the impact of putting the policy into place. However, the report’s authors pointed to the changes the state made to its voter registration system after the policy was put in place, with the state awarding IBM a $9.4 million contract to develop a new voter registration database.
The report also noted that a 2013 Supreme Court decision found that the state could no longer demand proof of citizenship from applicants using the federal form, creating a two-track system of applicants who submit federal forms being registered as federal-only voters, while those who used the state application are registered as full ballot voters and are eligible to vote in all elections.
While state and local officials did not respond to the report authors’ public record requests on the costs of splitting the system, they concluded that the two separate tracks must have entailed additional staff time, multiple versions of forms, additional upgrades to recording systems, and other expenses.
Since 2023, Arizona has spent $6 million in county funding for voter roll reviews while maintenance costs for the database rose from $1.3 million annually from Fiscal Years 2023 to 2025 to  $2.34 million annually beginning in Fiscal Year 2026.
In Kansas, proof of citizenship requirements were enacted in 2011, with more than $350,000 in funding approved in the next two years to implement the law, which didn’t include the cost for any staff hours or resources needed to enforce the proof of citizenship requirements. It also does not account for the costs borne by the counties, 
Both states have also incurred significant costs due to errors with their databases and legal challenges against the laws.
Alongside its assessments of the policies’ costs in Arizona and Kansas, the report also points to deficiencies in the financial analyses provided in other states considering these policies, including Michigan. 
Earlier this year, House Majority Floor Leader Brian Posthumus (R-Rockford) put forth House Joint Resolution B, which would amend the state constitution to require individuals to provide proof of citizenship when registering to vote and to present a photo ID or other form of identification when casting their ballot.

The report criticizes the lack of estimated costs in the nonpartisan House Fiscal Agency’s examination of the proposal, with the agency reporting that the resolution could bring “increases in personnel hours, paid wages, or FTE counts in city and township clerk’s offices” but offering no dollar amount for what implementation could cost. 
Lata Nott, director of voting rights policy for the Campaign Legal Center and one of the report’s authors, argued that the agency could have put together a rough estimate based on additional staffing costs and the cost from when the state previously updated its voter registration system.
While Posthumus’s proposal failed to reach the two-thirds majority vote needed to advance to the Senate, the matter was tabled after Posthumus moved to reconsider the resolution, rescuing the policy for consideration at another session. A ballot initiative seeking to implement the measure has also received approval from the Michigan Board of State Canvassers to begin collecting signatures. 
No matter where these types of policies are implemented, it’s safe to assume they’ll come with significant additional costs, Nott said, emphasizing that they are generally borne by counties and cities. 
Neda Khoshkhoo, Dēmos’s interim director of democracy and another of the report’s authors, said that the states that implement these policies have a duty to do so correctly, as they have the potential to disenfranchise large numbers of voters. 
“All the more reason why this needs to be done with proper resourcing,” Khoshkhoo told Michigan Advance. 
Ultimately the big risks that come from not properly supporting local election agencies in implementing these laws are threats to data security and  voter disenfranchisement, Khoshkhoo explained. 
Legal costs are also an important factor to be considered when looking at the price of these laws, Nott said.
“You are introducing a new procedure, a new requirement that has a high potential to disenfranchise people,” Nott said. “That would and should lead to legal challenges.”

Nott pointed to the more than $2 million in settlements paid to plaintiffs challenging Arizona’s laws, while a lawsuit in Kansas cost the state $1.9 million, noting that these settlements don’t include the cost of the state’s own attorneys. 
The more states skimp on providing resources on the front end, the more threat there is for devastating legal action on the back end, Khoshkhoo said. 
Ultimately, both Nott and Khoshkhoo argued that these policies simply aren’t worth the cost, with Nott noting that Kansas’s proof of citizenship system disenfranchised 30,000 people while a review of Michigan’s voting records for the 2024 election found 15 credible cases of noncitizen voting in addition to a previously recorded case where a University of Michigan student from China registered and cast a ballot.
More than 5.7 million ballots were cast in Michigan’s 2024 general election.
“It just seems like there are better ways to spend the money that would be spent on [documentary proof of citizenship] laws in ways that wouldn’t carry with them the risk of depriving people of their fundamental rights as citizens,” Nott said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Deciders-Day2-2048x1535-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-11 08:56:12.149015

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Adam Bunting: Education funding should be rooted in ‘genuine partnership and collective purpose’.","This commentary is by Adam Bunting, superintendent of the Champlain Valley School District.



I must admit I’m a little annoyed. I work hard not to be defensive of an educational status quo, as our schools, nationally, have significant work ahead to become more human and more future-centered. But I want to focus this letter on the Champlain Valley School District, because I worry that narratives like those offered by Sen. Scott Beck, R-Caledonia, House Minority Leader Rep. Pattie McCoy, R-Poultney and Gov. Phil Scott misrepresent the success and hard work of our students, educators and families, risking support for our system. 
In the past two fiscal years, CVSD has reduced our budget by $9 million and 82 positions. While I acknowledge challenges in our education funding system, I don’t want to see resources for our students and a budget that you have long supported jeopardized based on hyperbole that is, at minimum, untrue for our district.

Here is the refrain published last week: “Republicans are deeply concerned that, despite nearly the highest per-pupil education spending in the nation, Vermonters are seeing diminishing returns: declining reading and math scores, deteriorating school infrastructure, low post-secondary enrollment, a rising dropout rate, and the highest staffing ratio in the country — 3.4 to 1.”
Let’s start with the data. First is the idea of a rising dropout rate. So that you are in the know, CVU’s graduation rate for 2025 is 96%. This figure is impressive and even more so as some students can legally (and are welcomed to) attend school until they turn 22 years old. 
The statistics used to illustrate Vermont’s educational decline come primarily from the National Assessment of Educational Progress. NAEP scores are reported statewide and cannot be disaggregated to individual school districts. And while we at CVSD have not always highlighted our standardized-test successes (in part because test scores are such a narrow definition of meaningful learning, citizenship and human development), it is important to understand that statewide NAEP data does not represent CVSD performance.
NAEP would lead you to believe that our 4th graders may fall in the 30% range for proficiency in reading and math. That is simply not our reality. Looking at CVSD-specific data, gathered both internally and through standardized assessments, a few points of celebration include: 

87% of CVSD third graders were proficient or above in literacy on the 2025 spring i-Ready assessment; 70% were proficient or above in math.
On the Vermont Comprehensive Assessments System, 75% of our 4th graders were proficient or above in literacy and 61% in math.
Our 7th graders performed especially well: 83% were proficient or above on the Vermont Comprehensive Assessment Program’s English Language Arts assessment.
On the SAT college entrance exam (which we provide to all students at no cost), 87% of CVSD students last year were proficient or above in literacy.

All of this data is accurate. And, yes, I am cherry picking, but I’ll be transparent about that. We certainly have areas for growth, but the dominant narrative would have you believe there are no bright spots. That’s simply not true. And as I mentioned earlier, I’m not a standardized-test advocate. Wouldn’t it be great if life were that easy — score well here, and everything else falls into place?
I’ve worked in this district for more than two decades, long enough to see longitudinal patterns and to understand (as best I can) which factors more meaningfully contribute to long-term success and wellbeing. Academic proficiency matters, but equally — if not more — important are a student’s sense of purpose, the connections they form with peers, adults and their community and the identity they build as they navigate childhood and adolescence.
We’ve been measuring aspects of student engagement for more than a decade. Here are some data points (and we have generated hundreds of these) I care much more about than NAEP, as they represent successes to celebrate and opportunities that require attention: 

96.6% of CVU students say they have at least one trusted adult at school.
90% of CVSD students in grades 9–12 report feeling a sense of belonging.
96% of students surveyed say they have friends who treat them with kindness and respect.
86% of students in grades 3–8 say they can be themselves at school; 71% say school is helping them learn about themselves.
80% of students in grades 3–8 say school is important to them; 64% say they see themselves in the curriculum.
Students with IEPs (Individualized Education Program plans for students with disabilities) disagreed with the statement “I feel represented in school leadership positions and on committees” at nearly twice the rate of their peers (34.7% vs. 17.8%).

Stepping briefly out of my CVSD role, I want to share a personal belief: education should transcend politics. While Vermont’s decline on NAEP scores is multifactorial, I don’t think it’s a coincidence that Vermont began to lag when we transitioned from a Commissioner to a Secretary of Education in 2013. As in every realm of education, meaningful learning and progress start with relationships — and we have real work to do to repair them.
I’ve been told that we once enjoyed far greater cohesion and partnership. Yet in the past year, the most salient thing I’ve seen is divisiveness. So perhaps we can agree on three things. First, we could be doing much better as a state. Second, we must mature beyond standardized tests as accountability metrics and honor the young humans we are gifted to serve. And third, our way forward lies not in op-eds and negative narratives, but in genuine partnership and collective purpose.

(Photo courtesy of WSDOT)Drivers won’t pay higher tolls to pass through the Highway 99 tunnel in Seattle during next summer’s FIFA World Cup.
The Washington State Transportation Commission voted unanimously Tuesday to park a plan to impose a surcharge of up to $1 per trip to cover added costs of managing the expected surge in traffic during the international sporting event.
It wasn’t a hard decision for commissioners after they heard enough money is coming in from toll collections to deal with additional expenses. 
Plus, several had misgivings about the potential to cause disruption and congestion elsewhere if drivers turned to city streets and Interstate 5 to avoid the surcharge.
“I’m a firm believer that we only toll (for) what we need,” said Commissioner Jim Restucci, who made the motion to not proceed.
At the behest of state lawmakers, the commission was considering the temporary increase between June 1 and July 15, 2026, the period in which six World Cup contests are scheduled at Lumen Field in downtown Seattle.
Tens of thousands of fans will flood into the Puget Sound region for the first of those matches on June 15, a tussle between Belgium and Egypt. Four days later, the United States will battle Australia. Two other opening round contests are planned June 24 and 26. 
Teams will be training at the University of Washington in Seattle and Seattle University ahead of their matches. There will be other practice venues and fan zones in the region and across the state, too.
There’s $2 million for maintenance in the vicinity of the tunnel in the current state budget. Those dollars will come out of the tunnel toll revenue account. Lawmakers assumed that sum could be covered from a temporary toll rate increase, but didn’t mandate one.
Tolls vary based on time of day, with higher rates in peak commute hours and lower rates on nights and weekends. They are collected in both directions as one exits the tunnel. 
Weekdays, the cost ranges from $1.25 to $1.85 per trip with a Good to Go pass. It is $1.25 on weekends. 
Commission staff studied potential increases of 50 cents and $1 per trip and found those hikes would bring in about $900,000 and $1.6 million, respectively, in the six weeks. If approved, it would have been the first-ever temporary toll rate hike in the state.
But, it turns out, the $2 million will be generated through collections with the existing toll rates. 
“There’s no financial need to do this,” said Brent Baker, senior vice president and managing director of WSP USA, a firm that consulted on the analysis of a potential surcharge.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/highway-99-tunnel-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-12-11 07:57:32.181515

Much of the country endured severe dry spells in recent years, most notably in 2022. But the impact has been especially felt in the regions where America’s beef industry is most concentrated.
In November 2022, the U.S reached a drought index of 202 on the Drought Severity and Coverage Index (DSCI), where values range from 0, meaning no dryness, to 500, indicating exceptional drought across an entire area. That month marked the nation’s second-highest drought reading of the century, surpassed only by the 2012-2013 North American drought.

But for the top 200 cattle-producing counties — together representing roughly a quarter of the national herd — the drought index peaked at 267.5 in the same period, far higher than the national average.
A similar pattern happened in 2024, when national drought conditions intensified in October and November, and again were more severe across the top beef-producing counties. These counties span 21 states. While they are largely clustered across the central U.S. — particularly in the top five beef-producing states of Texas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Nebraska and South Dakota — several are outside that core region as well, including in states like Oregon and Florida.
Ranchers in those regions have faced shrinking pastures, dwindling water supplies and the rising cost of feed, conditions that have forced many to thin their herds. And because rebuilding cattle numbers is a slow biological process, there is no quick path to replenishing the nation’s supply.
As beef prices continue to rise, meat has become a political flashpoint.
The Trump administration has ordered a review of consolidation in the meatpacking industry and lifted tariffs on beef imports from Brazil and Argentina in an effort to expand supply, while also blaming immigrants and former President Biden for the high cost of beef.
But experts say the price surge is mostly driven by drought, which has shown signs of improvement in recent months.
This year, the top 200 beef-producing counties have fared better than the rest of the country.
“Drought conditions have improved to the point where it is not a major limiting factor for potential herd rebuilding,” said Derrell Peel, professor of agricultural economics at Oklahoma State University and one of the country’s leading experts on the cattle industry. “Drought is less of an issue now compared to the last several years.”

They say that would offer retirees and current staff greater flexibility.","Indiana Public Retirement System Chief Actuary Andy Blough testifies in committee on Wednesday, Dec. 10, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)A retirement benefit specific to medical costs — introduced almost two decades ago to slim down the state’s payroll — may be on its way out.
Lawmakers may instead bulk up Hoosier START, the state’s defined benefit plans. They say that would offer retirees and current staff greater flexibility.
Tony Green, the deputy executive director of the Indiana Public Retirement System, said the Retirement Medical Benefits Accounts were created in 2007, as then-Gov. Mitch Daniels’ administration was looking to cut costs.
Medical expense was a primary reason older employees were staying, Green told the Senate Pensions and Labor Committee on Wednesday.
RMBA was instituted to “enable or even incentivize” early retirement, he said. The balance can reimburse retirees, spouses, and dependent children for the cost of health insurance premiums.
But state needs have shifted toward recruitment and retention.

Senate Bill 10 would give current enrollees, through 2026, the choice to keep their RMBAs or have the money moved — via the General Fund — to Hoosier START. RMBAs wouldn’t be available to new hires beginning in 2027.
Staff may get more options than under the current setup, said Sen. Linda Rogers, chair of the committee.
“It sounded like a great tool, because if you retire at 60 and you don’t get Social Security until 65, you’ve got five years of insurance premiums you have to deal with,” Rogers, R-Granger, told the Capital Chronicle.
“… But if you look at today’s workforce, people entering it today are not staying like people did years ago.”
Turnover matters because all of the RMBA money — contributed by the state on employees’ behalf — is forfeited if they leave state employment before retirement age. That’s as opposed to Hoosier START accounts, which include employee contributions and a vesting state match.
The legislation would also increase the Hoosier START match from $15 per pay period to $28.
A pension-focused interim committee would consider making a recommendation to raise the match every odd-numbered year. The State Budge Agency could then follow through.
Another proposal heard Wednesday would offer public retirees a bonus benefit known as a 13th check, plus an additional $50 to certain retirement fund members.
“There is ample money” in dedicated supplemental reserve accounts to pay for the 13th check, said Sen. David Niezgodski, D-South Bend. He is the author of Senate Bill 63.
The 13th check is expected to cost about $34 million in fiscal year 2027, according to a cost analysis. The reserve accounts, meanwhile, had a collective balance of nearly $89 million at the end of fiscal year 2025, Niezgodski said. State fiscal years begin in July and go through the following June.
The extra $50, which would cost an estimated $4 million, would come from the General Fund. But it may not stay that way.

“If we keep that $50 (in the bill), then it should come out of the supplemental reserve accounts,” Rogers said. She planned to work with Niezgodski and the House Republican author of a similar bill, to “come to a mutual decision.”
The committee took only testimony. A vote is expected in January.
The panel also considered raising monthly pension benefits for retired police and firefighters — along with contribution rates for local government employers. Mixed testimony followed, but a vote wasn’t yet taken.
“Certainly, we all are in agreement that public safety is our No. 1 priority,” Rogers told the audience. “We have to match that with available funds.”

Recently, the two sisters informed tribal members, many of whom attended the school as children, that their religious order, School Sisters of St. Francis (SSSF), was calling them to leave their teaching positions on the reservation and move to an assisted living facility in Milwaukee.
The news caused a stir, especially after Sister Felissa expressed concern that no replacements from her order were scheduled to arrive, raising questions about how the school could continue to function.
A small group of protesters gathered at the entrance to the church/school Sunday morning, Nov. 23. The demonstrators all had a connection to the parish, the school and the sisters. 
Susan Aasen, a tribal member and lawyer who had attended the school, said she had been in contact with the two sisters and said they were distraught over the pressure to leave.
“They’re crying,” she said of the sisters. “This is their home. They have no connections in Milwaukee.”
“You see them crying and they’re sad,” said tribal member Denise Cross. “They don’t want to go.”

Sister Felissa, who has taught at the school for 64 years, told the Wisconsin Examiner she didn’t want to leave the mission or teaching and even though she had experienced some medical issues, she was still capable of serving the community and wanted to continue until she was unable. She added that she was originally informed she would have to leave Dec. 2 and then the date was changed to Jan. 6.
“I have known Sister Felissa for a generation; she’s woven into the fabric of our community,” said Kimberly LaRonge, a tribal member who practices the Midewinwin spiritual tradition, but whose family helped build the church. She said she had been helped by Sister Felissa over the years.
Laronge said there was “outrage” in the community because of the perceived disrespect towards the sisters and also the lack of communication with the tribe.
Tribal members expressed concern for the two sisters, the school, but also what would happen to the church property, including the graveyard where many of their ancestors are buried, and artifacts tribal members had given to the church. They said they had heard the convent would be converted into a retreat for retired priests, a rumor the local bishop said was not true at a community meeting on Dec. 2. He also assured tribal members the graveyard would not be disturbed. 
Applause for Bishop’s statement that the nuns won’t be sent away
On Tuesday night, Dec. 2 in the Bingo Hall of the St. Francis Solanus Catholic Church on the LCO reservation, Bishop James Powers spoke to 185 people, mostly tribal members.

“Let me begin first of all by saying that the School Sisters of St. Francis stationed in Milwaukee, headquartered there, have decided not to call Sister Felissa and Sister Maryrose back to Milwaukee, at this time,” he said, as the room burst into applause.
An undated statement to parishioners was circulated after the Dec. 2 meeting, from Sister Kathleen O’Brien, U.S. Provincial Coordinator in Milwaukee for the religious order.
“We have profound respect for our Sisters’ many decades of loving service to generations of Catholics in the Lac Courte Oreilles region,” Sister O’Brien wrote. “We have rejoiced in their milestone of consecrated life, supported their tireless ministry efforts, and worked closely with them to meet their physical and spiritual care in times of surgery and recovery.”
Sister O’Brien noted the order supports their sisters with a “philosophy of care of sisterhood.”
“…our sisters affirm that we are women of faith, responding to God’s call,” she wrote. “We value holistic growth and self-responsibility, interdependence and conservation of God’s resources. We believe in the goodness and potential of all sisters throughout the life course.”
Michael O’Loughlin, the congregation’s communications director, said that sisters from the Milwaukee order are in regular contact with Sister Felissa and Sister Maryrose.
O’Loughlin reiterated the order’s commitment to “self-responsibility as well as interdependence,” and the  “right of each individual to make informed health choices” while collaborating with others in making those decisions. 
“In keeping with this philosophy of care, our sisters in leadership and healthcare professionals will continue to work in partnership with Sister Maryrose and Sister Felissa to compassionately and evaluate their health needs and responsibilities,” he said.
O’Loughlin clarified that the sisters had not been ordered or directed to leave St. Francis Solanus. 
At the Dec. 2 meeting, Bishop Powers announced that no decision had been made about closing the school. O’Loughlin said that given the sisters’ advanced ages and that only a handful of students attend the school, the diocese has been in conversation with the order regarding the school’s financial viability.
Sister O’Brien acknowledged the widespread support the two sisters had received from the tribe and community, and she also pointed out that her order had sent sisters to the reservation for over 100 years, starting in 1909.
Dan Blank, the director of administrative services for the diocese, which has direct authority over the school, wrote in an email to the Examiner:
“The Diocese was aware that the School Sisters of St Francis (SSSF) had talked to Sisters Felissa and Maryrose about returning to Milwaukee on or about Jan 6. There was no specific intent to close the school, but the reality of having no one to replace the Sisters had put pressure on Father David (Father David Neuschwander, the local priest of a church cluster, five churches under one priest, that includes St. Francis) and the Diocese to evaluate the options. The SSSF became aware of the unrest among the parishioners and tribal community, and changed their position with hope that the Sisters will be able to continue their teaching ministry at the school through this school year.”
Financial questions and an uncertain future
After announcing the sisters were not leaving at the Dec. 2 meeting, Bishop Powers said he wanted to focus on the financial status of the school.
“Those accounts that are referred to as ‘sisters’ monies’ are monies the sister has received or raised for the direct support of the school,” he said. “And I need to know, how much is there, so that we can know, is it possible to continue the school? There’s nobody who wants to close a school. I don’t care what school where … but we can’t go on without money.”
Vickie Shibilski, a tribal member and a long-time volunteer and cook at the school, peppered the diocese with questions during the meeting. She also defended Sister Felissa saying she understood the school’s finances and “knew what she was doing.”
“Sister does, but we don’t,” responded the Bishop. “We have to know what funds are available. We need to know whether it’s money enough to keep running the school.”
Shibilski complained that Father David had not met with the community regarding the fate of the school.
“He may look at us like, oh, we’re just folks,” she said. “We’re just cleaners or whatever. We talk to the donors. We work with the donors. We’re in the community, and we’re everywhere, and we’re going to stay here. We’ll be here.” 
She also raised a complaint that a staff person at the church had been rude to Sister Felissa, swearing at her, and demanded the staff person be fired. Blank, the diocese administrator, said the incident would be investigated.
Another community member demanded clarification of the bishop’s statement that the nuns would not be sent away “at this time.” 
“Does that mean, like, not today, not tomorrow, but maybe in the spring, then they’re going to be asked to leave? Because that’s not a clapping matter,” she said. 
The Bishop responded, “I cannot stand up here and say that they’re going to be here til they die. No, I can’t, because, again, the community has that right to call them back,” adding that as the Bishop he had authority to call them back as well but had chosen not to.
A tribal member said the two nuns had given their lives to the tribe and the parish and school and if they retire, they shouldn’t be forced to live in Milwaukee.
Blank encouraged tribal members to make the Milwaukee order aware of community sentiment.
Another tribal member said she didn’t think Blank understood how much Native Americans care for elders, including their health needs.
Father David gave a presentation about the school’s finances.
“My desired outcome for this meeting is to raise awareness of the financial needs, particularly at the school, so that they can be met,” he said. “There are so many people who have volunteered so much and given so much of their lives. I would love to see more people financially supporting our school. In order to do that, people need to know what’s going on.”
Shibilski challenged the priest, saying he hadn’t mentioned the St. Francis parish or school during his Sunday services from Hayward that are broadcast on the radio. She was also critical that he had not attended important community events.

“Rarely do you visit our school or spend any time with our children, and I think you’ve only been in our classroom maybe once,” she said. “If you’re going to lead you need to lead all of us and be here and show the children and your parents, because right now, I don’t really believe they know you well. I don’t even know you well.”
Father David responded that he wanted to communicate “more clearly.” He added that during his first two years of service he looked at the finances of the church, and then the last year, he began looking at the finances of the school.
He noted neither the parish nor the school was in debt.
He then shared a pie chart showing the school’s expenses and revenue of $260,370. The biggest source of revenues is an endowment of $86,850. In two years, he said, the endowment would be spent down.
After the meeting, Father David said, “I hold Sister Felissa and Sister Maryrose in the highest respect, and I am grateful for their decades of loving ministry at St. Francis Solanus. They have been and remain a profound blessing to generations of families on the Lac Courte Oreilles Reservation.”
 As pastor, he said, “I am called to ensure the long-term health of all five parishes within the Lac Courte Oreilles and Hayward Area Catholic Churches, including financial health. Because of this responsibility, I expressed concerns to the Diocese regarding the long-term financial sustainability of the school.”
“The diocese is primarily focused on financial sustainability,” he added, “while the motherhouse in Milwaukee has the responsibility of caring for the health and well-being of their sisters.”
Parish concerns
At the Dec. 2 meeting, Bishop Powers noted the Catholic church has had a presence with the tribe since the late 18th century.
“Let me say again, there has never been nor will there ever be any talk of closing the parish as long as I am Bishop,” he said.
A complaint lodged several times during the meeting was that money from St. Francis and the other church on the reservation, St. Ignatius, is going to fund staff working at the Hayward church, and the perception that the tribal parishes were not receiving value from their dollars.
“What has St Francis gained from having this cluster?” Shibilski asked. “I don’t see that we gained anything; we’re losing here.”
Bishop Powers noted there were not enough priests in the diocese to serve just one parish, and he said the advantage of a cluster is “stability of operation” and the use of standard bookkeeping, which he said hadn’t been used for years at either the St. Francis parish or the school.
Shibilski said the cluster could just consist of St. Francis and St. Ignatius, with Father Karunakar Madanu (an international priest from India) serving both parishes.
“I’m begging you. I’m begging you, please, give us our cluster back,” she said. “Give us our parish back.”
“I can’t make that promise,” responded the Bishop.
Father David said he would like to hire a bookkeeper from the parish and create a finance council.
“But sometimes we think you’re just worried about the money, that’s all you’ve been asking about,” Shibilski responded.
Another community member said churches often donate to the mission field, and that St. Francis was designated as a mission and therefore should not be expected to generate revenue for the Church.
Larry French, the director of finance for the diocese, said when he asked about receipts for St. Francis school none could be produced.
“We didn’t have receipts for this school,” said French. “We didn’t know what was coming in. We didn’t know what was going out. You can’t audit when you don’t have anything to audit.”
Blank also noted that St. Francis parish didn’t have a finance council and questioned whether it had a parish council. And he also said if there are concerns on how contracts were given for facility work, there should be a building and grounds committee overseeing those projects
Several audience members then suggested an audit of the Hayward church.
“You know you should respect us a little more than what you are giving us,” said one community member.
Blank responded, “We have great respect, and we continue to support you. We are listening and learning. So yes, there can be an audit. Yes, there can be a request to the mother house that the sisters stay here forever. We can’t speak to that. We don’t have authority for that. Bishop can be in conversation with them.”
Blank also asked the audience to give Father David a second chance to work with the parish and school.
After the Dec. 2 meeting, the  diocese put out a statement thanking those who participated.
“We listened to the many concerns and requests from parishioners and LCO tribal members. There are many issues to consider and act on. In order to move forward together, we will need many volunteers for councils and committees for St Francis and St Ignatius. We promise to continue to communicate and to respect the many years of service by Sisters Felissa and Maryrose.”

Murphy urged to save Asbury Park’s iconic Tillie,Sophie Nieto-Munoz,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/12/11/save-tillie-asbury-park/,"Preservationists want Gov. Phil Murphy to save Tillie, part of an iconic Asbury Park mural, before he leaves office in January.","Palace Amusements in Asbury Park was torn down in 2004, and its mascot, Tillie, was saved for potential reuse. (Photo by Anne-Marie Caruso)As Gov. Phil Murphy’s two terms come to a close, preservationists are urging his administration to save Tillie, a giant, grinning fun house face and emblem of Asbury Park.
For two decades, Tillie, whose visage was removed from indoor amusement park Palace Amusements before the building’s demolition in 2004, has been in storage as the real estate development slated to replace Palace has been in the works. But Tillie fans worry it may already have deteriorated nearly beyond repair, and they want Murphy to step in before it’s too late to resurrect it.
“If any governor has a compelling reason to get this done, it’s Governor Murphy,” said Bob Crane, who heads the Save Tillie foundation.
Advocates offer a plan for New Jersey’s future

Tillie was part of the mural that graced the lime-green exterior of Palace Amusements, which stood near the ocean in Asbury Park for more than 100 years (the mural included two Tillies). The caricatures were painted in 1956 and soon became a symbol of this Jersey Shore town’s 20th century heyday. Tillie was featured on “The Sopranos” and on tour t-shirts for Bruce Springsteen in the 1970s. Palace shuttered in 1988 and fell into disrepair.
Before the Palace building was torn down to make way for an oceanfront real estate development, Crane and other activists lobbied to have as much of it preserved and restored as possible. They managed to save from ruin one Tillie, bumper cars that were also part of the mural, and 21 metal letters spelling out Palace Amusements.
A 52-page permit dated March 2004 between the Department of Environmental Protection and the developers who purchased the lot includes a provision requiring the artifacts to be preserved, restored, and displayed again.
“The preserved sections will be incorporated into a new hotel development or retail development at this location as part of the lobby wall,” the permit states.
But that new building has yet to be constructed. And the permit lacks any timeline requirements for when the area must be developed, local activists noted.

Fred Carl, a Wall Township historian, said he fears the Palace artifacts won’t come out of storage as long as they’re in the hands of developers.
“I was hopeful that it would be preserved, and it’s sort of sad this is another good faith effort being destroyed,” he said.
Today, the Palace lot is vacant, used as a parking lot by beachgoers and concert attendees.
David Mieras, an Ocean Grove native who was involved in the Save Tillie push at the turn of the 21st century, said the developers aren’t committed to restoring the mural, and public officials will not get involved.
“They could really put some pressure on (the developers) to do something with it. That’s all it would take. It wouldn’t take a lot,” he said. “They should start there, then move onto Convention Hall and the casino, because those are attractions that can never be replaced, ever.”
Tillie and the bumper cars were relocated once since they were removed from the Palace building. In 2021, they were taken from the wastewater treatment plant where they had been housed and placed in sheds near Convention Hall. Few people have seen their condition.
In 2016, an independent inspector who viewed Tillie said it had lost significant paint to the point of losing visual integrity, according to a letter Save Tillie attorneys sent to Murphy in June.
In May 2024, Preservation New Jersey named the artifacts as endangered, noting Palace Amusements was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. The group called on the developers to “think creatively and be proactive in returning these New Jersey icons to the public.”
Crane claimed the governor has the authority to direct state environmental officials to amend the permit and impose a time-specific plan for preservation and reuse of Tillie. He also wants an independent inspection, and urges the state to consider transferring oversight of the murals and letters to the state’s historic preservation office.
“Our hope is that at the time when he’s obviously clearing the decks and bringing to completion the things that he’s been working on during his career — including issuing pardons, commuting sentences — that he will see this is a 21-year-old crisis created long before he became governor, but that has continued,” Crane said. “And he has a chance to resolve it.”
A spokesperson for Murphy, who leaves office on Jan. 20, declined to comment. Developers iStar, Asbury Partners, and Madison Marquette did not respond to requests for comment.
The Department of Environmental Protection said in a statement that staff last conducted a site visit in 2018 and observed the artifacts in “satisfactory condition.” The department’s land resource protection division is coordinating with developers to ensure compliance with the project’s permit, spokesman Vincent Grassi said.
Grassi said the state has no say in preserving and displaying the artifacts under the permit, issued under the authority of the Coastal Area Facilities Review Act.
“The DEP in July reminded Asbury Partners of the CAFRA requirement and this week requested an update on efforts to fulfill the permit requirements. Once a hotel or retail development is constructed at the former site of Palace Amusements, the preserved artifacts are required to be incorporated into the new building,” he said in a statement.

Crane remains hopeful, despite having written to every governor who has helmed the state since Tillie was placed in storage, to no avail. He has not been able to arrange a meeting with state environmental officials, he said.
Crane believes the permit’s language means Tillie and the other Palace artifacts would be used “in a very public way” to help connect people with Asbury Park’s history for generations to come.
“The word ‘preserve,’ it has a very particular meaning. It doesn’t mean just sticking in storage, walking away, and basically doing nothing else. It means treatment. It means taking them from where they are today and making sure that they are available in the future,” he said.
He believes if the state’s historic preservation office had oversight of the artifacts for enforcement purposes, “they would have been back in public view a long time ago.”
Carl, the Wall Township historian, suggested it’s time for plan B — finding a local artist to replicate a full-sized version of Tillie and display it on the boardwalk or Convention Hall, where tourists and locals can learn about its history, he said. A replica of Tillie was painted on the outside of Wonder Bar, a few blocks north of the Palace lot, but Carl said most people today don’t know about its historical connection to Asbury Park.
“Plan A is stuck, and time is moving on,” he said. “Public outcry hasn’t done anything, and I don’t think the government has any authority to make them do anything. So this will get the iconic story of Tillie, the wonderful family vacations, and the people whose memories are tied up with Asbury Park, and bring it into the future.”",https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Tillie02a-1024x679.jpg,,,2025-12-11 06:57:07.945772

The nonprofit, housed at the University of Wisconsin Extension, is a navigator agency to help people understand their options when buying health insurance through the HealthCare.gov marketplace. (Screenshot)About 4,000 fewer people in Wisconsin signed up at the federal HealthCare.gov marketplace in November for a health plan for next year than did in November 2024 for coverage this year, recently released numbers from the federal government show.
It’s too soon to tell for sure whether that will forecast a significant drop in health coverage through the marketplace, according to William Parke-Sutherland of the Wisconsin family policy research and advocacy group Kids Forward.
Parke-Sutherland and others who pay close attention to health care access in Wisconsin are watching those numbers closely, however.
Monday, Dec. 15, marks a critical deadline — the last day that people who purchase a health plan through the marketplace can sign up for coverage that starts Jan. 1, 2026.
The Healthcare.gov marketplace was created as part of the Affordable Care Act. Enacted in 2010 to drive down the ranks of Americans without access to health care, the ACA established the marketplace to make it easier and cheaper for people without coverage from an employer or through government programs such as Medicaid to buy health insurance.
Enhanced tax credit subsidies first enacted in 2021 on health plans sold through the marketplace have helped boost enrollment to new records over the last four years nationally and in Wisconsin. More than 300,000 state residents received their health coverage for 2025 through the marketplace.
Those enhanced subsidies expire at the end of this year, however, leading to forecasts that enrollment will decline in 2026 as the cost of insurance climbs.
“Many Wisconsinites will see their premiums double, and some will see staggering increases of over $30,000 a year,” Gov. Tony Evers said Wednesday during a press call with the ACA advocacy group Protect Our Care. “That’s ridiculous and unattainable for many.”
The event was held both to alert people about Monday’s open enrollment deadline and to urge voters to lobby Congress to extend the subsidies.
“Each year, the Affordable Care Act and open enrollment has ensured hundreds of thousands of Wisconsinites having life-saving health care coverage,” Evers said. “These tax credits are not luxuries — they are lifelines that make the difference between kids and families and communities getting care or going without it.”
This year, 88% of Wisconsin residents who enrolled at HealthCare.gov qualified for the enhanced subsidies and saved $644 a month on average, Evers said.
Thad Schumacher, a Fitchburg pharmacist who also joined the call, said losing coverage would lead people to forgo “their primary care visits, their medications, for chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension, and preventative care that keeps people healthy.”
Early numbers send mixed signals
The federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid reported that from Nov. 1 to 29 this year, 84,398 Wisconsinites enrolled in coverage through the marketplace. From Nov. 1 to Nov. 30, 2024, Dairy State enrollment totaled 88,189, according to CMS.
Nationally numbers are up, however — 5.76 million in November this year, compared with 5.36 million in November last year, according to CMS.
While Wisconsin’s decrease of less than 4,000 people signing up may look small, “It’s just hard to know what this means,” Parke-Sutherland told the Wisconsin Examiner.
In the years going back to 2022, the first month of open enrollment saw anywhere from 29% to 42% of that year’s total HealthCare.gov sign-ups, he said.
At Covering Wisconsin — a federally licensed navigator that helps guide people through the process of enrolling in HealthCare.gov plans — the volume of November calls and contacts through the navigator’s web-based chat portal have been about even with the same month last year, said Allison Espeseth, the Covering Wisconsin director.
In 2024, however, there was “a pretty big spike” in contacts in the first two weeks of December leading up to the Dec. 15 deadline for coverage to start Jan. 1.
“This year, we are definitely continuing to have people call us, but we haven’t seen that spike,” Espeseth said.
She offered several possible reasons for that. Some people may have seen higher premiums for their plans and decided to go without. Others may think that there won’t be any subsidies, despite the fact that smaller subsidies that were part of HealthCare.gov plans from the beginning remain in place.
And some have wondered whether they should hold off on signing up in case Congress does reach a deal and extend the subsidies, Espeseth noted.
“We’ve been encouraging people to please sign up regardless,” Espeseth said. “Don’t wait.”

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A state board tasked with investigating free speech violations on Oklahoma university campuses must have increased enforcement power to properly protect people’s constitutional rights, one advocate said.
But leaders of the Oklahoma Free Speech Committee said the body doesn’t need more power beyond its advisory role when it comes to enforcing changes in free speech policy or investigating violations.
The debate over the committee’s role comes as the state’s three largest universities have faced complaints of free speech violations in recent months, ranging from political and religious discrimination to press censorship.
The nine-member committee, created by House Bill 3543 in 2022, is part of the State Regents for Higher Education and is a purely advisory body that issues recommendations, guides free speech training and investigates complaints of violations on college and university campuses, according to state statute. 
Rep. Chad Caldwell, R-Enid, authored the bill that created the Free Speech Committee and currently serves on the board.

He said the committee was intentionally set up to be advisory so it was collaborative, rather than adversarial, with the state’s colleges and universities. He continues to support that structure. 
“But if we find that our colleges and universities are routinely kind of ignoring the suggestions of the committee, then maybe we need to go back through and look at that,” Caldwell said. “But I think so far we’ve seen a willingness to collaborate and to work together.” 
Patrick Elliott, the legal director for Freedom From Religion Foundation, said an advisory board with “no enforcement authority isn’t enough.” The nonprofit advocates for the division between church and state. 
Relying on litigation alone “delays justice” and places a burden on victims of free speech violations, he said in a statement. 
“We support additional mechanisms to protect free speech,” Elliot said. “Those could include a government body that can both investigate and require compliance when rights are violated.”
Andy Lester, chair of the Free Speech Committee, said he likes the way the committee was created by statute to be advisory because there “isn’t another committee in the country like ours.”
“It’s a safety valve,” Lester said. “… I think the process works well. If the Legislature wanted to change that and empower this committee to do something else, I’m sure we, of course, would be happy to do that, but that’s up to somebody else.” 
There have been three formal complaints since the beginning of the semester that are currently being investigated, Lester said.

Rick Hall, a board member who serves on the committee’s Complaint Task Force, said he could not discuss what they entail, saying they should be kept confidential to “maintain the integrity of the review process.”  
Lester said only one other complaint has been submitted to the committee during its existence and it was found to not be a free speech issue. He did not elaborate on the details of the complaint.
“It’s usually probably better for them to try to do it on the campus itself, but they can come to us right away,” he said. “Our process takes some time.”
Oklahoma colleges and universities typically set their own policies to address free speech complaints. The Free Speech Committee plans to eventually review the policies of every campus, but said they are still doing initial reviews.
At the conclusion of an investigation, the committee can offer recommendations to the complaining party as well as the institutions involved and the State Regents. 
Laura Beltz, director of policy reform for the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a free speech advocacy group, said having a committee to provide input and expertise across the state is generally helpful. 
“That being said, if colleges are able to ignore the input of the committee when a campus violates a student or faculty member’s rights, it’s critical that mechanisms are in place to ensure that student or faculty member’s rights are vindicated, e.g. by referring the matter to an office that does have the authority to take action,” Beltz said. 
UCO complaint

At least two complaints to the committee, which were obtained independently by Oklahoma Voice, are related to accusations of free speech violations at the University of Central Oklahoma. They were filed by Amy Hall, the daughter of a former adviser to the student newspaper, and Jon Womastek, a UCO alumni. 
UCO’s complaints stems from the school’s decision to end the print publication of the student newspaper, The Vista, and allegations that the school was trying to control students’ coverage of the administration. The Vista continues to publish digitally, and the university has denied the claim.
A spokesperson for UCO said the institution “has not received any formal complaints of violations of free speech in 2025.”
The school did receive recommendations for minor changes to its free speech policy after an unrelated review by the Free Speech Committee in 2024. All recommendations were implemented, the spokesperson said. 
UCO does not have a “formal position” on the committee’s function as an advisory board, the spokesperson said. 
OSU complaint
A spokesperson at Oklahoma State University said in a statement that the school has received three formal complaints in 2025. 
“While we are aware of instances where someone has indicated that someone else’s expression is hateful or offensive, we are only aware of three formal complaints in which one student organization’s fliers were removed,” the spokesperson said in a statement. 
It wasn’t immediately clear if this complaint was also filed with the state Free Speech Committee or if it had been resolved.
The spokesperson said that the school is reviewing a set of recommendations from the Free Speech Committee and is committed to “maintaining” an environment on campus to support free speech.
The spokesperson did not answer questions about the efficacy of the Free Speech Committee.
OSU also faced accusations in October of violating a student’s free speech rights after a staff member reportedly criticized him for wearing a hat with the No. 47, a symbol of President Donald Trump’s presidency, at a student government meeting. 
The student, who was giving a speech promoting free speech at the time, said he received the cap from Charlie Kirk after volunteering at a Turning Point USA event held at the Stillwater campus. Kirk, a conservative activist, was assassinated during an event earlier this year in Utah, the same day the student wore the hat. SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
OU complaint
Spokespeople with OU did not comment by the time of publication about whether they had faced any formal complaints of free speech violations on campus this year or the efficacy of the committee.
OU has been entangled in a free speech-related controversy since late November when a student claimed the zero she received for an essay she wrote was because of her religious beliefs and a violation of her free speech.
The student said she used the Bible as a reference for the essay, which was assigned to be a reaction to an article on gender-based stereotypes, and argued against eliminating societal gender roles. The graduate teaching assistant, who OU has since put on leave, said she had failed to use empirical evidence and that parts of her essay were offensive.
The Freedom From Religion Foundation has demanded the graduate teaching assistant be immediately reinstated. The group said OU as a public university cannot “privilege religious viewpoints.”
Lester and Caldwell, who serve on the state’s Free Speech Committee, commended the University of Oklahoma on Tuesday for the way it has dealt with the ongoing controversy at its Norman campus. 
“From what I have seen thus far, it looks like the process at the University of Oklahoma is working well,” Lester said. “These issues are difficult to deal with, and my heart does go out to everybody involved, including, frankly, both sides of what happened and the administration. It’s hard to balance these things.”

Following a three-month debate, the library board voted 3-2 to scrub ALA references from its language. The debate over the national organization highlighted deep divisions in Central Wyoming. 
The post What’s behind Fremont County’s American Library Association fight? appeared first on WyoFile .","When the Fremont County Library Board voted 3-2 last week to scrub its governing policies and materials of references to the American Library Association, it was the culmination of months of heated debate that touched on everything from book banning to pornography to Marxist influences.  
The ALA, as it’s commonly known, is a 150-year-old membership association offering resources and professional development to librarians. Not long ago, the group was relatively non-controversial. But in recent years, it’s become embattled in America’s culture wars, launching initiatives on diversity, equity and inclusion and fending off accusations of radical wokeness from conservative activists. 
Which is how it ended up in the crosshairs of Fremont County Library Board members. The ALA advocates for measures that impede parental involvement while pushing initiatives such as unisex bathroom policies that are not in line with Fremont County, board member Marta Mossburg said in September when she introduced the motion to remove the references. (None of the libraries in the system are ALA members, though many librarians are.)
“They’re not a neutral professional organization,” Mossburg said last week before the vote. The ALA decades ago “morphed into a political group that advocates for very progressive law,” she added. “I don’t want that as the backbone of our Fremont County Library.” 
The proposal, which spurred hours of debate and more than 250 public comments, highlighted deep divisions in the community over censorship and what materials belong on a public library shelf. The majority of comments, around 70%, opposed the measure, according to Fremont County Library Director Anita Marple’s tally. Marple was also against it. 
“This whole process for me has been really discouraging,” she told the board. The measure feels like an unnecessary cudgel, she said, adding that the library system could just decide on a case-by-case basis whether to take advantage of ALA’s resources or not.

“There should not be a controversy here,” Marple said. “We are independent. We are locally governed. ALA doesn’t dictate our policy or our programming.”
The vote represents the latest in a string of fraught decisions and board discord in Fremont County, which operates libraries in Lander, Dubois and Riverton. In the wake of the 3-2 vote, Marple will begin the formal process of amending the library system’s policies accordingly. 
It’s unclear if library patrons will feel tangible impacts from the language removal. But they may wonder what exactly is the ALA and how it came to roil a community in the middle of Wyoming.
150 years old 
The ALA was formed in 1876 in Philadelphia during a convention of about 100 librarians. According to the organization, the intent was to “enable librarians to do their present work more easily and at less expense.”
Early efforts included the dissemination of the Dewey Decimal System, developed by a Massachusetts librarian. And in the decades following its founding, the ALA expanded to include chapters in all 50 states and roughly 50,000 members. Today, the ALA says it’s “the oldest, largest and most influential library association in the world.”
Accrediting master’s programs, awarding grants, offering professional development and holding conferences on industry best practices are among its services. 
But as the country has become more divided in recent years, libraries have become ground zero for culture wars, many centered on mounting attempts to remove books — including LGBTQ+-themed titles — from children’s sections or out of libraries all together. And critics have attacked the ALA for veering away from its original purpose and engaging in political advocacy. The organization has developed a strong advocacy arm, with initiatives to fight book bans, improve literacy and support DEI.

In a consequential 2022 tweet, then-new-ALA president Emily Drabinski tweeted she couldn’t believe a “Marxist lesbian” like herself could be elevated to the role. Conservatives latched on to that tweet, which fueled a revolt against the organization, with Republican lawmakers in states like Arizona and Montana taking steps to formally sever ties with the ALA. Drabinski is no longer with the ALA.
In 2023, Secretary of State Chuck Gray and several Wyoming Freedom Caucus lawmakers sent a letter to Gov. Mark Gordon demanding Wyoming cut affiliations with the ALA, which, they wrote, encourages libraries to “expose minors to sexually explicit materials.”
Instead of cutting ties, Gordon and state library officials wrote to the ALA requesting discussions about their concerns over the organization’s political direction.
But that did not extinguish backlash, a fact underscored in Fremont County by the board’s controversial decision last week. 
Trouble starts
When Mossburg introduced the proposal, she cited an April executive order from President Donald Trump that targets accrediting agencies that adopt DEI-based standards and said the ALA has a DEI mandate that violates the U.S. Constitution. She also said ALA has policies on pronouns and bathrooms that aren’t in line with Fremont County values.
When reached for comment, the ALA did not address specific complaints, but asserted that it is “a non-partisan, non-profit membership organization that empowers and advocates libraries and library workers, ensuring equitable access to information for all.
“ALA has remained committed to this mission since its inception nearly 150 years ago, serving people of all demographic backgrounds and ideologies and becoming a valuable resource for its members and the field at large,” read a statement from Shawnda Hines, deputy director of communications for ALA’s public policy and advocacy office.

Mossburg also asserted that the ALA “advocates for complete ‘intellectual freedom’ for everyone, regardless of age,” which puts children at harm. 
“This ‘intellectual freedom’ component is central to our current board manual, and has led to constant tension in the community regarding sexually graphic material in the Young Adult section,” Mossburg said during the September meeting.  
The proposal spurred a flood of public comments, most of them against a policy they called unnecessary, harmful or out of touch.
“You’re not the morality police, you are a library board,” Lander resident Vikkilyn Frank told the board during one meeting. 
Barbara Oakleaf, a former Lander library manager, said it appears that board members think Wyoming librarians are in lockstep with all of ALA’s stances and try to implement everything it espouses. 
“We do not,” she said. “We’re Wyomingites. We have more sense of our own freedom.” During her tenure, she said, she and her staff were mainly concerned with ensuring reading access to all county residents, she said. 
Marple too said she believes there is a lot of misunderstanding out there. Fremont County libraries have no DEI or gender-neutral bathroom policy, for example.
There was also support for removing connections to the ALA. One supporter, former state lawmaker Sarah Penn, urged the board in written comments to help “the effort to rid Fremont County of the ALA cancer.” 
Some called for Mossburg to abstain from voting due to what they perceive as a conflict of interest based on her association with the World Library Association. The fledgling organization, which advocates for “age appropriateness in libraries,” holds itself as a counterpoint to the ALA. The website lists Mossburg as a team member. 
Mossburg refuted that her association constitutes a conflict and reiterated her arguments against the ALA, which she said wants “a one-size-fits-all program dictated by them in America’s libraries.”

Board member Perry Cook was one of the people to bring up the potential conflict. She also warned the board against ignoring constituent feedback.
“I feel strongly that we need to listen to what our constituents are saying,” Cook said. “This is why we have a period of public comment. And instead of saying, ‘Oh, well, they all commented, but we know better,’ I think they all commented, and we should listen to that.”
The changes
Practically, the change resulting from the decision involves the removal of three ALA-affiliated documents from the Fremont County library system’s policies. 
One, a “Freedom to Read” document, states, among other things, that “it is in the public interest for publishers and librarians to make available the widest diversity of views and expressions, including those that are unorthodox, unpopular, or considered dangerous by the majority.”
The second is the “Library Bill of Rights,” which emphasizes that books and materials should be provided to all people, and materials should not be excluded because of the origin, background or views of those contributing to their creation. “Libraries should challenge censorship in the fulfillment of their responsibility to provide information and enlightenment,” it reads in one section.
The last one is the ALA Ethics Statement for Public Library Trustees, which sets out professional guidelines for board members to work with integrity by avoiding conflicts of interest and disqualifying themselves when conflicts arise, and acknowledging the formal position of the board even when they disagree. 
Marple, who has been a member of the ALA for nearly 15 years, will excise the documents from library materials. That will be tantamount to removing the Fremont County Library system’s statement of principles, she said, without replacing them with anything. “We will continue to operate by these principles,” she told WyoFile.
Sarah Reilley of Fremont County Right to Read doesn’t see expect noticeable differences immediately, especially if Marple is allowed to helm the system. What is more likely to happen is a slump in morale, she said. 
“The point of the ALA is to really ensure fairness and equal access to the library for everybody in the community,” Reilley said. “And when the library board said, ‘No, we don’t want to keep us in here,’ what that really said to the community is, ‘if you are a member of these marginalized communities, we no longer want this language here that protects you.’”

Long-term, however, Reilley is concerned. “I’m worried that they’re going to use this as a stepping stone to further restrict the free access to information in our library.” 
Fremont County Board Chair Kristen McClelland, who voted for the ALA language removal, said last week she doesn’t think the change will make users feel unwelcome. 
“I think there are people who are concerned about the material that their children see, myself included, who will feel more welcome knowing that the local population is deciding what goes on in the library,” she said.

Dec. 10, 2025 | Photo By Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceThe House Oversight Subcommittee on Corporate Subsidies and State Investments on Wednesday once again sat down with members of the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, questioning members of the body on what role it played in providing grants to a nonprofit facing scrutiny for failing to report them in their federal tax filings. 
In October, the Detroit News published an investigation which found the National Association of Yemeni Americans – which provides a range of social, educational and cultural services – had not filed their taxes since the 2021 Fiscal Year, which the association’s president maintains was an error and was being “promptly” addressed. 
Since its 2021 federal tax filing, the nonprofit received six grants through legislative spending initiatives, also referred to as earmarks, sponsored by several Democratic lawmakers. The most recent grants were sponsored by Sen. Sylvia Santana (D-Detroit) and Rep. Tonya Meyers Phillips (D-Detroit) with Santana requesting $800,000 to support the nonprofit’s behavioral health services and Meyers Phillips asking for roughly $1.5 million.
As the body that administered the grants to the nonprofit in the 2022 and 2023 Fiscal Year, Christin Armstrong, the Economic Development Corporation’s chief operating and performance officer, broke down how it directs grants to their grantees. 
“While the MEDC is the entity charged with administering these grants. These are pass-through grants that are made in accordance with Legislative appropriation,” Armstrong said, emphasizing that the economic corporation generally does not advocate for or advise on these bills and often does not have any visibility into them before they’re introduced.

In the course of Fiscal Year 2022 and 2023, the MEDC received nearly 350 legislative directed spending grants, Armstrong said, explaining that administering grants is something the corporation absorbs into its normal operations without receiving extra administrative funding. 
When an appropriations bill is signed, information from the state budget office is sent to the Legislative office that sponsored the grant, which works with the recipient to provide materials to the MEDC. After the necessary materials are signed by the parties, the corporation works to administer the grant, Armstrong explained, with 50% of the grant disbursed upfront. 
As part of the grant process, the economic development corporation expects that lawmakers have done some level of due diligence in their work with awardees before sponsoring a grant for them, Armstrong said.
After the initial disbursement the grantee has to prove that its funds have been used according to the grant agreement, Armstrong continued. Their team then confirms whether these expenditures are eligible or not. 
Grantees are also required to submit quarterly reports that include a narrative on the grant activities completed alongside expense reporting.
“If anything on that report seems off or problematic, then we ask questions and seek additional information or documentation as needed,” Armstrong said. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
During the two budget years when the Michigan Strategic Fund, which the Michigan Economic Development Corporation administrates, was in charge of the grants for the National Association of Yemeni Americans they believed the organization was in compliance with the Internal Revenue Service’s Requirements.
Tax exempt organizations like the association must file a Form 990 tax return with the IRS, which includes information about its revenue, expenses, activities and how much its highest paid employers and certain officers are compensated.
In more recent years, the grants to the group were instead administered by the Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity and the Department of Health and Human Services, which Armstrong explained structures its agreements differently, making it difficult to suspend the grant disbursement process.
Depending on the extent of any issues found while reviewing the grant’s first round of funding, the MEDC could also clawback some of those funds, Armstrong explained.
Minority Vice Chair Dylan Wegela (D-Garden City) noted that there are no requirements for grant recipients to file their 990 within the standard legal language in the budget, asking Armstrong whether the MEDC had any recommendations on how the Legislature could improve this language to ensure nonprofits receiving grants are operating above board.

Armstrong pointed to the earmark reforms that were recently signed into law as one example. The laws require lawmakers to publicly disclose their legislative spending requests at least 45 days before the state budget passes, including details on the grant recipient, the amount requested and the public purpose of the request. 
“I think you should require that [grantees] need to be in good standing with the state of Michigan. They should be in good standing with their tax filings with the IRS,” Armstrong said. 
The challenge with the current language around these complaints is that state agencies are not permitted to say no to a request if some pieces showing good standing are missing. 
“I think if we were trying to say no, I can almost guarantee we’re going to be hauled in front of a legislative office or committee explaining why we’re acting outside the scope of our authority,” Armstrong said. 
She encouraged lawmakers to consider what things they would like the bodies administering legislative grants to say “no” to when determining whether an award should be given or maintained.
“That would empower us, and then we’re not making independent judgment calls that maybe don’t align with what the legislative sponsors are saying,” Armstrong said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC_0274-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-11 06:57:07.945772

Columnist Walt Gasson reflects on the meaning of his family’s own roots.
The post Immigrant families built Wyoming. We must remember that. appeared first on WyoFile .","In 1893, Frederick Jackson Turner wrote “The Frontier in American History.” He declared that the American frontier was no more. My folks were new to the country, and as such, they may have missed the eminent historian’s proclamation. It’s possible they were busy with their efforts to scratch out a living in the sagebrush sea of southwestern Wyoming. My ancestors were immigrants.

Opinion

Turner never spoke about the nature of that frontier with stern little Laban Heward, my great-grandfather. Laban was an immigrant from England who came to Wyoming to do what he had done in Leicestershire — mine coal. He arrived here in 1880 with his brothers and brothers-in-law. They found work in the most dangerous mines on the Union Pacific line, near Evanston. A year later, he was joined by his beautiful wife, Elizabeth Fearn, and their children, one of whom became my grandmother. 
The great scholar never talked with my great-grandfather Friedrich Gasson, either. A perpetual immigrant, Fred immigrated with his family from eastern Germany to a sheep station in South Australia, then to a small farm near Ogden, Iowa. Not content to farm in a German immigrant community where the gently undulating land gets 36 inches of rain annually, Fred and his sturdy wife Caroline and their three young children climbed on the train and headed out for the territories: in this case, the Wyoming Territory and the small railroad town of Green River. A huge man, and undaunted by anything the cold desert had to offer, I’m sure he needed every ounce of courage to explain to Caroline that this was indeed the promised land. 
On my mother’s side came (legally or otherwise) the French-Canadian George Gravelle, a druggist — the pharmacist of his day — fresh from the gold rush at South Pass. The boom had busted, and the action was now in Green River. And action there was, when the widow Martha Baker accidentally dropped her baby in the river in 1875. His heroic attempt to save the child failed, but the Québécois’ courage must have impressed Mrs. Baker. They were married the next year, and my grandfather Gid was born the year after that. George died within months, at age 31.
From different parts of the world, with vastly disparate stories, these men and women came to the frontier that was southwest Wyoming and created the foundation for our family. But why did they come? I’ve wondered that from time to time, when I look at their photographs and walk the places they walked. What divine plan or series of random events threw these people onto that harsh landscape at that time? What was their motive? Why here? Why then? I think I know the answer. In a word, opportunity.
They were not alone. My hometown was replete with opportunity seekers from all over the world. In no small part, this was about the Union Pacific Railroad. Railroad jobs were good jobs — even if your English wasn’t quite perfect. The work was hard, for sure. The farther down you were on the organizational ladder, the harder it was. But the pay was good — good enough to support a family, if you had one or wanted to have one someday. 
So they came. The Basque guys came to herd sheep, and in time started sheep outfits of their own. Mexican guys came to herd sheep in the summer, but some of them stayed and got railroad jobs. The Greek guys and the Italian guys and the Eastern European guys started out on railroad jobs, but went on to own small businesses. Young men from all over the world found work and stayed to marry and raise families in Green River. Were they all legally naturalized citizens? Based on a sample of my own family, some were and some weren’t. Perhaps from a Shoshone point of view, none of us are. 
But all of us brought something to the dance. We brought our stories. We brought our cultures. We brought a fierce determination to make sure our kids had it better than we did. And we made our community a better place for it. The community I was born into in 1954 had multiple generations of people whose stories began someplace outside the United States. It was a place for people who were willing to take a chance. Immigrants all, they came to Wyoming because it was a better place than where they were before. Laban mined coal so his children could be ranchers. Fred ran a sheep outfit so his kids could run bigger sheep outfits. George gave his only child the best life he could and promptly died. All told, they invested and exhausted themselves in hard lives that gave their children a chance to live lives a little less hard, a little less exhausting. 
I don’t think it’s different today. People come to Wyoming from all over the country, all over the world. They come to work in the gas patch so their kids can be teachers. They come to be roofers so their kids can be accountants. They come to make hotel beds so their kids can be welders. It would be hypocritical for me to hold that against them, knowing that my own family came from England and Germany and Quebec for the same things. I know there are folks out there who want to draw a line between “us” who were born here and “them” who were not. But Wyoming was built on the foundation of immigrant families like mine. It will continue to be built on the labors of people from someplace else. And at the end of the day, literally and figuratively, there is no “us” and “them.” There’s only “we.”

(Photo by Christiana Botic/Verite News and Catchlight Local/Report for America)NEW ORLEANS — As the first week of an intensified immigration enforcement crackdown in southeast Louisiana came to an end, U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials remain tight-lipped about how many apprehensions federal agents have made to achieve their goal of 5,000 arrests, based on plans reviewed by the Associated Press in November, during the operation.
While offering little information about the overall operation, which began Dec. 3 with a series of raids at major home improvement stores, the DHS press office in a Monday press release praised federal agents for apprehending “rapists, thieves, gang members, human smugglers, and abusers” in the operation, dubbed “Catahoula Crunch.” The department highlighted eight immigrants originating from Latin America, most of whom were from Honduras, that it said had serious or violent criminal records ranging including domestic battery and domestic abuse.
However, less than a third of the 38 people who were arrested in the first two days of the operation appeared to have criminal records, according to records that the AP reviewed, which also showed operation leaders are monitoring social media accounts for threats to agents and indications of public sentiment.
The Times Picayune reported last week that immigrants arrested in the operation are first being taken to a newly opened U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in St. Rose — a town in St. Charles Parish where ICE contractor BI Inc. conducts its immigrant surveillance program — before being transferred across state lines to a jail in Hancock County, Mississippi — which has an intergovernmental service agreement with DHS to house federal detainees, and then on to one of Louisiana’s nine immigration detention centers.

When asked for information on the first week of the operation, a spokesperson for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the agency that Border Patrol falls under, referred Verite News to the Dec. 8 DHS press release.
“Catahoula Crunch” is the third operation of its kind in a major U.S. city in recent months, following operation “Midway Blitz” in Chicago and operation “Charlotte’s Web” in Charlotte, North Carolina.
In Chicago, federal agents focused on heavily Hispanic suburban neighborhoods near the city’s northwest side, sparking allegations of racial profiling — including of U.S. citizens of color caught up in the sweeps — and excessive use of force.
The New Orleans operation appears to be following a similar strategy, with community groups reporting heavy immigration enforcement activity in suburban areas such as Kenner which has the highest concentration of Hispanic residents in the state. Immigrants rights organizations have taken to Facebook and other social media sites to alert impacted community members of Border Patrol and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity in their areas. Area news organizations have reported allegations of U.S. citizens being apprehended or targeted by federal agents.
Members of local immigrant rights groups, such as Unión Migrante, have been monitoring immigration enforcement activity and posting sightings — at medical clinics, street corners and businesses — to social media. The group also posts advice on what to do in the event of an encounter with agents. On Tuesday, for example, the group posted a potential sighting of federal agents, along with Kenner Police Department cars, at Ochsner Medical Center in Kenner. The post said two cars had individuals in the back seats. A spokesperson for Ochsner Health, however, said the Kenner Police cars were there investigating a fender bender.
Rachel Taber, a Unión Migrante member, said she witnessed federal agents briefly at Ochsner’s main campus on Monday. The Ochsner spokesperson said they were not aware of any instances of federal immigration agents conducting immigration enforcement operations at any of Ochsner Health’s locations since the beginning of the Catahoula Crunch operation. DHS did not immediately respond to questions about immigration agents allegedly operating in or near medical campuses.
“It’s a life or death decision either way for immigrants. Many people are terrified to come out of their homes because they will be killed if deported to Honduras,” Taber told Verite News. “But there are people who will also die if they don’t get their cancer treatment or dialysis. So Border Patrol’s targeting hospitals now two days in a row is particularly cruel and unusual.”
Kenner Police Chief Keith Conley was not available for an interview or comment before this article was published.
In an interview last month, Conley said the department would assist federal agents in whatever way it is called to do so. The Kenner Police Department is formally partnered with ICE under a 287(g) agreement, which deputizes local and state officials to investigate civil immigration violations and begin deportation proceedings. Earlier this year, Kenner PD saw a spike in immigration detainers — requests to hold people suspected of breaking civil immigration laws in custody beyond their release dates so that they can be taken into ICE custody — a Verite News and Gulf States Newsroom investigation found.
The Louisiana State Police has also been assisting with the “Catahoula Crunch” operation. In a statement sent via email from Sgt. Kate Stegall, a public affairs officer from the agency’s Region NOLA, which encompasses Orleans and surrounding parishes, acknowledged that troopers have been providing “operational support.”
“Our Troopers have been in uniform and operating marked LSP vehicles to ensure a visible and coordinated presence,” Stegall said.

A number of businesses in areas with large Hispanic populations were shuttered throughout the region. Among them, Taqueria Guerrero, a Mexican restaurant in Mid-City, announced a temporary closure before the operation began. Nearby, a popular taco truck usually stationed at the corner of Broad and Canal Streets has not been seen in recent days.
In the days leading up to and in the initial days of the operation, Broad Street — a popular corridor for Hispanic businesses and customers — appeared abnormally quiet. One business owner told Verite News that she is unable to find essential workers, many of whom are Hispanic and fear being targeted in immigration raids.
A New York Times story found that the city’s restaurants, which rely heavily on immigrant labor, are already feeling the ripple effects of the enforcement operation. Prep cooks, line cooks and dishwashers are not showing up to work and some menu items are not being served because employees don’t want to risk being arrested while at a grocery store or market.
The operation also appears to be having an impact on school attendance.
On Tuesday, the Times Picayune reported that in Jefferson Parish, which has a higher population of students learning English than Orleans Parish, school absenteeism in the first two days of last week (before the operation officially began) was double the normal rate. Schools with large populations of English language learners had particularly high absenteeism rates. Aubri Juhasz, education reporter at NPR member station WWNO, told Verite News the numbers from Jefferson Parish schools will become clearer in the second week of the operation.
One local parent — who asked to remain anonymous because she fears she could be targeted by immigration enforcement authorities — said she brought her children to their school Jefferson Parish on the first day of the operation. But since then she and the kids have been staying home. She said she received a letter from the school assuring her the children would be safe at school.
“The problem is not when they’re in school. The problem is when someone would have to pick up the kids at the stop outside,” she said, speaking through an interpreter.
As a single mother who provides for her family by selling Central American food, she said her biggest fear is being evicted with her children because she can’t leave home and earn money to pay rent.
But she said, “I’m not leaving until they leave,” referring to Border Patrol.
Over the past week protesters have taken to City Hall and also to city streets. Carrying signs that read “No collaboration with ICE/CBP” protesters interrupted a New Orleans City Council meeting on Thursday, causing a pause in the day’s agenda and a suspension of public comment, which drew outrage. On Friday, New Orleans Mayor-elect Helena Moreno, City Council President JP Morrell, U.S. Congressman Troy Carter and other local leaders held a press conference demanding more transparency in tactics used during “Catahoula Crunch”  Over the weekend, groups of people holding posters denouncing immigration enforcement chanted in Metairie, New Orleans and Kenner.
This story was updated to include comments from an Ochsner Health spokesperson, who said they were not aware of immigration enforcement operations taking place at any Ochsner properties since the beginning of Catahoula Crunch.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)The TVA confirmation vote of former Nashville auto magnate Lee Beaman hit a wall this week amid questions about two Washington, D.C. rowhouses he owns and ties to embattled U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles.
The U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works was set to forward Beaman’s nomination to the full Senate until it ran into problems and was pulled from the agenda Wednesday.
Appalachian Voices, an advocacy group that opposes Beaman’s nomination, said in a statement, “The Tennessee Valley Authority is crucial to the wellbeing of people throughout the Southeast, managing everything from electricity rates and supply to flood control to river navigation, impacting millions of people. Lee Beaman is an unacceptable candidate for the TVA Board of Directors, and we’re hopeful that his removal from the agenda today is a sign that the committee is taking a closer look and will ultimately halt his confirmation process.”
Responding to a litany of questions about his political activity and properties in Washington, D.C., Beaman told members of the committee he bought the two houses totaling 6,500 square in D.C. in the name of Crockett Ventures and leased them to the nonprofit organization Ambassador Services International. The group is run by his pastor, Steve Berger, who has made inflammatory statements about LGBTQ people, saying he wants to beat them with a baseball bat. Berger accompanied Beaman to his initial hearing.
Car magnate Beaman draws fire during TVA board confirmation hearing

House Speaker Mike Johnson and Ogles, a Columbia Republican, are among the members of Congress believed to be living in the row houses, creating a conflict of interest for Beaman to serve on the Tennessee Valley Authority Board of Directors, senators said.
Beaman told senators in written responses to questions about the houses that he has no interest or control over the nonprofit organization, nor does he make decisions about who sub-leases from Ambassador Services International.
Democratic senators also raised the issue that Berger could be considered a lobbyist under federal law, creating another conflict of interest for the tenants and Beaman.  
A transcript of senators’ questions and Beaman’s responses shows that Berger founded a “discipleship program in Washington, D.C. to educate, equip, and inspire statesmen to live with compassion and confidence during their time of public service.” In addition, it says Berger and his wife, Sarah, who co-founded the organization, are trying to “correct our country’s trajectory and bring back the godly principles our country was founded on” by ensuring that “believers follow Jesus with bold, courageous faith.”
Beaman told the senators he isn’t involved in the ministry’s operations.
Asked if he understands that Berger’s actions could constitute “lobbying activity” under federal law, Beaman said he isn’t involved in lobbying. Beaman added that he went through an extensive clearance process and entered an ethics agreement, in addition to promising to uphold the TVA Act to serve people in the federal utility’s seven-state region.
Beaman also was listed as campaign treasurer for Ogles for four months in 2022 as questions surfaced about his fundraising. 
The House Ethics Committee found Ogles likely violated federal campaign finance laws, mainly by reporting an inflated personal loan of $320,000 to make his bid for office look stronger in 2022. Ogles initially said he raised $450,000 for the race, yet his first FEC report showed he brought in only $250,000.
Ogles amended campaign finance reports in May 2024 and acknowledged making a $20,000 loan to his campaign and saying the additional $300,000 was in a joint account he shared with his wife.
The ethics committee planned to subpoena Ogles to testify, but the matter has stalled since Johnson became House speaker, according to Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island.
Whitehouse told the panel a week ago that Beaman’s qualification to serve on the TVA board is that of a “Trump loyalist and 2020 election denier,” in reference to his support of President Donald Trump and claims that the presidential election of 2020 was stolen, a matter that has been debunked.
Whitehouse said Beaman signed a letter asking state lawmakers to appoint phony electors to overturn the election and noted he received a “Freedom Award” from Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity, which supports the fossil-fuel industry.
Beaman and Ogles haven’t responded to any requests for comment from the Lookout.

But beginning in 2026, the days in which visitors are allowed into them for free is changing, according to a press release from the U.S. National Park Service.
On Wednesday, it was also announced that a public lands group had sued the Trump administration for removing a photograph of Montana’s Glacier National Park on an annual pass as it was swapped for a collage portrait of George Washington and Donald J. Trump.
The Trump administration pushed back saying that the Glacier Park photograph would be used on national park passes for non-U.S. citizens, while the more common resident passes would contain Washington and Trump.
The Department of the Interior eliminated almost all the free-pass days listed for 2025, only keeping one of the eight designated days, Veterans Day (Nov. 11).
Instead, the Department of the Interior said that the new round of days will be “resident-only patriotic fee-free days.”
The newest line-up of fee-free days include Trump’s birthday, June 14, which is also Flag Day. It also includes former President Theodore Roosevelt’s birthday on Oct. 27.
Another change will be an increased fee system for out-of-country tourists. The fee-free days will not apply to out-of-country visitors.
Interior Secretary Doug Burgum explained the changes in a press release:
“President Trump’s leadership always puts American families first,” Burgum said. “These policies ensure that U.S. taxpayers, who already support the National Park System, continue to enjoy affordable access, while international visitors contribute their fair share to maintaining and improving our parks for future generations.”

(Photo by Jacob Orledge/North Dakota Monitor)A long-stalled oil refinery proposed near Theodore Roosevelt National Park recently appeared on a short list of projects being considered for North Dakota Legacy Fund investment.
Meridian Energy Group first proposed the Davis Refinery for a site near Belfield in 2016. The company, by 2022, had weathered the pandemic, won a pair of lawsuits seeking to stop the project and acquired all the necessary permits. It informed state regulators construction would begin that year and operations would begin by the end of 2025. 
The site of the proposed refinery remains empty. No equipment is present and no sign of activity is visible.
Now a firm responsible for investing $150 million of the state’s Legacy Fund is considering an investment in the project. Voters created the fund, recently valued at more than $13 billion, to invest state oil and gas revenue and create a lasting revenue source for the state. Legislators have pushed to invest more of the fund in North Dakota. 
GCM Grosvenor, a New York investment firm hired to manage the Legacy Fund’s investments in North Dakota projects, said in an Oct. 22 presentation to lawmakers it was considering a $10 million investment into the Meridian project. 
“It’s a really interesting project, and they have raised money around it,” said Michael Rose, a managing director of infrastructure with the firm. “It’s just very early stage.” 
Rose said the firm had met with Meridian Energy for about 10 hours and planned additional meetings to learn more about the opportunity.
Meridian CEO William Prentice said in an email the company plans to break ground on the estimated $1 billion facility in 2026. Its air quality and water use permits from two state agencies remain active despite years of inactivity.
Scott Skokos, executive director of the Dakota Resource Council that has opposed the Davis Refinery’s location 3 miles from Theodore Roosevelt National Park, said he thinks it would be a bad idea for the state to invest in the project that has spent a decade trying to raise the necessary funding. 
“That’s enough to say this is a bad investment,” Skokos said. “They’re ignoring all the red flags.”
Prentice declined to specify how much money Meridian has raised to date. But he said the money raised, combined with funding arrangements with investment banks, is “more than adequate for the needs of the Davis project.” The company reported raising more than $35.6 million from 530 investors in filings to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Meridian’s last SEC filing was in 2022, records show. GCM Grosvenor told lawmakers the company has raised $75 million of the $1 billion project so far. 
Ron Ness, president of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, said he hadn’t considered the possibility of using Legacy Fund dollars for the Davis Refinery.
“However, one of the goals of the Legacy Fund was to grow the N.D. economic base and diversify our economy,” Ness said in a statement. “Additional refining capacity in the state is a great value-add to our oil resources along with supporting rural economic development.”
‘Early review’
A possible investment into the Davis Refinery is in the “early review” stage for the firm handling the Legacy Fund’s infrastructure investments. Rose and Scott Litman, the two managing directors who briefed lawmakers, said they considered it an interesting opportunity but would wait until later in the project development process before committing any money. 
State officials will not have a say in whether GCM Grosvenor invests $10 million in the project or not. GCM Grosvenor is given autonomy in evaluating investment opportunities and deciding whether to proceed in order to insulate the process from political influence, said Jodi Smith, executive director of the state Retirement and Investment Office that monitors the program. 
North Dakota to expand in-state Legacy Fund investments

A GCM spokesperson said the firm considers a broad range of factors when determining how to invest but declined to comment on specific projects under consideration, citing an internal policy. 
“Every deal that goes through or that will ultimately come into this program will need to be approved by our investment committee,” Rose told lawmakers. “We’re not going to just take opportunities that come from anybody on this list and be like, ‘Well, OK, where do we sign?’ It’s got to go through our process.”
Rep. Keith Kempenich, R-Bowman, was one of the legislators present for the presentation. He represents the area the proposed refinery would be located in and supports the project. But the lawmaker said he would not be in favor of investing Legacy Fund dollars into a project like the Davis Refinery that is still looking for “seed money.”
“It’s up to the private industry to figure out where they want to go,” Kempenich said in an interview.
Project delays
Meridian has cited lawsuits, the COVID-19 pandemic and a lack of financing as reasons for delaying construction on the Davis Refinery. County records and court documents show the company has had trouble paying employees and contractors. 
In 2019, engineering firm SEH filed a $2.1 million lien against the property that Meridian plans to construct the refinery on, according to Billings County records. SEH later filed a lien against the company with the North Dakota secretary of state as well. SEH has continued to complete work for Meridian in recent years, according to minutes of local government meetings. 
In May 2020, Gibson Applied Technology and Engineering filed a lawsuit against Meridian seeking more than $400,000 for unpaid invoices. Later the same year, seven Meridian employees sued the company to obtain more than $600,000 in unpaid wages. Both lawsuits were filed in Texas and were resolved out of court. 
In a court document from an unrelated lawsuit, also filed in Texas, a former Meridian employee said in a deposition that employees went without paychecks and were on public assistance in 2020 when the company wasn’t raising money.
Meridian began construction, by regulatory standards, in 2021 when it signed an engineering, procurement and construction contract with a new firm, McDermott International. But no significant on-site work was performed until years later, in 2023, when it approached Billings County for permission to improve local roads leading to the proposed refinery’s site. 
Meridian has widened the roads and rebuilt them with gravel, said Billings County Highway Superintendent Pat Redmond. But he doesn’t know when Meridian will begin moving heavy construction materials to the site.
“I’ve been told numerous start dates but none of them have come true yet,” Redmond said. 
Meridian has paid for the road work. Billings County required the company to provide a $1.8 million letter of credit before beginning the work, according to county commission minutes. 
“We didn’t want to get stuck with a road half built,” said County Commissioner Steve Klym.

Prentice said in an email his company plans to complete the road improvements in spring 2026 and begin construction on the foundation of the refinery around the same time. 
Meridian “decided to take a more measured approach during and immediately after COVID,” contributing to the project’s delays, Prentice said. The additional time has enabled Meridian to develop advancements with its design, he said. The company is negotiating a contract for an engineering firm to construct the facility and turn it over to Meridian ready to operate. 
Prentice noted all litigation has been resolved but declined to comment further on the legal disputes. Prentice did not respond to questions about why employees were not being paid, the liens filed by SEH, critics’ concerns, and the unfulfilled timelines provided to Billings County. 
Permits are active
North Dakota regulators first issued an air quality construction permit for the Davis Refinery in 2018 and a water use permit in 2019. 
Air quality construction permits issued by the North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality typically expire within 18 months unless construction begins or an extension has been granted, Division of Air Quality Director Jim Semerad said in an email. 
Regulators granted an initial 18-month extension due to lawsuits by environmental groups against Meridian that were resolved in 2020. 
That extension was due to expire in 2021. But Meridian signed an engineering contract with McDermott International that year. Air quality regulators determined that was sufficient to consider the project under construction. 
“The legal definition of start of construction in the air quality world has often been debated,” Semerad said in an interview. “It really is everything from signing contracts to actual construction that you’d notice as you’re driving by.”
Meridian also has to show construction progress in order for the air quality permit to remain in effect. The Department of Environmental Quality evaluates that on a case-by-case basis. 
Semerad cited COVID-19 and tariffs as two prominent reasons why the Davis Refinery project has been slowed. 
The water resource permit authorizes Meridian to draw water from the Dakota Aquifer. The Department of Water Resources has awarded extensions in 2022 and September 2025. The permit now expires in March 2029, but is unlikely to be extended again. 
“By that time, more than ten years will have passed since permit approval, and further extensions are unlikely to be approved if water has not been put to beneficial use,” said John Paczkowski, state engineer, in a letter notifying the company of the latest extension.
Skokos said he believes Meridian is using technicalities to keep its environmental permits active.
“Every once in a while they’ll go do some dirt work, or they’ll sign a contract and make it appear like they’re doing something, and then they’ll put out a press release saying they did something, even though they didn’t really do anything,” Skokos said. “And then they keep looking for investors.”
The project promised to bring up to 200 new permanent jobs. But Klym, asked whether he thought the refinery would eventually get built after years of delays, demurred. 
“No comment,” he said.

(Photo by Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger moved Thursday to elevate one of the General Assembly’s most seasoned environmental lawmakers, selecting Del. David Bulova, D-Fairfax, to lead Virginia’s natural and historic resources portfolio when she takes office next month.
Spanberger said Bulova’s decades in environmental planning and his legislative work on water quality, Chesapeake Bay cleanup and conservation policy make him well suited to steer the administration’s efforts on climate resilience, preservation and land stewardship. In announcing the choice, she framed the appointment as central to her agenda.
“From the wonders of the Shenandoah Valley to the waters of the Chesapeake Bay, Virginia’s natural resources, public lands, and historic sites define our commonwealth,” Spanberger said. 
In his role as Virginia’s next secretary of natural and historic resources, Bulova will “bring decades of experience to our efforts to strengthen our commonwealth’s conservation, resilience, and preservation efforts.”
A 19-year House veteran whose district includes the city of Fairfax and parts of Fairfax County, Bulova, 56, said he was “deeply honored” and said his long record on clean water and conservation have prepared him for the role.
“Preserving and restoring Virginia’s environment is a life-long passion for me,” he said. He added that Spanberger “shares that passion, as evidenced by her work on the House Agriculture Committee, and understands what it takes to safeguard our natural resources for future generations.”
Bulova also emphasized the economic stakes, saying the governor-elect “understands that a healthy environment and a strong economy go hand-in-hand.”
A project manager at international engineering and environmental consulting firm WSP USA, Bulova brings more than 30 years of professional experience in water resources policy, Chesapeake Bay restoration, stormwater compliance, strategic planning and stormwater finance. 
Before joining WSP, he served as the Northern Virginia Regional Commission’s director of environmental services.
Inside the General Assembly, Bulova chairs the House General Laws Committee, the Commerce, Agriculture, and Natural Resources subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee, and the Chesapeake subcommittee of the Agriculture, Chesapeake, and Natural Resources Committee. 
He also sits on the Chesapeake Bay Commission — where he has twice served as chair — and the State Water Commission. From 2004 to 2006, he served as an elected member of the Northern Virginia Soil and Water Conservation District.
Spanberger’s decision signals she intends to lean on that legislative and technical experience as her administration confronts climate pressures, rising seas, aging water systems, and growing public expectations for clean rivers, healthier forests and more resilient infrastructure.
Over his nearly two decades in the House, Bulova has been a familiar broker among environmental groups, local governments, manufacturers and utilities. 
He has shepherded funding for agricultural best management practices, spearheaded investments to upgrade wastewater treatment plants, and backed initiatives to combat invasive species. He also worked on a pay-for-outcomes pollution-reduction pilot program for the Chesapeake Bay.
During the 2025 session, Bulova partnered with environmental organizations, water utilities and manufacturers on bipartisan legislation to curb PFAS contamination in one of Virginia’s major drinking water sources — a win that environmentalists credited to his willingness to convene groups that often clash over regulatory issues.
In 2019, the nonprofit VIRGINIAforever honored him with its Bridge Builder award for contributions to natural resources stewardship.
As with other districts where Democratic incumbents have been chosen for roles in Spanberger’s administration, Bulova’s departure from the House will set off a special election to fill the vacancy in strongly Democratic House District 11 before lawmakers convene in mid-January. 
The timing could further compress an already tight calendar as incoming leadership organizes committees and prepares for the new session.
Advocates say Bulova’s background — spanning technical water policy, local government experience and legislative know-how — positions him to navigate one of the state’s broadest and most complex secretariats, which oversees the Department of Environmental Quality, the Department of Conservation and Recreation, the Marine Resources Commission and several historic preservation agencies.
Bulova referenced that responsibility in his statement, citing the promise embedded in the state constitution “to protect its atmosphere, lands, and waters from pollution, impairment, or destruction, for the benefit, enjoyment, and general welfare of the people of the commonwealth.”
Bulova is a graduate of William & Mary and holds a master’s degree in public administration from Virginia Tech. A 1997 graduate of the Sorensen Institute for Political Leadership, he and his wife, Gretchen, reside in Fairfax County and have three children. 
Outside of work, the family enjoys hiking in Virginia’s parks, a pastime he often cites as a reminder of what the state stands to lose without strong protections.
Spanberger takes office in January, when Bulova is expected to step down from his House seat to join her cabinet.

(Photos: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout) The 11th Commandment, according to President Ronald Reagan, ​​was “Thou shalt not speak ill of any fellow Republican.” 
Reagan used the phrase during his 1966 campaign to become California governor, and according to a 2017 Politico story, the phrase spoke to a larger issue: Moderate and conservative wings of the Republican Party were at odds after the 1964 presidential election, with the former blaming the latter for Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater’s defeat. 
If this sounds familiar, it could be because Tennessee Democrats regularly engage in the same type of circular firing squad after elections, endlessly relitigating the results and arguing about whether a moderate or a liberal would be more successful. 
Democrats still heartily debate whether former Tennessee Gov. Phil Bredesen, a Democrat so moderate as to have been accused of being a Republican elephant in donkey’s skin, was the best candidate to challenge U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn in the 2018 Senate election. 
This pattern has been on display again since the Dec. 2 special election in Congressional District 7, in which Republican Matt Van Epps defeated Democratic state Rep. Aftyn Behn of Nashville. 
Glass-half-full Democrats point to Behn’s slicing of the GOP advantage in the district: She lost to Van Epps by just under 9 percentage points only a year after President Donald Trump and now-retired U.S. Rep. Mark Green carried the district by 22 percentage points. 
But others — podcasters, politicos, journalists and rank-and-file Democratic voters — have for more than a week been openly positing that a candidate perceived to be more moderate than Behn might have won the congressional seat. 
None of the arguments change the outcome but it’s worth unpacking them.
The district was made for a Republican win
The last time a Democrat was elected in the 7th Congressional District was in 1980, before the late Ed Jones was drawn into District 8 and Republican Don Sundquist — who went on to serve two terms as governor — was elected in 1982. That’s a trend that has held through four subsequent redistrictings — the process in which the Tennessee General Assembly may redraw the lines for state House, Senate and congressional districts following once-a-decade U.S. Census surveys. 



				There’s no data to support the idea that Republicans cross over to vote for any Democrat, no matter how moderate, if a qualified Republican is on the ballot. 			


Democrats note that the current version of the 7th District is gerrymandered, and they are correct, but that doesn’t explain how the GOP held onto the seat following the 1980, 1990 and 2000 redistricting processes, when Democrats held legislative majorities. 
During the 2022 redistricting, Green expressed concern about the new lines for the 7th District, which now include portions of Democratic-leaning Davidson County. But no matter: If Republican lawmakers thought a Democrat could feasibly win, they would have rejiggered the district lines to draw in even greater portions of rural and conservatively voting areas. 
Was there a moderate Democrat in the race and would it have made a difference?
There’s a conception among some Tennessee Democrats that Behn was too liberal to win, while others among the four-member Democratic primary field were ‘moderate.’ 
But is that the case? Behn ran on a platform of “Feed kids, fix roads, fund hospitals,” which doesn’t seem like wild-eyed liberalism. In the state House, she has sponsored a bill to end Tennessee’s regressive grocery tax and worked with a Republican lawmaker on a measure that would create transparency in investigations of sexual harassment claims involving lawmakers. 
Rep. Bo Mitchell of Nashville, who was early considered a frontrunner in the primary but eventually came in third, is no shrinking violet. He’s openly supportive of the right to have an abortion, cosponsored gun safety measures, participated in a Biden Administration gun safety summit, and opposed a bill targeting transgender Tennesseans. 
Another Democratic primary candidate, Rep. Vincent Dixie, rates an F from the conservative Tennessee Legislative Scorecard. He’s voted against open gun carry, for a measure to loosen the state’s abortion ban, and against a bill that would have required public schools to either do a DNA test on students in sports or provide a birth certificate to prove their gender. 
All of which is to say that all of the Democrats were likely too liberal for Republican standards, and I’ve found no data to support the assumption that Republican voters cross over to vote for what Democrats perceive as a moderate candidate when there is a qualified Republican on the ballot. 
The Trump factor
Democrats might not have been able to understand the appeal of Van Epps, but Republican voters did. Besides being a product of middle class parents who bootstrapped his way to West Point and served multiple combat missions in the Middle East, he had an endorsement that proved vital to his success: President Donald Trump. 
Trump endorsed Van Epps in both the primary and the general election and held two virtual town hall events for him, as well as calling in to a get-out-the-vote rally the day before the election.
In his victory speech, Van Epps said that “running away from Trump is how you lose, running with Trump is how you win.” 
Democrats have posted significant wins throughout the fall, including in New Jersey and Virginia governor’s races and in Tuesday’s Miami mayor’s race. But both Virginia and New Jersey are “purple” states and have regularly elected Democrats to leading roles. Tennessee, not so much. The last time a Democrat won statewide office was in 2006, when Bredesen was reelected to a second term as governor. 
It remains to be seen if the 7th District continues to shift towards Democrats if the U.S. economy spirals under the Trump administration, but in the meantime, infighting Democrats could use a dose of reality.

(Photo by Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)The first investment of North Dakota Legacy Fund dollars into an in-state infrastructure project could be made in early 2026 and help bolster a proposed pipeline to export natural gas out of the Bakken oil field. 
The state has allocated $150 million from the Legacy Fund for investment in “asset-based projects,” such as infrastructure, real estate and agriculture. The Legacy Fund, which invests state oil and gas revenue, was recently valued at $13 billion.
“We have billions and billions of dollars of infrastructure that needs to be worked on in North Dakota,” said Rep. Mike Nathe, R-Bismarck, the primary sponsor of the 2021 bill that led to the program’s creation. “This tranche of money will definitely help us take care of that need.”
That program, officially called the North Dakota Real Assets Fund and informally known as the in-state infrastructure investment program, has not made any investments yet. GCM Grosvenor, a New York investment firm, was hired this summer to manage the fund.
GCM Grosvenor will make investments in increments of $10 million and $25 million. The firm plans to deploy around $50 million over the next three years.
The firm is in the early stages of reviewing four opportunities and will likely make decisions on two possibilities in 2026, said Michael Rose, one of two managing directors for infrastructure alongside Scott Litman. The pair briefed lawmakers on the program’s status on Oct. 22.
The first possible project is a natural gas pipeline proposed by Intensity Infrastructure Partners that would connect McKenzie County to Rainbow Energy’s planned industrial park in central North Dakota. The second is a network of crude oil and natural gas gathering pipelines in the Bakken. 
GCM Grosvenor is avoiding projects where the state’s investment would represent a significant portion of the total financing. The team is focusing on opportunities where the state’s investment will represent a small slice of the total cost and the project is nearly ready for construction. 
That’s aligned with state officials’ goal of leveraging small, diverse investments to attract additional funds from outside North Dakota. 
Legacy Fund in-state investment program poses tricky transparency questions

“We want to bring outside capital in to benefit the state,” said Sen. Brad Bekkedahl, a Republican from Williston, during the Oct. 22 meeting. 
GCM Grosvenor manages infrastructure investments for 150 clients. Stephen Brewster, managing director of client services for GCM Grosvenor, said the firm has the ability to make larger investments in a project, beyond what it manages for the Legacy Fund. 
“That’s a great opportunity for the state,” Brewster said. “If the investment is good enough for North Dakota, and we’re the ones reviewing it, it should be good enough for other clients as well.”
GCM Grosvenor is the second outside firm hired to invest Legacy Fund money in the state. The North Dakota Growth Fund, managed by 50 South Capital, was established in 2021 and is authorized to invest up to $250 million in private equity funds and private companies with the goal of stimulating North Dakota’s economy while still generating a return on investment. The firm has invested $73.6 million as of June 30. 
North Dakota also uses Legacy Fund money to support two different low-interest loan programs through the Bank of North Dakota.
No political influence
A key principle underlying the in-state investment of Legacy Fund money is to insulate the decision-making from political influences. 
“We did not want North Dakota politicians influencing and directing money for investment because of their goals, or their friends’ goals, or their connections’ goals,” Bekkedahl said.

That’s one reason external investment firms like GCM Grosvenor have been hired to manage these investments. The firm, by design, has the autonomy to invest the $150 million without approval from state officials on any given project. 
“We should not be biasing the decision through any of our political influences and or personal preferences for a project,” said Jodi Smith, executive director of the state Retirement and Investment Office. “And so that’s why we have Grosvenor because they will look at it independently from us and make a determination if it’s still a good investment of the fund.”
The policy also limits the state’s oversight of how the Legacy Fund is invested. The Retirement and Investment Office, which oversees the in-state investment programs, only has one concrete remedy if state officials are not satisfied with GCM Grosvenor’s decisions. 
“We would always have the right, if we didn’t like what we were seeing, to terminate them as a manager,” said Lance Ziettlow, a portfolio manager with the Retirement and Investment Office. 
GCM Grosvenor has to abide by the state’s investment policy, developed by the State Investment Board and the Legacy and Budget Stabilization Fund Advisory Board, which includes guardrails such as a $25 million limit on any single investment. But the state is by and large relying on GCM Grosvenor’s internal due diligence process to ensure the $150 million is invested wisely.
The firm’s due diligence process is designed to assess a broad range of risks and benefits associated with each project, Litman said in an email. The firm typically invests in fewer than 10% of the deals it investigates, he said.
“We bring deals to a vote of our Investment Committee and Operational Due Diligence Committee, and only after the approval of each committee will we consider making an investment,” Litman said.
Natural gas pipeline moving forward
The natural gas pipeline is the opportunity that is furthest along GCM Grosvenor’s review process, with a decision anticipated in the first three months of next year. 
The pipeline is being developed by Oklahoma-based Intensity Infrastructure Partners. The company was one of two that applied for a $500 million financial guarantee from the North Dakota Industrial Commission, but commissioners instead chose a competing pipeline project from WBI Energy.
Intensity announced in June the pipeline would be a partnership with Rainbow Energy, the owner of Coal Creek Station in Underwood, to help provide power to a planned industrial park on the property.

Rainbow Energy is negotiating with a data center developer interested in building in the nascent industrial park, said Jessica Bell, vice president of external affairs, during a November presentation. The data centers would be powered by a combination of the coal-fired power plant and a planned natural gas power plant. 
Bell declined to specify the companies Rainbow is working with during her November presentation to lawmakers. A spokesperson for Intensity did not return requests for comment.
GCM Grosvenor’s Rose said they have interest in the Intensity pipeline as an investment opportunity because of how advanced the project is and the “steady cash flow” it will generate once built. 
“There’s no real risk here,” Rose said.
Both Intensity’s pipeline and the network of gathering pipelines were brought to the firm’s attention by EIV, a venture capital firm GCM Grosvenor often works with. EIV is investing around $100 million of its own funds in each project, Rose said.
GCM Grosvenor also is considering investing in the Davis Refinery proposed by Meridian Energy Group as well as two manufactured housing communities in Williston. The firm had also done due diligence on investing in multi-family housing in North Dakota, Colorado and Minnesota, though that deal is no longer available.

(Photo by Kelcie Moseley-Morris/Idaho Capital Sun)East Idaho continues to see unprecedented growth. Families are looking for community connections like those in eastern Idaho offers in order to build their dreams. Businesses are expanding, and communities throughout the region are planning for their future. Yet in my work partnering with cities and counties across the region to understand their challenges and build long-term capacity, I hear the same message repeatedly: Our housing system is not keeping up with the needs of everyday Idahoans.
New Idaho housing affordability group launches. Its first goal? City-level policy changes.

This shortage isn’t simply the result of growth. It’s the product of rules, codes, and processes that make it challenging to build the types of homes low and middle-income workers rely on. Teachers, firefighters, health care workers, and young families are being priced out or pushed farther away from job centers because the homes they need aren’t being built, and, under current zoning, they often can’t be built at all.
Single-family zoning continues to dominate most Idaho cities, even as demand shifts toward smaller, more attainable starter homes. Builders, particularly local, small, Idaho-based builders, say that the biggest obstacles aren’t construction costs but bureaucratic barriers like long timelines, unclear requirements, public hearings for simple projects, and inconsistent interpretations of code. These delays push good, modest projects off the table before they even begin.
The consequences reach far beyond housing. Eastern Idaho employers report struggling to hire because workers can’t find homes within a reasonable commute. If we want strong local economies, thriving small businesses, and the ability to attract and keep talent, we must ensure workers can live near their jobs.
Fortunately, opportunities lie right in front of us. Many east Idaho communities have underused commercial corridors and aging retail strips, many of them areas that already have existing infrastructure and are near jobs, schools, and transit. Zoning rules often block these ideal housing options with expensive rezones or parking mandates that far exceed what a project realistically needs. Allowing housing in these corridors should be one of the fastest, least controversial ways to add our region’s share of the 55,000 new homes Idaho needs while revitalizing dated parts of our cities and towns.
An overdue statewide strategy can assist local leaders with clear data, unlock approvals for the kinds of modest, infill projects that builders are eager to deliver, and ensure our housing supply aligns with workforce needs.
I’m proud to be part of the new Gem State Housing Alliance, which is stepping up to organize local leaders, gather the data cities need but often lack, and elevate practical, Idaho-specific policy solutions. By focusing on smaller homes, simpler processes, and more housing near jobs, the housing alliance is advancing reforms that can help east Idaho communities thrive.
Idaho families deserve attainable housing choices. Our employers deserve a stable workforce. And communities across our state should remain places where people can build a life. With statewide leadership and local collaboration, Idaho can build more of the homes residents need.

The family agreed to give Genesis a year to start the payments, only for the company to declare bankruptcy in July. (Adria Malcolm for KFF Health News)Nancy Hunt arrived at an emergency room from a Genesis HealthCare nursing home in Pennsylvania in such dreadful shape, including maggots infesting her gangrened foot, that the hospital called an elder abuse hotline and then the police, her son alleged in a lawsuit.
Hunt died five days later. Her death certificate said the foot injury was a “significant” factor. Genesis denied wrongdoing but agreed to pay $3.5 million in a settlement Hunt’s son signed in August 2024.
Yet Genesis hasn’t paid most of that debt, court records show. It may never have to.
Once the nation’s largest nursing home chain, Genesis says it was spending $8 million a month defending and settling lawsuits over resident injuries and deaths in recent years. But the company is now poised to wipe the liability slate clean by seeking refuge in the most protective corner of the legal system for the nursing home industry: bankruptcy court.
The Genesis case, one of 11 large senior care bankruptcies this year, illustrates how health care companies can dodge public and financial accountability for alleged negligence through delays, confidentiality clauses, and bankruptcy maneuvers, a KFF Health News investigation found.
When it filed for bankruptcy in Dallas in July, Genesis estimated its total liability for nearly a thousand settled and pending lawsuits at $259 million. A KFF Health News review of the terms of 155 settlement agreements and corporate financial statements shows Genesis officials knew insolvency was possible yet included provisions in its settlement agreements allowing it to defer payment, often for a year or more.
As a result, Genesis paid nothing in 85 cases and only a portion in the other 70, according to civil court records and bankruptcy claims made available through people with access to them. It still owes $41 million of the $58 million it had agreed to pay in those cases, the records show.
Nellie Betancourt, shown in a photo with her husband, Gabe, had planned a trip to Las Vegas before she fractured her hip at a Genesis HealthCare rehabilitation center — an injury the medical examiner’s report said led to her death. “When she went into that place, I said, ‘Well, she’s going to be taken care of for a few more days and I’ll take her home,’” Gabe says. (Adria Malcolm for KFF Health News)
“It just feels like they killed my mom and got away with it,” said Vanessa Betancourt, whose mother, Nellie Betancourt, a retired nurse, fractured her hip at a Genesis home in Albuquerque, New Mexico — an injury the medical examiner’s report said led to her death. Genesis agreed to a $650,000 settlement with Betancourt’s family in April under the condition it would not need to pay the first of seven installments for another year, according to the settlement document.

Genesis denied wrongdoing in all lawsuits and settlements. In a written statement, the company did not answer questions about individual personal injury cases. The statement said Genesis remained “focused on delivering high-quality, compassionate care to our patients and residents without disruption” during bankruptcy.
One lawsuit Genesis settled for nearly $1 million alleged nursing home managers ignored repeated warnings about a male resident’s behavior before he sexually assaulted a female Alzheimer’s patient, according to court records. In a case the company resolved for $500,000, a Genesis nursing home was accused of delaying the hospitalization of a resident who had vomited brown mucus. He died of a bowel obstruction. Genesis has paid nothing for either settlement, according to bankruptcy claims.
Creditors, including families of the deceased, are expected to salvage a fraction of what they were promised, if anything. On Dec. 10, the company’s owners were scheduled to seek approval by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas to sell its nursing homes and other assets to its largest investor, a private equity firm. In court papers, lawyers for residents and other creditors say the complex plan will prevent them from pursuing Genesis’ new ownership and other companies they blame for the company’s collapse.
John Anthony, a bankruptcy attorney representing 340 personal injury claims against Genesis, said, “They never had any intention to honor these deals.”
Low ratings and fines
During years of financial turmoil, Genesis has frequently struggled to provide top-notch care, federal records show. Using its five-star system, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services rated 58% of homes affiliated with Genesis as below average or much below average. CMS has fined Genesis homes $10 million for violating federal health standards over the past three years.
In 2022, Connecticut health regulators shuttered a Genesis home after two deaths and multiple violations. The company closed another Connecticut nursing home this year after residents twice were evacuated over safety concerns.
In its Chapter 11 filing, Genesis said it cared for about 15,000 residents in 165 nursing homes and 10 assisted living facilities in 18 states. They are centered in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, New Mexico, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Maine, Alabama, Maryland, and North Carolina, according to the bankruptcy filing.
The company said it owed $709 million in secured debt to lenders and the IRS. Under bankruptcy rules, those debts, backed by Genesis collateral, take precedence over the $1.6 billion in unsecured debt Genesis said it owes. Unsecured creditors include a pension fund; contractors that provided health services and equipment; Pennsylvania, New Mexico, and West Virginia for unpaid provider taxes; and former residents and their families who sued.
Dangers in memory care
Sandia Ridge Center, a Genesis home in Albuquerque, was repeatedly faulted by health regulators for not preventing sexual misbehavior in its memory care unit. In November 2021, CMS cited the home for lacking enough nurses to prevent sexual abuse among residents. An inspection report the following August identified more inappropriate sexual contact. Police were called to investigate sexual assault allegations in February and March of 2023, police reports show; neither resulted in criminal charges.
Then in April 2023, a 61-year-old male resident with alcohol-related dementia sexually assaulted a female resident with Alzheimer’s in the dining room, according to a police report and an inspection report. When the resident screamed for him to stop and that he was hurting her, he responded “shut up bitch I know you like this,” according to a lawsuit brought on behalf of the woman, identified in court papers as R.S.
Sandia Ridge management had been aware of the male resident’s behavioral issues for months, according to employee depositions in the case. Police had investigated a prior sexual assault allegation against him the previous year without bringing charges. In one deposition, a former activities assistant testified he hit her and twice pushed her into a bathroom while announcing, “I want to have sex with you.” When she reported him to a senior Genesis manager, she said in the deposition, the manager put his finger over his lips and said, “Shhh.”
The activities worker testified that R.S. used to happily sing along with Elvis Presley songs. After the assault, the worker said, R.S. “don’t sing anymore.”
Inspectors cited the home for failing to protect R.S. The same report said the home didn’t provide a therapist for another female resident who was being sexually harassed. Medicare fined Sandia Ridge Center $91,247. Genesis denied liability but settled R.S.’ lawsuit for $925,000 in May, according to the bankruptcy claim.
“We just felt we have to hold them accountable,” R.S.’ daughter said in an interview, speaking on the condition that she and her mother not be identified, because of the nature of the assault. “Maybe I’m wrong, maybe I’m naive, but the only way to do that is to sue someone, right?”
Genesis has not paid any of the settlement, according to the family’s claim filing.

Growth and debt
Genesis’ downfall can be traced to 2007, when affiliates of two private equity firms acquired the company in a $1.5 billion leveraged buyout, taking on substantial debt, according to its bankruptcy filing. Private equity also has been involved in other health care bankruptcies, including those of the HCR ManorCare nursing home chain, the prison health care contractor Corizon Health, and two for-profit hospital systems, Steward Health Care and Prospect Medical Holdings.
In 2011, Genesis raised $2.4 billion by transferring substantially all its nursing home buildings and other real estate to Welltower, a publicly traded real estate investment trust, according to Genesis’ bankruptcy filing. Genesis then rented the buildings back from Welltower, which made leasing costs a significant expense.
Genesis went on a nationwide buying spree. At its peak in 2016, it had grown to more than 500 nursing homes. In a court declaration, Louis Robichaux IV, a consultant overseeing Genesis’ bankruptcy restructuring, wrote that as the company expanded, it became harder to manage and “mired in corporate inefficiencies.” Robichaux wrote that Genesis’ financial woes were exacerbated by rapidly increasing labor costs and lawsuits, including some predating the covid pandemic.
Starting in 2021, Genesis avoided bankruptcy after receiving $100 million in loans from a private equity firm founded by Joel Landau, the owner of a Brooklyn-based nursing home chain, according to Robichaux’s filing.
But Genesis continued to teeter on the edge of insolvency. In audited financial statements for 2022 and 2023 submitted to a California oversight agency, management and auditors said rent and debt obligations raised “substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern.”
In a court filing, a committee appointed by the U.S. Trustee’s Office to represent the unsecured creditors in the bankruptcy accused Landau and Welltower of orchestrating a covert plan that allowed Welltower to keep getting its rents while Landau could run the company and “siphon value to himself.” The committee alleged their efforts forced the company into insolvency while “staffing levels and patient care declined precipitously.” Landau and Welltower did not respond to requests for comment.
Drawn-out lawsuits
Erin Pearson sued Genesis over the death of her father, James Sanderson, a retired mining company executive who died in 2018 after spending less than a month at Bear Canyon Rehabilitation Center in Albuquerque. In the memory care unit, Sanderson fell repeatedly, suffered medication errors made by nursing home staff, and developed a bowel obstruction and sepsis, according to the lawsuit, filed in 2019. Pearson’s lawyers said he was not hospitalized until eight days after nurses noticed he was vomiting brown mucus.

After the judge rejected Genesis’ request to force Pearson into arbitration, Genesis appealed. It took 2½ years before an appeals court affirmed the original decision to let the case go forward in court, records show.
This past May, more than five years after suing, Pearson reached a $500,000 settlement, with the first payment required by November, according to a copy of the agreement. Nothing was paid, according to the bankruptcy claim.
“It was so drawn out and for so long,” Pearson said in an interview, calling Genesis’ bankruptcy “despicable.”
Payouts postponed
Jennifer Foote, an Albuquerque attorney who represents clients in multiple lawsuits against Genesis, including Pearson’s, said the company frequently filed appeals. “They did not usually win them on these issues,” she said, “and our sense was that they were doing it as a delay tactic.”
Genesis HealthCare settlements included periodic payment plans, like this one from a $600,000 settlement in February 2025, included in a court record, that allowed the company to delay paying for a year or more. (KFF Health News screengrab)
Genesis started using installment payments around 2018, said Dusti Harvey, Foote’s law partner. “The payments wouldn’t start for several months out,” Harvey said. Foote said Genesis’ lawyers often wanted to time the payments to start the month the trial in the case was scheduled to occur.
Families had to wait even when comparatively small amounts of money were involved, settlement agreements show. Genesis’ settlement agreements also included a confidentiality clause prohibiting discussion of the incidents.
Genesis agreed to pay $42,000 in a November 2024 settlement, but the first payment was not due until nine months later. It was not paid, according to the bankruptcy claim.
A $250,000 settlement signed in October 2023 did not start paying out until the following September. When Genesis declared bankruptcy — 21 months after the case was resolved — it still owed $100,000, according to the family’s claim.
‘We never found out the truth’
Settling cases allowed Genesis to avoid the expense and publicity of a trial, at which details of how its nursing homes functioned might have been revealed. In October 2020, Margarett Johnson, a retired school bus driver, fell out of her wheelchair at a Genesis nursing home in Waldorf, Maryland, fracturing her jawbone, nose, and neck, according to a lawsuit brought by her family. Johnson was sent to a trauma center and placed on a ventilator. She died three months later, at age 76, from ventilator-associated pneumonia, the lawsuit said.
“It looked like she was hit by a truck,” Angelina Harley, one of her daughters, said in an interview. “I knew my mom was not going to come home. I knew the Lord was not going to punish her more.”
Genesis HealthCare still owes $112,500 from a $950,000 settlement over the death of Margarett Johnson after an accident in a Maryland nursing home, according to a bankruptcy claim. She is seen here with her brother William Tolson. (Angela Swann)
The company denied negligence and blamed the accident on Johnson’s jacket getting tangled in the wheel of her wheelchair, according to the lawsuit. Harley and her sister Angela Swann were dubious.
“We never found out the truth,” Harley said. “They wanted to settle out of court.”
The company denied liability but agreed to a $950,000 settlement in October 2024. It never paid the final $112,500 installment, according to a letter Johnson’s five children sent to the bankruptcy judge.
“If you settle out of court, you know doggone well you did something wrong,” Harley said.
Maddening judges
By summer 2025, judges in some civil cases had run out of patience.
Alma Brown, a retired day care manager and accordion teacher living in a Genesis nursing home in Clovis, New Mexico, suffered falls, infections, bedsores, and other neglect that hastened her death in 2023, according to her estate’s lawsuit. In Santa Fe District Court, Judge Kathleen McGarry Ellenwood castigated Genesis after it failed to pay $2 million of the $3 million settlement to Brown’s estate or explain the delay.
Genesis “obviously benefited by not having to go to trial,” McGarry Ellenwood said in one hearing, according to a court transcript. “They assure me that they’re not trying to renege on their contract, but it certainly seems like they haven’t lived up to what the bargain was.”
Genesis declared bankruptcy the day McGarry Ellenwood announced she would impose more than $100,000 in fines, plus $10,000 more each day until the settlement was paid.
In Pennsylvania, Greg Hunt petitioned a judge to punish Genesis after it stopped payments of the $3.5 million settlement after the death of his mother, Nancy, the resident with the gangrenous foot. She had spent eight months in 2019 at Brandywine Hall, a Genesis facility in West Chester that was later sold and renamed.
In a filing with the Common Pleas Court of Montgomery County, Genesis admitted it was in arrears but asked the judge for more time, citing “unforeseen and exigent financial challenges.” Genesis said care for patients at its nursing homes would suffer if it had to pay immediately.
Unswayed, Judge Richard Haaz in June ordered Genesis to pay up, along with punitive interest. But the bankruptcy court stayed that order. Genesis still owes $1.4 million of the $2 million it was supposed to pay, according to Hunt’s claim. (The rest of the $3.5 million settlement is supposed to be paid by an insurer in January 2026.) Ian Norris, Hunt’s lawyer, declined to comment, citing confidentiality provisions in the settlement.
Court records indicate Genesis lawyers never disclosed in either case that it was preparing to declare bankruptcy.
‘Bankruptcy as a tool’
In the first nine months of 2025, 10 other senior living companies with liabilities over $10 million entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy, according to Gibbins Advisors, a consulting firm.
Hamid Rafatjoo, a bankruptcy lawyer representing nursing homes who is not involved in the Genesis bankruptcy case, said filings may increase as the industry has become costlier to run and class action lawsuits have become a fixture.
“Nursing homes get sued all the time for everything,” Rafatjoo said. “A lot of operators wait too long to use bankruptcy as a tool.”
On Dec. 1, Genesis announced the results of its auction, saying it had elected to sell its assets to a private equity firm controlled by Landau. In a court filing, Anthony, the attorney for the personal injury claimants, alleged the auction was stacked in Landau’s favor despite an “objectively better and higher competing bid” from another private equity investor that would have provided more money to creditors. Genesis said in its statement that Landau’s group had increased its bid during the auction.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and two other senators last month asked the U.S. Trustee’s Office to intervene in the case, out of concern that “individuals who already own or control Genesis are trying to sell it to themselves, wiping away legal and other creditor debts in the process.” Lawyers representing those in charge of the auction did not respond to a request for comment.
Families of former Genesis residents said they fear the capacity to purge lawsuits through bankruptcy emboldens nursing home owners who provide deficient care.
“They can file bankruptcy again,” said Gabe Betancourt, whose wife, Nellie, died after her stay at Uptown Rehabilitation Center in Albuquerque. “And we’re the ones that will pay for it, with our memories, our lives.”
“It’s almost two years now,” Gabe Betancourt says of the death of his wife, Nellie. “When you sleep with somebody for 67 years and you stretch your arm, she’s there. There’s no way I will ever forget her.” (Adria Malcolm for KFF Health News)

Six days later, the Tennessee Comptroller said she improperly sought expungements for someone who was not eligible. (Photo: Courtesy of the Office of the Tennessee Comptroller of the Treasury)A Tennessee Comptroller’s Office investigation found that the Weakley County Circuit Court clerk improperly signed petitions to expunge criminal records for someone who was not eligible for expungement under Tennessee law.
The office released its report on Dec. 8, six days after Weakley County Circuit Court Clerk Courtney McMinn submitted her letter of resignation. 
McMinn’s resignation is effective Dec. 31, according to her letter, and she wrote she would “support a smooth transition.”
The Circuit Court clerk maintains court records and carries out administrative duties, including expungement — a process in which legal records of certain criminal cases can be “erased in the eyes of the law,” as defined by Tennessee’s Administrative Office of the Courts. 
State law requires individuals seeking expungement to file a petition to expunge records, which the clerk must serve to the District Attorney. The District Attorney may then submit recommendations and evidence to the court. An expungement order becomes official when it is signed by the District Attorney or Assistant District Attorney and the judge, and submitted to the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation to remove the charge or charges from the public record.
Someone is eligible for expungement if they are convicted of two eligible offenses or less, and anyone with more than one conviction must be determined eligible for expungement by the court.
McMinn prepared four petitions for a person convicted of forgery crimes in Weakley, Obion, Henry and Carroll Counties and sent the petitions to the corresponding court clerks between June and July 2023, according to the comptroller’s report. She also admitted to investigators that she signed the individual’s name on all four petitions.
Officials in the District Attorney’s office for the 27th Judicial District in Tennessee, which serves Obion and Weakley counties, told investigators that McMinn was told that the person was not eligible for expungement because they were convicted in multiple counties, the report states.
When another court clerk asked if the individual was eligible given his charges in multiple counties, McMinn emailed a TBI supervisor to clarify. The supervisor wrote that the court would have to determine eligibility. McMinn then told the clerk that the supervisor said “all of the 4 counties are considered a single criminal episode as the dates are all within the same time frame,” and if judges agree, “he should be eligible for the expungement,” according to the comptroller’s report.
“Because (McMinn) provided misleading information, the court clerk prepared the order and sent it to the DA’s office, where it was ultimately signed by an (assistant district attorney) and the judge,” the report states.
Expungements were signed and completed by the TBI in Weakley and Carroll counties. The judges in those counties were “not aware that the individual had convictions in multiple counties,” investigators wrote. The District Attorney’s office reported that it never received the expungement petition for the Weakley County charges, and only became aware of the expungement in August 2023 when a clerk from another county told the office about a signed petition and order she received, according to the report.
The expungement was signed by an ADA and judge in Obion County, but it was not sent to the TBI. The expungement process in Henry County was halted once the improper expungements were discovered, the report states.
The improper expungements were reversed in September and October 2023.
McMinn has served as the Weakley County Circuit Court clerk since the Weakley County Commission appointed her to serve the remaining term of the former clerk in June 2021. She was elected to serve in the position for a full term in August 2022.
McMinn’s resignation letter does not mention the investigation. 
“This role has been an honor, but it also demands a significant time commitment, and I’ve recognized the need to prioritize my family during this season of life,” she wrote.
McMinn did not respond to a request for comment.

This is a bad thing for all North Carolinians, and here’s why.
The University is supposed to be a place where there is a free exchange of ideas, learning, and conversations that develop critical thinking. This is essential for growing a healthy workforce in North Carolina. Publicly posting course syllabi will stifle this free exchange of ideas and lead to safety concerns for campus communities.
Publicly posting required course content and course objectives can lead to the weaponization of this information. This will produce a chilling effect where faculty feel pressure to self-censor the content of their courses to avoid being pulled into the political spotlight. As a result, students will be exposed to a smaller range of viewpoints, which is antithetical to the UNC system’s own “Equality Policy.” Students need to be exposed to a range of ideas so that they can develop their own thoughts and opinions.
The content of the ideas students are exposed to should not be subject to political zeitgeist or public opinion. It should be determined by the faculty who have expertise in the issues and have developed their craft of teaching over decades.
Second, publicly posting course syllabi threatens the safety of our campus communities. We are in an era of political extremism, where disagreement about ideas can lead to online doxxing, terminations of employment, and  physical intimidation and violence. Politically motivated shootings, disrupted lectures, and doxxing of faculty are already happening around the country. Publicly posting course syllabi only increases access to sensitive information by bad actors. This is a real security concern that can be avoided.
Our students deserve to learn in safe environments where viewpoint diversity is celebrated. Our faculty deserve to teach in environments where their safety is paramount and their expertise is lauded. Publicly posting syllabi supports neither of these goals. Instead, it deepens division, stifles creativity and innovation, and stokes fear that can lead to tangible harm for our campus communities.

(Photo by Dan Forer/Getty Images)When the Hope Scholarship, West Virginia’s school voucher program, was enacted, proponents framed the program as one of choice — a way to provide alternative education options to families who could not otherwise afford it. Now, on the eve of the program’s expansion — set to double or even triple in annual cost amid unprecedented public school closures across the state — lawmakers will have the opportunity to decide the best way to allocate budget dollars to ensure West Virginia students receive an accountable, high-quality education.
In 2021, our state lawmakers placed a ticking time bomb in the Hope Scholarship bill that simultaneously made the program less about expanding choice and far more expensive, and now we’ve reached the point where it’s going to explode. That bomb was a trigger provision to make the program “universal” next school year. This was not to give more children “choice” at all but to subsidize the private school tuition of families who are already in — and can already afford — private school. Proponents can no longer argue this is simply money following the student from public schools to private schools — it’s nine figures in new taxpayer funds lawmakers have to squeeze into an already shrinking budget for families who were never in the public school system to begin with.
And as program officials recently admitted, this is nothing new for the Hope Scholarship. Ninety percent of the vouchers have gone to students who “would have done alternative education without Hope.” This is a damning admission that the program has not achieved its supposed purpose of providing choice to families who could not afford it.
Notably, since the program was enacted, many of West Virginia’s public school families have seen their choice eroded or taken away altogether. Since 2019, more than 70 public schools have closed in West Virginia, from Hampshire and Mineral to Kanawha counties. In each of the communities impacted by school closures, parents and community members have opposed the closures, arguing their choice is for their children to receive an education in their neighborhood schools that are close to home, trusted and beloved. 
Other families have faced the loss of music and arts classes, advanced placement courses and certified teachers as school districts deal with balancing their budgets amid an outdated funding formula that falls short of today’s needs. Again, the vast majority of families are telling us they choose well-funded public schools that offer their children the resources they need to succeed.
Earlier this month, the State Treasurer’s Office published its annual report for the 2024-25 school year, showing even more clearly how the program lacks equitable access and accountability.

One in three Hope Scholarship recipients reside in just four counties: Berkeley, Kanawha, Monongalia and Wood
Over $2.5 million in West Virginia taxpayer funds flowed to entities outside of West Virginia
Nearly $14 million dollars (or 44%) went to unaccredited schools which, according to the West Virginia Department of Education, do not have to have credentialed educators or meet established graduation requirements or student achievement benchmarks
Just 6.5% of program recipients submitted nationally normed academic achievement test results, leaving policymakers unable to assess whether the vouchers are having a positive impact on educational attainment for the vast majority of recipients

Non-public schools that accept the Hope Scholarship are unaccountable to taxpayers, and recent admissions and reporting show the program is overwhelmingly benefiting households that already had choice in places that have private school options — at the cost of students in our public schools in all 55 counties.
While West Virginia has no tracking of educational outcomes for voucher recipients, the evidence in other states is clear: vouchers do not improve student achievement, they primarily benefit wealthy households at the expense of low-income and rural communities, and they lead to fewer funds for public schools. 
In West Virginia, private schools that receive Hope taxpayer dollars are not required to meet the most basic of accountability or transparency standards: they are not required to provide assessment results, utilize certified educators, meet specific curriculum standards, undergo audits, accept all students, or have open meetings accessible to the public.
Public schools, which serve more than 85% of school-aged children in West Virginia, meet all of those standards and serve all students regardless of socioeconomic status, disability, religion, or need.
In the upcoming legislative session, state lawmakers will have the opportunity to put resources toward proven, transparent and accessible K-12 education policies that support all children. The vast majority of children receive their education in our public schools and they and their families are counting on lawmakers to make the right choice.

(Getty Images)Kentucky relaxed licensing standards for almost two dozen new optometrists over a recent three-year period, triggering alarm from a national board charged with testing to ensure optometrists have met qualifications to begin treating patients.
Among those who appear to have been licensed without completing a required exam is the daughter of the current president of the Kentucky Board of Optometric Examiners, according to a list compiled by the National Board of Examiners in Optometry or NBEO.
A May 23 letter from the national board to the state board said its records show  21 optometry  graduates in Kentucky obtained licenses from 2020 through 2023 without having passed “one or more” parts of a state-required three-part exam the national board administers. 
The letter, marked “confidential,” said that passage of exams is important to “uphold the integrity of Kentucky optometric licenses and protect the public from practitioners who have not demonstrated competency.”
“NBEO is trying to understand how this could have happened,” said the letter which the Lantern obtained through the Kentucky Open Records Act. 
The Kentucky optometry board has yet to respond to the May 23 letter from the national examining board. It also has not responded to questions from the Lantern.
Meanwhile, the board, which meets Friday, has said it is working on a response to a recent state attorney general’s opinion that found it had circumvented state law in order to waive some testing requirements. The opinion issued Oct. 1 cited two such instances.
But the granting of testing waivers was far broader and more frequent than the two instances identified by the attorney general, a review of records by the Lantern reveals. In addition to a part of the test that would have required travel during the COVID-19 pandemic, the waivers also appear to include another more rigorous portion of the exam that the Kentucky board has acknowledged some graduates have had trouble passing.
Sen. Stephen Meredith, R-Leitchfield, who sought the Oct. 1 attorney general’s opinion, said he has questions the board has yet to address, including whether some optometrists could be providing eye care in Kentucky without valid licenses — a question also raised by the attorney general.

Meredith, chair of the Senate Health Services Committee, said he will seek answers when the General Assembly meets in January.
“I think that when we come back into session, I’m going to invite them to come in and testify,” Meredith said. “It’s very disturbing that any agency can just ignore state law. I think we need to have some continuing dialogue.”
Trust but verify
The stakes are higher in Kentucky because, unlike most states, Kentucky allows optometrists to perform expanded eye care including some eye surgeries thanks to a 2011 change in state law that expanded the range of services optometrists may provide. Optometrists hold a four-year doctorate of optometry but are not medical doctors, like ophthalmologists.
Kentucky optometrists have “one of the broadest scopes of practice for optometrists in the United States,” according to the national board.
The attorney general’s opinion says the optometry board maintains that “in the board’s opinion,” all Kentucky optometrists have met licensure requirements.
Meredith, the legislative committee chair, said he’d like more details.
“I’m like Ronald Reagan,” he said. “I trust but need to verify.”
Among the 21 Kentucky optometrists who the national board said had not passed one or more parts of the test, according to a list the NBEO provided: Dr. Hannah Ellis, daughter of Dr. Joe Ellis, the current state board president and a prominent optometrist in Benton. Joe Ellis was not president of the board when his daughter received her license. Hannah Ellis works at Clarkson Eye Care in Benton, the same optometry practice as her father, according to its website.
Neither Joe Ellis nor Hannah Ellis, a 2020 graduate of the University of Pikeville’s College of Optometry, responded to requests for comment from the Lantern.
Several of the other 21 candidates listed by the national board also are graduates of the Pikeville University College of Optometry, which opened in 2016 as Kentucky’s only optometry school.
Joe Ellis, a supporter of the new college and member of the Pikeville University Board of Trustees, served on the advisory committee to establish it. He also served as the keynote speaker at the optometry college’s 2018 ceremony where members of the first class scheduled to graduate in 2020 were awarded their white coats to mark their roles as future optometrists, according to a university press release.
At a special meeting Oct. 10, the board agreed to consider how to best address issues raised by the attorney general.
Meanwhile, the board’s only public comment has been a brief statement on its website that says in part that “protecting the public will always be the highest priority.” It adds that during the COVID-19 emergency the board “resolved” to reduce out-of-state travel for Part 3 of the test by accepting evaluations from optometry schools of how students performed in a clinical setting. 











“There’s got to be some dialogue here. There’s got to be some accountability.”


– Sen. Stephen Meredith, Kentucky Senate Health Services Committee chair 



“Although the board acted in accord with the guidance it received at the time, the recent attorney general’s opinion indicated the board should have acted through the formal regulatory process,” it said. The board “intends to take timely and appropriate action.”
It makes no mention of the board’s apparent decision in December 2023 — after the COVID-19 state of emergency had ended — to waive Part 1 of the exam for some candidates. Part 1, which focuses on science and medicine, is considered the most rigorous and was required in all 50 states until this year when the Kentucky board enacted a controversial change to allow candidates to substitute an easier, Canadian version of the exam.
Joe Ellis told a reporter at the October meeting he would have no further comment until the board decides on a response.
Meredith said further explanation is warranted.
“There’s got to be some dialogue here,” Meredith said. “There’s got to be some accountability.”
What board minutes show
An examination of the board’s minutes shows that the board acted on testing waivers on at least six dates between 2020 and 2023.
The attorney general’s opinion cited only two instances when the board, citing the COVID-19 pandemic, agreed to waive one part of the three-part exam, the test for patient skills, which requires travel to an out-of-state testing center to determine how applicants perform in a clinical setting examining patients.
But board minutes show other actions. Minutes from Dec. 13, 2023, state without elaboration that some optometry school graduates unable to pass Part 1 of the national exam — which tests students on science and medicine and is considered the most rigorous — “will be allowed licensure with additional education requirements.”
The Kentucky Board of Optometric Examiners has yet to respond to a May 23 letter from the national board responsible for assuring new optometrists have passed exams showing they are qualified to begin practice. This is the Kentucky board’s logo. (ky.gov)
The attorney general’s opinion deemed such actions “invalid” if authorized through a board vote or resolution rather than going through the public process of enacting a change in state regulations.
At that same Dec. 13, 2023 meeting, Joe Ellis was elected board president.
Meredith said he was not aware the board had decided to waive other parts of the exam. If that’s the case, he said, it’s very concerning.
“They don’t have the authority to do that,” he said.
The board has since enacted regulations allowing candidates to take a Canadian optometry exam, considered easier, in lieu of the national Part 1 exam. It did not respond to a question from the Lantern about whether any Kentucky candidates have taken that exam, which became an option around August after the board enacted a change in state regulations.
 Testing ‘insurmountable?’

The state attorney general found the board has the authority to change testing requirements as long as it follows the process spelled out in state law to create a new regulation — a change enacted in 2011 amid a lobbying blitz by Kentucky’s politically influential optometrists.
“The board shall have the sole authority to determine what constitutes the practice of optometry and sole jurisdiction to exercise any other powers and duties,” says the change in the law. 
KY optometrists, among few allowed to perform surgery, now want an easier, Canadian licensing exam

“No state has ever accepted a foreign licensure exam as a valid substitute for initial licensure,” Dr. Rich Castillo, dean of the optometry school at the University of North Carolina Pembroke, testified at a legislative hearing in April. “They are not interchangeable.”
But Kentucky’s board said in written comments to the legislature that the change in state regulations was needed because a “number of optometry students” could not pass the national exam.
Ellis testified at the April hearing before the legislative Administrative Regulation Review subcommittee that the tougher, national test might discourage young people from entering the profession in Kentucky and lead to a shortage of providers.
“If they see that testing seems insurmountable, they may not choose this profession down the road,” he said.
Meredith, the state senator, said that the attorney general’s opinion makes clear that the state board has the authority to change regulations to permit the Canadian exam — but not to waive requirements for licensure without enacting regulations.
“I think the more pressing issue here is granting licenses to people who have not passed the exam,” he said. “We need to protect the public.”
‘A matter of procedure’
At the October meeting, Ellis appointed a committee to review the findings of the attorney general and report back to the board.
He didn’t set a deadline for the committee report but said: “This board will take timely and appropriate action as required.”
“It was a matter of procedure,” Ellis said, describing how the board decided to waive one part of the national licensing exam for students during the COVID-19 pandemic by agreeing to do so at a meeting rather than enacting a change in state regulations, a more time-consuming step.
Ellis also is a former president of the Kentucky and the American optometric associations and a regular donor to Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, a Democrat. The Lantern reported that while Ellis has made contributions to Republicans, he’s among one of Beshear’s bigger financial backers, giving $4,100 to his reelection campaign, $28,000 to the Kentucky Democratic Party during Beshear’s reelection campaign and $5,000 to Beshear’s super PAC, In This Together.
Beshear appointed Ellis to the optometric board in September 2021.
 Ellis, at the October meeting, said he was not on the board in 2020 when it first decided to grant waivers to some applicants. It did so, he said based on the advice of the board’s former executive director who also served as legal counsel.
At the time, Ellis said, “there was a lot of confusion” about how to proceed during the COVID-19 state of emergency declared by Beshear that imposed limits on public gatherings and eased restrictions on some boards and agencies.
Ellis said it was his understanding that the board, when it first voted to waive Part 3 of the national exam, decided instead to accept faculty evaluations of student performance.
“If anybody was deficient, they would discuss it,” Ellis said. “That was their rationale at the time.”
As for the attorney general’s opinion, he added:
“It’s an opinion but I think we definitely need to consider that opinion to protect the public.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2210182104-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-11 05:56:28.319567

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Mitchell Check Jr. had just gotten off the phone after ordering a new shipment of white carnations for his family’s Taunton Avenue flower shop in East Providence Wednesday morning when he was asked how business has been going. 
“Things haven’t been horrible, but they haven’t been better,” said Check, who admits to pushing 70 but is not yet ready to retire from running his shop a block away from the Washington Bridge off-ramp.
It’s the same resigned outlook shared by many who live and work in the city at the epicenter of a commuter crisis that began two years ago Thursday. On Dec. 11, 2023, state officials suddenly closed the westbound lanes of Interstate 195 on the Washington Bridge after contracted engineers discovered broken anchor rods that put the highway connecting Providence and East Providence at risk of collapse.
At the time, the westbound bridge over the Seekonk River carried over 90,000 vehicles a day. That estimate has fallen to around 70,000 vehicles using the converted lanes on the eastbound bridge as of November 2025, according to the Rhode Island Department of Transportation’s (RIDOT) monthly traffic volume report.
The westbound bridge has been completely demolished, although Gov. Dan McKee’s announcement last week that the demolition finished 10 days ahead of schedule underwhelmed the public. 
“OK, that doesn’t get us over the water,” Rep. Matthew Dawson, an East Providence Democrat, said of McKee’s Dec. 5 announcement that contractor Aetna Bridge Co. had officially razed the substructure ahead of the Dec. 15 deadline set by a second reconstruction timeline. (The first timeline to reconstruct the westbound bridge fizzled after no bids were submitted to the state’s original request for proposals.)
“Society has figured out it’s the way they’re going to live their lives,” Dawson said. “And you have to be that way because there’s no end in sight.”
On the contrary, green signs on either side of the existing eastbound bridge say the project to replace the westbound bridge is “on time” and “on budget” with an estimated completion date of November 2028. That timeline was established under the timeline set in the $427 million contract awarded to Chicago-based Walsh Construction in June.

The official narrative is that Walsh is now in the process of mobilizing equipment and crews, securing permits, coordinating utility work, and advancing the new bridge’s design. The start of actual construction is dependent on finalizing design, steel fabrication, and the approval of the pending environmental permits, RIDOT spokesperson Charles St. Martin confirmed in an email.
“We’re anticipating that work being active next summer,” St. Martin said of the start of the construction phase of the bridge’s substructure.
McKee was famously absent from the very first press conference, leaving RIDOT Director Peter Alviti Jr. alone to deliver the bad news about announcing the highway’s abrupt closure right in the middle of the afternoon commute. Since then, McKee’s job approval rating has been stuck in low gear over his administration’s handling of the bridge.
The governor has no public events scheduled for the two-year anniversary of the closure. But he did issue a statement to Rhode Island Current stating he appreciates the public’s patience as a new bridge is constructed — a message that has been echoed by electronic signs along Interstate 195.
“The state has secured one of the top-rated design-build companies in the country to build a new bridge — one that will use proven construction methods, meet all modern safety standards, and improve traffic flow,” McKee said. “We have a completion timeline of November 2028, which is actually two years sooner than the new Maryland bridge to which ours had been compared in the past. Demolition has been completed safely and on time, and preparatory work is already happening on the bridge rebuild.”
“This is all good news, but that does not minimize the frustration the public has experienced during this time,” he continued. “The most frustrating part of this process for me, as governor, had been earlier efforts to repair a bridge that we later learned was unrepairable. As I have said before, my administration is holding the responsible parties accountable.”
The state is in the midst of suing the 13 firms that had previously worked on the bridge over the last two decades. That case is scheduled to go to trial in late 2027.










Society has figured out it’s the way they’re going to live their lives. And you have to be that way because there’s no end in sight.


– Rep. Matthew Dawson, an East Providence Democrat


East Providence Mayor Bob DaSilva says he feels more optimistic about the state of his city now compared to the first week after the bridge closed — when gridlock overwhelmed local streets in East Providence and up to the Massachusetts line on Interstate 195.
“It was something out of a weird movie that I never want to see again,” DaSilva said. “It was a nightmare.”
Four days after the bridge’s closure, RIDOT opened up a two-lane bypass on the existing eastbound bridge to get traffic flowing over the Seekonk River once again. In April 2024, three lanes of travel over both directions of the eastbound bridge.
DaSilva said he believes commuters have since adjusted and that fewer backups are happening on the highway.
“It’s not perfect,” DaSilva said. “But all and all, I travel over that bridge every day and I’m getting through with minimal slowdowns — it seems to have a better pace than it was before.”
That’s not Check’s experience.
“I have to have my drivers back by 2 o’clock or they’re stuck in traffic for an hour,” he said. “And if they’re coming in from Warwick, Coventry, East Greenwich — they’re stuck until God knows when.”

DaSilva said he expects “much smoother traffic” once the new westbound bridge is complete. 
The state’s plan for the new bridge calls for five widened lanes of travel over the new bridge, along with an on-ramp from Gano Street in Providence and a new offramp to Waterfront Drive in East Providence. The original bridge had four lanes.
“The end result will be a much better flow of traffic and, God willing, a better piece of mind for travelers heading through the area,” DaSilva said.
Skepticism still remains from those on the front lines of the closure. 
Susan Pascale-Frechette, owner of Pods Swimming, a youth swimming school on Commercial Way, said timelines often do go as expected and will believe the commuter crisis will end once that new bridge is finally up.
“Time will tell,” she said.
Reed Lappin of East Providence’s Riverside neighborhood had fewer complaints about bridge traffic when approached at Cafe Zara down Taunton Avenue. Originally from Boston, Lappin said he’s used to seeing worse.
“You just bear with it,” he said.

Nancy Hunt arrived at an emergency room from a Genesis HealthCare nursing home in Pennsylvania in such dreadful shape, including maggots infesting her gangrened foot, that the hospital called an elder abuse hotline and then the police, her son alleged in a lawsuit.
Hunt died five days later. Her death certificate said the foot injury was a “significant” factor. Genesis denied wrongdoing but agreed to pay $3.5 million in a settlement Hunt’s son signed in August 2024.
Yet Genesis hasn’t paid most of that debt, court records show. It may never have to.
Once the nation’s largest nursing home chain, Genesis says it was spending $8 million a month defending and settling lawsuits over resident injuries and deaths in recent years. But the company is now poised to wipe the liability slate clean by seeking refuge in the most protective corner of the legal system for the nursing home industry: bankruptcy court.
The Genesis case, one of 11 large senior care bankruptcies this year, illustrates how health care companies can dodge public and financial accountability for alleged negligence through delays, confidentiality clauses, and bankruptcy maneuvers, a KFF Health News investigation found.
When it filed for bankruptcy in Dallas in July, Genesis estimated its total liability for nearly a thousand settled and pending lawsuits at $259 million. A KFF Health News review of the terms of 155 settlement agreements and corporate financial statements shows Genesis officials knew insolvency was possible yet included provisions in its settlement agreements allowing it to defer payment, often for a year or more.
As a result, Genesis paid nothing in 85 cases and only a portion in the other 70, according to civil court records and bankruptcy claims made available through people with access to them. It still owes $41 million of the $58 million it had agreed to pay in those cases, the records show.

“It just feels like they killed my mom and got away with it,” said Vanessa Betancourt, whose mother, Nellie Betancourt, a retired nurse, fractured her hip at a Genesis home in Albuquerque, New Mexico — an injury the medical examiner’s report said led to her death. Genesis agreed to a $650,000 settlement with Betancourt’s family in April under the condition it would not need to pay the first of seven installments for another year, according to the settlement document.
Genesis denied wrongdoing in all lawsuits and settlements. In a written statement, the company did not answer questions about individual personal injury cases. The statement said Genesis remained “focused on delivering high-quality, compassionate care to our patients and residents without disruption” during bankruptcy.
One lawsuit Genesis settled for nearly $1 million alleged nursing home managers ignored repeated warnings about a male resident’s behavior before he sexually assaulted a female Alzheimer’s patient, according to court records. In a case the company resolved for $500,000, a Genesis nursing home was accused of delaying the hospitalization of a resident who had vomited brown mucus. He died of a bowel obstruction. Genesis has paid nothing for either settlement, according to bankruptcy claims.
Creditors, including families of the deceased, are expected to salvage a fraction of what they were promised, if anything. On Dec. 10, the company’s owners were scheduled to seek approval by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas to sell its nursing homes and other assets to its largest investor, a private equity firm. In court papers, lawyers for residents and other creditors say the complex plan will prevent them from pursuing Genesis’ new ownership and other companies they blame for the company’s collapse.
John Anthony, a bankruptcy attorney representing 340 personal injury claims against Genesis, said, “They never had any intention to honor these deals.”
Low ratings and fines
During years of financial turmoil, Genesis has frequently struggled to provide top-notch care, federal records show. Using its five-star system, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services rated 58% of homes affiliated with Genesis as below average or much below average. CMS has fined Genesis homes $10 million for violating federal health standards over the past three years.
In 2022, Connecticut health regulators shuttered a Genesis home after two deaths and multiple violations. The company closed another Connecticut nursing home this year after residents twice were evacuated over safety concerns.
In its Chapter 11 filing, Genesis said it cared for about 15,000 residents in 165 nursing homes and 10 assisted living facilities in 18 states. They are centered in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, New Mexico, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Maine, Alabama, Maryland, and North Carolina, according to the bankruptcy filing.
The company said it owed $709 million in secured debt to lenders and the IRS. Under bankruptcy rules, those debts, backed by Genesis collateral, take precedence over the $1.6 billion in unsecured debt Genesis said it owes. Unsecured creditors include a pension fund; contractors that provided health services and equipment; Pennsylvania, New Mexico, and West Virginia for unpaid provider taxes; and former residents and their families who sued.
Dangers in memory care
Sandia Ridge Center, a Genesis home in Albuquerque, was repeatedly faulted by health regulators for not preventing sexual misbehavior in its memory care unit. In November 2021, CMS cited the home for lacking enough nurses to prevent sexual abuse among residents. An inspection report the following August identified more inappropriate sexual contact. Police were called to investigate sexual assault allegations in February and March of 2023, police reports show; neither resulted in criminal charges.
Then in April 2023, a 61-year-old male resident with alcohol-related dementia sexually assaulted a female resident with Alzheimer’s in the dining room, according to a police report and an inspection report. When the resident screamed for him to stop and that he was hurting her, he responded “shut up bitch I know you like this,” according to a lawsuit brought on behalf of the woman, identified in court papers as R.S.
Sandia Ridge management had been aware of the male resident’s behavioral issues for months, according to employee depositions in the case. Police had investigated a prior sexual assault allegation against him the previous year without bringing charges. In one deposition, a former activities assistant testified he hit her and twice pushed her into a bathroom while announcing, “I want to have sex with you.” When she reported him to a senior Genesis manager, she said in the deposition, the manager put his finger over his lips and said, “Shhh.”
The activities worker testified that R.S. used to happily sing along with Elvis Presley songs. After the assault, the worker said, R.S. “don’t sing anymore.”
Inspectors cited the home for failing to protect R.S. The same report said the home didn’t provide a therapist for another female resident who was being sexually harassed. Medicare fined Sandia Ridge Center $91,247. Genesis denied liability but settled R.S.’ lawsuit for $925,000 in May, according to the bankruptcy claim.
“We just felt we have to hold them accountable,” R.S.’ daughter said in an interview, speaking on the condition that she and her mother not be identified, because of the nature of the assault. “Maybe I’m wrong, maybe I’m naive, but the only way to do that is to sue someone, right?”
Genesis has not paid any of the settlement, according to the family’s claim filing.

Growth and debt
Genesis’ downfall can be traced to 2007, when affiliates of two private equity firms acquired the company in a $1.5 billion leveraged buyout, taking on substantial debt, according to its bankruptcy filing. Private equity also has been involved in other health care bankruptcies, including those of the HCR ManorCare nursing home chain, the prison health care contractor Corizon Health, and two for-profit hospital systems, Steward Health Care and Prospect Medical Holdings.
In 2011, Genesis raised $2.4 billion by transferring substantially all its nursing home buildings and other real estate to Welltower, a publicly traded real estate investment trust, according to Genesis’ bankruptcy filing. Genesis then rented the buildings back from Welltower, which made leasing costs a significant expense.
Genesis went on a nationwide buying spree. At its peak in 2016, it had grown to more than 500 nursing homes. In a court declaration, Louis Robichaux IV, a consultant overseeing Genesis’ bankruptcy restructuring, wrote that as the company expanded, it became harder to manage and “mired in corporate inefficiencies.” Robichaux wrote that Genesis’ financial woes were exacerbated by rapidly increasing labor costs and lawsuits, including some predating the covid pandemic.
Starting in 2021, Genesis avoided bankruptcy after receiving $100 million in loans from a private equity firm founded by Joel Landau, the owner of a Brooklyn-based nursing home chain, according to Robichaux’s filing.
But Genesis continued to teeter on the edge of insolvency. In audited financial statements for 2022 and 2023 submitted to a California oversight agency, management and auditors said rent and debt obligations raised “substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern.”
In a court filing, a committee appointed by the U.S. Trustee’s Office to represent the unsecured creditors in the bankruptcy accused Landau and Welltower of orchestrating a covert plan that allowed Welltower to keep getting its rents while Landau could run the company and “siphon value to himself.” The committee alleged their efforts forced the company into insolvency while “staffing levels and patient care declined precipitously.” Landau and Welltower did not respond to requests for comment.
Drawn-out lawsuits
Erin Pearson sued Genesis over the death of her father, James Sanderson, a retired mining company executive who died in 2018 after spending less than a month at Bear Canyon Rehabilitation Center in Albuquerque. In the memory care unit, Sanderson fell repeatedly, suffered medication errors made by nursing home staff, and developed a bowel obstruction and sepsis, according to the lawsuit, filed in 2019. Pearson’s lawyers said he was not hospitalized until eight days after nurses noticed he was vomiting brown mucus.
After the judge rejected Genesis’ request to force Pearson into arbitration, Genesis appealed. It took 2½ years before an appeals court affirmed the original decision to let the case go forward in court, records show.
This past May, more than five years after suing, Pearson reached a $500,000 settlement, with the first payment required by November, according to a copy of the agreement. Nothing was paid, according to the bankruptcy claim.
“It was so drawn out and for so long,” Pearson said in an interview, calling Genesis’ bankruptcy “despicable.”

Payouts postponed
Jennifer Foote, an Albuquerque attorney who represents clients in multiple lawsuits against Genesis, including Pearson’s, said the company frequently filed appeals. “They did not usually win them on these issues,” she said, “and our sense was that they were doing it as a delay tactic.”
Genesis started using installment payments around 2018, said Dusti Harvey, Foote’s law partner. “The payments wouldn’t start for several months out,” Harvey said. Foote said Genesis’ lawyers often wanted to time the payments to start the month the trial in the case was scheduled to occur.
Families had to wait even when comparatively small amounts of money were involved, settlement agreements show. Genesis’ settlement agreements also included a confidentiality clause prohibiting discussion of the incidents.
Genesis agreed to pay $42,000 in a November 2024 settlement, but the first payment was not due until nine months later. It was not paid, according to the bankruptcy claim.
A $250,000 settlement signed in October 2023 did not start paying out until the following September. When Genesis declared bankruptcy — 21 months after the case was resolved — it still owed $100,000, according to the family’s claim.
Genesis HealthCare settlements included periodic payment plans, like this one from a $600,000 settlement in February 2025, included in a court record, that allowed the company to delay paying for a year or more. (KFF Health News screengrab)
‘We never found out the truth’
Settling cases allowed Genesis to avoid the expense and publicity of a trial, at which details of how its nursing homes functioned might have been revealed. In October 2020, Margarett Johnson, a retired school bus driver, fell out of her wheelchair at a Genesis nursing home in Waldorf, Maryland, fracturing her jawbone, nose, and neck, according to a lawsuit brought by her family. Johnson was sent to a trauma center and placed on a ventilator. She died three months later, at age 76, from ventilator-associated pneumonia, the lawsuit said.
“It looked like she was hit by a truck,” Angelina Harley, one of her daughters, said in an interview. “I knew my mom was not going to come home. I knew the Lord was not going to punish her more.”
The company denied negligence and blamed the accident on Johnson’s jacket getting tangled in the wheel of her wheelchair, according to the lawsuit. Harley and her sister Angela Swann were dubious.
“We never found out the truth,” Harley said. “They wanted to settle out of court.”
The company denied liability but agreed to a $950,000 settlement in October 2024. It never paid the final $112,500 installment, according to a letter Johnson’s five children sent to the bankruptcy judge.
“If you settle out of court, you know doggone well you did something wrong,” Harley said.
Maddening judges
By summer 2025, judges in some civil cases had run out of patience.
Alma Brown, a retired day care manager and accordion teacher living in a Genesis nursing home in Clovis, New Mexico, suffered falls, infections, bedsores, and other neglect that hastened her death in 2023, according to her estate’s lawsuit. In Santa Fe District Court, Judge Kathleen McGarry Ellenwood castigated Genesis after it failed to pay $2 million of the $3 million settlement to Brown’s estate or explain the delay.
Genesis “obviously benefited by not having to go to trial,” McGarry Ellenwood said in one hearing, according to a court transcript. “They assure me that they’re not trying to renege on their contract, but it certainly seems like they haven’t lived up to what the bargain was.”
Genesis declared bankruptcy the day McGarry Ellenwood announced she would impose more than $100,000 in fines, plus $10,000 more each day until the settlement was paid.
In Pennsylvania, Greg Hunt petitioned a judge to punish Genesis after it stopped payments of the $3.5 million settlement after the death of his mother, Nancy, the resident with the gangrenous foot. She had spent eight months in 2019 at Brandywine Hall, a Genesis facility in West Chester that was later sold and renamed.
In a filing with the Common Pleas Court of Montgomery County, Genesis admitted it was in arrears but asked the judge for more time, citing “unforeseen and exigent financial challenges.” Genesis said care for patients at its nursing homes would suffer if it had to pay immediately.
Unswayed, Judge Richard Haaz in June ordered Genesis to pay up, along with punitive interest. But the bankruptcy court stayed that order. Genesis still owes $1.4 million of the $2 million it was supposed to pay, according to Hunt’s claim. (The rest of the $3.5 million settlement is supposed to be paid by an insurer in January 2026.) Ian Norris, Hunt’s lawyer, declined to comment, citing confidentiality provisions in the settlement.
Court records indicate Genesis lawyers never disclosed in either case that it was preparing to declare bankruptcy.

‘Bankruptcy as a tool’
In the first nine months of 2025, 10 other senior living companies with liabilities over $10 million entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy, according to Gibbins Advisors, a consulting firm.
Hamid Rafatjoo, a bankruptcy lawyer representing nursing homes who is not involved in the Genesis bankruptcy case, said filings may increase as the industry has become costlier to run and class action lawsuits have become a fixture.
“Nursing homes get sued all the time for everything,” Rafatjoo said. “A lot of operators wait too long to use bankruptcy as a tool.”
On Dec. 1, Genesis announced the results of its auction, saying it had elected to sell its assets to a private equity firm controlled by Landau. In a court filing, Anthony, the attorney for the personal injury claimants, alleged the auction was stacked in Landau’s favor despite an “objectively better and higher competing bid” from another private equity investor that would have provided more money to creditors. Genesis said in its statement that Landau’s group had increased its bid during the auction.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and two other senators last month asked the U.S. Trustee’s Office to intervene in the case, out of concern that “individuals who already own or control Genesis are trying to sell it to themselves, wiping away legal and other creditor debts in the process.” Lawyers representing those in charge of the auction did not respond to a request for comment.
Families of former Genesis residents said they fear the capacity to purge lawsuits through bankruptcy emboldens nursing home owners who provide deficient care.
“They can file bankruptcy again,” said Gabe Betancourt, whose wife, Nellie, died after her stay at Uptown Rehabilitation Center in Albuquerque. “And we’re the ones that will pay for it, with our memories, our lives.”
‘It’s almost two years now,’ Gabe Betancourt says of the death of his wife, Nellie. ‘When you sleep with somebody for 67 years and you stretch your arm, she’s there. There’s no way I will ever forget her.’ (Photo byAdria Malcolm for KFF Health News)

(Photo by Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)Democrats in the Trump era have learned the hard way that zombie establishment leadership is no match for an authoritarian takeover.
The lessons abound. Senate Minority Chuck Schumer capitulates to President Donald Trump and is incapable of leading an effective opposition. Liberal justices on the U.S. Supreme Court so fear enforcement of the 14th Amendment’s insurrection clause that they give Trump a pass. An infirm octogenarian president is permitted to campaign for reelection until he falls apart on live TV.
Few Democratic figures in Colorado have so vividly exemplified establishment fecklessness as U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper, who’s up for reelection next year. As the Trump administration began populating Cabinet posts and other top administration openings with MAGA loyalists and quacks, Hickenlooper voted to confirm them at an unexpectedly high rate. At times he’s seemed oblivious to the scope of Trump’s lawlessness. He’s inclined to tout the good relationships he has with Republican colleagues even as they help Trump dismantle the very institutions they inhabit or oversee.
The Democratic base in former times often overlooked establishment habits. Not anymore. Now there’s backlash.
It came for party power brokers last month in New York City when Zohran Mamdani won the mayor’s race. It’s coming for moderate congressional candidates from Texas to Maine to California. And this week, when progressive Colorado state Sen. Julie Gonzales launched a campaign to claim his seat, it came for Hickenlooper.

Some observers have likened this phenomenon to the Tea Party movement on the right during the Obama administration when, prodded by an angry base, many far-right candidates stampeded moderate candidates in primaries throughout the country. In Colorado, a little known local prosecutor named Ken Buck, fueled by Tea Party energy, defeated establishment favorite Jane Norton, the former lieutenant governor, in the 2010 Colorado Republican primary for U.S. Senate. 
But the comparison goes only so far. The Tea Party was preoccupied with reducing the size of government. Progressive Democrats want to save the government from obliteration.
Candidates like Gonzales come to the race with policy proposals. She pushes universal health care, affordable child care, renter protections and reproductive rights, for example. But these candidates — call them No Kings Democrats — are riding a wave of rage over administration behavior.
A new Pew study captures this tinderbox moment. Forty-four percent of Democrats “feel anger toward the federal government.” That’s the most anger the study has registered since it began in 1997, even more anger than Republicans felt during the Tea Party days.
The origin of the Tea Party was anger that Obama enacted relief for distressed homeowners in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. No Kings Democrats are angry about a lawless and inhumane immigration enforcement program, military troops deployed to American cities, stupendous corruption, a mad president given king-like powers, weaponization of federal law enforcement, anti-science demolition of public health functions, alienation of foreign allies and coddling of foreign enemies, and a hundred other outrages.
Hickenlooper has come face-to-face with that anger during appearances this year with constituents around the state. But, given his record, it’s hard for him to effectively represent their frustrations. Gonzales, on the other hand, has participated in anti-Trump protests and is fluent in the language of resistance.
In recent decades, primary challengers very rarely win against a sitting U.S. senator, as Newsline reporter Chase Woodruff noted in a report about Gonzales’ campaign launch. Challengers unseated Senate incumbents just eight times since 1980, and the last such victory occurred in 2012.
But Gonzales’ supporters might be encouraged by some other numbers: The Democratic Party has never had a lower favorability rating in at least the last three decades, and just one-fifth of Democrats themselves, viewing officeholders as “spineless” and willing to “roll right over” for Trump, have a positive view of their party.
“What sort of party do we want to be?” Gonzales said in an interview with Woodruff. “Do we want to send back John Hickenlooper, a go-along-to-get-along incrementalist, or do we want to send a proven legislator, with a track record of taking on big fights against a well-funded corporate lobby, who’s gotten s*** done?”

On July 23, 2023, Jaeon Chavis was bitten by a dog at Red Onion State Prison in the midst of a dispute with a guard over using a prison telephone. 
The canine tore into his leg, rendering it the same texture as “ground taco meat” as guards punched and kicked him and later called him a “n— crybaby,” his attorneys alleged in a lawsuit filed in May. Since then, Chavis said he’s suffered from severe pain in his leg, constant anxiety, fear of retaliation from guards and lingering PTSD.
“I’m freaking terrified,” Chavis said in a September interview from Wallens Ridge State Prison, where he’s now housed. “It has destroyed me.”
In 2024, Virginia lawmakers passed bipartisan legislation aimed at curtailing the use of prison dogs after a Business Insider investigation profiled similar stories, and found the state’s use of the dogs made it a national outlier. The publication tallied at least 295 incidents across the country where dogs bit incarcerated people; over 90% of the attacks occurred in Virginia. 
Despite the new law, public records show canines continue to be a violent presence in state prisons. Prison dogs have “engaged” incarcerated people, prison employees and visitors in at least 33 incidents since the law went into effect on July 1, 2024, according to reports publicly posted by the Virginia Department of Corrections. 
In the 17 months since the law went into effect, canines have attacked their handlers and bitten incarcerated people in the arms, legs, stomach and head, according to incident reports obtained by The Virginia Mercury. In that period, five incarcerated people were sent to a hospital for treatment after encounters with a canine.
Criminal justice advocates have called for Gov.-elect Abigail Spangerger to ban the use of patrol dogs entirely, arguing that the canines can cause lasting injuries and trauma. Spanberger’s transition team did not respond to requests for comment.
The debate over the dogs comes at an inflection point for Virginia’s prison system. Virginia prisons face a staffing shortage of roughly 25%. A union representing the corrections officers told the Richmond Times-Dispatch that low staffing played a role in the recent killing of an officer — the first in a half century. 
VADOC spokesman Kyle Gibson said canines “play a vital role at VADOC facilities, protecting correctional team members and inmates while deterring aggressive inmate behavior,” a message that has been echoed by groups representing corrections officers.“I have witnessed and been involved in many incidents where the use of those canines saved lives,” Donald Baylor, a former corrections officer who represents the Virginia Chapter of the National Coalition of Public Safety Officers, told lawmakers last year. 
But Shawn Weneta, a criminal justice advocate and lobbyist who was formerly incarcerated and helped negotiate the current law, said it didn’t go far enough. He noted many other states are managing staffing shortages without the use of patrol dogs.
“The governor has the ability to say, ‘We’re not going to use patrol canines in our prisons, we don’t need them,’” Weneta said. 
The current law was a compromise. Del. Holly Seibold, D-Fairfax, who sponsored the 2024 bill, said in an interview she initially sought an outright ban on using patrol canines but carved exceptions to win support from Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin. 
The 2024 law says canines are to only be deployed in altercations involving three or more prisoners — or if a corrections officer “reasonably believes” canines are necessary to “protect any prisoner or any officer or employee from the threat of serious bodily injury or death.”
The full extent of the dogs’ use remains murky. The law requires VADOC to “track all canine uses of force” and publish the information on its website. The department has interpreted that phrasing as a simple tally published monthly that contains no details about the attacks. VADOC initially declined to hand over the incident reports, which contain narratives of canine attacks, but later agreed on the condition it redact the names of the people involved.
The redacted names in the reports make it difficult to know how badly imprisoned people were injured or verify the department’s narrative of events. But they illustrate how dogs can be an unpredictable tool for enforcing order.
On Nov. 22, 2024, an incarcerated person at Red Onion State Prison pressed against a fence to clear the path for an incoming corrections officer and dog who were responding to a fight. The dog lunged at the man, who was not involved in the altercation, and bit him in the stomach.
Two days later, a patrol dog at Wallens Ridge attacked a corrections officer in the buttocks when they were on hand to break up a fight. A little over a month later, on New Year’s Eve 2024, a canine bit its handler at Keen Mountain Correctional Center in the arm and left hand, causing serious injuries to the officer. 
Chavis, the incarcerated man who was attacked by a dog in 2023, argues in his lawsuit that canine handlers at Red Onion disproportionately targeted Black people and directed dogs to attack compliant incarcerated people as a “malicious form of punishment.” 
In the complaint, Chavis’ pro bono attorneys from the Georgetown University Law Center and the Erlich Law Office say the attack occurred after Chavis complained about a malfunctioning prison phone he was attempting to use to call his daughter on her birthday. 
The lawsuit says Chavis refused orders to go to a section of the prison he believed lacked camera coverage, fearing for his safety. It alleges he complied with officers as they handcuffed him but was nonetheless accused of resisting and was slammed to the ground, where he was choked by a guard and mauled by the dog. 
The lawsuit alleges corrections officers heckled him with racist abuse, including “(we) just fucked up another n— tonight.”
The complaint alleges officers on hand forced him to balance on one leg to deepen his suffering and told him “(we) should have let that dog kill you,” warning that if he spoke about the episode to anyone, he would be deemed a “snitch” and “taken care of.”
In legal filings, an attorney with the Virginia attorney general’s office representing VADOC and the officers involved disputed nearly all of Chavis’ claims, though they have yet to lay out their own version of events. Gibson, the VADOC spokesperson, said the department does not comment on active litigation.
The case is currently in the discovery phase ahead of a December 2026 trial; VADOC has turned over footage of the incident to Chavis’ attorneys, but it remains shielded from public view by a protective order. VADOC declined to turn over footage of the incident to the Virginia Mercury, citing an exemption clause in the state’s FOIA law that allows officials to withhold records that would jeopardize the safety of any person or government facility. 
Red Onion has been at the center of accusations involving civil rights abuses.

State lawmakers this year pressed for a probe into Red Onion after prisoners burned themselves and participated in hunger strikes in protest of alleged abuse by guards and overuse of solitary confinement at the facility.

(Photo courtesy of Christian Martinez, Office of Governor Glenn Youngkin.)Over a year after Hurricane Helene ripped through the Southern Appalachian region from Georgia to Southwest Virginia, Virginia Tech staff and students are leading research into the storm’s lasting environmental impacts – with a focus on North Carolina, which experienced the most catastrophic damage in the September 2024 storm. 
The university’s Department of Fish and Wildlife Conservation is partnering with the U.S. Department of Agriculture through an $8.8 million grant to conduct field work in early 2026. Virginia Tech will be tasked with hiring a staff of 20 people to begin collecting data on aquatic and forest ecosystems. 
The aim is to have field teams assess watersheds that were impacted by the storm to identify high-need areas where remediation is necessary to restore ecosystems or bolster public safety. The initial focus will be on North Carolina and Virginia.
“For the university, and especially for our students, we get this access to funding opportunities for experiential learning and opportunities for graduate student projects,” said Joel Snodgrass, head of the Department of Fish and Wildlife Conservation. “It works a lot like most of the other embedded federal scientists that we have with us.”
The teams will be looking for areas that were damaged that may be still susceptible to mudslides, debris jams in waterways and other risks. Infrastructure such as bridge crossings, culverts and trestles will be evaluated to make sure they remain safe for public use.
Virginia took on an estimated $4 billion in damages, and three people in the state died as a result of the storm; 250 people perished in other states. Hundreds of thousands of cubic yards of debris were blown around the region in Virginia, much of it clogging waterways in the southwest leading to dozens of trestles and bridges being completely destroyed or heavily damaged.
In some areas of the state, floodwaters reached over 31 feet on the New River, disrupting the flow of smaller streams that feed into the river. Changes like that have led to shifts in rebuilding efforts and researchers will assess what the altered stream movements mean for the area’s habitats and animals.
They will also be taking a close look at fish and threatened wildlife such as the eastern hellbender salamander to find out if the storm will have lasting population effects. 
Work to collect data in the field will begin in early 2026. By 2030, the team is slated to produce an extensive report to give data on the environmental impacts of the storm and potential remediation recommendations to make the forests more resilient against any future natural disasters.

(Photo by Bill Pugliano/Getty Images)The 13-state electric grid operator that serves Ohio is holding its second capacity auction of the year — setting a baseline electricity cost that will get baked into consumers’ bills in June 2027.
It’s the last such auction happening with a court-ordered cap on prices, and market watchers are warning next May’s auction could be dramatically higher.
PJM uses the capacity auction to ensure reliability. Power plants get paid by the megawatt hour for committing to produce electricity when demand peaks.
Just a few years ago, capacity prices were about $29 per megawatt hour. The rapid increase in demand from users like data centers, combined with shortening supply as older power plants are retired, has pushed capacity prices up.
The cap
The rates rose from $29 to $270 in one 2024 auction and then rose further this summer.
In July, the capacity auction for 2026 went all the way to the $329 per megawatt hour cap imposed by the courts after Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro sued PJM Interconnection.
Rising capacity prices are meant to be a signal to bring more power plants online, but Clara Summers from Consumers for Better Grid explained that system isn’t working.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“The price cap was originally imposed, let’s remind ourselves, because PJM’s interconnection queue backlog is so severe that new generation could not come onto the system no matter how high the price.”
Put simply, it takes a lot longer to get a new power plant up and running than it does to propose a new data center.
Capacity costs contribute to the average consumers energy bill, but they make up a small share of the overall total.
The cost of energy itself and transmission to your home make up the vast majority of your electric bill.
Following last summer’s auction, for instance, PJM predicted rising capacity costs would translate to a 1.5% to 5% increase on customers’ bills.
But over time, the increases can really add up.
A recent study from the Natural Resources Defense Council predicted an average family will pay about $70 more each month on their electric bills by 2028.
Jon Gordon from Advanced Energy United isn’t expecting the capacity prices to decline anytime soon.
“You know, I think most folks are expecting us to hit this cap again, the $329 per megawatt day cap, which hopefully means this auction won’t result in price increases as a result of the capacity market for consumers,” he said.
“But we all are concerned and looking forward to the June 2026 auction and what may happen there.”
Gordon noted PJM’s staff has even told to the board that maintaining a cap might be a good idea given uncertainty about how much power data centers will actually demand.
“Absent intervention on PJM’s part or some other entity’s part,” he said, “that cap that was put in place will expire, and PJM will go back to their original default cap of $500 a megawatt day.”
For how long?
Nikhil Kumar from GridLab explained some kind of limit is probably needed for the next few years, as PJM’s backlog of proposed power plants come online.
Even with a new fast track system for natural gas plants, he said, that capacity isn’t likely to hit the grid until 2029.
Still, he warned there could be “unintended consequences” of keeping a cap in place too long.
“You’re sort of undermining what the market is telling you,” Kumar explained. “Maybe the price should be $500 a megawatt day, but if you cap it at $330 it is going to have an effect on investments.”
For some energy developers, that lower threshold might mean their new plant no longer pencils out — meaning less supply gets added to the grid.
Meanwhile lower capacity prices might inadvertently keep older, inefficient plants around longer.
Those plants, Kumar explained, aren’t frontline resources so they rely on capacity payments to make money.
But if the owner decides to shut down the plant, again, cutting into supply, PJM could force it into a “reliability must run” contract, in effect keeping the plant available in case the grid can’t meet its power needs.
“You’re putting the rate payers on the hook,” Kumar said, “and then you’re basically a zombie plant, because you just get paid without actually participating in the market.”
“We don’t want an indefinite price gap,” he added. “We want the market to work eventually.”
What to do?
Summers said PJM needs to ensure the projections data centers are making are legitimate.
If demand forecasts outstrip the eventual demand, customers wind up overpaying.
One way to make the math work, she said, is for PJM to impose a “bring your own” model for data centers’ power demands.
Data centers want power quickly, but ordinary consumers don’t want to be on the hook for the build out.
“The best way to resolve that is for data centers to pay for their own new capacity to serve them,” Summers said.
She noted in a handful of states including Ohio and Indiana actors are working to hold data centers accountable for their forecasts.
In Ohio, AEP’s new data center tariff imposes abandonment costs if a data center reneges on its plans to build.
In a statement, PJM spokesman Jeff Shields said the grid operator “look(s) forward to working with any and all of our states who are pursuing these types of reforms.”
And he emphasized that the organization is working clear the backlog on its end.
Shields noted 57 gigawatts of proposed power has cleared the study to process, and PJM expects to process another 31 gigawatts this year.
“Those remaining projects include the shovel-ready, high reliability generation projects that came in through our Reliability Resource Initiative,” he said, referring to a program prioritizing projects like natural gas fired plants.
At a recent stakeholder meeting Shields noted “there were a number of thoughtful proposals on on how to best integrate data centers.”
That meeting, however, proved inconclusive, with no ideas earning consensus.
Still, PJM is planning to propose rules for large load users like data centers later this month, and Shields said those stakeholder ideas “will inform the PJM Board’s final decision on a path forward.”

Tony Caplan has his eye on a familiar culprit: plastic water bottles. 
“Plastic right now is a huge problem,” Caplan, a Democrat from Henniker, said in an interview. As proposed, House Bill 1141 would prevent the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services from issuing new permits for groundwater extraction and bottling in vessels that contain any percentage of plastic.
Caplan said he was motivated by three main goals: protecting groundwater, reducing waste, and reducing plastic use. 
He pointed to the increased incidence of deep droughts during warmer months, saying they would make it increasingly important to take steps to conserve groundwater. Though New Hampshire is receiving more rain and snowfall overall, precipitation has also become more erratic, straining aquifers. 
“We need to protect our groundwater in ways that we haven’t had to in the past,” Caplan said. “… It’s not an immediate threat, but it’s something that we need to think of in terms of the changing climate.”
This summer’s historic drought saw more than 200 households report dry wells throughout New Hampshire, according to the Department of Environmental Services, though officials said the true total was likely higher. 
Meanwhile, elsewhere in the Northeast, the lack of precipitation drew public scrutiny to large groundwater withdrawal and water bottling operations. In Maine, media organization More Perfect Union reported that bottling company Poland Spring, which draws water from several springs in the state, was pulling more water than it had in previous years despite ongoing drought conditions. Poland Spring later said the company had withdrawn a similar amount of water in 2025 as it had in 2024, according to News Center Maine. 
Caplan’s concern about the effects of large withdrawals on groundwater supplies is not new. In 2024, he introduced a bill to prohibit the Department of Environmental Services from issuing certain groundwater extraction permits for bottling operations.
At a hearing that year before the House Resources, Recreation, and Development Committee, a New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services spokesperson described the department’s existing permitting protocol, said Rep. Tanya Donnelly, a Salem Republican. The presentation satisfied the committee that the department was protecting groundwater, and did not recommend the bill for passage, Donnelly said. The bill was later defeated by the House. 
Now, however, Caplan said he has another reason for bringing the bill back: concern about the amount of plastic entering the waste stream and New Hampshire’s diminishing capacity to accommodate it.
“Our landfills are … filling up pretty quickly, and most of that is plastic waste,” he said. “That’s also the big environmental factor that we need to consider when talking about new permits for groundwater extraction with the purpose of using plastic as the bottle. That’s basically just a huge source of waste.”
Bottled water is up to 2,000 times more energy-intensive than the same volume of tap water, Caplan said. 
“It’s just so inefficient in terms of energy use, and that’s obviously impacting the climate,” he said.
As proposed, the bill would apply to future permit applications. The New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services is not aware at this time of any existing projects that would be affected by the bill, spokesperson Jim Martin said in an email.
Caplan said it was possible a bottling facility planned for Nashua at a facility purchased this spring by NF North America, a subsidiary of Chinese bottled water and beverage company Nongfu Spring, could be affected. However, water to the plant is slated to be provided by Pennichuck Water Works, according to a May NH Business Review report, published by the Valley News. Pennichuck Water Works is a utility and water management corporation that supplies water to Nashua and some surrounding communities.
If that is the case, the facility will not need a groundwater extraction permit from the Department of Environmental Services and would not be affected by the proposal, Martin said. The facility would still need a permit from the Department of Health and Human Services, he said. As proposed, the bill does not impact DHHS permits.
The House Resources, Recreation, and Development Committee will consider the bill at a hearing in the new year. Donnelly, a committee member, declined to comment on whether she would support the proposal without a more complete understanding of what entities or companies the bill could affect. 
Caplan said he hoped for “grassroots” support, adding he hoped to build on past momentum around limiting waste, a topic that has drawn some bipartisan support in the Legislature in past sessions.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/plasticpollution-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-12-11 05:56:28.319567

But after the government shutdown, the funding hit a delay.","Connecticut farmers whose crops were damaged by weather in the last two years will have to wait until next year to request relief funding after the process was delayed during the government shutdown.
Regular discussions between the Connecticut Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Department of Agriculture stalled during the 43-day government shutdown. Once it reopened in mid-November, talks picked up as they look to hammer out the final details of the federal Farm Recovery and Support Block Grant program.
The exact timing to wrap up negotiations and finalize the contract for Connecticut to administer the crop loss program, however, is still up in the air. Connecticut officials gave a loose timeline of before the 2026 planting season. (Historically, planting seasons start around April but vary for some farmers.)
And they are looking for a vendor that will help them distribute the money. The state agency can incur administrative expenses 90 days before securing a contract that federal officials can reimburse them for later.
“Since the reopening, we have resumed discussions in a regular cadence and are finalizing our timeline and work plan draft for review and approval through the USDA process,” Rebecca Eddy, a spokesperson for the Connecticut Department of Agriculture, said.
It’s been nearly a year since Congress approved the federal block grant as part of a year-end bill to fund the government last December.
After months of negotiations between state and federal officials, Connecticut found out over the summer it would receive about $53 million from a federal block grant designed to help small and midsized farmers recoup weather-related crop losses that were incurred during 2023 and 2024.
The state’s allocation is about a quarter of the $220 million Farm Recovery and Support Block Grant Program, which was open to every state in New England plus Hawaii and Alaska. The amount awarded to Connecticut was about 63.5% of the state’s $82.3 million request.
When the state learned of its allocation in August, Connecticut was still waiting for USDA to the approval of its program design and the execution of a contract. At the time, the state anticipated that could happen in September, with potential plans to open applications some time later in the fall.
But with Congress locked in a budget impasse at the end of the fiscal year, the government shut down on Oct. 1. 
“We continue to seek clarity and transparency from USDA on the agency’s proposed program,” the state agency wrote in its Nov. 21 newsletter. “We recognize the financial strain that delays in funding may have on farm operations and remain committed to launching this program as soon as possible.”
The U.S. Department of Agriculture did not respond to a request for comment about the process.
As they look to wrap things up regarding the federal block grant, Connecticut will figure out what eligible farmers will need in terms of paperwork and documentation to be able to get some of the $53 million pot of money.
Overall, farmers in Connecticut and across the country are getting hit by rising prices and the response by countries like China to U.S. tariff policies that have ignited a trade war.
The Trump administration’s $12 billion farm aid package will provide one-time payments to producers of row crops like corn, soybeans and wheat. Only $1 billion of that will go toward specialty crops, like fruits and vegetables, as well as sugar. The details and timeline for those payments have yet to be determined.
Smaller farming states like Connecticut and other places in New England don’t typically see the same kind of assistance from the federal government, especially since they predominantly grow specialty crops.
That prompted U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-3rd District, and other lawmakers to push for more federal assistance in the form of a block grant. It was designed to only apply to small and medium farming states where eligibility didn’t hinge on whether a farmer has crop insurance.
One of the influences behind establishing it was William Dellacamera, a farmer in North Branford who has been advocating for federal relief for over a year.
A 13-minute hail storm destroyed Cecarelli’s Harrison Hill Farm in August 2024. A month later, Dellacamera traveled to Washington, D.C., on his tractor to push for help from the federal government. As months went by with little developments and ongoing negotiations, he came back to the nation’s capital to ask about the status of the farm block grant. He met with U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins on two occasions as he made his plea for the quick rollout of the money for small and midsize farmers.
Dellacamera was pleased over the summer about the $53 million Connecticut plans to receive from the federal government. But he said there are “so many unanswered questions.”
“I didn’t think it was going to take this long,” Dellacamera said in an interview. “Somebody’s gotta figure it out, and nobody’s figuring it out quick enough.”
“Every farm is different — some are further behind and some are a little further ahead, but in the end, it’s just not working out,” he continued. “We just gotta hope that [the federal funding] does come through.”
He remains frustrated by USDA’s decision that states like Connecticut aren’t able to tap into a separate and much larger pot of disaster assistance because they have access to a specialty block grant.
Back in June, disagreements emerged over the rollout of the disaster aid block grant.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture gave eligible states two options. They could run their own crop loss program by using the block grant tailored for them, but they wouldn’t get access to a larger pot of supplemental disaster aid — the option that Connecticut ultimately chose. Or they could go with the latter, run by the federal agency, but face limits on what gets covered by the block grant.
Connecticut decided it would develop a state-run program using the federal block grant. That meant the state won’t get access to the $21 billion Supplemental Disaster Relief Program.
The state’s Department of Agriculture believes the block grant option will give the state more flexibility for specialty crop operations, especially since the supplemental disaster funds might not cover many of the farmers and producers in Connecticut.
At that time, the state agency and Connecticut’s congressional delegation pushed back against the USDA’s parameters that states cannot participate in both programs. Questions and concerns had emerged over the potential of farmers getting money from two places to cover the same thing.
DeLauro had argued the federal agency was going against the intentions of Congress in how it wrote the law, saying they interpreted the special grant as a supplement for smaller farmers who don’t always qualify for traditional disaster relief.
For its part, USDA placed the blame on Democratic lawmakers, contending that they were delaying aid. The federal agency argued members were looking “to manufacture controversy and blame the Trump Administration.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Willie-Dellacamera-Cecarellis-Harrison-Hill-Farm-scaled.jpg,,,2025-12-11 05:56:28.319567

(Illustration by stellalevi via Getty Images)William Skipworth’s three-part investigation in the New Hampshire Bulletin has laid bare the ongoing traumas experienced by people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. The community’s response has been swift — shock, grief, and a collective demand for action to prevent future harm. As the dust settles, pressing questions are emerging about oversight and accountability: Which safeguards broke down? Where is training most needed? And how do we sustain a workforce stretched far beyond its limits?
These systemic questions are essential. But we must also ask: What do the people within these systems truly need? 
People with intellectual and developmental disabilities experience significantly higher rates of abuse, neglect, and exploitation, and yet receive significantly lower rates of mental health screening, crisis support, and therapeutic services. When traumas occur, like those Skipworth reported, many are left without the tools, language, or professional support to process what has happened to them. Too often, their distress is relabeled as “behaviors,” or reduced to a staffing challenge rather than recognized as a mental health need. 
Our systems continue to place people with intellectual and developmental disabilities in silos that ignore the most basic truth: being human comes with mental health needs, whether the system is prepared to see them or not. Skipworth’s series reveals the all-too-common occurrence of reporting a concern and moving people as a solution. Moving people with intellectual and developmental disabilities quickly to new, and often unknown, caregivers and homes is treated as a solution, though often leads to increased complexity.
This is a pattern rooted in a long history of separating disability from humanity, of treating emotional life as optional or irrelevant for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. We see this in the very laws that shape our mental health system. 
Under NH RSA 135-C:2, the State of New Hampshire defines mental illness in a way that excludes intellectual disability. The intent is not to label intellectual disability as a mental illness, but this statutory separation creates a false choice — treating intellectual disability and mental health as mutually exclusive. The result is not theoretical. It’s lived daily: people with intellectual and developmental disabilities who also have mental health conditions are screened out of services, bounced between agencies, or told they “don’t meet criteria” because their primary diagnosis is intellectual or developmental disability. This was evident in public testimony I attended during the last legislative attempt to amend the statute, where families and providers described their experiences firsthand to state officials. 
The idea of primary diagnosis is intended for clinical professionals to identify the root cause of someone’s impairments in functioning, disregarding the complexity of mental health needs that we all experience. Although the law allows for concrete decision-making for professionals, the assumption that people with intellectual and developmental disabilities do not need mental health support creates potentially dangerous barriers. This exclusion might be legally convenient, but it is clinically dangerous and morally indefensible. 
New Hampshire’s developmental disabilities and mental health systems are primarily accessed through New Hampshire Medicaid. The Community Mental Health Journal references key statistics that show approximately 59% of Medicaid beneficiaries with intellectual and developmental disabilities had at least one mental health condition, compared to approximately 21% of all U.S. adults. Knowing our citizens with intellectual and developmental disabilities are more than twice as likely to experience a mental health condition than those without intellectual and developmental disabilities, we must challenge the current legal definition of mental illness, and the discrimination against people who need support the most.
Our state’s history makes this even more pressing. In Dr. Andrew Houtenville’s recent reflection, he reminds us that the work of deinstitutionalization is still ongoing. Our past must inform our future, with the necessity of continued oversight of the systems and protection of the people within them.
We cannot claim the legacy of deinstitutionalization while ignoring the very real institutionalization of trauma. The physical institutions may have gone away, but institutional thinking — believing that people with intellectual and developmental disabilities have “different” mental/emotional needs or lack thereof — remains. If the right to mental health care remains largely inaccessible to people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, then the institutional mindset survives, just out of public view.
In any other setting, such as a school or employer, counselors or employee assistance programs are likely to be offered as a resource when needed. Why is this not an expected resource for people receiving disability services? 
Without accessible mental health resources, trauma-informed assessment, and a commitment to whole-person care, our siloed systems will continue to neglect the most essential human needs. New Hampshire’s disability service system has many dedicated and compassionate professionals, but good intentions cannot overcome structural barriers. Until we recognize mental health as a universal right, not a privilege determined by diagnosis, we will continue to fail the very people we claim to serve. We cannot tolerate a system where trauma is predictable, but therapy is inaccessible.
Addressing workforce shortages, improving oversight, and increasing training are critical steps, but they are not enough. True deinstitutionalization requires us to do something harder: to see people with intellectual and developmental disabilities as whole people with full inner lives, emotional needs, mental health vulnerabilities, and the right to healing.
I encourage you to be part of modeling the expectation of the community you want. Contact your local representatives and begin discussions about mental health for all within your communities.
Should we fail to act now, the next investigative series will not be a revelation, it will be a record of predictable harm. 
New Hampshire can do better. We must. For every person who was denied support, silenced in their grief, or left to navigate trauma alone, we owe nothing less.

(Photo by Marty Schladen, Ohio Capital Journal.)Since online sports gambling became legal in Ohio in 2023, sports scandals have been mounting. Getting less attention is the human toll, which has grown rapidly.
With the stress of the holidays — and college and professional football playoffs — approaching, a Columbus-based clinician said it’s important to understand when gambling passes from being simple fun to a real problem.
Kelley Breidigan is an assistant clinical professor at Ohio State’s College of Social Work. She said that measures of problem gambling have been on the rise in all 38 states that have legalized online sports betting.
“Most folks are assigning this to the Supreme Court decision in 2018 that allowed states to legalize and regulate sports betting,” she said. 
“With that legalization, what we’re starting to see is that as online betting increased, it coincided with record-breaking demand for help for gambling addiction.”
The costs of problem gambling can be demonstrated several ways. For example, people’s financial health has deteriorated in a big way. 
The UCLA Anderson School of Management in April reported that entire states’ average credit scores took a hit when sports betting was legalized. That’s not just the average credit scores of gamblers, but of everybody in the state.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“Our main finding is that overall consumers’ financial health is modestly deteriorating as the average credit score in states with legalized sports gambling decreases by roughly 0.8 points,” the report said. 
“When states introduce access to online sports gambling, average credit scores decline by nearly three times as much (2.75 points). The decline in credit score is associated with changes in indicators of excessive debt.”
Not surprisingly, the researchers also found an increase in other, more serious problems. 
“We find a substantial increase in average bankruptcy rates, debt sent to collections, use of debt consolidation loans, and auto loan delinquencies,” the UCLA report said. 
“Together, these results indicate that the ease of access to sports gambling is harming consumer financial health by increasing their level of debt.”
In Connecticut, 12.4% of lottery revenue and 51% of sports betting revenue comes from about 2% of people with severe gambling addiction, a 2024 report from Gemini Research shows.
Amid accusations that big-time players are rigging at least parts of games, Gov. Mike DeWine last month told the Associated Press that he regrets signing Ohio’s sports betting law. 
He’s taken steps to limit bets on minor aspects of games — or “prop” bets — that seem particularly prone to abuse.
Speaking of the gambling companies, DeWine referred to “the deep, deep, deep pockets they have to advertise and do everything they can to get someone to place that bet…” the AP reported.
Breidigan, the Ohio State clinician, said that marketing sends the message that sports betting is a normal, safe activity. 
Indeed, watch any sports broadcast and you’re likely to see Kevin Hart and LeBron James laughing it up as they promote the Draft Kings betting platform.
Breidigan said such promotion and the ease of betting via cell phone have mainlined gambling to a huge new audience.
“This was always relegated to the fringes of society — people who had gambling issues. What this did is completely normalize gambling,” she said. 
“It made it so easy for people to just pick up their phone and make a bet. That has had a severe impact on individuals and families.” 
In addition to deteriorating finances, other social costs are mounting. 
There are an estimated 255,000 problem gamblers in Ohio. And the United Way of Greater Cleveland reported a 277% increase in gambling-related calls to its helpline in the first month of legalized sports betting when compared to a year earlier.
Even though legalized gambling creates a stream tax revenue, it’s still a losing bet in terms of public policy, the peer-reviewed journal Public Health reported in October 2024.
 It cited studies in Sweden and France finding that the social costs of gambling outweighed the taxes it generated.
And, as people develop gambling problems, they can face catastrophic personal consequences, the report said.
“Rates of attempted suicide and suicidal ideation are much higher among individuals with serious gambling problems and/or clinically diagnosed Gambling Disorder than among the general population,” it said. 
“Rates of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts have been found to be even higher among individuals in treatment for Gambling Disorder: as high as 81.4% for suicidal ideation and 30.2% for suicide attempts in the past 12 months.”
Breidigan said that it’s important to understand that problem gambling functions in ways similar to problems with substances. 
“What I think a lot of people don’t realize is that gambling actually stimulates the brain’s reward system just like drugs or alcohol,” she said.
 “The way our brains are set up, once it acclimates to a certain activity or substance or whatever it is, it needs more to get the same kind of dopamine hit to get that feel-good response.” 
The reasons some people might be more prone to problem gambling than others can vary. 
Bipolar and obsessive-compulsive disorders as well as depression might underlie a gambling problem. But so can many other things, Breidigan said. 
It’s important to recognize when gambling goes from being an amusement to something more. 
That’s when people “develop an incredible preoccupation with gambling. They’re constantly thinking about it. They’re planning it. There are increased bets… You’ll see them where they’re chasing losses — they’re trying to win back that money that they lost,” Breidigan said.
As with other addictions, problem gambling often reaches a point where it damages families. 
“A lot of times we see a lot of lying that really affects the family and friends because they’re hiding the extent of the losses that they have,” Breidigan said. 
“There’s a huge issue where they’re borrowing money. They’ve got unpaid bills. They’re selling possessions so that they can keep funding their gambling.”
As with other forms of addiction, help is available for problem gamblers. Breitigan said it’s important for people to get over their embarrassment, and understand that they’re far from alone. 
She said a good place to begin seeking help is the Ohio problem gambling helpline.
“There are some people who try very hard, but despite their best efforts, they’re still engaging in this harmful behavior,” Breitigan said. 
“Oftentimes it’s friends and family saying, ‘You need help.’ If you’re hearing those sorts of things, or thinking about them yourself, it’s probably a good idea to talk to someone. The job of a mental health professional is not to shame. There’s absolutely no point in that.”

(Photo Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)County officials said a change in state law requiring them to pick up half the cost of compensating individuals who were erroneously convicted puts more pressure on their budgets and holds county governments responsible for events they cannot control.
For years, the state picked up the tab for compensating those who were imprisoned for crimes they did not commit. That changed this spring with passage of a budget package that needed to close a $3.3 billion deficit: As part of that effort, the budget bill included surprise language that required counties to pick up half of the payouts.
Worcester County Administrative Officer Weston Young said counties — especially smaller ones with comparatively smaller budgets — should not be on the hook.
“I want to state clearly that in Maryland’s 24 counties, you cannot find one that does not support justice for exonerees, and all of us wholeheartedly back compensating the wrongfully incarcerated,” Young said Wednesday during a panel discussion at the Maryland Association of Counties winter conference in Cambridge.
“If you are innocent, it is an unimaginable nightmare to be wrongly incarcerated,” he said. “But that said, fairness would demand the state take responsibility, take sole responsibility.”
He said the change in law that forces counties to pick up half the costs of compensating exonerated inmates is pitting the counties’ desire to right past wrongs against a need to have certainty in their own budgeting.
State, Wicomico County to pay over half a million for man’s wrongful conviction

Young and other officials pointed out that county governments have no hand in the bad convictions. State’s attorneys are independently elected, and county executives and commissioners have no say in the cases prosecutors pursue or how they are prosecuted.
Young notes a current application for compensation that involves a person who was convicted on the strength of testimony from a state forensic expert. The conviction was tossed out after it was learned the expert misrepresented some credentials.
Prosecutors are not retrying the three-decade old case, and the person convicted — unlike many who have received compensation — has not been pardoned or exonerated.
Counties also are not a party to appeals or the administrative hearings where payouts are decided.
“There’s not a single county actor that’s involved in this,” said Wes Adams, a former Anne Arundel County State’s Attorney who is now the county attorney for Charles County.
In 2021, then-Gov. Larry Hogan signed the Walter Lomax Act, which was named for a man who spent nearly four decades in prison for a murder he did not commit. It clarified state law governing the compensation of those who are wrongly convicted.
Before the law passed, compensation was not mandatory and frequently denied. The Walter Lomax Act established a formal process, including hearings before an administrative law judge. It also set a formula for compensation based on the state’s most recently available median income. A daily rate is then applied to the number of days the individual spent behind bars for the erroneous conviction.
Since the bill passed, there have been about 40 compensation cases filed with the Office of Administrative Hearings.
“In all of the Walter Lomax Act cases, the claimant must prove by clear and convincing evidence that they did not commit the crime. So, in a lot of cases, honestly, most cases, the individual is not able to meet that burden,” said Syeetah Hampton-El, executive administrative law judge.

Just 18 of the applications have been approved for payments, Hampton-El said. Of those 18 cases, 11 of them — 61% — came out of Baltimore City. Three were from Wicomico County. Two were from Baltimore County. Charles and Harford counties accounted for one each.
Awards range from $250,000 to a high of $2.7 million — two exonerees received that amount.
In most cases, the tab for counties sounds small but in smaller counties, even small amounts can have an outsized feel.
“Our primary concern has to be to seek justice, but in these cases, the unpredictable financial burden can be crushing some of our jurisdictions as well,” Young said. “The state dictates changes to an expansion of the Walter Lomax Act … to include additional offenses. Expanded to allow estates to recover in the case of deaths. These are just the expansions that have happened so far, and expansions to include additional compensation with that.”
Some state’s attorneys said they also are aware of the conflict between seeking justice and fiscal issues.
Wicomico County State’s Attorney Jamie Dykes said prosecutors are obligated to protect the innocent, including those wrongly convicted. Those efforts, she said, come with a cost.
“From our perspective, while my primary concern is not money, it is justice and the public’s confidence,” Dykes said. “I’m also a taxpayer, a resident, and I am not ignorant to the realities that the new legislation, or the past legislation, puts on all of us, especially small communities.”
Young said his county’s share of the pending compensation case could surpass $2 million — about 1% of the county’s budget. That’s money that could be used to pay portions of the state’s expensive education reforms or other county priorities, he said.
Young fears more cost shifts by the state.
“The 50-50 move with the counties sets a long-term policy risk for all of us,” Young said. “It’s a dangerous precedent where they could do this for more and similar shifts. They’re saddling counties with unpredictable tabs. That’s a threat to fiscal stability statewide if counties start struggling.”

(Getty Images.)Ohio lawmakers have sent a bill changing marijuana policy to Gov. Mike DeWine’s desk, creating a slew of new criminal offenses, from buying weed in Michigan to smoking in a public area.
It’s taken years, but finally, recreational marijuana policy is heading to the finish line. This was an effort by the Republicans to “make changes” to the legislation to make it “better,” lawmakers have continued to say.
In November of 2023, 57% of Ohioans voted yes on Issue 2: the legalization of recreational cannabis.
“This bill leaves the crux of Issue 2 and marijuana access intact while providing for several important public safety concerns,” state Sen. Steve Huffman, R-Tipp City, said about S.B. 56.
While Republicans like Huffman are happy about what they call a compromise — creating some restrictions but keeping the amount of marijuana you can have the same — Democrats call it:
“Bull****,” Senate Minority Leader Nickie Antonio, D-Lakewood, said.
Antonio is frustrated, and so is marijuana policy researcher Karen O’Keefe.
“It’s a slap in the face to voters,” O’Keefe said. “Voters overwhelmingly voted in Ohio to legalize cannabis, full stop, and this creates numerous exceptions where innocuous conduct would be re-criminalized.”
Huffman defended the law.
“It instituted a public smoking ban… prohibits open marijuana containers and smoking in cars,” Huffman said.
Also, it gives landlords the ability to prohibit smoking and vaping, bans outdoor venues from allowing marijuana, and requires all products to be kept in the same package they were bought in.
“Imagine if you have a pill container where you track your dosage, because it’s medicine — that would be a crime,” O’Keefe said.
The open container law is one of the most worrisome, she added.
“If you have a baggie of edibles in the backseat of a Lyft or on a public bus — if it had ever been opened, you would be a criminal,” she said.
It also makes it a crime to buy out-of-state cannabis.
Federal law currently doesn’t allow marijuana to go across state lines, but it isn’t enforced.
This would be an enforceable state provision preventing a citizen from going to Michigan, where the weed is cheaper, to buy.
“If you’re a medical cannabis patient in the state to the North… you would be a criminal,” O’Keefe said.
The legislation also removes protections against discrimination for housing, employment, and even organ donation.
“In the voter-approved initiative, there was language to stop a person’s life from being ruined for cannabis in a number of ways, in addition to the criminal offenses,” O’Keefe said.
“One of those was that a person couldn’t be denied medical care, including organ transplants, just for being an adult-use cannabis consumer.”
Democrats also argue that a provision would allow for police to have probable cause during traffic stops if someone is a “known consumer” of marijuana.
We asked Ohio Senate President Rob McColley, R-Napoleon, his response to worries over what advocates call the re-criminalization of marijuana
“I don’t really subscribe to that,” McColley responded.
Enforcement of the new crimes, like having gummies in different packaging, won’t be a priority for law enforcement, the president said.
“There are a variety of provisions in this bill… It’s not something that’s going to be heavily penalized, but it’s something that we need to make sure that [police] have the tools necessary in the event that they need to be able to enforce,” he said.
This will just lead to selective enforcement, O’Keefe said, hurting marginalized communities that have historically been negatively impacted by drug convictions.
“If you’re African American, you’re far more likely to have a criminal record because of this kind of disproportionate enforcement,” she said.
We asked if O’Keefe thinks there will be more arrests.
“I think so,” O’Keefe replied. “In Minnesota, more than 3,500 people have been arrested under an open container law. I expect that we will see thousands more people arrested.”
The bill now goes to Gov. Mike DeWine, who says he will review it. But many marijuana supporters are hoping for a lawsuit.
Adding insult to injury, the lawmakers also took away Issue 2’s funding for expungement.
“This has some very kind of milquetoast, weak expansion of expungement language, at the same time as it’s pulling away all the funding,” O’Keefe said.
This will cause an even bigger burden on people who voted to get their records clear, she added.
Still, the marijuana advocates fared much better in the legislature than the hemp industry.
The bill completely banned the vast majority of “intoxicating” hemp — products with low-level THC that you can buy in gas stations and smoke shops.
Breweries and stores with liquor licenses will still be able to sell THC drinks until the federal ban on hemp goes into effect next year.

(Photo by Lauren McCauley/ Maine Morning Star)Tariffs imposed by the Trump administration contributed to a decline in Maine exports to Canada and fewer northern neighbors coming to visit the Pine Tree State this year.
Overall, exports from Maine to Canada are down nearly 20%, according to information Wade Merritt, president of the Maine International Trade Center, shared with the Legislature’s Maine-Canadian Advisory Commission during a meeting Wednesday morning. He also said Canadian tourism fell from 7% of all visitors to the state in 2024 to just 4% in this year.
Merritt said tariffs have “defined trade policy in 2025” and will continue to next year, but the decline in exports can also be attributed to multiple economic factors such as changes in commodity prices and supply chain shifts. And despite the downturn, he conveyed a sense of optimism that there continues to be opportunities across the border. 
Last year, Maine exported $1.3 billion worth of manufactured items to Canada, which is about 40% of what the state sells globally, Merritt said. 
However, as of August, exports to Canada (excluding petroleum) were down 18%. Natural resources including pulp, paper, lobster and salmon are leading the decline, Merritt said, but there are also losses in manufacturing.
President Donald Trump has argued that one goal of the tariffs is to encourage domestic manufacturing and the purchasing of American-made products. 
A recent survey from Pan Atlantic Research found that nearly a third of Mainers believe that tariffs are bad for the state because they drive up costs and hurt businesses.
Maine’s trade relationship with Canada is unlike that with any other country, Merritt explained. He described it as “familial” due to the binational communities that exist along the border and credited in-person interactions with helping sustain the relationship. 
For example, he mentioned Gov. Janet Mills’ June visit to New Brunswick and Nova Scotia to encourage Canadians to continue to visit Maine. That trip spawned a friendly soccer match between the Portland Hearts of Pine and Canada’s Halifax Wanderers. 
“We certainly see opportunity across the border continuing despite the headwinds,” Merritt said.
Forest products taking a big hit
Experts from the state’s forest product industry told the commission Wednesday that the new tariffs imposed in October were particularly challenging for pulp and paper sales. 
This builds on reports from August that the tariffs drove up lumber prices.
Dana Doran, executive director of the Professional Logging Contractors of the Northeast, said the last eight weeks have been “chaotic” for the pulp and paper sector because of the 10% tariff imposed on certain lumber products that started in mid-October. Because pulp mills often buy wood from Canada and export their finished product, they have been hit double by the new taxes, he noted. 
“Many of our folks have said that this is the worst they have ever seen in 50 to 60 years in business,” Doran said.
Technological changes over the past few decades were already forcing the forest product industry into a transition, but tariffs have had an impact beyond that, said Ellen Parent of the Maine Forest Products Council. 
Doran said he frequently hears from logging contractors that they would get out of the business if they had another opportunity. More than a dozen organization members in Aroostook County said that they have worked on the same land for 35 years but won’t have a job next year because the tariffs are making it so much harder to sell wood. 
While he hopes there is a resurgence of pulp markets and a drop in interest rates to fuel more home construction in the coming years, Doran said mills won’t be successful if that workforce isn’t there to harvest the wood. 
He suggested the lawmakers look for opportunities to prioritize Maine wood, such as large-scale heating projects or a policy to use Maine wood when building new houses. Doran also pointed to a new low-interest loan program from timber harvesting contractors that could be utilized, as well as a proposed sales tax exemption for logging trucks and trailers that could be funded and finally passed.
The commission meeting concluded without committing to next steps but the members plan to reconvene in the new year.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/logging-truck-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-12-11 04:56:15.233972

(Photo by Hanover County Animal Protection and Shelter)When he talks about Kansas Reflector, Senate President Ty Masterson acts like that raccoon who drank a bunch of liquor and passed out on a bathroom floor.
Just like the fuzzy critter guzzled peanut butter whiskey, Masterson imbibed misinformation and conspiracy theories about Kansas Reflector. He embarrassed himself in much the same way, making a public spectacle of his ignorance about journalism and a news source that holds him to account.
The Ashland, Virginia, mammal and Wichita-based gubernatorial candidate do have important differences. One has easily understood motivations. The other wants to run Kansas — and smear us.
Masterson told conservative pundit Hugh Hewitt on Dec. 2 that: “We have a kind of a Soros-funded blog that masquerades as the news. They describe me as ‘brutally effective.’ … They mean it as a negative. I remind people when your enemy is calling you brutally effective, I’m feeling pretty Trumpish.”
That’s an abridged version of the pitch Masterson has made across the state in recent weeks. The Marion County Record‘s Eric Meyer captured a fuller version in November.
“I’ll demonstrate that with a quote from the Kansas Reflector. Does anybody know what that is?” he asked the Marion County Patriots for Liberty. “So they’re a George Soros, (c)(4) funded blog in Topeka that masquerades as a news source. That’s exactly who they are. Matter of fact, that same (c)(4) funds entities like that in all the states.”
To break in here, we’re actually part of a 501(c)(3) consortium of nonpartisan, nonprofit news outlets.
Masterson continued: “They don’t have to sell advertising. They hire reporters with particular bents to write particular bent articles, and they give their content to all our small-town papers, who are starving for content. That is a very nefarious, well-oiled machine out to create a left momentum in rural Kansas. They are effective at what they do. Well, when they analyzed the (governor’s) race, they’re obviously not a fan of mine. They went through everyone, and when they got to me, they said Masterson, although not the most cuddliest of candidates, had been brutally effective in the legislature.”
Most days, I wouldn’t waste time on such obvious nonsense.
As the old saying goes: “Don’t wrestle with pigs. You both get filthy and the pig likes it.” Or raccoons, for that matter.
Folks can visit Kansas Reflector’s website and see what we do. Our news coverage and commentary — and our ever-growing audience — speak for themselves. On the other hand, Masterson has now made us part of his campaign pitch. So it’s time to respond.
Let’s begin with Masterson’s claim that Kansas Reflector called him “brutally effective.” The overall publication didn’t do that. I did.
That’s right, on July 25 I published a column titled “An early report on the Kansas governor’s race: Heavyweight Republicans and low-key Democrats.” And yes, I wrote that “Masterson, while not the cuddliest of the candidates, has proved brutally effective in his chamber, occasionally raising hackles among fellow Republicans.”
I wouldn’t count that as any sort of endorsement, myself!
Most importantly, though, Masterson is going around quoting an opinion column written by an individual. That’s not “Kansas Reflector.” That’s “Clay Wirestone, the opinion editor of Kansas Reflector.” He would rather attack an entire news organization that asks tough questions.
Second, let’s talk about barbs directed toward liberal philanthropist George Soros. Our editor in chief, Sherman Smith, gave a quote on the subject to Meyer, which I’ll reprint here.
“We have not directly or indirectly received Soros funding, but if someone can put in a good word for us, we would welcome his support in helping us shine a light on what Masterson and others are really up to in the Statehouse,” Smith said.
Smith also joked to me that if we were receiving Soros money, he wouldn’t be driving a 2002 Saturn.
As to the preposterous idea that Kansas Reflector hires folks “with particular bents to write particular bent articles,” let’s take a step back to think critically. Why would four of our five employees have worked at the Topeka Capital-Journal in 2016? That was the same year the paper ran an editorial endorsing Donald Trump, by the way.
One of our senior reporters was just inducted into the Kansas Press Association hall of fame, along with one of our columnists. Our editor has been named the KPA’s journalist of the year three (count them, three) times. We’re journalists, not political operatives.
When it comes to audience and funding: Since launching in the summer of 2020, Kansas Reflector has enjoyed increases in audience for every year of our existence. We now raise more than a third of our yearly budget from local donations, with contributions averaging $40 apiece. We’ve also spoken with thousands of Kansans across the state at town halls.
Want to know more? Browse a list of donors who have contributed $1,000 or more to our parent organization, States Newsroom, right here.
Let’s be clear about what we’re doing in this commentary section. I’m old enough to remember when almost all local and regional newspapers featured daily opinion pages. They included editorials and columns, many sharply questioning people in power. Several excellent Kansas news sites still run commentary, but the concept has come to seem old-fashioned or just too costly.
An unfortunate side effect has been to insulate public officials from public scrutiny. Masterson does not get a free pass because voters ticked his name in a box. Nor does any other lawmaker in Topeka.
If Masterson wants to search for new campaign taglines, perhaps he could look to the second paragraph of this column.
 “A public spectacle.”
“Misinformation and conspiracy.”
“Embarrassed himself.”
Just spitballing here!
Let’s hope the Senate president eventually comes to his senses — much like the raccoon sobered up under a veterinarian’s care — and sees Kansas Reflector for what it is. We’re Kansans writing about Kansas for Kansans. You don’t have to love what we do, but don’t question our commitment to publishing compelling news and commentary in the public interest.

Ohio’s Somali community, the second largest in the U.S. after Minnesota, is terrified Donald Trump’s crackdown on Somali immigrants in Minneapolis will spread to Columbus where an estimated 60,000 Somali Americans live. 
A surge in ICE activity and racial profiling targeting Somalis in the Twin Cities followed Trump’s racist rant last week against the entire Somali community in America that among them includes an overwhelming majority of U.S. citizens. 
Sit with that for a minute. 
The president of the United States openly trashed Americans of a certain ethnic and racial group in a vile attack that preceded increased federal government harassment of mostly Somali Americans in Minnesota.
Will Ohioans of Somali descent be next? 
Trump has insulted people from African (“s***hole”) countries before, but his latest outburst against Somali Americans was, as one account put it, “shocking in its unapologetic bigotry.”  
After nodding off during a lengthy Cabinet meeting dripping with Dear Leader adulation, the 79-year-old convicted felon lashed out at immigrants from the war-ravaged Horn of Africa nation. 
Trump called American citizens from Somalia “garbage” and vowed to deport them “back to where they came from” because “they contribute nothing” and “I don’t want them in our country.”  
His premier toady, Ohio’s shameless JD Vance, banged the table in emphatic concurrence. 
It was repulsive, if not unsurprising behavior from a man who notoriously demeaned and endangered legal Haitian immigrants revitalizing local economies in his home state. 
As the approving JD looked on, Trump heaped derision (again) on Minnesota Democrat Ilhan Omar, who immigrated from Somalia as a child, and called for the member of Congress to “be thrown the hell out” of the U.S. 
“We’re going the wrong way if we keep taking in garbage into our country. Ilhan Omar is garbage. Her friends are garbage.” 
There is no ambiguity about the message Trump is sending to the world when he disparages nonwhite immigrants in America while inviting affluent white South Afrikaners to emigrate here with U.S. support. 
Conversely, the most powerful man on the planet depicts Black Somali Americans as worthless freeloaders who threatened to destroy “our” country and wants them expelled. 
Never mind the taxpayers, doctors, lawyers, engineers, small business owners, politicians, etc., who are first- and second-generation Somali Americans contributing to their communities. 
Ismail Mohamed is one of them. 
He is a 33-year-old lawyer and one of two Somali Americans serving in the Ohio House as a state representative from Columbus.

The Democrat, in his second term, has been fielding urgent calls and texts from anxious constituents ever since Trump put Ohioans of Somali origin in the crosshairs of his wrath. 
People are gripped with fear, he said. 
“Especially those who don’t speak English, who fear going out. If they get picked up and can’t communicate, how are they going to relay that they are U.S. citizens?” asked Mohamed. 
“I am advising many to know their rights, make sure you have documents with you, the name of a lawyer.”
The young legislator was shaken by Trump’s hateful rhetoric about his community yet resolved. 
“We’re educating the community, but those in legal limbo as asylum seekers are worried. Even though you have legal status, a pending application, you’re at risk. When the president of the United States, the leader of the free world, attacks a community he knows is not in a position to fight back, it’s hard not to be scared.”
Mohamed, who was born in Somalia and lived as a refugee before coming to the U.S., is most concerned about the impact of Trump’s words and what they could trigger in someone who’s already on edge. 
“It’s easy for someone who’s a racist or bigot to pick up a gun and shoot at a local mosque or, God forbid, kill someone. We’ve seen that happen before in other states. We’ve seen an increase in hate crimes in Columbus. I’m careful, even as an elected myself.” 
The lawmaker recounted recent online attacks against him stemming from a video of him speaking Somali to his constituents. 
Posted blasts skewered an elected rep in the U.S. speaking a foreign language. 
Mohamed was unsettled when a Republican colleague in the Ohio House, state Rep. Jennifer Gross, actually reposted the video attacking him and added, “This is an Ohio State Representative. Thoughts?”  
Mohamed confided he had to have security for a period of time. 
Gross’ post has not been deleted.
Still, the refugee-turned-lawyer-turned-state representative reflected that every immigrant community in America has faced some initial pushback and hostility. 
“They’re not American enough, or their language is different, their food is weird.” 
But experiencing the ugliness firsthand, and from the president no less, is difficult to process said Mohamed. 
“It is still hard and painful when a young kid, a college kid, reaches out to you and says why is the president calling me garbage?”
It is a new low to try to explain or justify, he added. 
“You feel so angry and hurt. But we are appealing to everyone to say this is wrong, this is un-American to target and dehumanize an entire people simply for political gain. If it is Somali Americans now, it’ll be a different community next week. I hope Ohioans who are not Somali can just take a step back and imagine what is happening to us happening to them or their ancestors who were not welcomed.”

(Alex Wong/Getty Images)Critics of including private market investments, such as private equity, private credit, real estate and infrastructure, as options in 401(k)s are wrongly accusing these assets of being risky and opaque.
Higher diversification and risk-adjusted returns, coupled with transparent disclosures as required by securities and banking laws, will ensure that Nebraska employers receive the clarity required to evaluate these assets in accordance with their fiduciary duty to their employees.
The Trump administration’s Department of Labor (DOL) has been empowered by the president to open alternative investment options to all Americans, not just a select few public pension funds and wealthy individuals. Deputy Labor Secretary Keith Sonderling has led the charge to unlock private market investments for retirement savers, acknowledging that it behooves working Americans.
DOL plans to issue a rule that would let Nebraska’s private sector employers offer private market investments to their employees.
Allowing retirement savers to put a portion of their nest eggs in private market investments offers higher risk-adjusted returns and diversification. In one recent opinion piece in Pensions & Investments, two law professors discussed how private market investments can be safely incorporated into retirement plans.
In it, they argued, “[t]he Trump administration should be praised for democratizing access to alternative assets. Allowing employees to invest in private equity and other nontraditional assets can help diversify a retirement portfolio and reduce idiosyncratic risk.” The addition of private market investments to 401(k)s is a net positive for Nebraska’s private sector employees who want to save money using a tax-advantaged defined contribution retirement plan.
Working Nebraskans with 401(k) plans can benefit from exposure to private market investments. Over the course of a 20-year period, from 2003-2023, private equity returned 15.2% while the S&P 500 returned 9.7%. In August 2025, there were over 193,000 Nebraskans employed in the retail, wholesale, transportation and utility sectors. There were more than 176,000 Nebraskans employed in education and health services jobs.
Hundreds of thousands of these Nebraska workers, who likely have access to a 401(k) plan, would be directly impacted by the DOL’s actions and could benefit from higher risk-adjusted returns than those achieved by solely investing their retirement money in public stocks.
Despite the benefits, detractors try to label private market investments in 401(k)s as too risky for the populace. These naysayers are wrong on the merits.
Protections for retirement savers do not go away with the addition of private market investments. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) employs strict fiduciary standards of loyalty and prudence that compel asset managers and employers to conduct proper due diligence in selecting 401(k) offerings for employees.
President Trump’s executive order “does not alter ERISA’s uncompromising fiduciary standards,” according to a memo from attorneys who work in finance. Pundits who claim otherwise are misleading retirement savers and preventing them from increasing the size of their nest egg.
Detractors have also accused private market investments of lacking valuation transparency. These concerns are overblown. Federal law requires 401(k) assets to be valued at fair market value. Rules and regulations already in place mandate transparency for private market investments. This will ensure Nebraska’s private sector employees understand the full value of their retirement funds.
Private market investments will likely be packaged into target-date funds. If the target-date fund is set up as a mutual fund, it will be subject to rules under the Investment Company Act of 1940. This includes independent directors overseeing plan investments.
Private market investments incorporated into target-date funds that function as collective investment trusts (CITs) will be managed by a trustee and regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), which is housed in the Treasury Department.
They will also be governed by state banking authorities and subject to the fiduciary protections mandated under ERISA. Regardless of how the target-date fund is structured, private market investments will be subject to a litany of liquidity and disclosure requirements to provide Nebraska’s retirement savers with the needed security and transparency.
The benefit of target-date funds is that they allow employees to adjust their exposure to private market investments based on how close they are to retirement. Young professionals can start with a higher exposure to private market investments and see real wealth creation. According to the Council of Economic Advisers, “analysis by age group suggests that the younger age group will benefit the most from an allocation to PE on a risk-adjusted basis.”
The benefits of adding private market investments to 401(k) plans are clear. The Labor Department can usher in a new era of the modern retirement framework, offering higher risk-adjusted returns and diversification while also safeguarding Nebraska’s employees and providing transparent information to their employers. This new investment innovation provides the perfect pairing for building wealth for multiple generations.
John Murante served in the Nebraska Legislature from 2013 to 2019, as Nebraska State Treasurer from 2019 to 2023, and as director of the Nebraska Public Employees Retirement Systems from 2023 to 2024.

Even among experts the cost of water supplies is hard to pin down. A new study reveals huge differences in what water suppliers for cities and farms pay for water from rivers and reservoirs in California, Arizona and Nevada. 


California cities pay far more for water on average than districts that supply farms — with some urban water agencies shelling out more than $2,500 per acre-foot of surface water, and some irrigation districts paying nothing, according to new research. 
A report published today by researchers with the UCLA Institute of the Environment and Sustainability and advocates with the Natural Resources Defense Council shines a light on vast disparities in the price of water across California, Arizona and Nevada. 
The true price of water is often hidden from consumers. A household bill may reflect suppliers’ costs to build conduits and pump water from reservoirs and rivers to farms and cities. A local district may obtain water from multiple sources at different costs. Even experts have trouble deciphering how much water suppliers pay for the water itself.
The research team spent a year scouring state and federal contracts, financial reports and agency records to assemble a dataset of water purchases, transfers and contracts to acquire water from rivers and reservoirs. They compared vastly different water suppliers with different needs and geographies, purchasing water from delivery systems built at different times and paid for under different contracts.
Their overarching conclusion: One of the West’s most valuable resources has no consistent valuation – and sometimes costs nothing at all. 



Cities pay the highest prices for water. Look up what cities or irrigation districts in California, Nevada and Arizona pay for surface water in our interactive database at calmatters.org



“It costs money to move water around,” the report says, “but there is no cost, and no price signal, for the actual water.”
That’s a problem, the authors argue, as California and six other states in the Colorado River basin hash out how to distribute the river’s dwindling flows — pressed by federal ultimatums, and dire conditions in the river’s two major reservoirs. The study sounds the alarm that the price of water doesn’t reflect its growing scarcity and disincentivizes conservation.
“We’re dealing with a river system and water supply source that is in absolute crisis and is facing massive shortfalls … and yet we’re still treating this as if it’s an abundant, limitless resource that should be free,” said Noah Garrison, environmental science practicum director at UCLA and lead author on the study. 
Jeffrey Mount, senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California, applauded the research effort. Though he had not yet reviewed the report, he said complications abound, built into California’s water infrastructure itself and amplified by climate change. Moving, storing and treating water can drive up costs, and are only sometimes captured in the price. 
“We’ve got to be careful about pointing our fingers and saying farmers are getting a free ride,” Mount said. Still, he agreed that water is undervalued: “We do not pay the full costs of water — the full social, full economic and the full environmental costs of water.” 
Coastal cities pay the most
The research team investigated how much suppliers above a certain purchase threshold spend on water from rivers and reservoirs in California, Arizona and Nevada. 
They found that California water suppliers pay more than double on average than what Nevada districts pay for water, and seven times more than suppliers in Arizona. 
The highest costs span the coast between San Francisco and San Diego, which the researchers attributed to the cost of delivery to these regions and water transfers that drive up the price every time water changes hands. 
“In some of those cases it’s almost a geographic penalty for California, that there are larger conveyance or transport and infrastructure needs, depending on where the districts are located,” Garrison said. 
Agricultural water districts pay the least
In California, according to the authors, cities pay on average 20 times more than water suppliers for farms — about $722 per acre foot, compared to $36. 
One acre foot can supply roughly 11 Californians for a year, according to the state’s Department of Water Resources. 
Five major agricultural suppliers paid nothing to the federal government for nearly 4 million acre-feet of water, including three in California that receive Colorado River water: the Imperial Irrigation District, the Coachella Valley Water District and the Palo Verde Irrigation District. 
Tina Anderholt Shields, water manager for the Imperial Irrigation District, which receives the single largest share of Colorado River water, said the district’s contract with the U.S. government does not require any payment for the water. 
Cities, by contrast, received less than 40,000 acre-feet of water for $0. The report notes, however, that the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, a major urban water importer, spends only 25 cents an acre-foot for around 850,000 acre-feet of water from the Colorado River. 
Bill Hasencamp, manager of Colorado River resources at Metropolitan, said that the true cost of this water isn’t reflected in the 25-cent fee, because the expense comes from moving it. By the time the Colorado River water gets to the district, he said it costs several hundred dollars.
Plus, he added, the district pays for hydropower, which helps cover the costs of the dams storing the water supply. “That enables us to only pay 25 cents an acre foot to the feds on the water side, because we’re paying Hoover Dam costs on the power side.”
Federal supplies are the cheapest; transfers drive up costs
Much of the difference among water prices across three states comes down to source: those whose supplies come from federally managed rivers, reservoirs, aqueducts and pumps pay far less on average than those receiving water from state managed distribution systems or via water transfers. 
Garrison and his team proposed adding a $50 surcharge per acre-foot of cheap federal supplies to help shore up the infrastructure against leaks and losses or pay for large-scale conservation efforts without tapping into taxpayer dollars. 
But growers say that would devastate farming in California. 
“It’s important to note that the ‘value’ of water is priceless,” said Allison Febbo, General Manager of Westlands Water District, which supplies San Joaquin Valley farms. The report calculates that the district pays less than $40 per acre foot for water from the federal Central Valley Project, though the Westlands rate structure notes another $14 fee to a restoration fund. “The consequences of unaffordable water can be seen throughout our District: fallowed fields, unemployment, decline in food production…”
The Imperial Irrigation District’s Shields said that a surcharge would be inconsistent with their contract, difficult to implement, and unworkable for growers. 
“It’s not like farmers can just pass it on to their buyers and then have that roll down to the consumer level where it might be ‘manageable,’” Shields said.
The most expensive water in California is more than $2,800 an acre-foot
The most expensive water in California, Arizona or Nevada flows from the rivers of Northern California, down California’s state-managed system of aqueducts and pumps, to the San Gorgonio Pass Water Agency in Riverside County. Total cost, according to the report: $2,870.21 per acre foot. 
Lance Eckhart, the agency’s general manager, said he hadn’t spoken to the study’s authors but that the number sounded plausible. The price tag would make sense, he said, if it included contributing to the costs for building and maintaining the 705-mile long water delivery system, as well as for the electricity needed to pump water over mountains. 
Eckhart compared the water conveyance to a railroad, and his water agency to a distant, distant stop. “We’re at the end, so we have the most railroad track to pay for, and also the most energy costs to get it down here,” he said. 
Because it took decades for construction of the water delivery system to reach San Gorgonio Pass, the water agency built some of those costs into local property taxes before the water even arrived, rather than into the water bills for the cities and towns they supply. As a result, its mostly municipal customers pay only $399 per acre foot, Eckhart said. 
“You can’t build it into rates if you’re not going to see your first gallon for 40 years,” Ekhart said. 
The study didn’t interrogate how the wholesale price of imported water translates to residential bills. Water managers point out that cheap supplies like groundwater can help dilute the costs of pricey imported water. 
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, for instance, purchases water imported from the Colorado River and Northern California to fill gaps left by local groundwater stores, supplies from the Owens Valley, and other locally managed sources, said Marty Adams, the utility’s former general manager. (The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power was unable to provide an interview.)
Because the amount of water needed can vary from year to year, it’s added as an additional charge on top of the base rate, Adams said. “If you have to pay for purchased water somewhere, when you add all the numbers up, it comes out in that total,” he said. 
“The purchased water becomes the wildcard all the time.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/121025-Colorado-River-DM-Getty-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-11 03:56:22.838723

A Program Designed for Comfort and Care
The Facility Dog Program pairs specially trained dogs with Capitol Police officers who serve as their handlers. Dogs like Vinn, Delaware’s first facility dog, are taught more than 40 commands — including calming pressure therapy — and are certified through Assistance Dogs International (ADI).
Vinn arrived in Delaware in October 2022 through Canine Companions, a national nonprofit that trains service dogs for law-enforcement, judicial and medical programs across the country. Since then, Vinn has been deployed to assist victims during testimony, reduce anxiety in sensitive interviews, and provide comfort during Protection From Abuse hearings and trial preparation.
How the Program Works
Facility dogs are available to support:


Victims providing testimony in court


Children participating in interviews


Families and witnesses preparing for trial


Individuals involved in emotionally charged hearings


Anyone connected to an active case may request support through the Delaware Courts website: courts.delaware.gov/aoc/facilitydog.aspx
Capitol Police officers assigned as handlers undergo specialized training to ensure the dogs are deployed appropriately during judicial proceedings. The animals remain calm, quiet and focused in courtroom settings — offering emotional reassurance without disrupting proceedings.
Statewide Impact
The expansion of the program brings its services to the Leonard L. Williams Justice Center in Wilmington, the Kent County Courthouse in Dover and the Sussex County Courthouse in Georgetown.
Officials say the program is particularly impactful for children, survivors of domestic violence and families dealing with traumatic events. Research has shown that the presence of a facility dog can reduce stress hormones, stabilize breathing and help individuals communicate more clearly during testimony.
“By bringing this program statewide, we’re ensuring equal access to emotional support for anyone who needs it in any Delaware courthouse,” Capitol Police said.
A Calmer, More Compassionate Court Experience
Courtrooms can be intimidating — especially for those reliving painful events. Delaware’s Facility Dog Program is designed to bridge that emotional gap, making the justice system more humane without altering legal procedures.
As the program grows, Capitol Police say more dogs may be added to the roster, expanding availability for high-volume court days and sensitive cases.
Key Takeaway
The expansion of the Facility Dog Program marks a milestone in Delaware’s commitment to trauma-informed justice. By blending law enforcement expertise with compassionate canine support, the state is offering vulnerable residents a calmer path through the legal system — one paw at a time.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/capital-dog-program.webp,,,2025-12-11 12:58:47.053223
,California,2025-12-11 05:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,"Crime is down and kids are back, but drugs still plague Los Angeles’ MacArthur Park",Jim Newton,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/12/los-angeles-macarthur-park-cleanup/,"After a year of effort — and despite ICE’s military theatrics — L.A.’s iconic MacArthur Park is just beginning to regain some of its mojo.  It still struggles with drugs and homelessness, though.","A year ago, vendors had set up shop across the street from MacArthur Park in Los Angeles. They were dealing drugs and stolen goods from underneath makeshift tables at their stands. 
Langer’s, the neighborhood’s historic deli, was threatening to leave for good. And assaults in the area were on the rise.
Today crime is down in MacArthur Park, Langer’s is staying, and the drug vendors are gone — or at least displaced.
That’s the good news about the city’s yearlong attempt to bring safety and tranquility to MacArthur Park and its surrounding neighborhoods. There is progress.
The bad news is that the area remains blighted and filthy. 
A walk through the park Monday morning found evidence of progress: most spaces were relatively clean and a couple young boys scurried around on the playground equipment, their watchful dads nearby. 
But there were also painful reminders of how far this area has to go. 
Stores along Alvarado Street were open, but customers were sparse. Litter filled spaces where fences keep out street vendors. Water from recent rains congealed beneath an underpass, forming a dank, dirty pool. And young men lay glassy-eyed on benches, staring vacantly, their mouths agape.
The city’s campaign to restore MacArthur Park to some of its long-faded glory has within it some elements of the larger work Los Angeles itself faces. The park is a congregation point for unhoused men and women, it is a locus of drug sales and it sits amid one of the city’s most heavily migrant communities. 
It is, in all those respects, Los Angeles in microcosm. Its struggles are those of the larger city, and of urban America itself.
Recognizing that, city leaders focused attention on MacArthur Park in 2025, pouring money and resources into the area. Council member Eunisses Hernandez, whose district includes the park, cites $27 million in city investments in what she describes as “care first” programs that address drug overdoses, housing crises and conflicts between gangs. 
Those investments have resulted in quantifiable results: the removal of more than 36,000 pieces of hazardous waste, including needles and other drug paraphernalia; distribution of more than 17,000 doses of Narcan; cleaned sidewalks; painted curbs and dozens of residents housed.
In some cases, those interventions have literally saved lives. The council member’s office said 138 overdoses have been reversed by crews assigned to walk the parks and be alert for danger.
It’s thus heartening to see at least glimmers of progress. 
The fences installed in early 2025 succeeded in boxing out vendors who were using the neighborhood to sell drugs and stolen goods. The increased police patrols helped chase off some local dealers and pushed some of the open drug use outside the perimeters of the park. 
Those successes are directly attributable to city interventions by Hernandez and others. But the larger goal remains elusive.

This is not a community at peace, nor has it turned the corner from blight into prosperity.
The streets smell of urine, and the air wafts a scent of weed and other drugs. The litter is degrading. 
The overall effect is one of exhaustion. Storekeepers don’t look at drug users with compassion or a desire to help. They shoo them away from storefronts, tired of their smell and grime. 
All of which serves as a reminder that this is hard work, that solutions to drugs or homelessness are not pulled from a shelf and rolled out into neighborhoods, that even $27 million of city investment does not change a community overnight. 
Money and effort are essential to progress, but they do not guarantee it. Only commitment, work and time can be truly transformative.

It’s tough sledding under the best circumstances, and these are hardly the best. That’s at least in part because the federal government — which could have been a useful partner in this work — has chosen to be an active subverter of it.
It was here that President Donald Trump and his coiffed minion, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, chose to launch their summer assault on immigrants. On July 7, ICE agents, complete with a Blackhawk helicopter and horses (yes, horses), swarmed through and above the park, flashing their faux military gear and shouting at pedestrians.
The resulting theater accomplished precisely nothing in terms of the goals ICE set for itself — rounding up the “worst of the worst” and sending them back to home countries — but it produced two other results: It chased migrants indoors, where they have been sheltering ever since, and it smoothed a political path for Mayor Karen Bass, who had been foundering up to that point but has since redefined her political identity as the city’s bulwark against Trump and his mean-spirited nonsense.
And so the work to make MacArthur Park safer abruptly became a showcase for city and national politics, not to mention a preview of the unrest that Trump has spent the rest of the year provoking in other cities — Washington, D.C.; Portland; Chicago; New Orleans. Each has had a turn in the barrel, and each can point to Los Angeles as the testing ground for the new authoritarianism Trump has brought to America’s cities.
In the meantime, however, the sight of ICE agents stomping around in the park was enough to chase some immigrants and others who merely “look illegal” indoors. That has left neighborhoods feeling tense and deserted. Last week, the normally bustling health clinic at the corner of Westlake and 6th Street had just one family in the waiting room. 
Looking back on the year, neither Bass nor Police Chief Jim McDonnell was willing to declare victory in MacArthur Park. In separate interviews, each acknowledged that the chain link fences that disrupted illegal vending have become unsightly and should be viewed as temporary fixtures, not permanent installations.

“They served their purpose,” Bass said, adding that the city intends to soon replace them with planters or other fixtures. 
Both mayor and chief were pleased to see crime coming down in the area, but both recognize that the park is unfinished work. “It’s been overall good,” Bass said, “but it’s up and down.”
Next year may bring a new emphasis on design solutions. In addition to planters along Alvarado, Hernandez has suggested blocking Wilshire Boulevard as it passes through the park, restoring the area to its original configuration. 
And the councilmember and mayor jointly endorsed a proposal to develop a fence that would surround all of MacArthur Park, regulating flow in and out, rather than simply having park visitors spill onto the sidewalks, as so many drug users do today.
Not all of the neighbors love that idea – there’s very little that everyone in this community agrees on – but it offers a chance for some decorative enhancement in an area bereft of much. The fence is being designed now and could go up next year. If so, it will be the latest effort in this arduous work.
“It is,” Bass said, “a long process.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/102325-MacArthur-Park-GETTY-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-11 08:56:12.149015

Leaders made Latinos scapegoats and deported immigrants and some US citizens.","Guest Commentary written by

Sylvia Zamora
Sylvia Zamora is a sociologist at Loyola Marymount University and author of Racial Baggage: Mexican Immigrants and Race Across the Border.


My college students are always shocked when they learn that the U.S. deported an estimated 1.8 million people to Mexico in the 1930s, including some who had never stepped foot in the country.  
But this year marked the first time I couldn’t offer my usual conclusion: that the mass repatriation during the Hoover Administration represented a singular and unprecedented violation of constitutional rights. Instead, I had to acknowledge—somberly—that the nation is once again deporting Latino immigrants, including U.S. citizens.
Since I started teaching “Latino L.A.” seven years ago, my central objective has been to help my first-year students — the majority of whom come to my classroom with little to no background in Latino history — connect the past to the world they’re living in right now. 
My lesson about the 1930s deportation campaign — L.A. County officials referred to it as a “Mexican Repatriation” to make the “return home” sound legal, voluntary, and benevolent — became especially pertinent in this context. 
During the Great Depression, politicians struggling to respond to the economic crisis needed a scapegoat, and racialized ideas of who belonged in America and who did not. They made Mexican communities convenient targets. In Los Angeles, where 7.6% of residents were Latino, political leaders began suggesting that Mexican laborers were taking American jobs and burdening public resources. Deporting Mexicans would “open positions for needy citizens,” L.A. County Supervisor H. M. Blaine declared. The Depression would end if only the “aliens would go away.”  
Lecturing to my students about this history, I underscored how economic precarity and xenophobic racism intersected to broaden public support for the mass expulsion. Those same forces are re-emerging as the Trump administration harnesses widespread financial insecurity alongside a persistent narrative that immigrants are to blame. Now, as before, officials are advancing an idealized vision of the U.S. as fundamentally and normatively white. The mass removal of immigrants of color has never been about controlling any so-called immigration crisis, I told my students, but about a desire to shape who gets to count as an American.
Like today’s ICE, Depression-era INS agents indiscriminately rounded up Mexicans, presuming they were here illegally. In Los Angeles, they targeted parks, hospitals, and work sites in Mexican communities, demanding proof of citizenship. High-profile raids and media campaigns announcing impending roundups served as tools of intimidation, creating widespread fear that led to “voluntary” deportation via free one-way train tickets to Mexico. Entire families carrying only a few belongings boarded trains at Union Station, some never to return to the U.S. County officials and social workers went door to door, threatening cuts to welfare aid and heightening panic among working families who worried they would fall into extreme poverty.
I want my class to see the evils of then and now. But I also want to instill in them a sense of hope and agency. We discussed multiple resistance efforts that pushed back against mass deportation during the 1930s. Here in Los Angeles, media, churches, and charitable organizations provided critical help. La Opinion warned about neighborhood sweeps. The liberal Los Angeles Record publicly exposed dodgy arrests: “handcuffs instead of warrant[s],” the paper reported. Catholic churches raised funds to give to local families. L.A.’s bar association condemned constitutional rights violations. The Mexican Consulate helped provide community aid and legal defense.

Deportations never truly ended, but by 1934, they quietly tapered off as FDR’s administration shifted political priorities and the New Deal offered economic relief. Community resistance played a crucial role by bringing the lawless raids out into the open — abuses that might otherwise have remained hidden.
I hope my class helps students discern what makes this moment unprecedented, and what is a cycle in history, repeating itself. I want them to understand that while deportations have never stopped, it is not normal to see armed, masked men dragging people into unmarked vehicles. It is not normal for the government to detain people in unknown locations, without arrests or trials. 
I also want them to see how daily acts of survival and organized resistance — 100 years ago and today — are proof that Latinos refuse to accept dehumanization. And the Latino community in L.A. is now more resilient than ever before. Around us, grassroots activists organize neighborhood patrols and nonprofit organizations lead “Know Your Rights campaigns,” elected representatives and immigration attorneys provide legal and moral support, and journalists and social media document ICE activity.  
“A major difference today,” I told my class, “is that Latinos are the majority in Los Angeles. And we’re not going anywhere.”

It was a series of black bars representing the death toll on California’s roads in each of the past 20 years. 
Fatalities had been falling until 2010, when the bars started getting longer and longer. A blood-red arrow shot up over the growing lines, charting their rise, as if to make sure nobody could miss the more than 60% increase in deaths. 
“We are working to reverse the overall trend,” Tavares said.
No legislators asked about the chart. No one asked the director what, exactly, his agency was doing about it.
Over the next three hours, the Senate Transportation Committee members asked instead about homeless encampments along roads, gas tax revenue, gender identity on ID’s and planning for the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles. 
The chart presented by then-CalTrans Director Tony Tavares at the March 11, 2025 Senate Transportation Committee hearing. 
The committee chair said it was the legislature’s first informational hearing on the state’s transportation system in more than a decade. Yet only two senators — both Republicans with little legislative power in a state controlled by Democrats — even asked about dangerous driving, one following up with questions about a deadly stretch of road in her district and the other about a small California Highway Patrol program to target egregious behavior behind the wheel.

Over the past decade, nearly 40,000 people have died and more than 2 million have been injured on California roads. As an ongoing CalMatters investigation has shown this year, time and again those crashes were caused by repeat drunk drivers, chronic speeders and motorists with well-documented histories of recklessness behind the wheel. Year after year, officials with the power to do something about it — the governor, legislators, the courts, the Department of Motor Vehicles — have failed to act. 
The silence, in the face of a threat that endangers nearly every Californian, is damning.
California has some of the weakest DUI laws in the nation. Here, DUI-related deaths have been rising more than twice as fast as the rest of the country. But this fall, a state bill to strengthen DUI penalties was gutted at the last minute. 
When it comes to speeding — one of the biggest causes of fatal crashes — again the legislature has done little. For two years in a row, bills that would have required the use of speed-limiting technology on vehicles have failed.
Lawmakers did pass legislation a couple years ago that allows the use of speed cameras. But it’s just a pilot project in a handful of jurisdictions.
Marc T. Vukcevich, director of state policy for advocacy group Streets For All, considers it a win — but a modest one.
“This shit is not enough to deal with the size and severity and the complexity of the problem we have when it comes to violence on our roadways,” Vukcevich said.

Gov. Gavin Newsom declined an interview request. Last year, he vetoed a bill that would have required technology that alerts drivers when they’re speeding.  
The state DMV, which is under his authority, has wide latitude to take dangerous drivers off the road. But it routinely allows drivers with extreme histories of dangerous driving to continue to operate on our roadways, where many go on to kill. 
Steve Gordon, whom Newsom chose to run the agency in 2019, won’t talk about it. He has declined or ignored CalMatters requests for an interview. 
The agency simply released a statement from him in March, after our first interview request, touting modernization efforts that reflect an “ongoing commitment to enhancing accountability and transparency while continually refining our processes to ensure California’s roads are safer for everyone.”
Neither Newsom nor Gordon has announced any major changes since then.
How a bill to fight DUIs fails in Sacramento
For a brief moment earlier this year, Colin Campbell thought the state might finally do something about the scourge that changed his life one night in 2019.
A repeat drunk driver slammed into his Prius on the way to the family’s new home in Joshua Tree, killing his 17-year-old daughter, Ruby, and 14-year-old son, Hart.
Campbell, a writer and director from Los Angeles, began advocating for California to join most other states and create a law requiring in-car breathalyzers for anyone convicted of a DUI.
At first he was encouraged when the bill coasted through two legislative committees. But then came the roadblocks. 
The ACLU opposed the measure, calling it “a form of racialized wealth extraction,” according to a Senate Public Safety Committee report from July. In California, people forced to use the devices have to pay about $100 a month to a private company to rent them, though there’s supposed to be a sliding fee scale based on income. 
Then the DMV told lawmakers that it could not “complete the necessary programming” for the law, citing possible technology delays and costs of $15 million or more. 
The bill was gutted. California couldn’t do something that nearly three dozen other states could. 
Campbell called the sudden reversal a shameful example of forsaking public safety for bureaucracy.
“Our lives were destroyed that night,” he said. “If these people’s children had been killed by a drunk driver, there is no way they would be objecting to this.”
Even if the law had passed, DMV data suggests that California judges would have mostly ignored it.
State law says judges have to require in-car breathalyzers for people convicted of repeat DUIs. Last month, the DMV issued a report reinforcing what a similar report laid out two years earlier. Judges across the state ordered the devices just one-third of the time for repeat offenders.  In 14 counties, they ordered the devices less than 10% of the time for second-time DUI offenders. The counties are: Alameda, Colusa, Glenn, Lassen, Los Angeles, Madera, Mono, Plumas, Sacramento, San Luis Obispo, Santa Cruz, Sierra, Tulare and Yuba.
DMV officials did not answer questions about what, if anything, the agency was doing about it.
We reached out to all 14 counties’ courts. Only eight responded to questions. 
Chris Ruhl, executive officer for the Glenn County Superior Court, said the court is looking at local changes.
“Given the light CalMatters is bringing to this issue … the Glenn Court will review its current DUI sentencing practices,” according to a statement.
Glenn was one of a number of counties — including LA, Alameda and San Luis Obispo — that also suggested it wasn’t their judges’ responsibility to issue a court order. They said they only needed to notify the DMV of the convictions. 
However, the law is clear: It’s the judge’s job to order the offender to use the device, said Jerry Hill, the retired Bay Area Democrat who wrote the bill. 
When he worked in the Capitol, Hill said he also saw little urgency to rein in intoxicated driving. 
“If you ask any legislator, they are going to say it’s a terrible, terrible thing,” he said. 
But he said committee chairs and staff members who set the tone and write analyses often shied away from increasing criminal penalties. 
“That’s where we see a lack of understanding, in my view, of the devastating effect of drunk driving in California,” he said.
Lawmakers say next session could bring change
A number of lawmakers said they are aware of the carnage on our roadways and plan to do something about it this coming legislative session, maybe. 
Sen. Bob Archuleta, a Democrat from Norwalk who sits on the Transportation Committee, lost his granddaughter to a drunk driver just before Christmas last year. He said he recently met with representatives from Mothers Against Drunk Driving and is considering possible bills.
“This is not a Republican issue, a Democrat issue, an independent issue — or political issue. This is a life-saving issue,” he said. “We should all take it as seriously as the family that lost a loved one.”
Democratic Assemblymember Nick Schultz of Burbank said he is considering introducing at least one measure next year to address loopholes and weaknesses in state law. 
Schultz, who started his career prosecuting DUI cases in Oregon and now chairs the Assembly’s Public Safety Committee, said he is weighing several potential measures that would address issues CalMatters highlighted in its reporting this year, including lengthening license suspensions after fatal crashes, lowering the bar to charge repeat drunk drivers with a felony, strengthening breathalyzer requirements and making sure vehicular manslaughter convictions get reported to the DMV.
“People are tired of seeing the needless loss of life on our roadways,” Schultz said. “There’s no way to legislatively make someone make the right choice. But what we can do is create an incentive structure where there are consequences for bad decisions.”
In the absence of more leadership at the state level, road safety advocates — many of whom joined the cause after losing a loved one to a preventable car crash — are taking it on themselves to try to force change. They’re meeting with lawmakers and officials, holding public events, telling their stories.

Jennifer Levi started working with MADD after her son, Braun, was killed in May while he was out walking with friends in Manhattan Beach. She said they’d only recently relocated to the area after the family home burned down in the Palisades fire, destroying “all of Braun’s pictures, videos from when he was born.”
The driver who killed her son was allegedly intoxicated and had a prior DUI arrest.
“The worst day of my life is now my life’s work. I will not stop until California changes,” Levi said.
In the months since her son’s death, Levi said, she’s met with any officials or influential people she could — current and former lawmakers, district attorneys, local council members, a lobbyist, and members of the media. Among the changes she wants: to make it easier to charge repeat DUI offenders with murder when they kill someone, to make fatal DUIs a violent felony and to increase penalties for hit-and-run fatalities. As CalMatters reported in October, California law often treats drunken vehicular manslaughter as a nonviolent crime with minimal time behind bars. 
Levi calls her push to reform the system “Braun’s Bill.”
Many grieving families share a similar goal: for those they lost to be remembered by a state and society that seem indifferent. That desire was on display last month during an event in Sacramento to mark the World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims.
On a cold Sunday evening in mid-November, after a break in the rain, dozens of relatives of people killed in car crashes gathered on the dark steps of the state Capitol for a candlelight vigil. They fought to keep photos on posterboards upright in the gale-force winds. Family by family, they ascended the steps, stood above a display of orange cones lit with strands of white lights and addressed the onlookers, talking about their loved ones and what was lost — children left without their mother, mothers without their children, a wife left without the love of her life.
“Every day I live and I wake up and I pretend like I’m happy. Every day I wish my stairs would make noise. I miss being called mom,” said Angel Dela Cruz, whose 17-year-old son Edward Alvidrez Jr. was hit by a truck while riding a dirt bike in Madera County in 2022.
“I hope we all get justice,” she said.
The event ended with a moment of quiet reflection and a prayer before the families put away their pictures and walked off, the Capitol behind them locked, silent.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/072319-Steve-Gordon-DMV-AP-CM-bw-texture.jpg?fit=1024%2C672&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-11 08:56:12.149015

We hunt for a good place to hide the gifts we’ve acquired for our family and friends. We seek some semblance of holiday cheer amid the tumult of the day.
That’s why I’m happy to tell you that something that’s long been hidden has reappeared recently: the Lost Springs of the Ocklawaha.
No need to search for them. They’re right out in plain view — for a little while.
Most Floridians don’t even know they exist. Yet there are 20 or so, with names like “Cannon Spring,“ “Bright Angel Spring,” and “Tobacco Patch Spring.”
They’re not on any road maps. Unlike a lot of Florida’s springs, they’re not part of any state or national park. They might be considered part of a national forest.
You can’t see the lost springs unless the Florida Department of Environmental Protection conducts a procedure known as a “drawdown.” That’s when the lost springs re-emerge, and you can not only see them, but you can also visit and even swim in them.

There’s a drawdown going on right now, so charter captain Karen Chadwick took her boat out to renew her acquaintance with the lost springs. When she sees them flowing, she told me, “It’s the most beautiful place in the world.”
Margaret Ross Tolbert via screen grab
“It’s just incredible,” agreed her friend Margaret Ross Tolbert, a Gainesville artist whose paintings often feature Florida springs. “I’m always amazed at how they can bounce back.”
Just last week, Gov. Ron DeSantis was bragging at a Tampa press conference about Florida’s springs, but his words sounded hollow.
“We have the best springs of anywhere in the country,” he said.
If DeSantis really loved our springs the way he pretends to, he’d help the lost springs stay found. But so far, he hasn’t done it.
When the drawdown ends in March, those springs will get lost all over again. If that happens, it will be his fault.
What we’ve lost
In 1971, Elizabeth Abbott of the University of Florida’s Department of Geology wrote a report on these springs.
Here’s how the report described Blue Spring No. 1: “The spring was perfect for those wanting to get away from it all. It was privately owned for many years but always open for public use — swimming and fishing, as well as picnicking and camping.”
The spring’s natural beauty was exceeded only by its natural bounty, Abbott wrote.
“The most discriminating of seasoned fishermen marveled at the quality of fish [in] Blue Springs — not to mention the quantity,” she wrote. “Freshwater mullet and catfish swam like giant denizens convoyed by nervous bream, but the large bass was the most sought-after catch.”
Cannon Springs right now, via Margaret Tolbert
Further along, at Cannon Springs, she wrote, “The forest here is perhaps the most beautiful of all the river. It is a low hammock type with a mixture of palms and hardwoods. The cry of the limpkin is a noisy and interesting distraction.”
Orange Spring, she reported, is a sulfur spring, “with a walled-in circular pool about 75 feet across. The boil is about 18 feet deep. … The sulfur is said to be organic in origin.”
She credited the river’s many springs with swelling the flow of the river itself, as well as maintaining its water’s purity. It’s not mentioned in the report, but those springs were probably popular with manatees, which once used the Ocklawaha to migrate to the St. Johns River. I’m sure the early settlers and Native Americans who found the springs regarded them as pure magic.
Thus, to sum up, the springs were popular for recreation, provided habitat for a wide variety of wildlife, and helped maintain the river’s flow and purity.

“They were pretty well used by the local people in that area,” historian Steve Noll told me. “They were full of fish, too.”
No wonder that when they’re uncovered, people flock to the river to see them anew. Too bad they’re not available but for a few months every few years, due to one of the stupidest public works projects ever attempted.
Digging our grave
The Ocklawaha was once a river of dreams. But then came the Army Corps of Engineers to turn it into a nightmare.
The reason you can’t see these 20 or so springs year-round is because they’re inundated by the Rodman Reservoir. That 17,000-acre artificial body of water was created in 1968 when the Corps built the controversial Kirkpatrick Dam.
The dam is a 7,200-foot-long structure that impounded 16 miles of the 80-mile river, drowning a chunk of the Ocala National Forest.
It was built as part of the idiotic Cross-Florida Barge Canal. The canal was an 19th century idea built in the 20th, an attempt to slice a shortcut across the Florida peninsula for ships — even though, by then, most freight was being carried by trains and trucks.
Opponents could see what a disaster this canal would be. It wasn’t just that by damming the Ocklawaha, the corps would end a popular waterway connection between Silver Springs and the St. Johns River.
The excavation would also cut into the aquifer that supplies most of Florida’s fresh water, allowing salt water to intrude. The Corps was digging Florida’s grave.

The fight to stop it was funded by John Couse, a well-to-do air conditioning contractor who owned a home near Cannon Springs, said historian David Tegeder, who with Noll wrote “Ditch of Dreams: The Cross Florida Barge Canal and the Future of Florida.”
Crouse became involved after seeing the Army mowing down trees using a tank-like machine called the Crawler-Crusher, which did exactly what its name said. Seeing the damage done around the spring gave him a reason to fight.
The canal’s opponents won a temporary injunction. Their efforts got the attention of President Richard Nixon, who canceled construction of the canal.
Now the former canal route is a 110-mile linear greenway for hikers, bikers, and horseback riders named for the canal’s most vocal opponent, scientist-turned-activist Marjorie Harris Carr.
Unfortunately, every effort Carr and others after her have made to rip out the dam has been thwarted.

Dead Lakes and dammed river
Some people want to keep the reservoir intact. They fear what will happen to the fishing if the dam goes away. I point those folks to the story of the Dead Lakes dam in the Panhandle.
After a three-year drought kept the Dead Lakes too low for fishing, the Legislature approved putting a dam on the Chipola River. Built in 1960, the 18-foot-tall dam was supposed to boost fishing by maintaining high water levels.
When the dam was new, fish corralled in the reservoir became easier to catch. Over time, though, the reservoir clogged with silt and weeds. Soon the remaining fish were so small they were hardly worth catching.
In 1987, the state removed the dam, allowing the natural lake level to return. Fisheries biologists studied the Dead Lakes for years afterward and found they were now healthier. There were more and bigger fish. And there were twice as many kinds, too.

That’s why I think the anglers shouldn’t resist restoring the Ocklawaha. They should embrace it — assuming it ever happens.
The most recent effort to remove the Rodman dam happened last year. The Legislature voted to spend $500,000 for an updated study of ripping out the decrepit old dam and freeing the Ocklawaha. The last such study was nearly 30 years ago.
The new study was supposed to be done by the University of Florida Water Institute — not exactly a fly-by-night outfit. It was intended to provide legislators with up-to-date information so they could make an informed decision about the dam.
To everyone’s surprise, DeSantis vetoed the money. He became the first governor from either party since the ’70s to actively oppose restoration of the Ocklawaha. He offered no explanation, either
The springs and the cypress trees that were drowned by the reservoir stayed covered.
Until two months ago.
The drawdown
Every four or five years, the DEP has to draw down the reservoir, lowering its water level. They do this to clear out the aquatic plants that clog the system.
Nina Bhattacharyya via Florida Defenders
The current drawdown began in October, according to Nina Bhattacharyya, now executive director of Carr’s organization, Florida Defenders of the Environment.
“We are encouraging people to get out there and get a glimpse of what a restored river would look like,” Bhattacharyya told me.
The alteration in the waterway is dramatic. With the water lowered, you can see all the cypress stumps from the national forest. As for the springs, they’ve been jolted back to life.
“Any time one of these happens, people rush out to see the lost springs,” Bhattacharyya said.
One of the people who rushed out was Ryan Worthington, whose Instagram account is called “The Florida Excursionist” and who co-hosts a podcast called “The Florida Madcaps.”

“I went out to Cannon and to Tobacco Patch,” he said. “A lot of the others are small in size and back in the woods so they’re hard to get to. Cannon has the best flow and there are a lot of sunfish and other aquatic life in it.”
Tolbert has been out, too. She compared one of the uncovered springs to a volcano, suddenly producing eruptions of water gushing from beneath the earth.
The last time there was a drawdown, Tolbert was moved to film a 40-minute documentary called “Lost Springs: An Artist’s Journey Into Florida’s Abandoned Springs.” It was directed by Matt Keene, who’s also done a movie called “River Be Dammed.”
“You have to keep returning because they’re so unbelievable,” Tolbert says in the documentary. “Yet there they are, something that would only seem to exist in your dreams.”
Now let me tell you about something I dream about.
Finding the courage
In my dream, the drawdown never ends. The springs are never hidden. They remain out in the open, available for anyone who wants to swim in them or toss in a fishing line.
But what if it wasn’t a dream? The drawdown is scheduled to be over in March. But it doesn’t have to be. There’s no law that says the DEP has to return all that water to the reservoir.
What if DeSantis issued an executive order that told DEP, “Don’t put the reservoir back”? What if he decided to copy what happened with the Dead Lakes and restore the landscape?
Think about it. During his two terms, he’s repeatedly messed up this state’s natural resources. He built a polluting immigrant detention camp in the Big Cypress National Preserve. He tried to build golf courses in Jonathan Dickinson State Park. He’s refused to crack down on polluters and instead has spent millions in tax dollars to clean up their messes for them.
In fact, his DEP has repeatedly failed to comply with a state law requiring new rules for stopping the damage to our springs.
Last week, when he was talking about how wonderful our springs are, he was announcing plans to spend millions more on cleaning up pollution. What he didn’t mention is that his DEP will continue turning a blind eye to what the polluters are doing.
I tried repeatedly to get DeSantis’ spokesfolks to comment on the Rodman drawdown, or to explain why he vetoed the money for studying the aging dam. As usual, his staff wouldn’t even acknowledge my inquiries. 
This is a guy who always says the buck stops somewhere else. When a reporter asked him last week why he voted to give a shady campaign contributor $83 million for a 4-acre parcel in Destin that wasn’t on anyone’s preservation list, he repeatedly tried to shift the blame. In three minutes, he blamed someone else six times.
If DeSantis is searching for a way to redeem himself and leave a better legacy than the one he has now, this is it. Here’s hoping he’s able to find the courage to save the lost springs.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Save-the-Lost-Springs-banner-at-Blue-Spring-2025-by-Karen-Chadwick.jpeg,,,2025-12-11 00:56:11.558347
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-11 05:02:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Nursing IS a profession,U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/11/nursing-is-a-profession/,The U.S. Education Dept. exclusion of nursing as a professional occupation is a disgrace.,"As this headline from Newsweek magazine reports, a few weeks ago, the U.S. Department of Education issued probably the most out of touch, offensive new rule in the history of the Department, excluding nursing from its definition of professional occupations, part of its new graduate student loan program, which was created by the One Big Ugly Bill.
For the 4.7 million actively registered nurses and the 250,000 students enrolled in bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral nursing programs across the United States, this decree that they are not professionals is both a disgraceful insult that shocks the conscience and an order which will condemn America’s nurses into second class status for federal graduate student loan assistance.

U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney

This legal demotion is happening at a time when our country is experiencing a nursing shortage. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that we have 195,000 unfilled nursing positions in this country. The Department of Health and Human Services goes even higher. It says it’s 280,000. McKinsey and Company, a respected [consulting firm], predicts that by the end of this decade, the shortage will grow to 400,000.
But members of the House don’t really need to spend much time reading these reports to know that that shortage is real. Just go to any hospital, nursing home, or health clinic in your district, and you’ll hear the same thing, that they are short staffed in ERs, exam rooms, operating rooms, and on the floors. Short staffing is bad for patients and it’s bad for nurse nursing burnout.
Despite this blindingly obvious reality, the Education Department’s designation is putting a hard cap of $100,000 with no indexing on graduate student loans for nurses – all part of the One Big Beautiful Bill, which my Republican colleagues passed in June – a health care monstrosity which cut $1 trillion from Medicaid and cut off premium subsidies for 22 million Americans for their health care exchange plans, and now will suffocate the growth of our nation’s caring professions.
If you doubt my words, then maybe you’ll listen to the President of the American Nurses Association, the largest nursing professional organization in America. Jennifer Mensik Kennedy, the President states, “Nurses make up the largest segment of the health care workforce and are the backbone of our nation’s health system. At a time when health care in our country faces an historic nurse shortage and rising demands, limiting nurses’ access to funding for graduate school threatens the very foundation of patient care.”
Well said. But [the American Nurses Association] is doing more. They have organized a petition drive because this rule goes into effect next July. They, again, as of the middle of last week, had 180,000 signatures, and that will grow. It definitely will grow in the coming days.
And every member in this House, and I will be one of them, should write to the Department of Education saying that this rule makes no sense in terms of the health care system today, and also is an insult to the people who go through extensive training, testing, and certification before they are, again, allowed to practice their profession, the caring profession.
And while we’re at it, we should also help other professions which were excluded by the Department of Education – physician assistants, physical therapists, audiologists, speech language pathologist, architects, accountants, advanced degree educators, social workers, dental hygienists, and occupational therapists. This proposal by the Department of Education is madness, and Congress should actually do more than just support the regulatory process in terms of reversing these rules.
We should also go back and revisit the One Big Beautiful Bill and recognize what, again, our health care sector is telling us that we are risking the financial solvency of institutions all across America. And again, we are damaging our future in terms of getting young, motivated people to join the health care professions.

In a nation that prides itself on equality, too many are still forced to suffer in the shadows. Contemporary LGBTQ+ survivors face barriers such as discrimination, a lack of culturally competent shelters, and limited access to mental health services.
Quantitative data from the Centers for Disease Control shows that 44% of lesbian women, 61% of bisexual women, 26% of gay men, and 37% of bisexual men experience intimate partner violence in their lifetime. These barriers contribute to increased rates of depression, anxiety, and trauma within the community. And for many, the absence of inclusive domestic violence shelters creates a direct pipeline into homelessness. Even law enforcement —often seen as the ultimate safety net— can pose risks to LGBTQ+ survivors who fear police bias, misgendering, or harassment.
Take Clara’s story: a young trans Latina who fled her abusive partner only to discover that most shelters wouldn’t accept her. She found temporary safety only after locating a rare LGBTQ-affirming program —yet the moment she left, her abuser tracked her down, and the violence resumed. 
Or consider Sheila, who after transitioning left a seven-year abusive relationship. When she sought a restraining order, the judge brushed her off, telling her she was “too big to be afraid of anyone.” That wasn’t just a failure of empathy. It was a systemic refusal to see LGBTQ+ abuse as real. These are not hypotheticals. These are people—living, hurting, and too often forgotten. (The names Clara and Sheila are pseudonyms used in the NCAVP report to protect survivors’ privacy.)
Now I know what you’re thinking: Why should this matter to me? Because when abusers know certain victims are less likely to be believed or protected, it emboldens violence everywhere —not just against LGBTQ+ people. Harm tolerated in one corner of the community spreads to all of us.
I say this not as an outsider, but as a survivor myself. As a masculine-presenting lesbian, I have been assaulted by a man who believed my identity made me a target. The fear, shame, and confusion I felt in that moment still follow me—yet even then, I hesitated to seek help, wondering whether anyone would take me seriously. My story is not rare. It is precisely why culturally competent protections matter.
And what if I told you there is a way to strengthen those protections  —yet it remains stalled in courtrooms and in Congress? The Equality Act, first introduced in 1974 and reintroduced multiple times since, has repeatedly passed the House but died in the Senate. This bill explicitly prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in employment, housing, public accommodations, and federally funded programs.
I can already hear the next question: If this bill is so important, why hasn’t it passed? Opponents argue it threatens religious freedom, undermines parental rights, or exposes women to harm. I’m not here to dismiss every concern outright. Some questions people raise come from fear, confusion, or a lack of information—not from hate.
Do we need real conversations about fairness in women’s sports? Yes. Do we need safeguards to prevent predatory men from weaponizing gender identity? Absolutely. These concerns deserve good-faith discussion, not political fear-mongering. But here’s the truth: the Equality Act doesn’t take away anyone’s right to worship, doesn’t redefine sports policy, and doesn’t erase common-sense safety protections. What it does is ensure that LGBTQ+ people cannot legally be denied housing, fired, refused service, or turned away from life-saving programs simply because of who they are.
You don’t have to understand every nuance of gender or sexuality to understand this: no one deserves to be homeless because a shelter won’t take them. No survivor should be turned away while begging a judge for safety. No teenager should be denied care or service because their identity makes someone uncomfortable. Equal rights aren’t a special privilege —they’re the bare minimum in a democracy.
And before you say, “This doesn’t affect me,” let me offer this: it could be your child one day. Or someone you love. You don’t build a safer country by protecting only the people who look like you, love like you, or believe like you. You build one by ensuring everyone has access to safety, dignity, and a fair shot at life.
The truth is simple: if equality isn’t for all of us, then it isn’t equality at all.

My older brother, my hero, was losing himself to addiction. 
Throughout his senior year, he began experimenting. What was at first recreational spiraled into full blown dependence by the time he graduated. Xanax, percocet, cocaine, hard drugs seized him by his mind and his body. From roughly the age of 17 or 18 until just two years ago, he was in and out of rehab, trying to reclaim his life. 
He has been clean for over two years now, and I am grateful and proud every day. But his fight is lifelong. Every single day, he fights.



I tell his story not just because I am incredibly proud of my brother, but because we must confront a truth: drugs are far too accessible to teenagers. It is time to take this urgent crisis seriously.
How easy is it, really?
You don’t have to meet some dealer down at the end of the alley anymore: for many teens, access is just a text away. Surveys show that older adolescents routinely report drugs are “fairly easy” or “very easy” to obtain. Among 12th graders, 65 % said some drugs were easily available. That perception speaks volumes. 
If a kid believes they can get something, they’re more likely to try.
In Connecticut, the numbers are alarming. Among youth aged 12–17, approximately 8.95 % report using illicit drugs in the past month. Among those users, more than 80 % report marijuana use. In the 18–25 age group, substance use jumps dramatically: 44.8 % report marijuana use in the past year, and over 20 percent meets criteria for a substance use disorder.
Cannabis remains the common drug used by young people in our state. In Connecticut’s youth population, 14.08 % had used cannabis in the past year; 7.46 % in the past month, both rates higher than the national average.
More alarmingly, harder drugs aren’t always far behind. In Connecticut, about 1.99 % of residents over 12 report past-year cocaine use, with the highest prevalence among young adults.
These numbers do not completely capture how easy it can be for teens to get their hands on pills, stimulants, or other addictive substances from people such as peers, social media marketplaces, or family prescriptions. The data reflects a system broken by convenience and, more importantly, normalization.
The stakes are real, and personal
When addiction takes hold, it doesn’t just wreck the addict’s life. It fractures families, depreciates safety, and steals futures. Watching my brother fall to addiction the way he did was like literally watching him become a different person. Angry, frail, lost. The drugs were like a parasite, feeding on his dreams, altering his personality, hollowing him out.
He eventually clawed his way back. His recovery wasn’t about heroism, it was brutal, arduous work. But every person trapped in addiction deserves at least a chance to climb out. That opportunity can’t purely rest on personal willpower; it must rest on a society that acknowledges the problem. It takes a village.
A call to Connecticut
This isn’t just a fight for the next generation of Connecticut, this is now. If we fail to act, we risk thousands more young people emptied out by substances, dreams deferred or destroyed, families torn apart in the name of silence.
Yes, drugs are more accessible than they should ever be. But the access we must fight is not just to pills or powders; it is a fight for access to intervention, treatment, resources, hope. We owe that access to every teenager in this state.
My brother’s journey is a testament both to the cruelty of addiction and to the possibility of redemption. He is no longer lost. But thousands of others may be if we don’t change course, and quickly.

Jeff Landry administration's decision to abruptly cancel a massive contract providing health insurance to hundreds of thousands of Medicaid recipients.,"Legislators, advocates worry about the impact of canceling a major state Medicaid contract right before the Christmas holiday. (Photo illustration by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Several Louisiana senators and health care advocates are aghast at Gov. Jeff Landry administration’s decision to abruptly cancel a massive contract providing health insurance to hundreds of thousands of Medicaid recipients. 
“It’s unwarranted. It’s unnecessary and it fails the people we serve in that program,” Senate Democratic Caucus Chairman Gerald Boudreaux, D-Lafayette, said in an interview Tuesday. 

Legislators in both political parties said they were blindsided this week when they learned the Landry administration terminated a $4.2 billion agreement with UnitedHealthCare to provide Medicaid coverage in 2026. Lawmakers, hospitals and other health care providers said they weren’t given any notice of the governor’s decision in advance. 
UnitedHealthCare provides health insurance for 330,700 Louisiana residents and holds one of the largest contracts in state government. Without a deal in place, its participants will have to be moved into other Medicaid plans before Jan. 1. 

Lawmakers and advocates questioned whether such a big shift is feasible over a short period of time, especially with the holidays approaching. Many said disruptions in health care will be inevitable. 
“We are going to have problems. We are going to have people who fall through the cracks,” Senate Pro Tempore Regina Barrow, D-Baton Rouge, said in an interview Wednesday. “We are going to have people who are not going to get health care.” 
All Medicaid plans not the same, advocates say 
The remaining organizations that provide Medicaid coverage for the state are Aetna, AmeriHealth Caritas, Healthy Blue, Humana Healthy Horizons and Louisiana Healthcare Connections. 
The Louisiana Department of Health plans to use an algorithm to help pick a plan for each person who needs to switch from UnitedHealthCare, Health Secretary Bruce Greenstein said in an interview this week. 
It will prioritize keeping families together with the same health care company and making sure the doctors and other medical professionals a person sees most frequently take their new insurance.
“This will take place over the next two weeks, so it will take place over Christmas,” Greenstein said on Monday night. “I feel confident that we will be able to execute on this.”

If a Medicaid recipient is unhappy with their new health care coverage, they will have 90 days starting Jan. 1 to switch into another plan, Greenstein said.
Health care advocates and legislators said they aren’t convinced the transition will go so smoothly.
Attorney General Liz Murrill
UnitedHealthCare covers one quarter of the 1.4 million people who receive insurance through a Medicaid managed care organization. Only Louisiana Healthcare Connections, with 362,600 enrollees, has a larger share of enrollees.
When the health department has tried to switch large numbers of people from one Medicaid plan to another in the past, advocates said it has taken several months. Having such a massive change take place over the holidays will likely cause confusion, they said. 
“That isn’t a good time to make a change involving hundreds of thousands of people,” said Peter Robins-Brown, executive director of Louisiana Progress, an advocacy group for low-income people. 
UnitedHealthCare coverage is also widely accepted by doctors, hospitals and other health care providers. Many of the remaining health care plans have more limited provider networks, especially in rural areas, said Katie Corkern, an advocate for mental health care and people with disabilities. 
Corkern said she also worries there will be gaps in services after people switch into new health care plans and have to seek a new round of prior authorizations for medical treatments. 
Health insurers use prior authorization to review whether an enrollee requires the care or treatment they are seeking. They won’t agree to pay for certain services until prior authorization is granted. Prior authorization procedures differ among companies, and that status doesn’t automatically transfer when a patient has a new insurance plan. 
It’s also not clear that the five remaining health care plans have enough doctors, hospitals and other medical providers who take their insurance to absorb potentially thousands of new patients, said Jan Moller, executive director of Invest in Louisiana, a left-leaning organization that works on state tax and budget policy. 
“Sometimes, it can be hard for Medicaid beneficiaries to find doctors and other providers who will treat them,” Moller said. “How are we going to make sure we have enough doctors in our [remaining] networks to provide everything we need?”SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 
Lack of communication
Lawmakers are bewildered as to why the UnitedHealthCare contract is being dropped so suddenly. 
At the urging of the Landry administration less than a month ago, legislators approved UnitedHealthCare’s Medicaid contract for 2026 alongside five others. No concerns about the company’s services were brought up by the governor’s team during a nearly three-hour hearing Nov. 20. 
State Medicaid director Seth Gold then sent a short letter to UnitedHealthCare less than two weeks later telling the company its contract was ending on Dec. 31. 

“I’ve spoken to senators from both parties, and they have significant questions about what has evolved since the last [legislative] meeting that would force or require [the Louisiana Department of Health] and the administration to cancel,” Senate President Cameron Henry, R-Metairie, said in an interview Tuesday.

The Senate Insurance Committee and Senate Health and Welfare Committee are holding a joint hearing Tuesday to discuss the canceled contract with Attorney General Liz Murrill and state health officials. 
“Hearings need to be held to determine how this decision is made and why it is made and the ramifications,” said Sen. Thomas Pressly, R-Shreveport, who sits on the Health and Welfare Committee and voted to approve the UnitedHealthCare contract last month. “It needs to be on the record so people understand what’s going on.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX 
Problems with litigation 

Murrill and a recent setback for her in a state lawsuit against UnitedHealthCare appear to have played a major part in the contract termination. 

She sent a letter to Greenstein, the health secretary, on Dec. 2 urging him not to renew the UnitedHealthCare agreement because of the company’s “ongoing noncompliance with its contractual obligations.” That same day, the health department, which Greenstein leads, sent notice to UnitedHealthCare abruptly canceling its 2026 extension. 
In her letter to Greenstein, Murrill said UnitedHealthCare and its pharmacy benefits manager, OptumRX, has failed to turn over full access to its pharmacy claims processing system, which she alleges is required by its existing state contract. 

This claim is also the basis for the state’s years-long lawsuit against UnitedHealthCare, which Landry initially filed in 2022 when he served as attorney general. 
Landry and Murrill, who took over the lawsuit when she became attorney general in 2024, have more broadly alleged in the lawsuit that UnitedHealthCare and OptumRX overcharged the state Medicaid program for prescription drugs. The company has denied wrongdoing, saying it is in compliance with all state laws. 

Last month, the state lost a crucial court battle regarding the lawsuit. The Louisiana First Circuit Court of Appeal ruled against Murrill on Nov. 21, the week before Thanksgiving and 11 days before she sent the letter to Greenstein. 
The timing of the appellate court’s decision may explain why legislators were caught off guard by the contract termination. The ruling came out the day after legislators voted to renew UnitedHealthCare’s agreement. It’s not clear whether Murrill had raised objections to Greenstein and state health care officials before the court decision and that vote took place. 

The appellate court ruling also isn’t directly related to the merits of the lawsuit. It has to do with a side issue regarding how the attorney general had structured her contract with the private law firm, Salim-Beasley of Natchitoches, that is handling the case against UnitedHealthCare for the state. 

UnitedHealthCare has alleged in court that Murrill’s contract with Salim-Beasley violates state law. The company says the legal arrangement is too similar to a contingency fee contract, in which attorneys are only paid from the financial damages or settlement dollars awarded to the state if they win a case. 

The attorney general is only allowed to hire attorneys on a contingency fee basis if she received approval from the legislature to do so, according to state law.
Murrill’s attorneys have argued the Salim-Beasley contract doesn’t have to meet this requirement because its payment wouldn’t come directly from an award of damages or settlement the state receives. It would be given out separately from UnitedHealthCare under a judge’s direction and therefore is not a contingency fee contract. 
But the appellate court concluded UnitedHealthCare’s argument over the Salim-Beasley contract may have merit and needs to be heard in the lower district court before the state’s lawsuit can move forward. 

Murrill said the court fight is a factor in wanting to cancel UnitedHealthCare’s contract. 

“United has engaged in frivolous attacks on the AGs contracting authority as well, in an attempt to divert attention away from the issues,” she wrote in a text message to a reporter Monday.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/COVID-vaccine.jpg,,,2025-12-10 23:56:23.924927

It followed a hearing during which the company's attorneys sparred against the Trump administration, which has announced plans to reconsider the permit issued for its Maryland wind farm. (Photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)Offshore wind company US Wind battled the Trump administration in a Baltimore courtroom Wednesday, defending its Maryland project against the government’s plans to revoke and reconsider a construction permit issued under President Joe Biden (D).
For US Wind, the threat is existential, attorneys said Wednesday. Not only would the government’s revocation of the permit threaten to upend the project along Ocean City’s coast, it also could send the entire company heading toward bankruptcy.
“We’re not there yet,” US Wind CEO Jeff Grybowski said Tuesday outside the U.S. District Courthouse. “We’re in this fight because we made a promise to Maryland that we’re going to build the biggest renewable energy project in the state’s history.”
US Wind’s project is the closest to development along the Delmarva coast. Other companies — Ørsted and Equinor — have leases offshore, but do not have approved construction plans, like US Wind. But having an approved permit did not stop the Trump administration from trying to stop the project — one of a number of offshore wind projects that have been targeted, including some where stop-work orders have stalled construction.
Wednesday’s hearing is the latest twist in a case that began with the parties in entirely different roles. It began in October 2024, when Ocean City challenged the Biden administration’s approval of the permit, called a Construction and Operations Plan, or COP.
The Interior Department initially defended its issuance of the permit. But it reversed course after President Donald Trump (R) took office this year, and in September it asked U.S. District Court Judge Stephanie Gallagher to remand the permit back to the agency for reconsideration, saying it was not properly evaluated under Biden.
Judge strikes Trump order that froze wind energy permitting, leasing

US Wind fired back, asking Gallagher to bar the federal government “from taking any action to vacate, remand, withdraw, rescind, or in any way undermine” the project’s permit while the case proceeds.
Gallagher, who previously set aside the government’s remand request to allow for additional legal filings, said Wednesday that she plans to issue a written decision on US Wind’s preliminary injunction request.
Samuel Vice, attorney for the Justice Department, said this is not the time for an injunction. The government’s reevaluation of the US Wind permit is proceeding, though the department has taken “no affirmative steps” yet.
“We have not gotten to them in the queue,” Vice said. He said the US Wind reevaluation is part of a “broader reevaluation for all existing leases” spurred by Trump’s executive order, which also banned new or renewed leasing for offshore wind projects.
US Wind attorneys had argued that the president’s offshore wind ban meant that an Interior review of their project could reach no other conclusion than to deny the permit, since it is barred from issuing renewed approvals for wind farms.
Vice said on Wednesday that ban “has been vacated and is no longer operative,” so it can’t be used to justify a preliminary injunction for US Wind.
A federal judge in Massachusetts overturned Trump’s wind ban Monday, determining that the administration failed to justify its change in policy.
Gallagher said she found it concerning that the US Wind review is “in the queue,” noting that if Interior moves forward with a reconsideration, US Wind could be stuck in “limbo land” while it awaits a renewed ruling.
“They are suffering — I think that is clear from the record — ongoing harms from this delay,” Gallagher said.
US Wind said Wednesday that the project was already mired in legal confusion because of the Trump administration’s anti-wind pronouncements. Delays have “already caused harm” to the company — which is headquartered in Baltimore and funded by American and Italian firms — which has been forced to press pause on a “very, very expensive” Facility Design Report to the federal government, said Toyja E. Kelley, an attorney for US Wind.










There’s no procedure for this. They’re making it up as they go along.


– US Wind attorney David Newman, on the government's justifications for reversing it position.


If the permit were actually remanded, it might be the final straw for the project.
“The damage that’s been done to this project already may well be irreparable. But the project can still proceed,” said US Wind attorney David Newman. “This project cannot withstand another blow.”
The company believes it needs an injunction from Gallagher to protect it as Ocean City’s litigation proceeds.
The Town of Ocean City, for its part, is opposed to US Wind’s motion for a preliminary injunction, which would apply to “any person or entity acting in concert or participation with the Government.” That language  is “too broad,” said Nancie Marzulla, an attorney for Ocean City, and could be construed to include Ocean City.
A significant portion of Wednesday’s proceedings focused on whether Interior had taken a “final agency action” on US Wind’s permit.
US Wind argued in various court filings that the government signaled it has made a final decision about revoking the permit — even if it has not actually done so just yet.
“It [the agency] doesn’t have to actually pull the trigger for us to get review,” Newman said.
But Vice said that because the department has yet to actually issue its decision, court intervention now “would be an overstep.” The time to file a legal challenge is after Interior makes a decision about the permit, he said, not before then.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The department believes that Biden-era administrators applied an improper standard for review, and did not adequately consider the project’s effects on activities such as commercial fishing and search and rescue efforts.
But US Wind argues the government is “retroactively” moving the goalposts by changing the standard of review. And the new standards are “far more restrictive than the old ones,” Newman said, adding that “virtually no wind energy project could satisfy” the new rules, which require minimal impact to surrounding activities on the water.
US Wind said there are ways the government could revoke the COP, but only if there is an imminent danger to the environment or to national security, or if US Wind has violated terms of its lease. But instead of following the playbook, he said, the government moved abruptly to seek remand and reconsideration from the court.
“There’s no procedure for this,” Newman said. “They’re making it up as they go along.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_9773-cropped-e1765410333423-1024x664.jpeg,,,2025-12-10 22:56:25.850655

(Amy Bushatz/Mat-Su Sentinel)Gov. Mike Dunleavy on Tuesday issued a disaster declaration for the Matanuska-Susitna Borough to provide aid for individuals and local governments affected by the recent three-day windstorm.
The declaration, requested by Mat-Su officials Tuesday afternoon, provides grants to individuals and families to make home repairs, secure temporary housing or address other needs caused by the weekend storm, according to a state news release sent Wednesday.
Details on how much money may be available or how individuals can apply will be provided “in the coming days,” the release said.
“We are activating our disaster programs to bring relief to individuals and families who suffered property damage, and to ensure the Mat-Su Borough is reimbursed for emergency protective measures and infrastructure repairs,” Dunleavy said in the statement.
The borough will waive construction and household waste disposal fees at the Central Landfill near Palmer through Dec. 21 to help with cleanup, officials said in a release Wednesday.
The waiver also covers furniture, concrete and other nonhazardous construction trash, the release states. Brush and woody debris dumping at the landfill is already free.
“This measure is intended to support the disposal of storm-related waste and to assist residents who experienced damage or loss to personal property from the recent windstorm,” the release states.
The waiver applies only to individuals, not businesses or commercial landfill users, it states.
An American Red Cross emergency shelter at the Curtis D. Menard Memorial Sports Complex in Wasilla closed Wednesday morning, hours after power was restored to all homes and businesses in the region.
An average of 17 people stayed in the shelter each night between Saturday and Wednesday, Red Cross officials said in a release. Volunteers helped more than 50 people and provided more than 200 meals and snacks during operations, they said.
Officials with Matanuska Electric Association said some areas may experience brief power outages this week as crews work to fully remove trees from power lines.
Winds were expected to return to the Mat-Su on Wednesday evening, with gusts of up to 60 mph forecast through the weekend, according to the National Weather Service in Anchorage.

(File photo by Danielle E. Gaines/Maryland Matters)If it was supposed to be musical chairs, it was a short song.
Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) announced committee chairs for the 2026 General Assembly, his seventh as president, but most of the faces are familiar to anyone who haunted the Miller Senate Office Building during the 2025 legislative session. That familiarity starts with Ferguson and Senate President Pro Tem Malcolm Augustine (D-Prince George’s), who were reelected by a unanimous vote Wednesday of the Senate Democratic Caucus, according to a press release from Ferguson’s office.
The biggest change was in the Senate Executive Nominations Committee, where last year’s chairman, Sen. Clarence Lam (D-Howard and Anne Arundel) was moved out, replaced by Sen. Benjamin Brooks (D-Baltimore County). Lam, who had the misfortune of getting out, loudly, in support of redistricting just as Ferguson and the rest of the Senate were moving toward opposing, keeps his seat on the Finance Committee.
The only other standing committee chair to move is Sen. Shelly Hettleman (D-Baltimore County), who leaves the Rules Committee to become chair of Budget and Taxation’s Public Safety, Transportation and Environment Subcommittee in place of former Sen. Michael Jackson, who left the Senate to become superintendent of the Maryland State Police. Sen. Katie Fry Hester (D-Howard and Montgomery) takes over Rules.
Sen. Karen Lewis Young (D-Frederick) takes over as chair of Budget and Taxation’s Pensions Subcommittee, which had been held by Hettleman. Additionally, Augustine will fill Jackson’s seat on Budget and Tax, and Sen. Nick Charles (D-Prince George’s) takes over as vice chair of the Senate Democratic Caucus.
Sen. Kevin Harris (D-Prince George’s, Charles, and Calvert), who was just sworn in Wednesday, will join the Senate Committee on Education, Energy and the Environment.
“The Senate Democratic Caucus agenda will focus on growth, affordability, and protecting against attacks from the federal Administration in the 2026 Legislative Session,” Ferguson said in a statement released with the appointments. “We must give Marylanders the certainty and financial relief needed to navigate this avoidable chaos.”
A new gig, an old burial ground
Marc Schindler, former assistant secretary and chief of staff with the Maryland Department of Juvenile Services (DJS), will lead a national initiative to conduct research on children who died at juvenile facilities. The Forgotten Children Initiative at the Center for Youth Justice at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy launches next month.
Schindler said in an email Wednesday that the first phase will focus on a burial site at the old House of Reformation and Instruction for Colored Children in southern Prince George’s County, a wooded area believed to hold the remains of at least 230 Black teens from the 19th and 20th centuries.

Work on that restoration project began with former DJS Secretary Vincent Schiraldi, who stepped down in June. Schindler, who also worked as an executive director of the Justice Policy Institute, first visited the site last year and later returned with department staff, a volunteer genealogist and some youth from the nearby Cheltenham detention center to look for headstones.
Schindler led a tour of the grounds with members of the Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland in September, when he said there are 230 known graves and possibly 100 more marked only with cinder blocks. But records from the time are missing and death certificates were not issued in most parts of the state until 1898.
DJS applied this summer for a $31,000 grant to the African American Heritage Preservation Program to work on restoring the wooded area.
“Marc brings energy, wide-ranging experience and vast knowledge of the youth justice field from a number of perspectives,” Michael Umpierre, director of Georgetown’s justice center, said in a statement. “Most importantly, he has the passion, expertise and drive needed to positively impact today’s justice system.”
The Black Caucus hopes to pass legislation in the 2026 General Assembly for a commission to investigate the deaths of the Cheltenham boys, and possibly identify other forgotten burial sites and cemeteries throughout the state.
The national effort by Georgetown’s justice center plans are to research unmarked graves, to not only tell the stories of youth buried there but also memorialize them.
“It may be easy to think that this is an initiative about the past, but the past is with us,” according to the justice center. “We need to ensure that all of our country’s forgotten children – whether laying under a cinderblock grave, or sitting in detention today – are treated with dignity and humanity.”
Have a seat on the bench
Gov. Wes Moore has appointed three new judges to the Baltimore City District Court and elevated an Anne Arundel County District Court judge to the county’s circuit court, “four exceptional legal minds who have dedicated their careers to upholding the law,” he said last week when making the appointments.
“Their collective experience — from public defense to prosecution and federal service — has prepared them well for the bench,” he said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Moore named District Judge Sidney A. Butcher to a circuit court seat. First appointed to the bench in 2019, Butcher previously worked in the Medicaid Fraud Unit of the Maryland Attorney General’s Office, was in private practice and worked for a decade as a prosecutor in the Baltimore City State’s Attorney’s Office. He also served on the Anne Arundel County Board of Education. Butcher earned his law degree from the University of Kansas School of Law.
Moore appointed Elizabeth López, Noelle W. Newman and Otis W. Freeman to the Baltimore City District Court.
López has spent her entire legal career as a public defender, with 15 years in the Maryland Office of the Public Defender and the last four years in the Office of the Federal Public Defender, where she is a felony attorney supervisor, overseeing four attorneys.

(Photo by Sean Maguire/contributed image)The Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities is planning a new dock at Cold Bay, one of the most remote stops on the state ferry system’s route map.
More than 600 miles southwest of Anchorage, on the Alaska Peninsula, the town of just 56 people is the gateway to the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge and home to a 10,000-foot runway used as an emergency stop for trans-Pacific flights. 
Cold Bay is a stop on the ferry route between Kodiak and Dutch Harbor, but the dock serves more than ferries — it connects the town with ships that supply groceries, water and almost everything else it needs.
State surveys have found that the existing dock “is nearing the end of its serviceable life and is at risk of failing.”
Most of the funding for the new dock is expected to come from the federal government; the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act passed by Congress during the Biden administration included $43.4 million for the dock, and the state will contribute another $8.7 million in matching funds.
The final cost of the dock may be higher than that; inflation has driven the cost of all construction projects higher than they were in 2023, when the federal government awarded a construction grant.
Under DOT’s timeline, the project will go out to bid in spring 2027, with construction beginning the following year, and projected to be completed in 2029.
The new dock is expected to be large enough to support the planned replacement for the ferry Tustumena.
One public meeting about the project has already taken place; a second is planned for Tuesday evening, Dec. 16, by Zoom.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_6511-1024x529.jpeg,,,2025-12-10 21:56:51.850865

The Chesapeake Bay Journal
An Eastern Shore biologist is asking for the public’s help reporting sightings in Maryland of a bright yellow invasive spider that looks scary but is actually harmless to humans.
Washington College professor Angela Chuang says the Joro spider, Trichonephila clavata, is easiest to spot in the late fall when the adult females reach their maximum size, with a leg span of up to 4 inches. She is calling for observers to snap photographs of the spiders and report them in the iNaturalist app.
Chuang said it isn’t uncommon to spot the species in large numbers in Georgia, Tennessee and other parts of the South. They weren’t documented in Maryland until 2022, when they were found  in Elkridge.
“The main thing is, we would like it if people could report when they see these spiders, so we have a better understanding of how Joro spiders are spreading around, especially because this is a distinct population from the older one,” Chuang said. “It represents an opportunity to study an invasive population at its earliest stages.”
The Joro spiders’ yellow bodies and black legs make it easy to mistake them for yellow garden spiders, which are Maryland natives. The Asian Joros don’t seem to pose a danger to humans or pets, and tests have shown their bites to cause little or no reaction in subjects.
Still, Chuang is concerned about the impact they might have on local wildlife, particularly local spider communities. When they settle into a new region, Joro spiders tend to quickly become the dominant species, she said. People in the Baltimore and Eastern Shore areas should be especially on the lookout, she added.
Residents of those areas can email the researcher directly at JoroSpidersWC@gmail.com to invite her team to their properties to study them.

Tony Evers signed “Bradyn’s Law,” which creates a new crime for sexual extortion and the “Swenson Starkie Act,” which extends the statute of limitations for hiding a corpse. Evers addresses the Legislature in his 2024 State of the State message. (Baylor Spears | Wisconsin Examiner)Gov. Tony Evers signed two bills this week introduced in response to crimes, including “Bradyn’s Law,” which creates a new crime for sexual extortion and the “Swenson Starkie Act,” which extends the statute of limitations for hiding a corpse. 
AB 201, now 2025 Wisconsin Act 48, was introduced by Rep. Patrick Snyder and Sen. Jesse James after the death of 15-year-old Bradyn Bohn from Kronenwetter, a village outside of Wausau. Bohn died by suicide in March after being targeted online by a perpetrator who convinced him to send photos of himself and told him that he needed to send money or face major consequences. He suffered through hours of threats and was coerced into sending money before his death.
“Today is an important day to remember Bradyn as we honor him and his memory, because now, moving forward, we will be able to hold bad actors responsible for reprehensible behavior, especially when they prey on our kids, and that is so important,” Evers said in a statement. “We wouldn’t be here today without Bradyn’s family and their relentless advocacy to keep kids safe online and hold predators accountable. We will be able to protect more of Wisconsin’s kids because of Bradyn’s family’s efforts to fight back.”
Sexual extortion, or “sextortion” is defined by the Federal Bureau of Investigation as a crime in which “an offender coerces a minor to create and send sexually explicit images or video and then uses that material to extort the victim by threatening to release it.” 
2025 Wisconsin Act 48 makes it a Class I felony to coerce someone to engage in sexual conduct or to produce “an intimate representation” by threatening to injure someone’s property or representation, by threatening to commit violence or by threatening to distribute intimate photos of another person. The crime would be a Class H felony if the victim does any of those acts or is under the age of 18, and a Class G felony if the defendant was previously convicted of a sexually violent offense, the violation was committed during the course of a child abduction or the victim is under age 18 and the defendant is more than four years older than the victim. 
A person can also be prosecuted for felony murder if the person commits extortion and it causes the death of the victim. 
Sexual extortion has become a growing threat in the U.S. in recent years. The FBI observed from October 2022 to March 2023 an increase of more than 20% in reports of financially motivated sextortion incidents involving minor victims. 
From October 2021 to March 2023, the FBI and Homeland Security Investigations received over 13,000 reports of online financial sextortion of minors that included at least 12,600 victims, mostly boys, and led to at least 20 suicides.
Rep. Brent Jacobson (R-Mosinee) said in a statement that the bill is the first step towards “protecting vulnerable Wisconsinites from exploitation.” 
“As technology creates new avenues for exploitation, my colleagues and I have an obligation to make sure our laws protect our constituents, and that Wisconsin parents have the resources and awareness to keep their children safe from harm,” Jacobson said. “We must continue to come together to prevent these heinous crimes from claiming children in our state.”
Statute of limitations for hiding a corpse
SB 423, now 2025 Wisconsin Act 59, extends the statute of limitations for prosecuting the crime of hiding or burying a corpse by specifying that it only begins “once the victim’s remains are found and identified or when the crime occurs, whichever is later.” The current statute of limitations is six years in Wisconsin.
The legislation was introduced by Sen. Van Wanggaard (R-Racine) and Rep. Ron Tusler (R-Harrison) after the case of Starkie Swenson. Swenson disappeared in 1983 but his remains weren’t found until 2021, 38 years later. 
According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, John C. Andrews accepted a plea in the case and was convicted on a charge of homicide by negligent use of a vehicle in 1994 and served 16 months in prison. He refused to reveal where Swenson’s body was. 
Police charged him with hiding a corpse after identifying the remains in 2021, but the charges were dismissed due to the statute of limitations. 
“The killer should’ve faced justice for hiding the remains in an attempt to conceal his crime. However, because of a loophole in Wisconsin law, Starkie’s killer was able to avoid charges,” Tusler said in a statement. “Although we cannot heal the wounds caused by the murder of Starkie Swenson, 2025 Wisconsin Act 59 ensures that no violent criminal will be able to exploit the corpse-hiding loophole again,” Tusler said in a statement.
Notifying parents of sex offenses
AB 74, now 2025 Wisconsin Act 57, requires Wisconsin schools to notify a pupil’s parent or guardian if the pupil is an alleged victim, target or recipient of alleged sex offenses while at school. The law also requires school boards to provide parents and guardians each year with information on their rights to access records regarding school employee discipline.
“Doing everything we can to keep our kids safe at school, at home, and in our communities is a top priority for me, as well as our schools and education professionals, who are frontlines of doing what’s best for our kids every day,” Evers said in a statement. “This bill will strengthen transparency by making sure parents and family members are notified if any misconduct at school affects their kids’ safety or well-being and bolster accountability by ensuring they know what their rights are and what their kids’ rights are.”
Evers signs several other bills this week
Under AB 136, now 2025 Wisconsin Act 55, the penalty for impersonating a peace officer, a firefighter, an emergency medical services practitioner or an emergency medical responder is increased from a Class A misdemeanor to a Class I felony. Sen. Jesse James (R-Thorp) and Rep. Chuck Wichgers (R-Muskego) introduced the legislation this year following an incident in New Berlin.
AB 388, now 2025 Wisconsin Act 75, creates a legal framework to establish a behavioral health hospital in Chippewa Falls using $10 million, which was set aside in the state budget this year to be used for Rogers Behavioral Health. Sen. Jesse James, who coauthored the bill, said in a statement that it “is extremely monumental for the people of northwestern Wisconsin” and provides “a renewed sense of optimism” to the community as it will provide mental health support for children and adults in the area.
Under SB 11, now 2025 Wisconsin Act 79, principals will now be required to allow youth membership organizations, including the Girl Scouts and the Boy Scouts, to schedule at minimum one time to visit their school to encourage students to join their organization. The visit can consist of both spoken and written information on how the organization helps students with educational interests and civic engagement. 
Sen. Rachael Cabral-Guevara (R-Appleton) celebrated Evers signing the bill, saying that the organizations “create more engaged, confident, and community-minded citizens” and the law “ensures the next generation of Wisconsin children will continue to benefit from these life-changing experiences.” She also criticized Evers for vetoing another bill that would have added new requirements on schools related to military recruiters, saying the state should “proudly support our military, not slam the door shut when they’re offering students legitimate career options, which is precisely what the governor did with this veto.”
SB 310, now 2025 Wisconsin Act 61, limits the amount of time covered by an emergency power proclamation by a local government’s chief executive officer to 60 days, unless extended by a local governing body. The bill was part of a controversy surrounding Rep. Sylvia Ortiz-Velez earlier this year who claimed that Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley, who is running for governor, abused his power during the COVID-19 pandemic when he issued emergency orders in 2021.
AB 265, now 2025 Wisconsin Act 56, requires judges to sentence offenders to a minimum of 10 years in prison if convicted of a human trafficking crime and 15 years for a child trafficking crime.

Maya Homan/Georgia RecorderEconomists are offering a “sobering” forecast for 2026, marking the second consecutive year of slowed growth across both Georgia and the U.S. at large. The state’s economy is projected to grow 1.5% in 2026, only marginally better than the 1.3% growth expected nationally, according to economists at the University of Georgia.
During a 2026 Georgia Economic Outlook presentation in downtown Atlanta Wednesday, interim Terry College of Business dean Santanu Chatterjee told business leaders that Georgia’s economy grew by roughly 3% in 2025. But heading into 2026, he said, growth will be slower as a result of “uncertainty” around trade policies, slowing population growth, labor force declines, and slower national economic growth.
Unemployment is also expected to be on the rise, with Georgia’s rates estimated to climb to 4.1%, an increase of half a percentage point. National unemployment is expected to sit at 4.7%, up from the current 4.4%. Inflation is expected to hover around 3.5%, up from 3% in September.
As with last year’s prediction, Georgia is expected to have a stronger economy than the U.S. as a whole, but the state’s economy is still predicted to struggle. Nationally, the U.S. faces a 49% risk of recession.
Georgia has a few protective factors that make its economy more resilient than the U.S. as a whole, Chatterjee said. Existing economic development projects from companies like EnergyTek Corporation, TriNet and JS Link America will continue to ramp up production.

Additionally, the state’s numerous military bases and the cities around them will likely benefit from increased federal spending on defense and immigration enforcement. An expanded immigrant detention facility near Folkston, Georgia — which is expected to be the nation’s largest — is also projected to create 400 new jobs in the area.
Data centers are also expected to be a major source of growth in the upcoming year. According to one report, Georgia recently surpassed Virginia as the most active data center market in the nation.
Federal policies begin to make an impact
Though Georgia is expected to have a slightly brighter economic outlook than the U.S. at large, national trends around wage growth and consumer spending indicate that the country is experiencing a “K-shaped economy” where high earners see their wealth and income rise, while lower earners struggle to keep pace with the rising cost of living.
“Across the board, lower income households appear to be significantly more challenged right now than the rest of the economy,” said Mark Mathews, the executive director of research at the National Retail Federation, who delivered the national economic forecast at Wednesday’s event.
As President Donald Trump wraps up the first year of his second term, his policies on tariffs and immigration are also beginning to make their impact on the national economy.
Tariffs on imports are expected to settle at around 15% in 2026, which is six times higher than the rate at the beginning of 2025. The rate is not high enough to trigger a recession by itself, Chatterjee said, but elevated global tensions and economic uncertainty could slow growth. 
Some companies may also choose to postpone hiring and other business decisions “until trade policies stabilize and become more predictable.”
Trump’s immigration policies could also lead to changes in the economy. Normally, immigrants help contribute to annual population growth, Mathews said. But under policies that have ramped up immigration enforcement and placed a new emphasis on “self-deportation,” 2026 “could well be the first year in American history where we have a population decline,” he said.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_2076-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-10 19:57:15.419887

Sens. Regina Barrow, D-Baton Rouge, and Katrina Jackson-Andrews, D-Monroe, were also critical of the leadership at the Department of Children and Family Services and its lack of experience in child welfare. Its leader, Rebecca Harris, appeared Thursday before the legislature’s Select Committee on Women and Children and acknowledged that her top executives don’t have backgrounds working directly on child abuse and neglect. 
Jackson-Andrews said that having no one among the department’s top six leadership positions with a background in child welfare is “alarming,” given the agency’s primary mission.
“That’s what we do at DCFS. That’s the main thing, protecting children,” Jackson-Andrews said.

Lawmakers have long scrutinized the department over instances when repeated abuse apparently went unchecked. Through September, 39 children in Louisiana died this year as a result of suspected abuse or neglect. Of those deaths, 25 were at households the agency had previously investigated.
Harris, who was named the department’s leader in August, has put an emphasis on placing more child welfare workers in “front line” jobs where they can respond to allegations of abuse and neglect. So far, she’s reassigned about 100 child welfare supervisors from office jobs to positions where they can handle child welfare cases directly. Another 48 recently hired “second shift” workers have boosted those numbers, DCFS Assistant Secretary Bret Hanemann said.
Some of the shuffled supervisors contacted Jackson-Andrews to complain they were given extremely short notice about their new assignments, the senator said. Harris confirmed that the employees were moved to new roles in less than a week, adding “we did not do all this perfectly.” 
Harris also intends to end remote work for the 51 staffers who field calls to the state’s 24-7 child abuse hotline. She said no other state allows those employees to work from home, where they could potentially lose power or their internet connection. The decision is also in line with an executive order from Gov. Jeff Landry in April to require in-office work for all state employees with limited exceptions.
Instead, the department is launching a call center at its downtown Baton Rouge headquarters starting Dec. 15. The five hotline employees who live in the Baton Rouge area will have to work at the new location, which Harris is fashioning to work like a 911 call center. The remaining 46 employees, which include call workers, their supervisors and  managers, are being offered front line jobs at regional DCFS offices.
Hundreds of Louisiana child abuse reports filed online sat untouched for days

Lacy Simms, who Harris has placed in charge of the call center, provided lawmakers with details on Harris’ plans to model the hotline after an emergency call center in an effort to reduce call wait times and how long staffers spend on each call. The secretary said calls should average seven to nine minutes, including the time needed to dispatch first responders if warranted. Currently, the call center averages 26 minutes per call.
Simms said she has reached out to the Association of Public-Safety Communications Officials, an organization for emergency communications professionals, to develop what she said would be the first-ever training for child abuse hotline workers. 
“I really believe with the right training, with the right information, with the right people put into our training, I really believe we’re going to take off and be the first child welfare agency in the nation where our people are certified, and we operate it as a 911 call center,” Simms said. 
The secretary originally planned for the transition to the call center to be complete by Jan. 1, but she has since extended that deadline to June 30. The additional time will allow new and existing employees to be trained on new technology and procedures being put in place.
Lawmakers also heard from Melanie Mann, who was on the hotline staff until last month when Harris began the process to relocate the team to Baton Rouge. Mann said she resigned because her disability would not allow her to work at the closest DCFS regional office to her in Amite.   
Jackson-Andrews said she has received calls and emails from about a dozen hotline employees who have said they have contemplated quitting or retiring rather than taking regional office jobs. Mann said she knows of several former co-workers who also have disabilities and aren’t likely to take new roles with the department.
Simms said Mann and one supervisor are the only departures from the DFCS hotline staff to date. Forty people have applied for jobs as hotline operators, and 10 applications have been submitted for the vacant supervisor position, she added.


Let us know what you think...


 

Earlier in the meeting, Mann questioned the department’s new emphasis on hiring communications workers, rather than persons with background in social work or child services, to staff the hotline. She said the restructuring could result in the loss of staff with specialized training and years of experience. 
“We make high stakes decisions that can impact children’s lives every time we process a report,” Mann said.  
Jackson-Andrews said multiple times she did not want to pin the longstanding issues at Children and Family Services on Harris but stressed that her reorganization should include input from its child welfare workers, especially because that experience is lacking on her executive team.
In an interview after the hearing, Harris said the department’s top managers, who are just one level below the executive team, have the institutional knowledge and background the senator mentioned. She referenced her own experience as an investigator with the state health department involving cases of sexually transmitted disease among minors, which she said often overlapped with DCFS child welfare cases. 
“Between all of the different skills and knowledge and experience that’s brought to the table, I believe that we have a very solid team,” Harris said.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)While a majority of nurses at UnityPoint Health — Des Moines voted this week to unionize in initial results, the National Labor Relations Board did not announce the outcome of the election Wednesday amid a dispute over challenged votes.
Nurses working in four UnityPoint Health locations in the Des Moines area — Iowa Methodist Medical Center, Blank Children’s Hospital, Methodist West Hospital and Iowa Lutheran Hospital — voted from Dec. 7-9 on whether to unionize. The nurses who would be represented voted on whether they wanted to become a bargaining group represented through the Teamsters Local 90.
Results were counted Wednesday, and totaled 871 votes in favor of Teamsters representation, and 666 votes opposing the union. There are 251 challenged ballots, according to a statement from UnityPoint Health, largely coming from Teamsters, which are not included in the final vote counts released Wednesday.

Approving union representation only requires a simple majority. Without the challenged ballots, the union effort is ahead by 205 votes. If all challenged ballots were approved — and if all were opposing the union — the unionization effort would be defeated.
But Nico Hernandez with Teamsters Local 90 said he did not believe the challenged ballots would be approved nor would they overturn the current election results, as the Teamsters challenged ballots of people who were ineligible to participate in the vote.
“(UnityPoint) agreed to a stipulation timeline, they agreed to a list of voters that were eligible to vote, and they intentionally tried to tell people that were ineligible to vote to go to the polls,” Hernandez said. “They told agency nurses, for example, to go vote, they told — there’s LPNs that they told t0 vote, people who are not registered nurses. And so as a result, there’s a fair few challenges. However, obviously, with a margin of 205, it’s very substantial, and as a result, we’re very confident that at the end of the day, once we have our day at the Labor Board, these nurses will be certified as a union. Because they have fought for so much, and they, you know, they deserve the ability to bargain and negotiate for fair protections on the job and for dignity at work.”
UnityPoint officials said in a statement they “don’t believe there is any merit to the International Brotherhood of Teamsters’ challenges.”
“We have reason to believe they only challenged the ballots of certain nurses based on how they believed those nurses would vote,” the UnityPoint statement read. “UnityPoint Health did not challenge the ballots of any nurses currently employed in the bargaining unit – we believe everyone’s vote should count and everyone’s voice should be heard.”
Hernandez said the Teamsters disputed that any ballots were challenged based on how they believed individuals would vote, as well as the claim that UnityPoint Health did not challenge ballots, saying UnityPoint challenged ballots of “people that are nurses in the bargaining unit.”
According to a statement from UnityPoint Health – Des Moines, the NLRB “has not confirmed an outcome to today’s vote, which means a result is undetermined and there is no union at UnityPoint Health – Des Moines.”
The effort to form “United Nurses of Iowa” effort has built over more than a year as some nurses sought voluntary recognition from UnityPoint for the planned bargaining group in August before moving forward with an NLRB vote. The vote was originally scheduled for October, but was delayed due to the government shutdown.
Nurses involved in the organizing effort said they were pursuing a union as a way to address issues like staff shortages, safety concerns and compensation.
Following the vote, there will be a hearing scheduled with the NLRB to go over the facts of the case — something Hernandez said the Teamsters are “hopeful that it’ll be scheduled as soon as possible.”
“We’re looking forward to, you know, get this thing across the finish line,” Hernandez said. “These nurses know that they’ve won their union. We just need to get the paperwork.”
UnityPoint officials said the health care system “will continue to stay focused on delivering exceptional care to our patients, families, and communities” while proceeding through the NLRB process for evaluating challenged ballots.

The lifelong hunter and fisherman heard there was a storm on the way. Typhoon Halong, the forecast said. But no one knew how bad it would get. Weathering storms was part of life in his community.
By nightfall, everything changed.
“The wind just kept getting stronger,” Andrews recalled, who is Yupik and a member of the Native village of Kipnuk. “It seemed like every 15 minutes, the water level would be really higher than the last time I looked.”
As midnight passed, the river swelled into the roads, seeping closer to his home. Andrews, his wife, and their three children watched as the calm morning gave way to chaos.

In many western Alaska communities, schools serve as more than classrooms. When strong winds or a winter blizzard rolls in, they often open their doors to families who need a safe and sturdy place to shelter.
“I wasn’t gonna evacuate to the school until I knew I had to,” he said. “Around 2 a.m. I was really concerned, seeing that it was already flooding and the peak was a few hours away, and I decided that I should evacuate to the school.”
He rushed inside his home, yelling for his family to grab what they could: blankets, pillows, a few dry clothes stuffed into trash bags. The wind howled as they scrambled onto their four-wheeler.
“My wife and kids were holding on to each other,” he said.

Along the boardwalks and against strong winds, Andrews and his family drove on four-wheelers in one direction he had planned to take to higher ground. But the water was already too high.
Turning around, Andrews took his family through the storm with another family to the school. Andrews was among the few who made it to the school, while other relatives and families couldn’t get back in time.
Phones began to ring and vibrate once they were sheltered there. It was those who hadn’t evacuated to the school in time.
“We were starting to get phone calls from people asking for help. They were terrified,” he said.

They were caught in the flood and trapped in the homes as the water rose.
“We couldn’t do anything with nothing,” he said.  “They were drifting away in their house, and that feeling of helplessness was really stressful.”
By dawn, the village was underwater.

More families poured into the school — more than 700 people in total. The generator hummed weakly, powering a few lights and a small water tank. Outside, houses drifted in the flood.
The scale of Typhoon Halong’s destruction across western Alaska became clearer as state officials released new damage assessments.
In an update published on Oct. 13, the State Emergency Operations Center reported, “49 communities are reporting impacts, and 1,400 residents are sheltering in 12 shelters.” Among the villages affected was Kipnuk, where homes were swept off their foundations and many residents were forced to evacuate.
The numbers underscored how widespread the storm’s effects were, stretching across remote communities where evacuation routes are limited and recovery is expected to take months.
A day later, the Coast Guard and National Guard arrived.
On Oct. 15, evacuation orders were issued. Andrews and his wife returned to their house to gather pieces of their home and memories. “A couple of pictures, and grabbed our Bibles,” he said.
Along with those sentimental items, Andrews also collected some essentials.
“And my shoes, my kids’ shoes that were dry. We were able to get a couple of shoes for my kids, but that was it. We filled her backpack and she had her bag of blankets, pillows,” he said.

Andrews and his family were flown first to Bethel, then to Anchorage, and finally to Fairbanks, where they now stay in an apartment.
Relatives in the interior of Alaska were the reason Andrews and his family decided where to go next.
“My wife told me that her aunt was telling her that we should come to Fairbanks,” he said.
They arrived in Fairbanks on Oct. 17 and learned that an AirBnB host had offered their cabin for about two weeks. “We stayed at the cabin in North Pole for about a week or more until we were able to find an apartment,” he said.
“The day after we got to Fairbanks, we got all these donations, clothes and food, and one donation was a car. A small car. It’s an earlier, older, older car, but it helps us get whatever we need around town,” he said.
For Andrews’ children, adjusting to city life was a cultural shock, but also a relief.

Andrews said all three of his kids had never even crossed a street with a walk signal before. They had never ridden a school bus, and the basic daily routine of getting to and from school was completely new to them. They were used to playing on a playground and going to school, but the need for food was different.
In the city, he said, you have to pay for almost everything you eat, while back home they lived off what they hunted, caught and gathered.
City life brought a lot of differences, but also a lot of conveniences.
“My kids just gone to their first week of school,” he said, smiling. “And they just tell stories of everything they did, and it’s really, really refreshing that they’re enjoying their time in school.”
 A community response

Across town, in an office at Denakkanaaga, Sharon McConnell was on the phone. As director of the nonprofit, she and her colleagues had been tracking the evacuees’ arrival in Fairbanks.
“At that time, we found out that there were about 10 or so, well, there’s 10 adults and about nine children,” she said. “We just thought it would be a nice gesture to get to know them, welcome them, let them know who we are, what’s available in Fairbanks.”
McConnell and a coalition of Native-led organizations — including the Fairbanks Native Association and Doyon, Limited — organized a welcome luncheon. It wasn’t just a meal. It was a gesture of home.

“People brought Native food. Denakkanaaga and [Fairbanks Native Association] put together a menu and we each made different dishes, moose soup, salmon salad with salmon eggs, things like that,” McConnell said, smiling at the memory. “Other folks brought seal oil, dried meat, salmon strips.”
When Andrews and his family arrived, the room was quiet at first. New faces, a new place, the uncertainty of starting over. But as the dishes were passed around and the children laughed, the air began to change.
“By the end of the luncheon,” McConnell said. “People were laughing and teasing each other. You know that we that we do in the Native community,”
Among the guests were community leaders and elders, the Fairbanks Chief of Police, and representatives from Doyon and Fairbanks Native Association. One woman from Southwest Alaska even brought homemade frybread.
“Someone brought seal oil which was wonderful,” McConnell added.

Still, practical needs remained urgent.
“One little child that was at the luncheon needed boots right away,” McConnell said. “Another little toddler, the family needed a car seat for him or her, and [Fairbanks Native Association] was able to provide that immediately while we were at the lunch.”
Beyond material aid, McConnell’s focus — and that of Denakkanaaga — was on connection.
“We’re more of an advocacy organization, not a hands-on direct services,” she explained. “What we’ve offered them, of course, is a place to visit, a place to come to, to meet elders, meet more Native families.”
 The strength of connection

For McConnell, the experience reaffirmed the importance of Native-led response efforts.
“No matter where we reside, that really strong Native connection is there, whether it’s in Fairbanks, rural communities, Anchorage,” she said. “We come together, we support each other. Not just our own cultures, but other Native cultures of Alaska, the statewide Native community”
And for Andrews, that connection is what carried his family from chaos to stability. “We lost a lot,” he said. “But we found kindness everywhere we went.”

He had spent the fall building a new 10-by-10 shed, finishing the door, the walls and the roof just the night before the flood. “It’s a brand new shed that I made where my wife could process fish and some seal meats,” he said, adding that it was also where they planned to keep their freezers.
When he returned after the water receded, everything was gone. The house was gone, the shed was gone and so was his homemade wood stove sauna. He listed the rest quietly: three boats, including “a 22 footer with 115 horse Yamaha,” a snowmachine, three utility sleds, an aluminum ATV trailer with the boat trailer, his Honda ATV 500, all of his guns, camping gear, fishing gear, salmon and the fuel tanks he used for traveling.
“Those are all gone,” he said. Even his wife’s 10-foot kayak had washed loose, though he later found it wedged under what was left of the house. “We lost our fish rack,” he said.
Now, in Fairbanks, as his children settle into their new schools and his family finds their footing, Andrews still thinks of home. The open skies and the sound of the wind sweeping across the tundra.
“It’s different here,” he said.  “But people have made us feel like we belong.”

The family’s daily rhythm has shifted in ways he still notices.
“Our days are too different now compared to our routine at home,” he said.
Back home, school for all students started around 9 a.m. from kindergarten through 12th grade. In Fairbanks, his middle schooler begins much earlier.
“So we’re starting our days earlier and going to bed earlier now,” he said. He wakes up ahead of dawn, gets everyone out the door and finishes the day on a new schedule. “I’m picking up the kids by myself,” he said, another change in a life that still feels new but is slowly settling into place.
 Epilogue

In the weeks after the luncheon, McConnell and her team continued to invite the families to community gatherings like beading circles, craft nights, and elder lunches.
“It’s just the beginning,” she said.
For Andrews, the road ahead remains uncertain, yet hope persists.
The future for western Alaska remains uncertain in the wake of Typhoon Halong.
With “as much as 90 percent of structures” destroyed in villages like Kipnuk, according to the American Red Cross, limited access due to remote locations, and ongoing threats from thawing permafrost and rising seas, many residents face a long and difficult recovery.
“Almost all of the supplies have to come in by barge – plywood to nails to windows – and that isn’t going to happen in winter. You can’t truck it in – there are no roads. Planes can only fly in small amounts – the runways are short and not built for cargo planes,” said the University of Alaska Fairbanks’ International Arctic Research Center.
While some families will likely return, the process may take months or even years, and for others, permanent relocation to higher ground may be the safer option.
“Recovery is a priority for the impacted areas, and recovery operations continue with an emphasis on restoring critical infrastructure and services, including water, power, and communications, and emergency home and boardwalk repairs,” according to the Alaska Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management.
Officials continue to provide support through shelters, donations, and temporary housing, but the storm has highlighted the broader challenges that climate change and extreme weather pose for Alaska’s remote communities.
“I hope we’ll be able to return home,” Andrews said softly. “While we are in the cities, wherever we are, wherever people ended up after the storm, I just hope that all of us will be alright for as long as it takes.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)The Tennessee Supreme Court vacated a lower court’s judgment that a 2022 state Senate map was unconstitutional, ruling that a voter in a misnumbered Davidson County district lacked standing to challenge the map.
The ruling also upheld a lower court’s decision that declared the 2022 House redistricting map was constitutional.
This is the latest development in a lengthy legal battle over the maps that has spanned multiple courts since state lawmakers approved the new districts after the most recent U.S. Census.
Francie Hunt, executive director of Tennessee Advocates for Planned Parenthood, sought an expedited ruling from the state Supreme Court in 2023 for her challenge against the new Senate districts. She lives in a part of Davidson County that was placed into Senate District 17 along with the entirety of Wilson County in the redistricted Senate map.
Hunt challenged the Senate plan because it numbered Davidson County’s four Senate districts out of compliance with a constitutional rule that districts in multi-district counties must be numbered consecutively.
Judges order Tennessee Senate redistricting map to be redrawn; trial possible for House plan

Prior to redistricting, the map numbered Davidson County’s four Senate districts consecutively. Because Senate terms are staggered, this meant two of the county’s senators would be up for election in presidential election years, and the other two would be up for election in gubernatorial election years. Under the Senate map adopted in 2022, three Davidson County senators would be up for election in gubernatorial election years, and only one would coincide with the presidential election cycle.
Justice Sarah K. Campbell, who wrote the majority opinion, stated that Hunt needed to show a “distinct and palpable” injury for her claim to be valid.
“Hunt’s complaint is simply that she lives in a non-consecutively numbered Senate district, while other Tennessee voters do not,” the opinion states. “But that difference does not affect the weight or strength of her vote, so it is not vote dilution.”
The opinion states that Davidson County’s Senate districts were also numbered nonconsecutively in redistricting plans following the census releases in 1990 and 2000. Hunt has lived in Davidson County since 1999, but “was unaware of the numbering issue at that time,” according to the opinion.
Voters have challenged district misnumbering in other courts when it caused voters to wait longer than usual to elect an official, Campbell wrote, but the redistricted Senate map allowed Hunt to vote for a Senate candidate in 2020 and in 2022, two years sooner than she would have been able to had her district been numbered consecutively.
While the court found Hunt lacked standing, “other plaintiffs — whether voters, candidates or public officials — may be able to establish standing based on different facts in future cases,” Campbell wrote.

Three plaintiffs backed by the Tennessee Democratic Party initially sued the state to block maps drawn by the Republican-dominated Senate and House following the February 2022 redistricting process. The lawsuit alleged the House redistricting plan violated the Tennessee Constitution because it divided more counties than necessary and rejected an alternative plan that would have left seven counties whole.
A three-judge panel issued an injunction against the Senate map in April 2022 because it failed to meet a constitutional requirement that Senate seats in the same county must be numbered consecutively. The panel ordered lawmakers to come up with a new map within 15 days. 
In response, Gov. Bill Lee, Secretary of State Tre Hargett and Tennessee Elections Coordinator Mark Goins filed an appeal in the Tennessee Court of Appeals. The Tennessee Supreme Court intervened because of the case’s urgency and lifted the panel’s injunction days later.
Hargett said little about the case other than “congratulations to the Attorney General’s Office in another court victory.”
Minority opinion finds Senate map misnumbering did violate rights
In the court’s minority opinion, Justice Holly Kirby found that Hunt’s constitutional rights were violated in the redistricting plan that moved her from the district held by Republican Sen. Ferrell Haile in Sumner County to that of Republican Sen. Mark Pody of Lebanon, who she said was not “connected” to her community. 
The minority ruling found Hunt “sustained” injury from the 3-1 staggered terms in Davidson County and said it is neither “conjectural nor hypothetical” and that it would “manifest itself” each time District 17 changes.
Senate and House redistricting rulings challenged at Supreme Court level

Kirby threw a few barbs at the majority opinion, saying the justices “quibbled” with Hunt’s description of her injuries and cast it as vote dilution.
She summed up her ruling by saying, “Under our standing jurisprudence in redistricting cases, it should not be easier for the proverbial camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a voter to challenge the constitutionality of her own voting district. Ms. Hunt has proper standing, and her claim should be considered on its merits.”
The majority opinion determined that another plaintiff, Gary Wygant, did have standing to challenge the House plan, but only for Gibson County, where he resides. The court upheld a lower court’s ruling that Wygant “failed to prove that the legislature lacked a rational or legitimate basis for dividing Gibson County.”=
In a separate opinion, Justice Dwight Tarwater wrote that Wygant could not prove he was harmed by the slicing of Gibson County from one state House district into two. Wygant claimed he and other voters were hurt by “the denial of a single representative to represent all of Gibson County” but Tarwater opined the claim lacked merit.

Plaintiff attempts to bolster case against the Women's Center with a 2023 federal audit that found blind spots and an incomplete investigation into staff-on-inmate sexual abuse allegations. 
The post New filings in Wyoming women’s prison sexual assault lawsuit point to secluded off-camera locations appeared first on WyoFile .","New filings in an ongoing lawsuit against officials at the women’s prison in Lusk point to a 2023 federal audit that found surveillance camera blind spots within the facility and an incomplete investigation into staff-on-inmate sexual abuse allegations, among other deficiencies. 
In the last five years, three former prison guards at the Wyoming Women’s Center have been convicted and found guilty of sexually assaulting female inmates. 
In August, one of those women filed a federal lawsuit that alleges the sexual abuse she experienced was the result of “deliberate indifference to the rights and safety of inmates” by the prison’s staff and leadership. 
Filed in Wyoming’s U.S. District Court, the complaint names Joseph Gaul, a former correctional officer, alongside Warden Timothy Lang and Deputy Warden Robert Harty. Five John Does are also listed as defendants, whom the plaintiff could not name but believes were Women’s Center employees. 
In 2023, Gaul admitted to inappropriate sexual contact with the plaintiff, Chasity Jacobs. He then pleaded guilty to second-degree sexual assault and was sentenced to two to five years in prison. 
The Wyoming Attorney General’s office is seeking to dismiss Jacobs’ lawsuit, contending that it does not make a plausible claim and was filed outside the statute of limitations. 
In the meantime, attorneys for the plaintiff filed an amended complaint on Dec. 1. It names an additional defendant — Rick Catron, the former women’s prison warden — and includes details from a 2023 federal audit. 
“Multiple sexual assaults have been investigated internally by [the Wyoming Department of Corrections] rather than immediately referred to outside law enforcement, undermining accountability and potentially concealing the full scope of abuse,” the amended complaint argues. “Investigations are often incomplete, shielded by internal review procedures, and rarely result in systematic reform or staff discipline beyond the individual perpetrator.” 
PREA audits
The Prison Rape Elimination Act requires agencies like the Wyoming Department of Corrections to track and report sexual victimization at each of its facilities on an annual basis. 
In the last decade, PREA records indicate there have been 11 substantiated instances of a prison guard sexually assaulting a female inmate at the Women’s Center.

Federal law also requires that facilities undergo independent audits every three years to remain eligible for substantial federal funding. The last PREA audit of the Women’s Center was completed in 2023. In July of that year, between the on-site PREA visit in February 2023 and the report’s completion in September 2023, Jacobs says Gaul raped her in a secluded closet, and a week later, sexually assaulted her in a vestibule. He was later convicted of the second incident.
“Although surveillance cameras had been installed throughout the facility, the February 2023 PREA audit identified multiple camera blind spots that posed significant safety risks and allowed areas of the prison to remain unmonitored,” the amended complaint states. 
More specifically, “the auditor identified one blind spot in the commissary caged areas,” according to the audit report. “The auditor also observed a door to the boiler room unsecured, causing a blind spot and safety issue.” 
The facility was required to take corrective action, which, according to the audit, included providing a memo to staff related to unsecured areas and unsecured doors. 
“The memo advised of the importance of securing doors and that failure to do so moving forward would result in disciplinary action, including up to termination,” the audit states.  
The facility also “provided six photos of mirrors installed in [the] commissary,” the audit states. “The photos provided confirmation that the blind spots were alleviated.”
The amended lawsuit also points to the audit’s review of sexual abuse and sexual harassment allegations and investigations at the Women’s Center. 
“During the 2023 audit, it was discovered that WWC failed to complete an investigation into a staff-on-inmate sexual abuse allegation, requiring corrective action for its failure to conduct or document a complete investigation by PREA standards,” the lawsuit states. 
As the audit report details, “a review of nine allegations indicated that one was sexual abuse while the others were consensual sexual activity. The sexual abuse allegation involved staff sexual abuse in addition to numerous other allegations.”
While “the facility investigator completed an investigation into the other allegations,” the audit states, “an investigation into staff sexual misconduct” was not completed because the investigator “did not have the authority to conduct a staff-on-inmate sexual abuse investigation.” 
After the investigation was forwarded to “agency investigators,” there was no documentation that it was completed, according to the audit.
The facility was once again required to take corrective action, which included completing the investigation, providing “a process memo to the auditor related to who is responsible for the different allegation types” and providing “a list of sexual abuse allegations during the corrective action period and the corresponding investigative reports.”
Those tasks were completed by Aug. 23, 2023, including the investigation, which “determined the allegation was unsubstantiated.”
The lawsuit
Approximately five months after the on-site portion of the 2023 PREA audit was completed, Gaul, the former guard, assaulted Jacobs, according to her lawsuit.  
The first of two assaults took place in a chemical closet, according to the complaint, and the second occurred in another unsupervised area of the prison. 
Before he was hired to work at the women’s prison, Gaul was terminated from at least two public-sector jobs in Nebraska due to misconduct toward women, according to the lawsuit. 
“During the 2020 PREA audit, the auditor examined all WWC’s self-reported policies and interviewed Defendant Catron who indicated all potential hires undergo background checks and are asked questions about previous terminations,” the lawsuit states. “Despite these representations, the facility continued to employ male officers who engaged in grooming behavior, rule violations, and abuse of inmates.”
The state now has the opportunity to respond to the amended complaint.
The Wyoming Department of Corrections did not respond to WyoFile’s request for comment by publishing time.

(Keila Szpaller/The Daily Montanan)A Sheep Creek mine would bring economic development to the Bitterroot Valley, but the U.S. Forest Service should ensure the mine exploration moves forward with “needed transparency,” Montana’s congressional delegation said in a letter to the agency chief.
“We have been ardent supporters of new mines and mine expansion in Montana, including the Libby Exploration Project and the Sibanye-Stillwater Mine, both located on Forest Service land,” said U.S. Sen. Steve Daines and the Montana delegation in a letter Monday.
The letter said the delegation saw at Sheep Creek the potential to “greatly expand U.S. critical mineral production” and its ability to bring jobs and important revenue to the community.
However, the delegation said federal land use decisions need the support of local communities, and, “importantly, county commissions,” which the project does not have. The letter called for “ample local engagement.”
U.S. Critical Materials has proposed a controversial 3.9 acre mine exploration project for “rare earth” minerals at the headwaters of the Bitterroot River to see if a fullscale operation is feasible.
Company representatives argue the project could support national security and bring jobs to the area, but local residents have decried the lack of communication and doublespeak from mine officials and raised concerns about impacts to water, critical for local agriculture, tourism and recreation.
Last week, Ravalli County Commissioners unanimously voted to send a letter to the Congressional delegation asking the Sheep Creek mine exploration be removed from the FAST-41 list of federal projects to be expedited, citing lack of public engagement.
FAST stands for Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act.
The commissioners did so at a meeting they estimated drew 700 people. During public comment, not one person spoke in favor of the mine, and many raised concerns, including whether the mine should ever operate in the area.
The letter from the Congressional delegation was addressed to U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Schultz and Emily Domenech, director of the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council, which oversees FAST-41 projects.
In the letter, the delegation did not ask the Forest Service or permitting council to remove the project from the FAST-41 list, or “fast track,” although U.S. Sen. Tim Sheehy and U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke made such calls earlier, but it called for the chief and director to ensure transparency from U.S. Critical Materials or any successor companies.
“Unfortunately, it has become clear to us that the developers of the proposed Sheep Creek deposit have not engaged with community leaders and gained their trust to proceed with the development of this deposit,” the letter said. “As such, we cannot support the project and urge the Forest Service and the Permitting Council to ensure full transparency and increased local engagement in the permitting process.”
The letter was signed by Daines, Sheehy, Zinke and U.S. Rep. Troy Downing, all Republicans.
Wednesday, Ravalli County Commission Chairman Dan Huls said the Commission had not heard from either of the U.S. Critical Materials mine officials since they presented at the meeting last week.
The project is still named on the FAST-41 project list for Montana, and Huls said it’s frustrating to be in “hurry-up-and-wait mode” regarding its status.
“I hope that our congressional delegation has the horsepower to get this thing off of the fast track,” Huls said.
The letter he and Commissioners Greg Chilcott and Jeff Burrows signed also requested full environmental reviews for any work at Sheep Creek.
The Permitting Council has not responded to requests for comment about the status of the Sheep Creek proposal. Wednesday, U.S. Critical Materials also did not respond to messages from the Daily Montanan.
In the letter this week, the Congressional delegation thanked the Forest Service chief and permitting council director for their work “expanding mineral production in Montana” and on other FAST-41 projects, like the Stillwater Mine and Libby Exploration Project.
“The Sheep Creek deposit has the potential to greatly expand U.S. critical mineral production and reduce our dependence on China for rare earth elements that are vital for the US economy,” the letter said. “Future development of the Sheep Creek deposit will bring jobs, economic development, and important revenues for the local community that can be used to increase public safety, fix roads and infrastructure and fund schools. This can be done while also protecting environmental assets, water quality, and wildlife.”
But one piece is missing at Sheep Creek compared to the projects at Libby and Stillwater, the delegation said.
“Unlike the proposed Sheep Creek mine, both (the Libby and Stillwater projects) enjoy strong support of the local community and the confidence of county commissioners and stakeholders,” the letter said. “We hope that the lack of engagement will be rectified promptly and urge the Forest Service and the Permitting Council to ensure the project receives the needed transparency and ample local engagement.”
Huls, though, said he remains skeptical about the project in the Bitterroot, and he sees better opportunities to mine the same minerals elsewhere in Montana.
“I very much wish that everything the proponents said was true,” Huls said of the mine officials. “But what they lined out for us, in my opinion, was a project that’s too good to be true.”
Huls said he wasn’t necessarily speaking for the other commissioners. He also said he agrees the U.S. is under China’s thumb when it comes to rare earth minerals, and it concerns him.
“There’s no doubt about that,” Huls said. “But my understanding is there’s a tremendous amount of those minerals that are in the tailings of the mines that were in Butte and Anaconda where that processing took place.
“And if we could get our critical minerals from those places, that would be much better, and it would probably improve the landscape over there instead of placing the mine at the headwaters of the Bitterroot River and potentially having an incident.”
An incident, he said, would be a matter of when, not if, and a question of severity of impacts, whether a truck full of minerals wrecking into the river or water pollution from washing tools.

The Child Custody and Domestic Relations Task Force met Wednesday to discuss its legislative proposals compiled after hours of meetings with testimony from judges, attorneys, parents, social workers, advocates and others.

“It’s like we’re playing catch up from years and years and years of problems,” task force member Sen. Carl Bjerke, R-Coeur d’Alene, said Wednesday. 
Multiple proposals are expected to result from the task force, but the primary one will be an overhaul of Idaho Code Section 32-717, which involves custody in divorce actions. The potential changes include a baseline 50/50 joint custody presumption unless there is a “clear evidence of danger,” a requirement that children’s wishes be considered, added expirations on temporary protective orders unless a hearing is held, and new definitions. 
The exact draft bill proposal wasn’t available Wednesday. Co-Chair Rep. Heather Scott, R-Blanchard, said changes were still being made. 
There will also be a proposal to clarify that police must enforce violations of custody orders, and to require a wealthier parent to pay attorneys fees for the other parent in cases where there is a substantial resource imbalance. 
The proposed changes and a “white paper” report outlining the issues in the family court system discussed during the task force hearings were presented by Mila Wood, a volunteer who worked with the task force. 
Many of the proposed changes were included in a framework that task force members discussed in November. 
 Proposal focuses on parental rights, but adds child safety, domestic violence safeguards 

Wood said the proposed legislation would “significantly reduce erroneous deprivations of parental rights, improve due process compliance, and create statewide uniformity and custody cases.” 
She also said she worked with advocates of Kayden’s Law, which are a collection of laws to prioritize child safety in custody cases. Part of the law and the proposed legislative changes are meant to strengthen protections for both the parent and children in cases that involve domestic violence. 
The Kayden’s Law framework would prohibit unsupervised visits if the parent had a history of abuse or domestic violence, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
The bill would also add to domestic violence statutes a definition of “coercive control,” or a “pattern of domination including intimidation, isolation, monitoring, economic abuse, and psychological manipulation,” according to meeting materials provided Wednesday. 
Wood said a repeated issue brought up in hearings was that domestic violence was being framed in some court cases as “mutual conflict.” 
“I think that kind of speaks to training,” Wood said. “A lot of the domestic violence health agencies I spoke with just said that there really is a lack of training and understanding of what a domestic violence survivor goes through and how that might apply in the actions or reactions.”

 Proposed bill would add custody interference to kidnapping law 

A repeated complaint in testimony was, although the law related to child custody court orders resides in the criminal code, law enforcement often did not feel empowered to enforce a civil matter. 
Task force members on Wednesday discussed a proposal to add “child custody interference,” to the kidnapping code, while adding escalating penalties for multiple offenses. Wood said she is working with Rep. Bruce Skaug, R-Nampa, to finalize a draft of the bill. 
Child custody interference would include knowingly and unlawfully taking away, withholding, concealing or failing to return a minor child in violation of a court custody order. 
The proposed penalties include a $50 fine for the first offense and a $300 fine for a second offense that happens within 12 months of the first. A third offense within two years would be a misdemeanor crime, with a fine up to $1,000 and incarceration for up to two weekends in jail. 
The proposed bill would include exceptions for actions taken with “articulatable facts” that the child faced imminent physical harm or required urgent medical care. 
The proposal would also enumerate law enforcement’s duties in these cases, including accepting, documenting and filing reports when a criminal complaint is made and to conduct an immediate welfare check on the child. 
 Lawmakers plan to workshop legislation ahead of 2026 session 

The task force cannot pass legislation, but it may present recommendations for fellow lawmakers to consider during the legislative session. Legislative Services Office bill drafters are expected to give members the updated proposal early next week.

Scott and co-Chair Sen. Tammy Nichols, R-Middleton, told the Sun that the task force won’t meet again but the hope is that members will look at the ideas and decide to bring proposed legislation themselves during the session, which begins Jan. 12. 
Scott said Wednesday that she and other lawmakers have repeatedly heard complaints about the judges presiding over family court cases. The courts have constitutionally protected separation of power from the Legislature to enforce laws. Scott said she wanted to focus on what was in the lawmakers’ purview. 
“I’m hearing, ‘you need to get rid of the judges.’ ‘The judges need this.’ ‘The judges need that,’” Scott said. “How can we expect to look at our judges honestly, and say they’re not doing a good job or they are, if we are not clear in our law?”

“Plastic is everywhere — wrapped around our food, stitched into our clothes, even coursing through our veins.” That’s how Judith Enck begins her new book, “The Problem with Plastic: How We Can Save Ourselves and our Planet Before It’s Too Late,” co-authored with Adam Mohoney. 
A former regional administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency, Enck warns that plastics are a toxic industry that are poisoning people and the environment. Plastic production has gone from two million tons per year in 1950, to 450 million tons per year today. 
The plastics industry has spent millions selling the material as safe and sustainable, but only 6% of plastic is recycled. Plastic recycling is a “false solution,” Enck said. “Plastic recycling has never worked. Never will work.” 
The plastics industry has “spent millions of dollars advertising, telling us, ‘don’t worry about all the plastic you’re generating,’ just toss it in your recycling bin. That is deceptive, and it is so deceptive that the Attorney General of California Rob Bonta sued the nation’s largest maker of plastic, the little mom and pop company known as Exxon Mobil, for deceptive claims around plastics recycling and chemical recycling.”
Plastic never breaks down. It breaks up into smaller microplastics, circulating in the environment for centuries, said Enck. “16,000 different chemicals are used to make plastic, and the chemicals will sometimes hitchhike on the microplastics. So we’re having the physical presence of microplastics in our bodies, but also the presence of chemicals that are used to make plastic, including PFAS chemicals, lead, mercury, formaldehyde.” Microplastics have been found in lungs, testicles, blood, breast milk and semen. They are associated with a rise in reproductive cancers, cardiovascular disease and diabetes, among other ailments.
The plastics industry has deployed an army of lobbyists to beat back attempts to limit the use of plastics. As an example, Enck cites New York’s effort this year to consider “a comprehensive packaging reduction bill that will reduce all single use packaging by 30% over 12 years.”
“This was the most lobbied bill in the 2026 legislative session in nearby Albany,” said Enck, noting that “there were 106 registered lobbyists against this bill, and 24 in support. I have never seen so many special interest lobbyists wandering the halls of the State Capitol in Albany, including the final night of the legislative session, where they killed the bill on the assembly floor after it passed in the State Senate.”
That experience has led Enck to conclude that “reducing plastic in our bodies, in our environment, in Lake Champlain, in the ocean, is more of a political science issue than a science issue. We have enough science to act.”
Judith Enck was appointed EPA regional administrator by former President Barack Obama and she has served as New York’s deputy secretary for the environment. She is now a professor at Bennington College and the founder and president of Beyond Plastics, a group that works to eliminate plastic pollution.

(Photo by yanguolin/iStock Getty Images Plus)Local governments in Iowa should pause the use of automated license plate readers, civil rights advocates said Wednesday, arguing the devices infringe on the privacy of drivers who have not violated any laws.
Researchers and technical and legal experts released a report Wednesday on automated license plate readers, or ALPRs. They said contracts made across the state between communities and the companies that provide the tools have created a “patchwork” network across the state where people’s data is tracked and saved for potential use by unknown parties.
Members of the ACLU of Iowa and University of Iowa Technology Law Clinic said Wednesday during a media conference they recommend that municipalities, counties and other community governing groups get out of their contracts for the cameras if possible and stand up to companies trying to gather data on residents’ travel habits. The ACLU of Iowa retained the technology law clinic to conduct the study, according to the report.

Pete McRoberts, policy director at the ACLU of Iowa, said the research team received varying responses from the 48 communities it contacted. Many provided information but others refused to state how many cameras they operate and where. Some claimed information that is disproven by their own contracts, he said.
“The patchwork of responses to this is really a good eye-opener as far as how problematic these contracts are,” McRoberts said.
Surveillance before a crime is committed
Unlike speed cameras or those placed at stoplights to catch drivers running a red light, automated license plate readers “capture and read license plates on all passing vehicles, so not just people that they suspect of violating a law,” ACLU of Iowa Legal Director Rita Bettis Austen said.
These pictures can provide a snapshot of where someone is at a given time, she said, with the devices recording date, time and location alongside license plate numbers.
Austen said the ACLU of Iowa “has been engaged in education and policy advocacy” related to ALPRs for just over a decade, but adoption of the technology, and its capabilities, has grown exponentially over the past couple of years. This has caused significant privacy and civil rights concerns for the organization, she said, as well as among Iowans.
“ALPRs are being placed along roadways throughout Iowa, and they’re taking thousands of snapshots of all of the license plates that are going by of all of the vehicles, and then that information can be fed into a network of nationally shared databases that are being maintained by these private vendors who contract with local governments to put these cameras up and access the data,” Austen said.
One in 10 of those captures will be incorrect in some way, Austen said, as the camera systems have been found to have a 10% error rate. The report provided examples from between 2009 and this year of drivers, some with family members in the car, being detained by police after an ALPR flagged their vehicle as stolen after misreading the license plate.
Examples of misuse of the camera systems and the databases where information is stored were also listed in the report. In one incident, according to the report, Sioux City police officers were using racist phrases to search ALPR databases. According to the report, the phrase used to search was “Traveling Romanian Theft Group.”
Austen acknowledged “non-objectionable potential uses of ALPRs,” such as checking license plates against lists of stolen cars, tracking license plates associated with AMBER alerts and collecting tolls, but said the lack of state regulation as to how this technology can be utilized is leaving the privacy of Iowans vulnerable.
ALPRs create network of surveillance
Flock Safety is the largest provider of ALPRs in the state, Austen said, and the report stated that the company’s systems hold more than 20 billion readings — an ever-growing number. She added the company’s business model “encourages” communities it works with to let their data go into a national database system in order for those communities to be able to “access the data that’s coming from other communities.”
UI Technology Law Clinic Director Megan Graham said during the media conference that ALPRs are “widely used in Iowa, and there is a substantial network of surveillance of this kind across the state.”
The team found 19 “transparency portals” with ALPR information from Iowa agencies contracted with Flock, Graham said, and between Nov. 8 and Dec. 7 of this year, the cameras in those agencies completed more than 4.2 million vehicle detections, with more than 90,000 detections per camera. There were 13 “hot lists” per 1,000 vehicles, she said.
Each group that uses the technology has control over how widely their data is shared and who has access to it internally, and their policies as to what is public information can be different from place to place.
“Iowans’ privacy is affected by these policies, and because of the policy differences, the policy shifts and changes as Iowans drive from place to place around the state,” Graham said.
Report encourages education 
Graham pointed out that while law enforcement and government agencies are using this technology, so are homeowners’ associations and private businesses. Flock Safety states on its website that private customers are unable to access law enforcement data but can share their data with police if they choose, and the company does not sell data — the customers are the ones who decide with whom to share data, and generally information in the company’s system is deleted after 30 days.
In Iowa, Austen said there is no state code requiring residents to be notified about ALPRs, and no state or local rules the team could find required a warrant to use the ALPR databases.
Of the nearly 50 communities the team reached out to about ALPR usage, Austen said the police departments in Des Moines and Clinton and the sheriff’s offices in Fayette, Fremont and Mills counties did not respond to inquiries by the report’s publication.
Des Moines police have “identified responsive records but have not shared them yet,” Graham said, and the Mills County Sheriff’s Office stated they couldn’t complete the team’s request due to staffing issues, but the sheriff’s offices of Fayette and Fremont counties have not responded at all.
Nearly every agency contacted by the team didn’t provide everything they requested, Graham said, mostly because they said they didn’t have the sought-after information, but there were some cases where agencies would refuse to provide information on where cameras are located or how many incorrect flags they get from the system.
“I do think that it’s ironic that our interest in trying to get access to these public records is to ensure the privacy of Iowans, and in comparison, the police that are withholding these record records are saying that they want to do so to ensure the privacy of surveillance technology,” Austen said. “So they want to watch us. They want to be able to do so in secrecy, and this is fundamentally at odds with our democracy and the way that most Americans want to live our lives.”
McRoberts said this variance in responses to records requests is a “good example” of how local governments are either unequipped or unwilling to deal with the consequences of their contracts relating to the violation of residents’ privacy. He cited a situation in which a “high ranking city official” denied that they were feeding data to their ALPR’s larger system when “it’s explicit that the contract gives a worldwide nonexclusive license for any of that data that’s collected.”
Calling the contracts “largely one-sided,” McRoberts said municipalities need to have their attorneys analyze them and recognize that they can try and protect their citizens’ privacy. If agencies are already contracted with a vendor, he added, they should try “to return to protecting individual privacy by using any legal means to get out of those contracts.”
Iowa lawmakers “have been very interested in finding out facts” about ALPRs and how cities are using them, McRoberts said, and the ACLU of Iowa is recommending to them that the state should “press pause on” the camera systems until the Iowa Legislature can figure out a potential “comprehensive fix on privacy.”
With laws already in place directing law enforcement to have a warrant for GPS tracking devices and other areas of technology surveillance, Austen said questions need to be asked whether law enforcement is using ALPRs in a way that “safeguards” against risks, if it’s appropriate for these agencies to have regulatory power over the technology and data and whether “broader, uniform minimum protections” should be in place for Iowans.
“That’s why the value of this report is an educational tool for the general public, for policymakers, to include city council members and state legislators,” McRoberts said. “This is a good day for openness and for transparency.”

Andy Beshear speaks to a crowd. (Provided by Office of the Governor)FRANKFORT — In the middle of his second and final term as Kentucky governor, Democrat Andy Beshear says he’s focused on helping Kentuckians keep the American Dream within reach. 
Beshear, 48, who will lead the red state through 2027, has spent much of the year pushing back against Republicans at the federal level, particularly when it comes to health care and food assistance jeopardized by the Trump administration.
As for what’s ahead, Beshear, who’s talked about as a presidential contender, recently became the head of the Democratic Governors Association, which will support candidates in 2026 elections and put the governor in a key position to influence national Democratic politics. 
Beshear has joined multiple lawsuits by Democratic state officials against the administration since Republican Donald Trump returned to the White House. In a Wednesday afternoon interview with the Lantern, he vowed to keep challenging the president. 
Beshear pointed to AmeriCorps funding being restored in Kentucky as an example of what Democrats can accomplish. AmeriCorps is a public service and volunteerism program that works with communities on housing, hunger, disaster relief and more.
“I sued on that. We won, but only the states that went to court got that funding,” Beshear said. “So, blue states or states with Democratic governors have AmeriCorps and Republican states do not, so we’re going to continue to stand up for our people.”
However, Beshear hopes “standing up for Kentuckians is bipartisan.” He referred to calls from Republican state lawmakers earlier this year for him to fill a funding gap in meals for seniors. His administration ended up re-allocating $9.1 million to support the program in October. 
“You know, I heard a lot of Republican senators push really hard on senior meals, saying, ‘Listen, people should have enough to eat. No one in my community should starve,’ but I didn’t hear one of them speak out when Donald Trump said he wasn’t going to pay SNAP benefits during the shutdown,” Beshear said. “Either you believe that people shouldn’t go hungry or you don’t. It shouldn’t be political.”
Beshear echoed comments he’s publicly made before, such as criticizing Trump for being the first president to not pay SNAP benefits during a government shutdown. The governor was also critical of threats by the Trump administration to block food assistance for states led by Democrats that have not complied with requests to provide personal information of SNAP recipients. 
“I promise to protect that data,” Beshear said. “I’ve gone to court once to protect it. I’ll do it again.”
What’s next? 
Beshear is seen by some as a 2028 presidential candidate given his repeated electability in red state Kentucky. However, he is “trying to live in the here and now,” adding that he will be governor until Dec. 14, 2027, and he doesn’t want to “waste a single minute or a single moment.” 
The governor also believes the next two years will be “complicated by federal policy … hurting our American families,” such as tariffs, rising costs and the GOP One Big Beautiful Bill Act (which Beshear called the “Big Ugly Bill”) that could put rural hospitals nationwide at risk. 
As leader of he Democratic Governors Association, Beshear said he’s “got 36 races to think about in 2026 before thinking about anything past it.” The association helps candidates across the country. 
But some Kentucky Democrats have suggested that Beshear enter the 2026 race for Kentucky’s open U.S. Senate seat. Longtime Republican U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell announced earlier this year that he would not seek reelection. Candidates — both Republican and Democratic — have lined up to launch campaigns to replace McConnell in office. 
Beshear doesn’t want to join them. 
“My parents always taught me never to interview for a job that you don’t want. At the end of the day, it’s just not something that I’m interested in,” Beshear said. “I’ve loved my time being governor. I wouldn’t give up one year of being governor for a six-year term in the U.S. Senate, and I like getting things done. Voting on the rule to the amendment to the continuing resolution — it just isn’t how I want to spend my days, and so if that means eventually going back into the private sector, I’m at peace with that. Getting to serve as governor for eight years is pretty special.”
He does believe that Democrats will be in good shape when it comes time for him to leave office, Beshear said. He sees a “big shift across the country,” and that “the Republican Party has turned its back on our American families” when it comes to affordability issues. 
Democrats have “a chance to be the party that reignites and refuels the American dream that focuses on families’ everyday concerns,” such as working hard to afford needs like groceries but also still being able to take family vacations and enjoying time together, the governor added.
“Part of the American Dream is that affordability,” he said. 
Final budget session
Next month, Kentucky lawmakers will return to Frankfort for the 2026 legislative session. It will also be the last time Beshear can make proposals for the next two-year state budget. 
Throughout Beshear’s time as governor, Republicans have held supermajorities in the state House and Senate, making it difficult for Beshear’s agenda to get through the General Assembly and all GOP legislation is veto-proof. 
Nevertheless, Beshear said his final budget proposal would include “investments in our Kentucky families” in areas such as job creation, health care and public education. He will unveil his recommendations at the annual State of the Commonwealth address the first week of January. 
“I don’t want to give away too much of what we’re going to be talking about, but to me it’s going to be centered on the fact that while we are doing better in Kentucky right now, life has gotten harder for many, if not most American families, and for government to work, we’ve got to be supporting that American Dream, where if you work hard and you play by the rules, that you can get ahead,” Beshear said. 
Beshear has taken steps to highlight one particular proposal he’ll put before the legislature — his Pre-K for All initiative. In June, he established an advisory committee of education officials, former Democratic and Republican state lawmakers and workforce development leaders to explore support among Kentuckians for universal pre-K programs. 
The group later announced its recommendations, including that Kentucky should phase expanded access to pre-K over several years. 
Asked if he had concerns about Pre-K for All becoming partisan in the Republican-controlled legislature, Beshear quipped he did not know “how four-year-olds can be partisan” as they can’t vote, “so if it becomes partisan, it is because someone made it partisan.”
Beshear said he’s approached the idea differently by going to rank-and-file Democrats and Republicans, particularly those in education policy.
He also said the proposal has changed since he first introduced the idea earlier this year after getting feedback from Kentuckians, including lawmakers. 
“This is going to be the people’s proposal,” Beshear continued. “And so if leadership from the other side wants to create an us versus them, it’s going to be them versus the people of Kentucky and their plan. But I hope that doesn’t happen.”
Also looking ahead, Beshear said his upcoming State of the Commonwealth address may have answers for a coalition of advocacy groups that urged him earlier this week to halt utility disconnections in Kentucky until March amid an uncertain future for federal housing, heating and food assistance. The group’s request was to issue a moratorium through executive order like Beshear had in the beginning months of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the governor said that he was able to do so in 2020 because of the state of emergency and powers it gave him.
“But what I’d tell that group is, tune in to the State of the Commonwealth and the budget address, and they’ll see how much I believe in helping people and keeping that heat on,” Beshear said.
Power of a Kentucky governor
Beshear has frequently defended his authority as governor against pushes by Republicans in the General Assembly to limit his power. 
Earlier this year, Beshear’s office appeared before the Kentucky Supreme Court to argue against two Republican-backed state laws that shift appointment power of the governor to other constitutional officers, all of whom are currently Republicans. 
Asked if he has concerns about similar efforts to limit his power in the next legislative session, Beshear said Kentucky Republicans should be asked about their support for checks and balances, as Trump has repeatedly tried to expand his own executive powers at the federal level. 
“I think to be fair, if they’re going to attempt to increase legislative power and decrease executive power, they should be asked about the federal government where a president they support is trying to vastly increase executive power,” Beshear said. “So, either you believe in checks and balances, or you don’t.” 
Amid legislation on the table for 2026, Northern Kentucky Republican TJ Roberts is working on a bill that would require all Kentucky police agencies, including the Kentucky State Police, to enter federal agreements with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for immigration enforcement under the 287(g) Program.
Beshear, who has authority over KSP as governor, expressed concern about the proposal, saying that day-to-day officers do not have the training ICE officers have, which includes an “intense education in federal immigration enforcement and federal law.” Beshear also pointed to reports that ICE has attempted to recruit employees from law enforcement agencies with which they have such agreements.
“I think what that bill would be doing is creating an open season on trying to take our law enforcement officers away from the city they’re working for, away from the county they’re working for, away from the state that they’re working for, and leave us with fewer day-to-day law enforcement officers that are keeping us safe,” Beshear said. 
Beshear said the executive branch he heads is “critically important” as it is charged with administering law. 
“A signing of a bill or a piece of legislation doesn’t get to the end result on its own. It takes an executive branch that operates, and operates in many instances quickly, to try to get especially positive results for our people,” the governor said. “So, limiting an executive branch could also limit the effectiveness of legislation they want to pass.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54810002888_bb76ce3ab6_o-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-10 18:57:48.902986

Under Section 2812 of the Election Code, people who are not registered as members of the two major political parties cannot vote in partisan primaries.
The group, which also includes David Thornburgh, chairman of Ballot PA Action and son of former Gov. Dick Thornburg, argues the provision is unconstitutional. 
It violates the right “to cast an equally weighted vote” and to “have an equal opportunity to translate votes into representation,” enshrined in the Free and Equal Elections Clause of the state Constitution, the lawsuit claims.
“After 88 years of being treated as second-class Pennsylvania citizens, 1.4 million independent voters will finally get our day in court,” Thornburgh said in a statement.

The filing in Commonwealth Court follows an unsuccessful request to the state Supreme Court to exercise its power to hear extraordinarily important or sensitive matters without first being considered in lower courts. The high court rejected the group’s King’s Bench petition in August.
“Our current law disenfranchises independent voters,” said Shanin Specter of Kline & Specter, who represents the independent voters. “It is past time independent voters are given the same rights as Republican and Democratic voters.” 
In addition to Kline and Specter, the five petitions are represented by Faegre Drinker Biddle & Reath.
The new petition includes expert testimony citing Pennsylvania election data that shows how denying unaffiliated voters participation in primaries dilutes the power of their votes.
Carnegie Mellon University Department of Mathematics Professor Wesley Pegden analyzed election data between 2002 and 2020 for all state House and Senate races. He also looked at mayoral and school board elections in the counties where the petitioners live and major local elections for mayor and other executive roles across the state.
The analysis measured voter influence, which is the number of votes it would take to flip the outcome of an election. The smaller the margin, the more individual votes matter in a given race, Ballot PA Action said in a news release. 
“Since Democratic and Republican voters get to vote in two elections — both a primary and a general election — and independents are only allowed to vote in the general election, the partisan voter’s influence is greater when elections are contested,” the organization said.
Pegden found the median influence of Democratic and Republican voters in legislative elections from 2002 to 2020 was nearly double that of independent voters. The only time affiliated and unaffiliated voters have equal influence is when the primary and general elections for an office are uncontested. 
“In other words, the only elections in which independent voters have equal electoral influence to partisan voters is when no voters have any choice at all,” Ballot PA Action said. 
According to the Department of State, more than 1.4 million Pennsylvanians are registered to vote as unaffiliated or as members of a minor party. The Democratic and Republican parties have 3.8 million and 3.6 million registered voters, respectively, according to the most recent count Nov. 3.
Legislation intended to end the prohibition on independent or unaffiliated voters casting ballots in primaries has also fizzled in recent years.
Rep. Jared Solomon (D-Philadelphia) has a bill currently making its way through the state House that would allow unaffiliated voters to participate in either the Democratic or Republican primary, but wouldn’t allow third-party voters. The legislation passed the House State Government Committee in May.
Sen. Lisa Boscola (D-Northampton) introduced a bill to end closed primaries in 2023 but it did not advance beyond the Senate State Government Committee. Boscola said earlier this year she intends to reintroduce the bill.
Sources vary, but Pennsylvania is one of between nine and 11 states with closed primaries in which only voters registered as a Democrat or Republican may vote. 
Other states allow voters to cast primary ballots through a variety of systems — ranging from registering with a party at the polls to choosing which party’s ballot to vote on in the voting booth, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/VOTE-ART-NEW-2-1024x704.jpeg,,,2025-12-10 18:57:48.902986

(Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)Montana’s tourism economy is centered on the outdoors — and nowhere is that more obvious than its national parks and monuments.
But beginning in 2026, the days in which visitors are allowed into them for free is changing, according to a press release from the U.S. National Park Service.
On Wednesday, it was also announced that a public lands group had sued the Trump administration for removing a photograph of Montana’s Glacier National Park on an annual pass as it was swapped for a collage portrait of George Washington and Donald J. Trump.
The Trump administration pushed back saying that the Glacier Park photograph would be used on national park passes for non-U.S. citizens, while the more common resident passes would contain Washington and Trump.
The Department of the Interior eliminated almost all the free-pass days listed for 2025, only keeping one of the eight designated days, Veterans Day (Nov. 11).
Instead, the Department of the Interior said that the new round of days will be “resident-only patriotic fee-free days.”
The newest line-up of fee-free days include Trump’s birthday, June 14, which is also Flag Day. It also includes former President Theodore Roosevelt’s birthday on Oct. 27.
Another change will be an increased fee system for out-of-country tourists. The fee-free days will not apply to out-of-country visitors.
Interior Secretary Doug Burgum explained the changes in a press release:
“President Trump’s leadership always puts American families first,” Burgum said. “These policies ensure that U.S. taxpayers, who already support the National Park System, continue to enjoy affordable access, while international visitors contribute their fair share to maintaining and improving our parks for future generations.”

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island’s child welfare agency shared one item from its wishlist with the state’s properties board on Tuesday: taking ownership of the former campus of St. Mary’s Home for Children, the nonprofit that ran the psychiatric care campus which closed its doors in August 2024 after a year of scandals and accusations of chaos and abuse.
The Rhode Island Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF) formally relayed its hopes to acquire the seven-building campus in North Providence at a Tuesday morning meeting of the State Properties Committee. No vote or action was taken after the DCYF’s presentation, which was only intended to begin the discussion of a possible state purchase of the complex owned by the dissolving nonprofit. 
The state has a ceiling price of $1.5 million under a tentative purchase and sale agreement for the 8-acre site with St. Mary’s. But the cost of renovating buildings and environmental remediation work could require spending up to an estimated $25 million more.
“We need to purchase St. Mary’s and move forward with the legislature’s plan to care for our own children by creating their own psychiatric residential treatment facility for adolescent girls in our state,” DCYF Director Ashley Deckert told the state panel. “This treatment is designed to reintegrate them into the families and communities of Rhode Island.”
The proposal would open up approximately 16 beds for adolescent girls and make available the highest level of psychiatric care beneath a hospital stay. DCYF would find a new provider to run the revived facilities, which would consist of three buildings which satisfy the federal label of a psychiatric residential treatment facility (PRTF), a Medicaid-subsidized form of care. 
Medicaid has traditionally excluded coverage for residential psychiatric care of adults, unless an institution has 16 or fewer beds. The rule does not apply to youth, but according to one Congressional Research Service brief, revisions to Medicaid coverage over the years suggest that “Congress supported the use of smaller facilities rather than larger institutions” when it comes to psychiatric care, making 16 beds a norm for Medicaid-supported institutions. 
Medicaid funded all youth who stayed at any of St. Mary’s psychiatric residential treatment units as of April 2024, according to an email from a former DCYF spokesperson.    
Recent history
The road to St. Mary’s closure in August 2024 began with an explosive December 2023 report from the Office of the Child Advocate, the watchdog agency charged with overseeing DCYF. The investigation found incidents of staff burnout and neglect, frequent runaways, teen overdoses, and improper reporting of such incidents to state regulators. 
The Child Advocate did not spare DCYF, however, and argued the agency often worked in siloes when overseeing St. Mary’s, magnifying its blindspots. The agency’s structuring of provider contracts tended to encourage overzealous placement at St. Mary’s, even if it was not the best fit for a particular youth.
Still, the Child Advocate’s office warned in January 2024 that the state needed the capacity of St. Mary’s. As of Wednesday, the state still does: There are 19 adolescent girls in out-of-state behavioral health placements, DCYF spokesperson Barb Francella said in an email to Rhode Island Current.
The overall number of out-of-state placements is 70, but most are boys who would not be treated at St. Mary’s. Wednesday’s numbers showed that boys with developmental or medical disabilities, numbering 26 overall, comprised the largest share of out-of-state placements.
DCYF stopped placements at St. Mary’s in early 2024, and eventually removed all children from the home. With the closure of St. Mary’s, Rhode Island lost its only psychiatric residential treatment facility. 
The lack of this particular brand of Medicaid-eligible facility has been a perennial problem for DCYF. In 2022, an open solicitation for new PRTF vendors attracted no viable bids. In a memo that year, DCYF asked the state purchasing department to waive the bid process and continue working with St. Mary’s as its only option, citing an “immediate and critical need” for these services for adolescent girls.
According to DCYF’s Tuesday presentation, the Fruit Hill Avenue complex is already outfitted to be a psychiatric residential treatment facility, offers necessary school, recreational and residential facilities not available elsewhere,” and represents the “best use of taxpayer money” for the state’s needed capacity.
Maintaining a psychiatric residential treatment facility within the state is not only a capacity issue for DCYF, but a way to satisfy its legal obligation. 
Per a consent decree with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced in December 2024, Rhode Island needs to broaden its options for kids with severe psychiatric issues — an order informed by the DOJ’s observance that DCYF had been “warehousing” kids in psychiatric hospitals for far too long because they had no other place to go. 
“A PRTF is necessary to fulfill our obligations under the federal Consent Decree,” read the DCYF presentation from Tuesday.
The consent decree, finalized in January 2025, does not specifically mandate a psychiatric residential treatment facility. A May 2025 report from the court-appointed monitor of the decree, however, noted that Rhode Island needs to build out its residential care options, and noted that the state lacks any PRTF capacity.

‘This transaction is pretty unique’
DCYF seeks to purchase the entirety of the two parcels of land that comprise the St. Mary’s Fruit Hill Avenue campus, but it would only immediately renovate three buildings for use. Two buildings would be used for residences and another would serve as an educational and recreational space, both of which are required to be designated as a psychiatric residential treatment facility.
“That’s a little different than what the committee normally sees,” committee member Rebecca Weber said of the $1.5 million cap.
Lisa Martinelli, the executive legal counsel for DCYF’s parent agency, the Executive Office of Health and Human Services, told the properties committee in her opening remarks, “From the legal standpoint, this transaction is pretty unique.”
The uniqueness derives from the deal’s price calculation, which is pegged to the costs associated with St. Mary’s dissolution. The nonprofit’s board has “agreed to a discounted purchase price which equals the remaining amount for St. Mary’s to dissolve,” Martinelli said.
Attorney Stephen Del Sesto, who represents St. Mary’s Board of Directors, told the properties panel that private developers had offered as much as $5 million for the property. The board declined those offers in favor of a potential state purchase which would continue the campus’ original purpose of serving youth.
Another nuance in the ownership switch-up involves leftover charitable donations given to St. Mary’s over the years. Del Sesto didn’t have a specific amount, but told the properties committee “it’s a significant amount of money.” 
If the state acquires the campus, Del Sesto said the “easiest way” to deal with eligible funds might be to transfer them to the state. The funds would not be part of the purchase price, he added, but could be transferred to the state with Attorney General approval under a doctrine known as cy-prés: The moving of funds intended for one purpose to the next most similar purpose.
“I mean, essentially it is an offset,” Martinelli said of the possible bonus funds. 
While Martinelli told the panel that there is no deadline attached to the sale, she cautioned that at least some haste would be prudent. That’s because the defunct campus will continue to generate expenses — fees which will ultimately influence the state’s final purchase price. 
“The longer this is delayed, the more expensive it is to the state,” Martinelli said.
Del Sesto said St. Mary’s has a similar perspective: “We have limited cash to maintain this space, which is why we needed to close…I can’t speak to any timing issues for the state, but the St. Mary’s has been in this dissolution mode now for about 15 months, and…cash is becoming critical, and timing is becoming critical.”
The purchase price does not bundle in the other costs associated with the project, namely the $15 to $20 million expected in renovation costs. 
Karen Greco, a spokesperson for the Department of Administration, said in an email Wednesday that a copy of the purchase and sale agreement can be shared “once it is executed.”
The State Properties Committee will reconvene to discuss the potential deal at a future meeting.

Old fruit orchard a lingering concern for Fruit Hill soil
The St. Mary’s campus received state approval for a makeover in 2023, prior to the fallout. When the facilities closed, the time-sensitive pandemic subsidies intended for that project were eventually transferred to a different type of residential facility under construction, Martinelli explained Tuesday. That facility broke ground in Exeter last summer.
But in 2024, before construction on the St. Mary’s expansion could continue, discovery of the Fruit Hill Avenue campus’ soil toxicity paused the buildout. 
The soil issues rose afresh at Tuesday’s meeting and consumed a chunk of discussion time. The state’s capital projects staff had Michael Flynn, principal environmental scientist with Pare Corporation, on hand Tuesday to discuss findings past and present. The state enlisted the company in 2025 to further investigate, according to an email from Department of Administration spokesperson Greco. 
Flynn told the properties panel that soil tests found elevated levels of lead, perhaps from old buildings’ paint, and arsenic, in a wooded area once home to a fruit orchard. There were also polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the soil, a byproduct of combustion. 
An estimated $1 million to $5 million could be spent on remediating the problem areas, said Dane Kwiatkowski of the Division of Capital Asset Management & Maintenance.
Flynn noted the contaminants are mostly a concern where kids could come into long-term contact with bare soil, and don’t pose a danger to drinking water or indoor air.
“What we’re seeing primarily is this stuff is in grassy areas,” Flynn said. “It’s kind of bound up in the matrix. It’s not a particularly dusty site.”
“These levels that we’re having are high enough to be concerned about,” Flynn said of the arsenic. “You definitely want to do something about them.”

Underutilized?
One person with mixed feelings about the state’s proposed purchase of the campus is North Providence Mayor Charles Lombardi, who previously sat on St. Mary’s board. 
Lombardi said in a phone interview Wednesday that he had hoped the property could become housing or some other source of revenue for the town. 
“I’m looking at the square footage there, and I’m saying, ‘Oh, man, this is perfect for resources for the town,’” Lombardi said. 
Because the campus sits in a residential neighborhood, Lombardi said he would like to see some of the vacant property on the complex’s backend ceded to the town.
Still, he added, he won’t be “negative toward a facility for…treatment for the needy children.” He said he’s fine that the campus might continue to provide the services it offered for decades before its closure last year. 
“But again, the majority of the board feels that the best use at this point in time is to enter into an agreement with the state. And like I said, I’m not going to be the person to try to make a big deal of that,” Lombardi said.
But asked about the state counsel’s assertion that time is short, Lombardi said, “That’s an understatement.”
The campus has sat vacant for months and is patrolled by local police to deter trespassing.  
“I’m just wondering why it took the state so long to make their feelings known here,” Lombardi said. “They should have made a move to purchase this property maybe a good 10 months ago.”

At a U.S. House hearing on Wednesday, lawmakers weighed changing a landmark federal voter registration law, the 1993 National Voter Registration Act, or NVRA, which requires state motor vehicle agencies to offer residents the opportunity to register to vote. Some conservatives say the law makes it too difficult for states to keep their voter rolls up to date.
Since President Donald Trump took office, the U.S. Departments of Justice and Homeland Security have ramped up efforts to scoop up data on voters and pressure state officials to conduct more aggressive maintenance of their lists to ensure that everyone on the roll is eligible to vote.
Justice Department sues 6 more states for voter lists

Some Democrats and privacy advocates have raised concerns about how the Trump administration plans to use the information. The Justice Department has sued more than a dozen mostly Democratic states, seeking to force officials to turn over lists of registered voters.
While Republicans control Congress and the White House, any GOP-led measure likely would  face a Democratic filibuster in the Senate. And the chance of major voting legislation clearing Congress before the November 2026 midterm elections is minimal. 
But Wednesday’s hearing before the Committee on House Administration’s Subcommittee on Elections showed that at least some congressional Republicans are fully on board with the Trump administration’s efforts to inject the federal government into a process, voting roll maintenance, that has historically been left to the states. 
Other congressional election measures have stalled, however. The House in April passed a measure that would require voters to show proof of citizenship when registering, but the bill has stalled in the Senate. Trump attempted to impose a proof of citizenship requirement through an executive order that has been blocked in federal court.










Election officials benefit from clear and unambiguous laws, which will help them carry out their duties and ensure voter lists are accurate and up to date. 


– U.S. Rep. Laurel Lee, Florida Republican 


U.S. Rep. Laurel Lee, a Florida Republican who chairs the subcommittee, said the NVRA’s language on maintenance of state voter rolls should be more clear. The law requires states to have a general program of maintenance but leaves many of the specifics up to states.
“Election officials benefit from clear and unambiguous laws, which will help them carry out their duties and ensure voter lists are accurate and up to date,” Lee said at the hearing.
Options for data sharing
Michael Morley, a law professor and the faculty director of the Election Law Center at Florida State University, testified that the NVRA only allows states to remove voters due to changes in their circumstances, such as a felony conviction or death. The law doesn’t explicitly allow states to remove voters who should have never been registered in the first place, he said.
Morley urged lawmakers to amend the law to require states to try to identify voters “who are ineligible on any basis” — a change that could significantly expand the scope of voter removals.
“There are a variety of circumstances under which a person could be ineligible to vote,” Morley told lawmakers, such as a lack of citizenship or a move out of state.  
4 Republican states will help Homeland Security obtain driver’s license records

Morley also raised the prospect of Congress mandating that state election officials receive information from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s SAVE system, a powerful search tool originally built to check the immigration status of individuals applying for government benefits. The Trump administration has repurposed SAVE into a program to verify citizenship.
Homeland Security has been encouraging states to upload their voter rolls into SAVE, after the agency linked the program with Social Security data in May.
“This committee could look at the possibility of either requiring states to enter into agreements to receive information from the SAVE database, or potentially even other databases to the extent that there are other agencies that have information concerning citizenship that could be shared with states,” Morley said. 
Some Democratic state election officials oppose using SAVE, citing worries about whether residents’ personal data could be shared with other agencies. Unredacted voter rolls often contain driver’s license numbers and partial Social Security numbers.
Twelve state secretaries of state submitted a federal public comment on Dec. 1 sharply criticizing the SAVE rollout. The changes to SAVE “are likely to degrade, not enhance, State efforts to ensure free, fair, and secure elections,” they wrote.
“This is, again, part of a power grab pattern when it comes to control over our elections,” Minnesota Democratic Secretary of State Steve Simon told Stateline earlier this month.
Many Republican secretaries of state had called on the Trump administration to implement the changes to SAVE. A handful of GOP states also sued Homeland Security last year, alleging the Biden administration wasn’t doing enough to help states identify ineligible voters; those states — Florida, Indiana, Iowa and Ohio — settled with the Trump administration in late November.
“Accurate and up-to-date voter rolls are essential for safe, secure, transparent, and accessible elections,” Montana Republican Secretary of State Christi Jacobsen said in a November news release announcing that her state would soon use SAVE.
Worries about ‘overzealous’ purges
On Wednesday, Sophia Lin Lakin, director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Voting Rights Project, cautioned lawmakers against engaging in “overzealous” purges of voters. 
Homeland Security wants state driver’s license data for sweeping citizenship program

The current law, she testified at the U.S. House hearing, includes protections that guard against hasty removals of voters made in error. For example, the NVRA mandates a 90-day “quiet period” before federal elections that prevents election officials from systematically removing ineligible voters during that period.
“This prevents last-minute purges that leave voters to discover they’ve been removed and get back on the rolls in time to cast a ball that will count,” Lakin testified.
U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell of Alabama, the ranking Democrat on the subcommittee, said Americans too often have to jump over unnecessary barriers to cast their ballots. She said conspiracy theories and misinformation surrounding elections have spurred state-level legislation to make voting harder.
“The NVRA is a critical component to our federal voting legislation,” Sewell said, “and it provides vital access and protections to voters, as well as guardrails for election officials to conduct voter maintenance.”

Superintendent Bob Thibault said the agreement is “not an admission of wrongdoing in this case.”

The Windham Central Supervisory Union will pay a historic $250,000 in damages to two Black students who allegedly faced discrimination, under a settlement agreement signed last month.
The consolidated lawsuit had alleged that school authorities did “little or nothing” to deal with the complaints reported at the Leland & Gray Union Middle and High School in Townshend. As part of the settlement, the school district also agreed to centralize and improve its recordkeeping and implement training sessions to better handle hazing, harassment and bullying in school. 
It is the largest single settlement in the history of the Vermont Human Rights Commission, according to a press release Thursday.
“This settlement represents a significant step forward in our ongoing efforts to ensure that every student can learn and thrive in a safe and inclusive environment,” Big Hartman, executive director and general counsel of the Human Rights Commission, said in the release.
The commission received complaints and took up the cases involving harassment faced in school by two students of color. The lawsuits outline pervasive incidents of racial harassment including students calling a Black male student the N-word and “little brown banana” and a Black female student being teased and taunted and called “lesbian” due her sexual orientation.
The commission determined that both students were racially discriminated against in violation of the Vermont Fair Housing and Public Accommodations Act, according to the lawsuits filed in 2022 and 2024 in Vermont Superior Court.
Bob Thibault, superintendent of schools for WCSU, said the agreement is “a means of avoiding “protracted litigation with families” and “not an admission of wrongdoing in this case.” He noted the settlement money will come from the union’s insurer and not taxpayers.
“We are pleased to resolve the lawsuit on favorable terms given that it covers two students with two separate claims,” he wrote in an emailed statement Friday.  “The School is constantly working to improve and welcomes the additional training from HRC to supplement our own rigorous training on the prevention of harassment.”
A training program will be developed in partnership with the Human Rights Commission and Windham County NAACP to be implemented over the next three academic years, according to the settlement agreement signed last month.
“By investing in comprehensive training for supervisory union staff, we are committed to creating lasting change that will benefit students, families, and educators alike. Schools and administrators must understand the importance of addressing student discrimination and following the mandates of Title 16’s harassment complaint process,” Hartman said in the release.
Mary Gannon, an education consultant and vice president of the Windham County NAACP, said the settlement brings justice to the students and helps families pay for the expenses incurred due to ongoing harassment. But school leaders hiding behind settlements to avoid acknowledging the harm done is “absolutely preposterous,” she said.
“So no, you didn’t do the best you could and that’s been an issue at Leland & Gray for a very long time, as it is with other schools that we are talking with, some of which have cases in front of the Human Rights Commission,” Gannon said. “We have a lot of people in positions of leadership, mostly white men, who don’t have an understanding of what the cumulative impact is of something like this.”
Conflicts of interest and insurance companies, law firms and school boards protecting their own further hinder progress on hazing, harassment and bullying (HHB) cases, she said, adding that Vermont needs to better foster individual responsibility among educational leaders.
This settlement comes after the Agency of Education reestablished an HHB prevention advisory council this year to seek advice and recommendations to update current policies.
The state agency has created a new Safe and Healthy Schools Division, according to agency spokesperson Toren Ballard. It aims to help schools foster a safe, inclusive and culturally responsive environment for students, educators and staff. 
“This renewed focus is crucial in ensuring that instances such as those that occurred at Leland and Gray Middle School do not happen again,” Ballard said in a Monday email.

Persistent racial harassment
The lawsuits shared with VTDigger describe complaints from the parents of two Black students who faced multi-year harassment at the Leland & Gray Middle and High School in Townshend, a small Windham County town.
According to the first complaint, an unnamed minor identified as A.B., who attended the school from 2019 to 2022 and was the only Black student there, was subjected by students to “continuing unwelcome conduct, including verbal, written, visual, and physical conduct” and electronic communications based on his racial identity. 
Incidents outlined in the complaint included students calling him the N-word and “little brown banana” and described white basketball players mocking a kneeling pose used by professional athletes protesting police harassment during the Black Lives Matter movement.
Despite written or verbal accounts of the incidents he faced, authorities at the school and the district “failed to take prompt and appropriate remedial action” or follow their own policies for addressing student harassment, the complaint noted.
While he started school as a “personable, intelligent, curious student and athlete, eager and willing to make friends, and interested in participating in and learning at school with other children,” the “pervasive harassment” A.B. faced at Leland & Gray “substantially and adversely” affected his access to equal education there, according to the complaint. 
As a result, A.B. self-isolated, lost interest in attending school and participating in sports, refused to socialize with other students and cried when he came home from school.
Eventually, his parents transferred A.B. to private school and began mental health treatment for him in March 2022, “all at considerable expense,” to “protect their son from continued harassment, suffering, and denial of educational opportunities,” according to the lawsuit filed April 2024.

‘Little or nothing’ done
In the second complaint, a Black female student identified as D.B., faced “unwelcome conduct” from other students about her sexual orientation from 2020 to 2022. These included “verbal, written, visual, physical conduct, the use of epithets, stereotypes, slurs, comments, insults, derogatory remarks, gestures, threats, graffiti,” and the display or circulation of written or visual material, the complaint filed in May 2024 states.
Examples include a student threatening to “beat the fucking shit out of” D.B. because of D.B.’s sexual orientation. A dean handling complaints in school reportedly overheard the threat and emailed the parent to notify a student had spoken “in an unkind way” and would be disciplined. But nothing was done, according to the Human Rights Commission.
The complaint outlined other incidents in which D.B. was allegedly called “lesbian” by a student who took food from her tray at lunch, bit into it and threw it back on her tray, and another where students drew graffiti on the bathroom wall insinuating that D.B. and her best friend were lesbians.
“D.B. was thereafter repeatedly humiliated, even by students she did not know, including by being told “to shut the fuck up” or “to get her [ass] out of here,” according to the complaint.
The complaint noted that school and district authorities who were notified of the incidents “imposed little or no discipline” on the perpetrators for the harassment.
The parents withdrew D.B. from school in March 2022 “to protect their daughter from continued harassment, suffering, and denial of educational opportunities,” according to the complaint.
D.B. entered the school as a “personable, intelligent, and curious student, eager and willing to make friends,” but by the end of those two years her performance declined and she became “depressed and self-isolating,” lost interest in going to school, refused to socialize with other children and came home crying, the complaint stated. 
The complaints state the school and district “did little or nothing to satisfy the requirements” of its own policy to prevent harassment, “failed to take prompt remedial action” to stop the harassment, “failed to keep contemporaneous or accurate records” of the harassment the two students faced and as required by Vermont statute.
School discrimination cases in Vermont have surged in recent years, yet very few make it to the Vermont Human Rights Commission. Last December, the commission was forced to stop taking cases in a year that saw a record increase, due to a serious funding gap.The commission that enforces anti-discrimination and civil rights laws in Vermont has declined to investigate 45 cases in the current fiscal year and has requested three new positions for fiscal year 2027, according to Hartman. It is currently investigating 12 school discrimination complaints and has accepted two additional school cases that have not yet been initiated.
These are among 23 cases accepted by the commission this fiscal year. It has 70 open investigations and 14 cases under litigation currently.
Students push for reform
Last week, parents and students shared similar testimony of discrimination faced in other schools at a press conference announcing the next phase of Narratives for Change, a statewide campaign, at Essex Middle School. 
Alice Langbauer, a youth organizer for the Education Justice Coalition and a Colchester High School student, said they faced increased bullying after reporting harassment. Friends were afraid to speak up on their behalf because of potential retaliation from peers, they said, and school leaders did nothing to address the issue. 
“I’ve experienced bullying getting worse or more people joining in on the bullying after reporting,” said Langbauer, who called for the agency to include whistleblower protection in its hazing, harassment and bullying policy “because knowing that someone will report them makes a bully feel unsafe.”
Superintendent of Schools Amy Minor said she was sad to hear of it because addressing harassment and making sure students are heard is “a core priority” at the Colchester School District. When she hears about students feeling unheard or unsupported, she said she takes it as an opportunity to examine their systems and make improvements.
“Personally, I really want to make sure that every student feels safe, respected and supported in our schools,” she said Wednesday.
In Berkshire, a middle school student was urged to report sexually explicit comments from a classmate, but no action was taken when she was called a racial slur at school, said parent Caroline Elander. 
“I don’t feel like educators are given enough help,” she said in the release. “Right now the staff don’t know how to stop (bullies) from picking on other kids. There needs to be specific training to support staff to interrupt harm.”
Youth advocates outlined progress made in some areas, such as students in White River Valley School District creating a youth council to process cases of harassment and bullying. They demanded the state agency implement student-driven priorities — such as whistleblower protection, mandatory intervention and restorative justice — to address “the growing crisis” of harassment incidents across Vermont schools. 
“At its root, bullying and harassment is about power and abuses of power. Schools must use their power to intervene on behalf of those who are being harmed,” Alyssa Chen, co-coordinator of the Education Justice Coalition, said at the Dec. 3 press conference.
The concerns “underscore the need for proactive engagement that centers the lived experiences of students, educators, and caregivers,” Ballard, the Agency of Education spokesperson, said in an email, which is why Secretary of Education Zoie Saunders reestablished the Hazing, Harassment and Bullying Advisory Council this year.
“The Agency is listening, and we are deeply appreciative of the students, educators, and caregivers who have engaged in this process,” Ballard wrote. “The Agency looks forward to continuing to collectively work towards our shared goal of ensuring that every student in Vermont can learn and thrive in a safe and supportive setting where every member of the community is treated with respect.”

Ron DeSantis unveiled a $117.3 billion state budget proposal Wednesday, his eighth and last, that includes new money for a Make America Healthy Again commission, transfers part of the University of South Florida to New College, and bolsters military installations in hopes of deterring oil drilling off the Florida coast.
The proposal, which runs roughly $3 billion higher than the current-year budget, would allocate a record $1.56 billion for teacher salary increases, $14.3 billion for infrastructure and transportation projects, and $1.4 billion for Everglades and water quality projects.
“​​Since I became governor, we have run budget surpluses, reduced the state’s legacy debt by more than 50%, and enacted record tax relief,” DeSantis said in a statement, hours after his Orlando budget rollout. “Today I announced the ‘Floridians First’ Budget, which will keep Florida on the course of fiscal responsibility and delivers on the priorities that have made Florida the greatest state in America.” 
His proposal would eliminate 354 vacant positions — 225 of which are county health roles — and launch novel testing of contaminants in food with a $5 million allocation toward Florida’s new MAHA Commission, co-chaired by First Lady Casey DeSantis and Lieutenant Gov. Jay Collins.
The commission emerged in September as a way for Florida to align with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy’s nationwide push to “make America healthy again” through targeting processed foods and chemicals, and questioning water fluoridation.
The governor proposed a bill, too, that would transfer land from University of South Florida’s Sarasota-Manatee campus to New College of Florida. DeSantis proposed last session that those Ringling Museum facilities be transferred to New College. 
The governor’s budget would expand the school guardian program, providing security to K-12 schools, colleges, and universities, with about $6 million to implement it. 
Another provision is aimed at an emerging battle between Florida officials and the Trump administration. DeSantis wants to allocate $6 million to the Florida Defense Support Commission and $1.5 million for the Defense Reinvestment Grant Program to counter the White House’s plan to explore for oil off the Florida Gulf coast.
“This investment is especially critical as Florida continues to advocate that leasing of oil and gas developments off Florida’s Gulf coast may negatively impact the Gulf Testing Range,” the governor’s office wrote in the budget proposal. 
The document referred to concerns that the military’s ability to train in the Panhandle would be severely hindered by oil rigs near their training areas. Florida has multiple military bases in Panama City and the Pensacola area.
One of the big items being sought by DeSantis is $1.56 billion targeted for teacher pay raises, nearly 15% more toward increases than last year. The governor emphasized that the stand-alone item for teacher pay can ensure that money appropriated from Tallahassee goes to the classroom and benefits students.
“The classroom, 90% of it is what teacher do you have standing in front of the classroom. That’s the most important thing,” DeSantis said.
Fiscal strength
DeSantis, who is term-limited from running for reelection, touted the state’s fiscal strength, noting that his proposed spending plan earmarks $118 million for the Budget Stabilization Fund, also known as the state’s “rainy day” fund. DeSantis has tripled the amount in the fund since first taking office. The fund could reach the constitutional limit of $5 billion next year if the Legislature approves.
“Our overall footprint from a government perspective is that we have the lowest number of state government workers per capita and we either are the lowest or the second-lowest in state spending per capita of all 50 states. So, the outcomes are superior to states that are spending 25, 50, 100 percent more per capita … ,” DeSantis said.
The 2026 regular legislative session begins Jan.13. Although the Legislature will consider thousands of bills during the 60-day session, there is just one they are required to pass: the General Appropriations Act, or the budget. If lawmakers are unable to pass a budget within that time, the Legislature can extend the session or call a special session.
Homestead property tax relief
DeSantis focused much of his energy on the proposed spending plan but also used the opportunity to push for property tax reductions for homestead properties in the coming session. DeSantis’ budget would set aside $300 million to “support ongoing property tax relief conversations.”
DeSantis called the issue “huge” and said he’d have more to say about it “going forward.”
“But we have an opportunity to give people relief on this. So, we’re going to be working, you know, I know there’s been a lot of great work that is being discussed, you know, I’ve been talking with some of the senators, but I know some House members are working on a lot of stuff. We got to be bold, we got to be strong, and we got to do something that’s going to have a meaningful difference in people’s lives and the lives of families. And, you know, otherwise, you know, it just ain’t gonna it ain’t gonna fly,” DeSantis said.
No money for social justice, net zero policies
DeSantis’s budget includes funding for 25 additional circuit and county court judges.
The governor’s budget bill would amend a 2023 statute that made it illegal for a governmental entity, the state group health insurance plan, or a state-contracted health care provider to spend state dollars on gender-affirming or -conforming care.
The bill would expand that law to ban all governmental entities from spending tax dollars on “efforts which advance, promote, entertain, or support fundamental considerations of social justice, including those focused on critical race theory; diversity, equity, and inclusion; or that otherwise defend the concept that mankind is inherently racist, sexist, or oppressive, whether consciously or unconsciously, solely by virtue of his or her race or sex.” 
DeSantis’s proposed budget bill would prevent governmental entities from spending funds to advance, promote, entertain, or support Net Zero policies, carbon taxes and assessments, and carbon emission trading programs, commonly known as cap-and-trade or cap-and-tax programs. The bill would amend statutes to say such  programs are “detrimental to the state’s energy security and economic interests. “
He’s also suggesting $693,455 — nearly identical to the current budget — for the State Board of Immigration, a commission created during the 2025 session to oversee Florida’s immigration laws and ensure statewide enforcement and compliance.
The governor’s budget would expand the school guardian program, providing security to K-12 schools, colleges, and universities and about $6 million to implement it.

Vermont has in recent years lost hundreds of homes to flood damage and subsequent property buyouts.

This story, by Report for America corps member Carly Berlin, was produced through a partnership between VTDigger and Vermont Public.
In the aftermath of three consecutive summers of damaging floods, state officials have awarded nearly $50 million in federal flood recovery grants. The lion’s share of the funding is going toward housing construction on higher ground.
“The majority of these funds are focused on housing projects that will create new units which are out of harm’s way for future storms and help replace units we’ve lost in recent years due to the severe weather events we’ve faced,” said Nate Formalarie, deputy commissioner of the Department of Housing and Community Development, at a Wednesday press conference.
Vermont has in recent years lost hundreds of homes to flood damage and subsequent property buyouts, in which the government pays owners of properties for their homes and turns lots into greenspace. Flood recovery grants are a form of long-term disaster aid that is appropriated by Congress. For communities around the country, these funds are a rare opportunity to use federal disaster recovery money to construct new homes where they didn’t exist before.
In Vermont, these funds, which are Community Development Block Grants for disaster recovery, are tied specifically to the July 2023 floods. The funding has been awarded to 25 projects concentrated primarily in Washington and Lamoille counties, two of the hardest hit areas in the state that year. 
The housing projects include the construction of a 31-unit apartment building in downtown Barre, the renovation of a vacant Vermont State University building in Johnson into housing and the conversion of an underutilized office building into apartments in Montpelier.
“These efforts represent recovery and stability,” said Angie Harbin, director of Downstreet Housing and Community Development, the primary affordable housing nonprofit in central Vermont, at the press conference. Her community development organization received $14.5 million of the federal grant funding.
State officials received over $120 million in applications for the funds from municipalities, developers and planning commissions, which was nearly twice the amount of money available.

One project left out of the mix was the high-profile redevelopment of Barre’s North End neighborhood, first pitched by Gov. Phil Scott, a native of Barre, soon after floodwaters devastated the area over two years ago.
Without these federal funds, the original vision for Barre’s North End is now on “life support,” said Barre City Manager Nicolas Storellicastro. City officials denied Federal Emergency Management Agency buyouts to many homeowners there because approving them would stipulate that nothing could be built on those lots in the future. Such a scenario would deplete the city’s housing stock and property tax rolls. Storellicastro had hoped these more flexible federal funds would be the key to fixing up the neighborhood.
“That one…you know, tugs at the heartstrings, because there’s people still living in that neighborhood who want a way out,” Storellicastro said. Barre City did receive funding to acquire land and build out infrastructure for a separate housing development as well as grants for widening a floodplain and planning future stormwater upgrades.
Formalarie said state officials prioritized projects that had other funding already lined up and were close to “shovel ready,” among other factors.
Other awards went to relocating a homeless shelter in Barre out of the flood zone, restoring a floodplain in Hardwick and replacing a bridge in Cabot to better accommodate rising waters.
State officials are accepting applications for another $14.4 million in federal recovery funding specifically for housing projects that needed a little more time to finalize their proposals, Formalerie said. Pre-applications are due by Jan. 12.

(Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)The number of Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainees held at an Estancia jail has decreased sharply since its contract with the federal government expired Oct. 31, according to newly released data.
The number of detainees dropped from a peak of up to 700 detainees in May to approximately 340 as of late November, according to data from the Deportation Data Project, run by a team of lawyers and academics who analyze ICE data they receive via public records requests. 
According to that data and interviews with people with regular access to the jail, the decline began on or shortly after Oct. 31, when an intergovernmental service agreement between ICE and Torrance County expired without explanation.
Torrance County immigration detention center continues operating without ICE contract

The contract’s expiration means ICE no longer pays roughly $2.5 million monthly to private contractor CoreCivic, Torrance County officials said during a County Commission meeting Wednesday in Estancia. Officials told Source New Mexico they are concerned about the potential economic implications for the county, which relies on the jail as a major employer and tax revenue source, if the population continues to decline and no contract extension is reached. 
While the expiration and subsequent detainee decline have no immediate financial implications for the county, County Manager Jordan Varela said he is keenly interested in what a new contract might say and what that could mean for the jail’s future. 
“The big financial obligation would be if the facility closed, because we lose that guaranteed revenue and, two, now we incur the expenses of having to transport our inmates miles away to other counties,” he said. 
Immigrant advocates, however, said they remain concerned that CoreCivic, the private company, no longer has any financial incentive or legal reason to provide adequate care at a facility they say already has a long history of substandard care. 
“Conditions there could continue to decline, and it’s alarming that hundreds of people are being held in New Mexico under no apparent authority,” Zoe Bowman, managing attorney at the New Mexico Immigrant Law Center, which has clients at the jail, told Source New Mexico. 
The expiration has renewed calls from advocates and U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-NM) that ICE immediately stop housing detainees in Torrance County. Standard operating procedures require that ICE remove all detainees and equipment absent a contract, and Heinrich has pressed ICE’s director to explain what legal authority it has to continue holding detainees. 
The decrease in population identified in the Deportation Data Project has continued into December, according to PJ Podesta, a senior program manager for Innovation Law Lab, which conducts weekly jail visits. His best estimate is that 250 ICE detainees are at the jail, based on conversations with detainees in different pods. 
NM advisers to US Civil Rights Commission call for closure of ICE detention facilities

The decline is “striking,” Bowman said, given that the number of ICE detainees is increasing or staying level at New Mexico’s other two ICE detention facilities in Milan and Chaparral, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearing House,  along with other facilities across the country amid President Donald Trump’s mass deportation push. 
“The Trump administration is doing absolutely everything they can to detain as many people as possible and fill ICE detention beds,” she said.
Podesta and Rogelio Bolufé, a Cuban immigrant detained at the facility who says he’s also witnessed the decline, told Source that they believe the reduction in population is because CoreCivic is not admitting new detainees, while ICE is transferring detainees out at the usual rate.
The detainees Podesta has been able to track from Estancia have mostly ended up at Camp East Montana, an ICE detention facility at Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas. 
Source New Mexico asked ICE and CoreCivic on Tuesday about whether a decrease has occurred and, if so, what the reason might be behind it, including whether the expired contract played a role. Source also asked what a decline in detainees could mean for the future of the facility. 
An ICE spokesperson did not respond to Source New Mexico’s request for comment. CoreCivic spokesperson Brian Todd did not address those questions in an emailed response to Source New Mexico, though he noted that the population “may fluctuate week to week” at the jail.

Thirteen Republicans joined all Democrats voting for the resolution. Maine’s Jared Golden, a Democrat, and Pennsylvania's Brian Fitzpatrick, a Republican, forced the vote by garnering enough signatures from lawmakers under a legislative move known as a discharge petition. The procedure allows rank-and-file members to compel the chamber to vote on measures that are not brought up by the leadership of the majority party, which is how bills typically reach the floor.Wednesday’s vote was to discharge the bill out of committee and bring it to the floor for a vote. A vote on the bill itself is expected Thursday. The discharge petition gained the 218 signatures needed from 213 Democrats and five Republicans: Fitzpatrick, Don Bacon of Nebraska, Rob Bresnahan of Pennsylvania, and Nick LaLota and Mike Lawler of New York. In March, Trump signed an executive order that banned collective bargaining agreements for federal agencies dealing with national security. Those agencies include the departments of Defense, Veteran Affairs, Homeland Security, State and Energy, along with the National Science Foundation, the U.S. Coast Guard, most entities within the Department of Justice and several pandemic response and refugee resettlement agencies within the Health and Human Services Department, among others. “Protecting America’s national security is a core constitutional duty, and President Trump refuses to let union obstruction interfere with his efforts to protect Americans and our national interests,” according to the executive order.Federal law enforcement and firefighters are exempt from the order.Bargaining agreements for federal employees are somewhat limited.

A federal judge in Boston has ordered the Trump administration to restore a record the government previously wiped so that Rümeysa Öztürk, the Turkish student who was detained in Vermont and other states by immigration agents earlier this year, can take on paid research jobs as part of her studies.
The Tufts University Ph.D. student was first arrested in March by masked federal agents on a street in Somerville, Massachusetts. She was whisked north and held overnight at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in St. Albans, before being transferred via Patrick Leahy Burlington International Airport to an ICE detention center in Louisiana. The federal government has not charged Öztürk with a crime related to its case against her.
ICE officials have said they took Öztürk to Vermont because it was the closest facility they had available to detain her at the time. Her lawyers have contended, however, that the move was an effort to muddy the waters over which state her detention could be legally challenged in.

ICE held Öztürk in Louisiana for 45 days until a Vermont federal judge ordered her release on bail.
Just hours after the government arrested Öztürk in March, it also terminated her record in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System, or SEVIS, according to court records. ICE uses the system to track international students who live in the U.S.
According to court filings, without that record, Öztürk has been unable to participate in a paid research assistantship under her academic advisor that both she, and the advisor, say would be a substantial benefit to her studies and her career. Öztürk is studying child development and the impact of media on children’s well-being.
On Monday, U.S. District Court Judge Denise J. Casper granted Öztürk’s request for a preliminary injunction ordering the government to restore her SEVIS record. In Casper’s decision, the judge determined Öztürk would face “irreparable harm” from a continued inability to take on new research opportunities, including financial losses.
The Trump administration had argued in court filings that a federal district court judge had no authority to weigh in on its decision to terminate Öztürk’s SEVIS record.
Öztürk, in a statement provided by the American Civil Liberties Union, which has been part of the legal team representing her in court, said she was grateful for the court’s decision though felt “a great deal of grief for all the educational rights I have been arbitrarily denied as a scholar and a woman in my final year of doctoral studies.”
“Nonetheless,” she added, “this decision gives me hope, and I earnestly hope that no one else experiences the injustices I have suffered.”
Öztürk appears to have been targeted by the Trump administration for an op-ed she co-wrote in Tufts’ student newspaper that criticized the school’s response to Israel’s war in Gaza. The Trump administration has said it arrested her in Somerville following a decision to revoke her student visa, though her attorneys say she got no notice of that decision until after being taken into custody. The government has not challenged her lawyers’ assertion that she was targeted in the first place over the newspaper article.
Öztürk has since been challenging the legal merits of her arrest and her subsequent detention in federal court, in large part on grounds that it violated the First Amendment. In May, a federal judge in Burlington ruled that Öztürk should not be kept in custody while that legal challenge is being considered, so she was released. The judge found that Öztürk’s right to free speech was being chilled by her ongoing detention and that ICE was not giving her adequate care for her asthma while detaining her.
At the same time, because her visa was revoked, Öztürk is facing the possibility of being deported. She is challenging those removal proceedings, but that is taking place in the federal immigration court system, which is separate from the U.S. district courts where judges are considering her challenge to the legal merits of her detention.

Now, with arrests up, stepped-up enforcement on camping and overall crime sticking to a downward trend, some said Tuesday they’re satisfied with the department’s direction under new police Chief Brian Redd.

House Speaker Mike Schultz praised Redd’s “great work” and Mayor Erin Mendenhall’s “true leadership.” Nonetheless, Schultz and other members of an audit committee turned their attention to the rearview mirror Tuesday, reviewing findings of an inquiry that blames ex-chief Mike Brown’s leadership for past problems in the state’s largest municipal police force. 
The panel, co-chaired by Schultz and Senate President Stuart Adams, deemed the review a priority in a November 2024 meeting, roughly a month before they called on Mendenhall to “restore public confidence, security and safety” to Utah’s capital city.  
Will the Utah Legislature follow SLC mayor’s plan for public safety, homelessness?

The mayor responded by releasing a wide-ranging plan, and Brown announced less than a month later that he intended to retire.
The legislative audit released Tuesday pointed to poor culture and morale that auditors said stemmed from Brown’s “poor leadership.” But Brown, who led the department for 10 years before stepping down in February, called it a “political attack” that “functioned as a vehicle to present a manufactured partisan indictment, not a fair and independent inquiry.”
Brown said in an emailed statement Tuesday that legislative auditors didn’t get in touch with him or ask him to respond to their findings. 
“That deliberate omission is more revealing than any conclusion they have tried to represent as objective,” Brown said.
The auditors wrote that “the previous chief’s inability to make decisions empowered civilian risk-management advisors to effectively lead the department.” They said oversight and planning weren’t priorities, officers were sometimes paid for hours they didn’t work, and administrative leave was “misused.”

Brown defended his record as chief, saying his leadership delivered “innovative policing strategies, stronger community engagement, and safer streets. Those results are still being felt across the city today and carrying it forward.” 
Mayor Erin Mendenhall and Chief Brian Redd said they’re working closely together on the department’s new vision. They said funding from the Legislature has contributed to pay raises that have helped recruit and retain officers. 
“We’re going to keep working hand in glove as we undo the challenges that this department faced over the years, and the audit has helped provide great clarity for us,” Mendenhall said. 
Redd said his department is staffed “at full strength” and crime has ticked down this year, but with a rise in violent crime he said is driven by cases of rape and sexual assault he believes are being reported by people as they’re booked into jail. 
He said officers paid for hours not worked were disciplined before he started the job in March 2025 and the police department’s changing how officers report their hours, with a new system starting in the first quarter of 2026. 
House Minority Leader Angela Romero, D-Salt Lake City, told the mayor and police chief that “with you leading, I fully trust we’re going to get to where we need to.” Romero noted that apart from her part-time job as a lawmaker, she’s also an employee of the city. 
House Majority Leader Casey Snider, R-Paradise, added, “you have stepped up and it is noticeable.”  
The audit committee also scrutinized the Salt Lake County District Attorney’s Office, the Salt Lake County Jail and the county’s criminal justice system as a whole, with a focus on those committing repeat offenses.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/60D3B598-9D91-452A-887D-1669F4FB48CC_1_105_c-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-12-10 17:57:46.798173

(Photo by Glen Stubbe/Minnesota Reformer)Gov. Tim Walz on Wednesday urged U.S. Secretary of Homeland Secretary Kristi Noem to review all recent arrests in Minnesota after reports that at least two U.S. citizens were detained this week in the Trump administration’s mass deportation campaign.
On Tuesday, a man alleged that federal immigration officers chased him on foot in Minneapolis’ Cedar-Riverside neighborhood, tackled him and arrested him even though he’s a U.S. citizen, the Sahan Journal reported. Mubashir, who declined to share his last name, said he offered to show officers his I.D. and said he was a citizen multiple times. The officers ignored him, Mubashir said.
A 55-year-old woman, who is a U.S. citizen, was also arrested in Minneapolis Tuesday after confronting Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers over the arrest of her neighbors, according to MPR News.
In his letter to Noem, Walz said the arrests raise concerns about the due process rights of U.S citizens.
“The forcefulness, lack of communication and unlawful practices displayed by your agents will not be tolerated in Minnesota,” Walz told Noem in his letter.
Walz urged the Homeland Security secretary to find out whether agents possessed a warrant authorizing search and seizure. Any federal agents who acted unlawfully should be placed on administrative leave, Walz wrote.
The Minnesota governor, who is seeking reelection to a third term next year, also asked that Noem clarify the legal standard for citizen observing law enforcement interactions, ensure ICE agents receive clear guidance about respecting the civil rights of U.S. citizens and to “reassess the broader ‘surge’ enforcement strategy.”
The Trump administration has ramped up the presence of federal agents in Minnesota in the past two weeks. It’s unclear how many people have been detained by ICE. DHS has identified 19 people arrested by agents who are allegedly in the U.S. illegally and have criminal records.
“Our state’s safety and community trust depend not only on effective law enforcement, but on justice, fairness and respect for civil liberties,” Walz said in his letter. “We cannot allow public trust to be further damaged by detaining citizens under unclear or questionable circumstances.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/08-Noem-MN-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-10 17:57:46.798173

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)The gender equity nonprofit Gender Justice sued Swift County and the Minnesota Department of Corrections Wednesday on behalf of a transgender teenage girl who was placed in a state-licensed group home that did not affirm her gender.
The lawsuit, filed in Ramsey County District Court, alleges that Swift County officials and the Minnesota Department of Corrections violated the Minnesota Human Rights Act and the Equal Protection clause of the Constitution by forcing the girl to stay in boys’ facilities, where she was subject to bullying and harassment on the basis of her gender identity. 
The Minnesota Human Rights Act protects Minnesotans from discrimination on the basis of race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, gender — including gender identity — in employment, housing, education, public benefits and more. The Department of Corrections and its Commissioner Paul Schnell are defendants in the lawsuit because the department licensed the group home in question. 
When the child, who is identified only by the initials S.R. in the lawsuit, entered foster care in 2020 at the age of 12, she told her mother she did not want to stay in a boys’ home because she was a transgender girl. The mother then requested that her child be placed in an LGBTQ-friendly home.
The lawsuit alleges that Swift County instead placed her in a group home that assigned children sleeping arrangements and activities based on biological sex rather than gender. 
Boys in the home called the child slurs and harassed her by repeatedly asking her questions about her genitals, according to the complaint. When the child and her mother requested an alternative placement, their request was denied. 
“Transgender youth in Minnesota have the right to safe and affirming care, including in the foster care system,” said Sara Jane Baldwin, senior staff attorney at Gender Justice, in a press release. “When a foster care facility discriminates against a child and the agencies overseeing it fail to act, that’s a violation of the law and a betrayal of public trust.”
LGBTQ youth are over-represented in the child welfare system, accounting for approximately 20% of foster youth nationwide, according to a report by the Minnesota Department of Human Services. The report found that LGBTQ youth are twice as likely as non-LGBTQ children to report mistreatment in out-of-home care. 
The complaint notes that after the girl returned to her mother’s custody in June 2021, the child’s therapist reported that her “aggressive behaviors probably occurred due to a placement in a facility that was not set up for transgender youth.”
A spokesperson for the Minnesota Department of Corrections said the department does not comment on ongoing litigation.

Bob Ferguson signed a statewide emergency declaration on Wednesday.
Ferguson said he’d also seek an expedited emergency declaration from the federal government in response to the flooding, which is the result of an atmospheric river that has dumped multiple inches of rain in parts of the state since Monday. 
A National Weather Service forecast for Wednesday morning through Thursday afternoon showed 6 to 8 inches of rain in communities on the western edge of the Cascades, like Concrete, Gold Bar and Darrington. Even more rain was forecast at higher elevations.
“Lives will be at stake in the coming days,” Ferguson said, urging people to follow evacuation orders. 
Ferguson also activated the Washington National Guard through Dec. 31. Adjutant General Gent Welsh said there’d be 100 National Guard members deployed immediately and more than 300 by the end of the day tomorrow, including aviators and rescue specialists.
National Guard members will be positioned tonight near Skagit County, according to Karina Shagren, a spokesperson for the Washington Military Department.
Robert Ezelle, director of the Washington Military Department’s Emergency Management Division, emphasized the deluge was “far from done” and warned that next week could bring more wet weather.
Rivers from around the Canadian border down to southwest Washington are at moderate to major flood stage, with water levels expected to remain high through the end of the week. Officials expect a number of rivers to reach or exceed record flood levels.
A chief concern is the Skagit River, where Ezelle said current flood levels are expected to surpass a 1990 record by about 4 feet upriver.
County officials are preparing to evacuate about 75,000 people from low-lying areas in that region, according to Ezelle.
He said levees on the Skagit and other rivers could be overtopped, as well as a floodwall in Arlington.
The emergency declaration will give the state the chance to seek federal funds in response to the flooding. Ferguson described the federal declaration as critical and said it would help to unlock potentially life-saving resources for the state.
A slew of major routes and local roads are experiencing closures.
A 50-mile stretch of Highway 2 is closed between Index and Coles Corner, west of Leavenworth, due to heavy rain causing slides and flooding of the highway. As of 2 p.m., state transportation officials had no estimate on when the major east-west route would reopen.

The unsolved murder case of Manchester resident Sarah Hunter nearly four decades ago finally came to a close Tuesday.
The longtime suspect David A. Morrison pleaded guilty Tuesday afternoon to first-degree murder in Bennington County Criminal Court and was sentenced to life in prison without parole. 
Earlier that morning, Morrison pleaded guilty in Berkshire Superior Court to a kidnapping in Massachusetts over 40 years ago and was sentenced to two to four years in prison, according to a joint press release from the Berkshire County State’s Attorney’s Office and the Bennington County State’s Attorney’s Office. 
Morrison had been serving a life sentence with the possibility of parole in California for kidnapping with a firearm, sexual assault and robbery, according to the press release. 
Morrison, 65, will serve out a life sentence without parole in Vermont, concurrent with the  sentences in Massachusetts and California. Morrison was transferred and booked at Southern State Correctional Facility in Springfield Tuesday, according to the Vermont Department of Corrections offender locator. 
“The guilty pleas entered by Mr. Morrison to these terrible crimes, including the abduction, sexual assault and murder of Vermont resident Sarah Hunter, bring a long-awaited resolution to cases whose impact continues to resonate through families and communities to this day,” said Maj. John-Paul Schmidt, commander of the Vermont State Police Criminal Division, according to the joint press release.

In September 1986, Hunter, a 32-year-old local golf pro at the time, was kidnapped and murdered, and her body was found in Danby. Morrison admitted to taking Hunter by force after she visited a gas station in Manchester. Morrison placed her in the trunk of his car bound and gagged and stabbed scissors into her ear, killing her, according to court documents. 
Morrison faced charges for Hunter’s murder over a decade ago, but the case was dismissed after a discrepancy over where key evidence was located. Morrison pleaded not guilty at the time but told police earlier in a jailhouse interview he would address Hunter’s murder when he “felt it was time,” and that he thought he would not “take this to my grave.” 
At the Berkshire Superior Court in Massachusetts, Morrison pleaded guilty Tuesday morning to kidnapping Laura Sheriden in 1981. A 15-year-old at the time, Sheriden was hitchhiking and received a ride from Morrison. After Morission passed her house and pulled out a gun, Sheriden fought Morrison and escaped the kidnapping, according to the press release. 
Bennington County State’s Attorney Erica Marthage said at a Wednesday press conference that the cooperation between law enforcement and state officials in Vermont, California and Massachusetts was crucial in coming to a complex interstate agreement and finding resolution in these cases. 
Jared Bianchi, Bennington County Deputy State’s Attorney, said in an interview that the three-state requisition agreement required review by attorneys in each state and a signature by the Governors of each of the three states, including Gov. Phil Scott. 
Marthage gave special thanks to Detective Sergeant Samuel Truex, who was the original investigator of Hunter’s murder case and came out of retirement to aid its resolution 39 years later. 
Morrison’s indictment in Massachusetts was the missing “chess piece” to closing the cases, Marthage added. 
“I think it was just all those pieces and that collaboration and setting aside all of our individual agendas and getting this done,” Marthage said. 
At the press conference, Sheriden said she admired the people dedicated to finding resolution for her and Hunter’s cases and the sense of “finality” it brought to the Hunter family. 
Wilmington’s Haystack Golf Course has previously hosted golf tournaments named and held in Hunter’s honor, and “in recognition of the career she could have and should have had had David Morrison not crossed her path,” Sheriden said. 
“Yesterday, when I kind of fully processed what this meant for Sarah Hunter, that was really tough,” Sheriden said. “I know she lives on through her family.”

(Photo by Kyle Joly/National Park Service)A population decline is continuing in one of North America’s biggest caribou herds, threatening hunting opportunities for rural residents who depend on the animals for food.
The Western Arctic Caribou Herd, which ranges in Northwest Alaska, is down to 121,000 animals, according to the most recent census by state biologists and their partners.
It is the lowest population since the 1970s, continuing a slide since 2003, when the herd peaked at 490,000 animals. In 2023, the last time a population survey was completed, the herd was down to 152,000 animals. 
Alex Hansen, a Kotzebue-based wildlife biologist for the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, presented the population numbers on Tuesday to the Western Arctic Caribou Herd Working Group.
“So, no end in sight at this point. Certainly, some concerns we all have, and not sure where this is going,” Hansen told the group at a meeting in Anchorage. “But hopefully, we can get through it together.”
The likely response, he said, will be additional hunting restrictions.
The Western Arctic Caribou Herd Working Group, which began its three-day annual meeting on Tuesday, will consider making recommendations for such restrictions.
The group is made up of subsistence users, hunting guides, conservationists and others with interest in the herd, and advises state and federal management regulators. As the herd has declined, state and federal agencies have imposed hunting restrictions, based in part on recommendations made by the working group.
Hansen said biologists calculate that the population, at its current size, will likely support a hunt of about 5,800 animals, far below the general goal of up to 20,000 animals.
While calf birth rates and survival rates are adequate, the herd’s problem comes down to survival rates for adult caribou, especially for adult female caribou, he said.
“We’re seeing that we’re not getting the survival rates that we need to keep this population going and growing as we continue to decline. If we expect to see growth, we probably want to see that survival rate of 85% or higher,” he said. Instead, the survival rate is believed to be 79%, he said.

	Refraining from hunting females will be key to preserving the herd, he said.
“If we want to continue to drive this population further into decline, harvesting cows is the way to do it,” he said. “If we want to avoid that, removing cow harvest is one of the few things we can do to accomplish this.”
Charlie Lean, a working group member from Nome, said he sees evidence of the decline.
“it’s pretty grim,” Lean said. “From Nome, from my viewpoint, the caribou were very hard to find. They’re not coming as far on the Seward Peninsula as they used to.”
But hunting limits can cause hardships in the Indigenous villages where residents depend on the hunts for subsistence.
Mary Hugo, a working group member from Anaktuvuk Pass, said she understands the gravity of the problem and the desire to prevent hunting of females.
However, male caribou do not migrate in the area around her non-coastal North Slope village, she said. That makes it difficult for her to sign onto any possible recommendation that hunting of females cease, she said.
“We’re still hunting what goes around, and it’s just females. So it’s hard for me to have an opinion about something that I feel so personal about, because I hunt for my family, and that’s basically saying that I can’t hunt for my kids,” she said, her voice breaking. “So for us to hunt females, it’s not what we want to do, but if we have no choice, we will.”
It is unclear whether the Western Arctic herd is again the biggest in Alaska.
In recent years, that distinction belonged to the Porcupine Caribou Herd, which has a range that straddles the Alaska-Canada border. The Porcupine herd hit an all-time high of 218,000 in the last population census, completed in 2017.
That made it one of the few tundra caribou herds in the Arctic that was not declining during the past two decades.
However, release of new population census is pending, and there are now signs of decline in that herd as well.
Arctic-wide, tundra caribou herd populations have declined by about two thirds over the past two to three decades, according to last year’s Arctic Report Card issued by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Applying a new policy update Bluesky also implemented in Australia, the decentralized social media platform said it would allow legal adults in Mississippi to access its app, while keeping the service unavailable for minors. Bluesky made the change after altering its “Age Assurance system,” despite its ongoing concerns over a 2024 Mississippi state law that requires users of websites and other digital services to verify their age.
“We continue to believe that Mississippi law limits free speech and disproportionately harms smaller platforms,” the company said in a statement. “As a result, we will not follow the law’s requirements to track children’s online conduct in detail, and we will not devote our limited resources to build the verification systems, parental consent workflows, and compliance infrastructure the law requires. However, because we have the technical means to offer a choice for older users, we want to let them decide for themselves if they are comfortable confirming that they are at least 18 years old.”
In August, Bluesky announced that it would go dark in Mississippi after the U.S. Supreme Court declined to block a Mississippi age-verification law, which the company said limits free expression, invades people’s privacy and unfairly targets smaller social media companies.
Bluesky grew after the 2024 presidential election. Many users of X, which is owned by Elon Musk, retreated from the platform in response to the billionaire’s strong support of President Donald Trump.
Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch, a Republican whose office defended the law, told the justices that age verification could help protect young people from “sexual abuse, trafficking, physical violence, sextortion and more,” activities that the First Amendment does not protect.
The age verification law added Mississippi to a list of Republican-led states where similar legal challenges are playing out.
NetChoice is challenging laws passed in Mississippi and other states that require social media users to verify their ages, and asked the Supreme Court to keep the measure on hold while a lawsuit plays out.
That came after a federal judge prevented the 2024 law from taking effect. But a three-judge panel of the 5th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals ruled in July that the law could be enforced while the lawsuit proceeds.
On Aug. 14, the Supreme Court rejected an emergency appeal from a tech industry group representing major platforms such as Facebook, X and YouTube.

Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham), right.Direct punches have been few and far between on the Democratic Party side of the 2026 U.S. Senate nomination fight, but that changed Wednesday when two of the race’s heavy hitters – Mallory McMorrow and Haley Stevens – threw their respective gloves to the ground.
It was a sign of life for a primary battle that is expected to be politically bloody – and expensive – and could be a harbinger of gut punches to come.
This week, McMorrow (D-Royal Oak) celebrated the passage of a 10-year Michigan economic development plan that she championed alongside state Sen. John Damoose (R-Harbor Springs). McMorrow’s bill would assess the diverse needs of the state by region, including those regions’ challenges with infrastructure, transportation, housing and other amenities needed for economic growth. Development strategies would be hammered out from those region-based assessments.
On Wednesday, Stevens (D-Birmingham), a current member of Congress, introduced articles of impeachment against U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Her announcement followed a September comment in which Stevens said she planned to file an impeachment resolution against Kennedy for a host of reasons. U.S. Rep. Shri Thanedar (D-Detroit) last week issued similar articles of impeachment against U.S. Department of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.
Haley Stevens introduces articles of impeachment against federal health secretary RFK Jr.

For the most part, both McMorrow, Stevens and Abdul El-Sayed, the progressive in the race also seeking the nomination, have stayed in their lanes and saved their punches for Republican former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers of White Lake, who at present is the frontrunner in the GOP side of the contest, including a coveted endorsement from President Donald Trump.
McMorrow, however, saw an opportunity to pounce on Stevens for what appeared to her campaign as pure “political theater” – referencing, of course, the new articles of impeachment against Kennedy.
“On Tuesday, McMorrow passed a raft of legislation to boost Michigan’s economy and keep money in Michiganders’ pockets.” the release said. “Notably, her decade-long economic development plan cleared the Michigan Senate with bipartisan support, earning praise from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. The legislation, co-sponsored with Republican Senator John Damoose, creates a holistic, region-by-region approach to economic growth that addresses infrastructure, housing, and community needs across the state.”
Field shaping up in Michigan’s contested U.S. Senate race

The release went on to quote McMorrow, who rallied around her work in the Senate. That included the economic plan, but also a bill preventing unemployment benefits clawbacks that would have cost almost 350,000 Michiganders thousands of dollars, despite their not having participated in any wrongdoing; a bill to broaden a program addressing blighted brownfields; legislation protecting against invasive bodily exams while under anesthesia; and a bill to safeguard domestic violence and stalking victims.
“Real economic growth requires vision and measurable metrics.” McMorrow said in a statement. “My legislation gets at the heart of what actually makes communities thrive – it sets out a clear, long-term roadmap to make sure every corner of our state has the tools and resources to succeed, not just today, but for generations to come.”
McMorrow’s campaign specifically contrasted that work against Stevens’ work in Congress.
“At the same time, Stevens, describing herself as a ‘serious lawmaker’ and ‘not one for political theater,’ filed impeachment articles that, according to the New York Times, ‘do not have the support of her party’s leaders and are all but certain to fail,’” McMorrow’s campaign said. “Even Stevens’ Democratic colleagues view the impeachment push as ‘the politically motivated move of a candidate who has struggled to gain traction in a heated primary,’ the Times reported.”
Decade-long, bipartisan Michigan economic development plan championed by McMorrow passes Senate

The campaign went on to say that McMorrow knows Kennedy has “no business being in power, but the way to stop his dangerous overreach is communicating everywhere and winning at the ballot box, not doomed resolutions and political stunts.”
Stevens’ campaign swung back hard.
“Haley’s job is to fight for Michigan and protect Michiganders’ health and safety,” Stevens campaign manager Sam Barrett said in a statement to Michigan Advance. “After months of working with doctors, scientists, and her colleagues in the House to fight back against Secretary Kennedy’s chaotic and reckless policies that put Michiganders’ lives at risk, Haley took the serious step of introducing articles of impeachment.”
Barrett said that Stevens, as someone who has been consistently named one of the most effective Democrats in the House, knows “it is her responsibility to stand up for Michiganders.”

“Anyone who thinks we should let RFK continue to wreak havoc on health care instead of using every tool available to hold him accountable is wrong,” Barrett said.
While striking, it wasn’t the first crack at the bat for a candidate against another in the Senate race. El-Sayed took a swipe at McMorrow after she took heat for her shifting stance on the Israeli war on Gaza and the ongoing genocide of the Palestinian people, which McMorrow has acknowledged is a genocide. El-Sayed has held that position since he launched his campaign.
At a November college Democrats event at Michigan State University, El-Sayed noted, with a few barbs, that the issue was something that separated him and McMorrow and especially Stevens, who has not acknowledged the situation in Gaza as a genocide but has called for an end to the war. Stevens is also a strong supporter of Israel and has been backed by pro-Israel political action committees.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_1182-1024x541.jpg,,,2025-12-10 17:57:46.798173

New guidance from the U.S. Department of Agriculture requires that certain groups of noncitizens who were recently denied food assistance in Vermont should regain eligibility, according to advocates. 
Among those who will regain access to benefits are green card holders who entered the country as refugees and asylees, as well as Afghan Special Immigrant Visa recipients, advocates said.
Advocates said Tuesday’s memo will require the state to restore eligibility to dozens of the more than 140 households statewide who have lost access to food benefits due to visa status in recent months, following the congressional passage of July’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

Molly Gray, who leads the Vermont Afghan Alliance and coordinates support for a number of Special Immigrant Visa holders, said Wednesday that the return of food assistance would be a huge relief to many “given the significant humanitarian impact this has had on our newest Vermonters.”
The federal clarification was long overdue, she and other advocates agreed. Meredith Owen Edwards, senior director of policy and advocacy at Refugee Council USA, called previous federal guidance “contradictory and confusing,” in an interview Wednesday.
Gray and others have maintained throughout the last several months that Vermont erroneously removed several groups from food assistance, while officials in Gov. Phil Scott’s administration said their decisions were informed by federal law and USDA guidance. The eligibility of Special Immigrant Visa holders — participants in a program supporting largely Afghan nationals who assisted the U.S. military during the war in their home country — was particularly contested.
The Department for Children and Families, which administers 3SquaresVT, did not respond to requests for comment.
In recent months, the groups affected by Tuesday’s memo were removed from 3SquaresVT, Vermont’s version of SNAP, unless they had been a lawful permanent resident for five years or longer. The new guidance states that these populations are eligible for SNAP as soon as they become lawful permanent residents, a status change marked with a green card.
Edwards welcomed the announcement, which she said should help enable affected groups “to actually meet their basic needs.”
Refugees and asylees can generally apply for a green card after one year — though Reuters recently reported that such requests had been frozen at the federal level — while Special Immigrant Visa holders become lawful permanent residents immediately on arrival.
Advocates said the timeline for reinstating benefits to the relevant households remained unclear Wednesday. Gray said her team had offered its services to help the state “reenroll eligible individuals as quickly as possible.”
The development comes after Vermont Attorney General Charity Clark joined a multistate lawsuit earlier this month seeking to force the Trump administration to clarify its policies and allow those groups to access the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.
Amelia Vath, a spokesperson for Clark, pointed to the fact that Tuesday’s guidance came hours before the Trump administration’s Wednesday response deadline in that suit.
“We believe this development is a direct result of the lawsuit,” Vath said in an emailed statement Wednesday. “While we see this as a positive step towards ensuring all those who are entitled to get SNAP benefits are able to get them, there may still (be) work to be done,” she added.

The U.S. Supreme Court Wednesday heard arguments in an Alabama death penalty case, in which the state is challenging lower court determinations that Joseph Clifton Smith, convicted of the 1997 murder of Durk Van Dam, is intellectually disabled and ineligible for the death penalty.  (Jane Norman/States Newsroom)The U.S. Supreme Court Wednesday heard arguments in an Alabama death penalty case in which the state is challenging multiple federal courts’ determinations that a death row inmate is intellectually disabled and ineligible for capital punishment.
The three liberal justices on the nation’s highest court questioned the attorneys from the Alabama Attorney General’s Office about what attorneys for the state called errors made by U.S. District Court Judge Callie V. S. Granade when she ruled in 2021 that Joseph Clifton Smith, convicted and sentenced to death for the 1997 murder of Durk Van Dam, had IQ scores that made him ineligible for the death penalty.
The state argues that Smith scored above 70 on IQ tests, one of several factors in Alabama’s administrative code used to determine intellectual disability. Robert Michael Overing, an attorney with the Alabama Attorney General’s Office who argued on behalf of the state, said both the lower court and the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals erred in their judgments.

“He didn’t come close to proving an IQ of 70 or below, with scores of 75, 74, 72, 78, and 74, but the lower courts changed the rules,” he said.
In its appeal to the nation’s highest court, attorneys for the Alabama Attorney General’s Office said that both the federal district court and the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals changed the standard and that, by the results of Smith’s IQ scores, he is not intellectually disabled.

Following oral arguments, Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall said Smith’s IQ scores indicate that he does not have an intellectual disability.
“The Eleventh Circuit’s approach would require states to ignore clear evidence to indulge hypotheticals designed to delay a convicted capital murderer from accountability after 27 years,” Marshall said in the news release. “The people of Alabama have the right to enforce the punishment chosen by their laws and juries, and our team has presented a strong case before the Justices to hold the line against criminals who have committed heinous murders.”
The federal district court focused on Smith’s lowest IQ scores and, along with the margin of error, ruled that his IQ could be below 70. The lower court also used other evidence for his daily life called adaptive functioning to declare that Smith had an intellectual disability.
The attorneys for Smith said that the lower courts judged the case correctly, citing Hall v. Florida, a 2014 U.S. Supreme Court case in which the court ruled that a strict IQ threshold for determining intellectual disabilities in executions was unconstitutional.
“I am holding all 12 reported cases on this issue post Hall in Alabama, and there is not a single case, including the two that my friend mentioned, in which the court said, ‘We are only going to look at the test scores, we are not going to consider the other evidence,’” said Seth P. Waxman, an attorney for Smith.
The more liberal justices expressed skepticism of Overing’s argument.
“What the district court did here was not only look at the IQ scores holistically, but also other evidence of adaptive functioning, and that is precisely what our case law says what the courts are supposed to do,” said Ketanji Brown Jackson, associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.
Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the case troubled her, because Alabama did not make the same argument throughout the appeals process but used the same standard that others have used in the past.
“You didn’t argue this below,” she said. “Your own expert did exactly what you say is wrong. Your expert said he (Smith) had valid scores between 72 and 78, and he relied on all the other indicia to determine that he believed this person was not intellectually disabled.”
Overing said courts have reviewed other cases in the same way but did not grant an exception based on intellectual disability based on the other evidence besides IQ scores.
“There is certainly not an Alabama case in which the courts used the lowest score alone and said that represents a possibility of intellectual deficits,” Overing said.
Waxman also said that Alabama statute follows the decision that the U.S. Supreme Court made that allows courts to look beyond just the IQ scores of defendants when deciding if they have an intellectual disability.
“That includes evidence of intellectual functioning other than IQ test scores at least where a court, considering expert testimony, concludes that those scores alone don’t decide the issue,” Waxman said.
Associate Justice Sam Alito said that the law could be interpreted another way, that it allows states to define whether someone has an intellectual disability without violating the Eighth Amendment — which bans cruel and unusual punishment — so long as they are doing it in a way that is not permitted.
“And so long as a state does not go below that floor, a state court does not go below that floor, there’s no Eighth Amendment violation,” he said. “And so long as a state does not go below that floor, a state court does not go below that floor, there’s no Eighth Amendment violation.”
Waxman did not directly answer the question before the justices moved on.

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – The Oklahoma Democratic Party is challenging what it says is a decision by the Oklahoma Election Board to close the party’s primaries.
The Oklahoma Election Board on Wednesday issued a press release saying no party notified the agency by deadline that it wanted to open its primaries.
As a result, all party primary elections will be closed to the over 487,900 registered independent voters in the upcoming elections.
The Oklahoma Democratic Party for a decade had opened its primaries to independents. 
It voted in June to continue the practice and notified the Oklahoma Election Board in August by sending the agency its minutes from the meeting, said Lauren Craig, Oklahoma Democratic Party executive director.
“In our mind, we had done all the appropriate steps,” Craig said.
The party said it did not learn of the decision to close its primaries until the press release, the party said.
“Oklahoma Democrats welcome independents in our elections,” said Erin Brewer, the state chair. “We value their voices in selecting our general election candidates. We are working with the State Election Board to correct this error and exploring legal counsel if necessary.”

Craig said it was a “miscommunication.”
“We were shocked to get this news,” Craig said.
Paul Ziriax, Oklahoma Election Board secretary, said state law “is very clear,” and “unambiguous.”
He said that although not required by law, he sent out a reminder on Oct. 30 and a follow up letter on Dec. 3.
He said the notice the Oklahoma Democratic Party sent the agency in August was about changing the party’s symbol on the ballot, not about open primaries.
Ziriax said he has never had a party fail to meet the deadline and was a little surprised by the party’s reaction.
He said it is regrettable if the party intended to notify the agency but failed to do so.
“It is a done deal,” Ziriax said.
Oklahoma is one of about a dozen states that has  a modified primary system.
To participate in a party’s primary or primary runoff election, a person must be a registered voter of that party, with an exception.
In every odd-numbered year between Nov. 1 and Nov. 30, recognized political parties can notify the State Election Board that they have opened their primaries to independents.
If a party notifies the agency, the deadline is extended to Dec. 15 for the other recognized parties to respond.
If notice is not provided, primaries remain closed, according to the Oklahoma Election Board.
Oklahoma has three recognized political parties, Democrat, Republican and Libertarian.
Recently, only Democrats have chosen to open their primaries to nonaffiliated voters.
The dispute over access also comes as supporters of open primaries are seeking to gather enough signatures to put the issue on the ballot in the form of State Question 836.
Jan. 26 is the deadline to submit the 172,993 signatures needed to get the constitutional amendment on the ballot, according to the Oklahoma Secretary of State.
State Question 836 proponent Tony Stobbe, a retired U.S. Coast Guard commander, said the dispute underscores the need for reform. He said he is not able to vote in an election that decides anything.
“It’s wrong that hundreds of thousands of taxpayers, including veterans like me, are shut out of the process,” he said.
The announcement from the Oklahoma Election Board “means it’s more important than ever that we give Oklahomans a chance to open our primaries and ensure all registered voters can participate in our elections,” Stobbe said.
As of Nov. 30, Oklahoma had nearly 2.4 million voters.
Of those, nearly 1.28 million were Republicans, 608,661 were Democrats, 487,927 were independents and 23,277 were Libertarians.

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Colorado health officials continue to recommend universal hepatitis B vaccinations for newborns after the Trump administration changed a policy that has been an accepted standard for more than 30 years. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted last week to move away from a recommendation that all newborns receive the hepatitis B vaccine, now recommending doses only for infants whose mothers test positive for the virus or whose status is unknown.
The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment next Wednesday will ask the Colorado Board of Health to incorporate vaccine recommendations from the 2025 American Academy of Pediatrics, which recommends universal hepatitis B birth doses, into its vaccine requirements for children in schools. The emergency rulemaking is necessary so that the switch to following the academy’s recommendations can take effect immediately, CDPHE spokesperson Hope Shuler said.

Colorado still requires children attending child care or school to receive the hepatitis B vaccine, and most insurance plans will continue to pay for the birth dose of the vaccine. 
The U.S. has seen a 99% reduction in pediatric hepatitis B infections since the birth dose was first recommended in 1991. Colorado saw only 23 cases of perinatal hepatitis B between 2001 and 2015, and the state has seen no confirmed cases since 2016, according to CDPHE.
“Colorado has spent decades building an effective system of maternal screening and universal birth dose vaccination that has nearly eliminated infant hepatitis B infections in our state,” Jill Hunsaker Ryan, executive director of CDPHE, said in a statement. “The evidence is strong, the science is clear, and the vaccine has an exceptional safety profile. We want providers and families to know that the hepatitis B birth dose remains safe, effective, and strongly recommended for all newborns.”










Colorado has spent decades building an effective system of maternal screening and universal birth dose vaccination that has nearly eliminated infant hepatitis B infections in our state.


– Jill Hunsaker Ryan, executive director of CDPHE


Dr. Ned Calonge, CDPHE’s chief medical officer, said the CDPHE wants providers to have all the information they need to explain to families the well-documented benefits of the vaccine. 
“We still strongly recommend it, it’s still available, and it’s still paid for,” Calonge said. “We would like to just remind parents that nothing has changed around the evidence. It has a great effectiveness and benefit and no significant downsides, so nothing really should change in terms of the acceptability, or parents obtaining this dose for their newborns.” 
The 30 years of evidence showing the safety and efficacy of the hepatitis B vaccine speaks for itself, Calonge said, particularly its effectiveness in Colorado. He said parents should understand that the vaccine is still recommended by “every credible health care entity in our state and provider groups nationally.”
The risk of developing chronic hepatitis is much higher for newborns and children, Calonge said, which can lead to serious liver diseases including cirrhosis and liver cancer. 
Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has spent decades spreading misinformation and conspiracy theories about vaccines and other health issues, fired all 17 previous members of the ACIP and replaced them with a slate of hand-picked appointees, many of whom are seen as vaccine skeptics.
Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, said the state will continue to reinforce the importance of the birth dose and ensure families have “the best information” available on its effectiveness. 
“Colorado will continue to follow the science and strongly support the hepatitis B birth dose as a safe, simple, and effective protection for every newborn, even as ACIP creates confusion for families,” Polis said in a statement. 
In September, Hunsaker Ryan issued a public health order to allow Coloradans to have continued access to COVID-19 vaccinations after the Trump administration limited who was eligible.

Larry Rhoden awarded $1 million Wednesday from a fund he controls to help pay for two business parks in the hometown of a political opponent.
Rhoden announced the Future Fund award during an event on the campus of Northern State University in Aberdeen. The city is the business and population center of northeastern South Dakota, but it only has one vacant property available for large-scale business projects, according to a press release from Rhoden’s office.
“These business parks will help ensure that Aberdeen’s economy continues to grow and remain competitive,” Rhoden said in the press release.
The money will be added to $7 million raised by local leaders and private investors, the release says.
Aberdeen is the home of Toby Doeden, who owns businesses in the area and is seeking the Republican nomination for governor in next spring’s primary election. The other declared candidates for the nomination are Rhoden, U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson and state House Speaker Jon Hansen.
Doeden did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday’s Future Fund award. 
Noem’s uses of credit cards and an economic fund cause lawmakers to propose restrictions

The Future Fund is a pool of state money, funded by a tax on employers, over which the governor has exclusive control. State law says the money must be used for research or economic development. Earlier this year, Rhoden pledged $1.5 million from the fund to support the build-out of a diesel mechanic training program at the state penitentiary.
The fund has existed since 1987 but became controversial under Rhoden’s predecessor, Kristi Noem, whose uses of the fund included a fireworks show at Mount Rushmore, a Rapid City-area shooting range that legislators refused to fund, a Governor’s Cup rodeo in Sioux Falls, and a workforce recruitment campaign that Noem starred in.  
Lawmakers on a government oversight committee recently endorsed a draft bill for the 2026 legislative session that would take the ability to act as the fund’s sole manager away from the governor. The bill would require each Future Fund grant to be approved by a majority of the Board of Economic Development, which already has oversight of other economic development programs.
Shortly after the $1 million award announcement, the Governor’s Office of Economic Development sent a news release saying that the office’s Board of Economic Development had voted to award a $500,000 grant to the city of Watertown “to support critical infrastructure expansion in the Calvin Industrial Park.” The grant is from the state’s Local Infrastructure Improvement Program.
“This investment reflects our commitment to keep South Dakota communities strong, safe, and free,” Rhoden said in that press release.
The Watertown money will help pay for sanitary sewer infrastructure at the industrial park.

Credit: FloridaRedistricting.govA pending ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court regarding the 1965 Voting Rights Act could trigger the Florida Legislature to conduct a mid-decade congressional redistricting effort, but it won’t require them to do so.
That was the opinion of Tallahassee election attorney Andy Bardos, who spoke Wednesday before a Florida House select committee charged with considering congressional redistricting, the second “educational and informative meeting” in the past week that did not allow public comment.
Denying that redistricting would have anything to do with partisan advantage, Gov. Ron DeSantis has maintained that Florida will be “forced to” redistrict once the high court rules in a case called Louisiana v. Callais, which could redefine Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act or declare it unconstitutional. The justices have twice heard the case and are expected to rule sometime before next July.
“In terms of binding effect, it has binding effect on Louisiana,” Bardos told lawmakers. “Whether Florida chooses after Callais to keep its maps in place, await either the next cycle, or await litigation, or redraw its districts, that will be a judgement call made when we see the Callais decision.”
Bardos and committee chairman Mike Redondo, R-Miami, confirmed during the hearing that if the Legislature does in fact redo the congressional map sometime next year, it would do so based on U.S. Census and voter information data that used previously when it did the decennial redistricting in 2022.
Court rulings
What has changed since then is the Florida Supreme Court’s ruling in July upholding the state’s 2022 congressional map, which had been legally challenged by voting rights groups such as Black Voters Matters after it was approved by the Legislature.
Those groups argued the map had violated the 2010 Fair Districts amendments when it redrew Congressional District 5. That seat stretched for more than 200 miles along the Florida-Georgia border to encompass Black populations in Florida’s old plantation belt from Gadsden to Duval counties.
One of those protections in the Fair Districts amendments prohibits lawmakers from drawing districts that “diminish [racial and language minorities’] ability to elect representatives of their choice.” The plaintiffs had argued that eliminating a district in which Black voters were electing their preferred candidate violated that provision.
The Florida Supreme Court ruled that the old District 5 seat was likely an illegal race-based gerrymander that failed to meet the equal-protection standards under the U.S. Constitution. “In the process of deciding that, the court articulated legal principles that had never before been set forth by a court in that way,” Bardos said.
The Fair District amendments also state that “no apportionment plan or individual district shall be drawn with the intent to favor or disfavor a political party or an incumbent,” which seemingly would contradict the stated goal of President Donald Trump, who said explicitly in July that he wanted Texas to create more House seats favorable to his party for the 2026 midterm elections. Gov. DeSantis said publicly weeks later that he thought Florida should do so, as well.
Bardos went on to tell Rep. Kevin Chambliss, D-Homestead, that the Florida Supreme Court ruling that the 2022 congressional map was constitutional “raises questions now about how does this articulation of additional principles effect other parts of the state which the court wasn’t focused on.”
This was the last meeting scheduled by the select committee until the 2026 legislative session begins on Jan. 13. However, both DeSantis and Senate President Ben Albritton have said they would prefer the Legislature wait to address the issue again in a special session after the U.S. Supreme Court weighs in on the Louisiana v. Callais — which, as Bardos said Wednesday, might not be for another six months.
No public comment allowed
Opponents of the proposed redistricting expressed outrage that the public wasn’t given time to speak during the hearing.
“The people of Florida deserve better than a rush job behind closed doors,” said Jessica Lowe-Minor, president of the League of Women Voters of Florida. “There’s no compelling reason to do redistricting at all right now, and it certainly shouldn’t be done when the public doesn’t have sufficient opportunities to engage and provide input.”
“When lawmakers show up in Tallahassee, they should be fighting for the hardworking people who sent them there,” added Amina Spahić, political director with Florida For All. “But, instead, we see them catering to the powerful interests and mega-donors who bankroll their campaigns.”
Noting that some of his constituents drove up from South Florida before learning that they would not be able to speak during Wednesday’s hearing, Chambliss asked committee Chair Redondo if he could provide notice earlier if he planned to disallow public comment during future committee meetings.
Redondo responded that both hearings held so far involved only presentations, which he said typically do not allow for public comment. “When there’s some sort of legislative action being considered, that’s typically when we see public comment in normal meetings. But we’ll certainly try to notice the meetings as reasonably early as possible,” he said.

“Discussions about technology these days invariably lead to the topic of generative artificial intelligence, or GenAI,” Supreme Judicial Court Chief Justice Kimberly Budd said in her State of the Judiciary speech Tuesday. “My colleagues on the SJC and I recognize that GenAI offers enormous potential for streamlining many aspects of the work of attorneys and courts alike. At the same time, we also recognize that the use of GenAI raises many questions and concerns, especially at this relatively early stage in its development.”
Budd noted questions surrounding the reliability, confidentiality and cost of using GenAI in courtrooms. And while the courts are open to the technology, they are being “deliberative and thoughtful” about how to use it.
“On a more fundamental level, we must ensure that GenAI does not adversely impact judicial independence and undermine public confidence in the administration of justice,” Budd said.
She said the judiciary asked the court’s Standing Advisory Committee on the Rules of Professional Conduct to consider whether changes need to be made to state Rules of Professional Conduct to address attorneys’ use of GenAI. The committee did not recommend any changes, but that may change as the technology evolves.
Also, the Supreme Judicial Court issued interim guidelines for how judges and court personnel should use GenAI. Right now, GenAI is only used for administrative tasks, she said. Also, only public information can be used and the AI tools can not retain or use any information that is entered to train the programs. 
Budd said the guidelines are a “modest first step” but they are necessary and expected to be updated as the judiciary learns more about GenAI.
Also, she said the technology has the potential to help those who can’t afford lawyers. The Access to Justice Commission is studying ways to use GenAI to boost access to justice, while also limiting cost disparities.
Across the US, courts are adopting AI more slowly than the private sector, according to a May report from the Thomas Reuters Institute and the National Center for State Courts AI Policy Consortium for Law and Courts.
Of those surveyed, 34 percent said their courts have used a sort of GenAI or plan to do so in the next year. And many respondents expressed concerns about overreliance on technology and malicious use of AI, like falsely created evidence. At the same time, the respondents acknowledged AI can help boost efficiency and estimate the technology could save three hours every week in the next year.
“Whatever improvements new technologies, including artificial intelligence, may bring, I want to stress that our legal system is, and will remain, centered on human intelligence, understanding and judgment,” Budd said, adding judgement ultimately depends on those who work within the system.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/JusticeBudd2-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C656&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-10 16:57:28.161333

Vermont’s Air National Guard will deploy, but officials are mum on the destination. 
The 158th Fighter Wing received a federal mobilization order, according to Joseph Brooks, a Vermont National Guard spokesperson, but he declined to say when and where. 
The deployment, which is reportedly expected this month, was first publicized by Seven Days.

Lt. Col. Meghan Smith, another guard spokesperson, said the Vermont Guard does not have the exact departure timeline. She referred all further questions to the Office of the U.S. Secretary of Defense, which referred questions back to the Vermont National Guard.  
Gov. Phil Scott has twice this year chosen not to deputize the Vermont National Guard for federal initiatives, first to help with clerical immigration enforcement work and later as part of President Donald Trump’s efforts to crack down on crime in Washington, D.C. 
But in this instance, Scott said at his weekly press conference Wednesday that the authorization did not require his approval. 
“It’s going to be under federal control. So everything, from my understanding, is coming out of either the National Guard or the Pentagon at this point,” Scott said of the deployment. He did not provide additional details on the upcoming mobilization. 
In the early days of the war in Ukraine, the Vermont Air National Guard deployed to Europe. At the time, officials said the mission was in support of NATO but not in direct response to the war. 
Earlier this year, the Vermont Air National Guard deployed on a scheduled rotation to Japan.
The Trump administration has recently deployed National Guard troops to American cities like Washington, D.C., and Memphis. The new use of troops on U.S. soil has drawn criticism from local leaders and received mixed reactions from the courts as lawsuits proceed on the legality of Trump’s orders. 
Reports from across the country detail the recent deployment of Air National Guard members to countries like Djibouti and Italy. 
Vermont’s Air National Guard utilizes F-35A fighter jets, which the Guard describes as the “most advanced and capable weapon system in the U.S. Air Force.” The 158th Fighter Wing has about 1,000 members.

Dec. 10, 2025. | Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance. Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Twp.) and House Appropriations Committee Chair Ann Bollin (R-Brighton Township) celebrated the committee’s vote along party lines on Wednesday afternoon to disapprove around $645 million in work project spending during a press conference held after the vote. 
The vote took place under a provision of the Management and Budget Act where either the House or Senate Appropriations Committee could vote to disapprove any of the newly requested work projects. The House committee did not hold any debate or testimony on the spending package prior to voting, which committee Democrats heavily criticized. 
“I look at this as a negotiation the way this process is set up,” Hall said. “It is my favorite law, the law that allows the House Appropriations Committee to unilaterally kill hundreds of millions of dollars of Democrat pork and waste, fraud and abuse.”
Asked if this move — which Hall said he believed had only been used once before, and committee Democrats said they believed had never been used — would increase political tensions in future budget years, Bollin responded, “It’s the law, we’re just following it.”
Bollin also pushed back against arguments that the process of deciding which work projects to reject was not transparent. 
“Everybody on the Appropriations Committee got a copy of the request, the recommended work projects,” she said. “They too had 30 days to be asking questions, recommending, having input. Certainly, I’ve always had an open door to do that.”
However, speaking to reporters immediately after the vote, Democratic members of the committee expressed their anger and frustration about the process and what they saw as a lack of transparency. 
“For this process to be laid out in a time frame where we were handed the document as soon as we gaveled in and we had no discussion, to even be able to ask questions of HFA [the House Fiscal Agency],” said Rep.

“We were just handed this list. There are things like sexual assault kits on here, community colleges, human trafficking, public safety, survivor justice,” said Rep. Julie Rogers (D-Kalamazoo). “This is cutting projects that have already been approved.”

Hall specifically called out projects including those that pushed for climate infrastructure, a charter school transparency database and the Office of Global Michigan in the press conference. 
“Now the Democrats are trying to shove another $2.7 billion of slush fund money through this work project scheme, which is something that really has taken off under Governor Whitmer,” he said. 
Hall emphasized repeatedly that the projects that would have been funded by this spending package will now go through HEAT, the Hall Ethics, Accountability and Transparency plan, an earmark reform law that Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed into law in November. 
“I will caution you not everything that the Appropriations Committee cut was waste, fraud and abuse,” he said, adding that projects would be able to be re-reviewed under his ethics law and potentially receive more funding. “There are some valid things that were cut.” 
Hall also noted that the money disapproved in Wednesday’s vote will now go into the state’s general fund.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC_3333-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-10 17:57:46.798173

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)It’s easy these days, in the face of the dysfunction, grasping ambition and negativity that characterizes our politics, to lose sight of the value of true public servants. But there are still leaders out there who put service before self. People who are willing to make sacrifices of their time and their personal lives in order to make their community better.
Adrienne Jones is a leader like that. Maryland should take a beat to recognize her, and honor her work, in the wake of her decision to step down as speaker of the House of Delegates.
I served with Madame Speaker for all 12 years I was in the legislature, the last four as majority leader under her speakership. She, of course, served a lot longer than I did — next year will mark her 30th year as a delegate. Good leadership, though, isn’t about length of service. It’s not about titles either, or social media clicks or quotes in the press. Good leadership in elected office is a daily effort to do right by your constituents on matters large and small.
It’s responding to the everyday challenges people face and helping where you can, whether it’s getting a pothole filled on their neighborhood street or helping them get the unemployment benefits that will keep food on their table. It’s making the thousands of decisions that come across your desk while putting aside the noise and chaos of politics and the entreaties of special interests. It’s about staying focused on one core question, “What’s the right thing to do?” Not the politically expedient thing. Not the thing that will get you more campaign contributions or attention. The right thing.

I’ve seen Speaker Jones ask that question time after time. In all the years I’ve known her, I’ve never known her to make a decision for the wrong reasons. That was as true when she was a backbencher before my time as it was when she served in leadership under Speaker Michael Busch. And it was the cornerstone of her speakership.
It’s the question she asked for so many years as a member of the Appropriations Committee and as House chair on the capital budget. Her legacy is written in brick and mortar across the face of this state. In the schools and roads and parks she funded in those days
It’s embedded now in the character of the state’s spending decisions, which are fundamentally driven by the premise that the state should support communities that are struggling. That the enormous power of our state government to make investments should be wielded as a tool to make life better for regular people.
When she was speaker, it was the question she asked her staff and her leadership team as they were weighing tough decisions. And she guided the House so many times towards actions that have done right by Marylanders. Efforts to reduce inequality. To protect health care and reproductive rights. To give our children paths to a better future.
And she did it quietly, confidently. She isn’t the kind of elected official who tries to get her way by talking louder than others. She has never been the look-at-me type. It just isn’t her personality.
Her leadership has been the steady, calm, quiet sort; a reassuring style of leadership in normal times and an essential one when our national politics is more Thunderdome than Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.
When she took on the speakership, at a very difficult time for the House after Mike Busch’s untimely death, the press noted rightly the ground she broke. She was the first woman and the first African-American to hold that office. A tremendous historical milestone in the state that bequeathed to the world Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass.
But the significance of her speakership isn’t just in who she is, but in what she did. Her work, sometimes obscured by louder personalities, often underrecognized and even thankless, has made life better for every single one of us. She has done the right thing, so many times, over so many years. And for that, we should all be grateful to Madame Speaker.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2024_jan29_jones_enoughleg-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-10 16:57:28.161333

Vermont Gov. Phil Scott said Wednesday that he supported calls for the resignation of Eva Vekos, the embattled state’s attorney in Addison County. Meanwhile, Vekos was adamant Wednesday that she had no intention of stepping down. 
Calls from Scott and other top political leaders in the state come after VTDigger published a story on Monday in which sexual assault survivors criticized Vekos’ handling of their cases and described ethics complaints filed against her. 
Scott said he agreed with a statement issued shortly after on Monday by the chair of the Vermont Democratic Party, Lachlan Francis, that Vekos was “unfit to serve as State’s Attorney, and she should resign from her office immediately.” The statement cited VTDigger’s reporting.

“I do think that it’s time to make a change,” Scott, a Republican, said at a Wednesday press conference in Montpelier. The press conference was not specifically about Vekos or her conduct.
“I compliment the Democratic Party for moving forward,” the governor said. “It’s something that I think they feel strongly about — and I believe that there is some merit to that.” 
Vekos is in her first term as Addison County’s top prosecutor and ran for office in 2022 as a Democrat. Francis said if Vekos decides to seek reelection to another four-year term in 2026, the Democratic Party would not support her candidacy.
The governor’s comments also come after the Vermont Progressive Party called on Vekos to resign. The party said in a statement Wednedsay that “her complete and total lack of regard and respect for sexual violence victims cannot continue.”
“It is clear that Eva Vekos has failed morally, ethically, and legally to protect the sisters and daughters of Addison County, whom she took an oath to protect,” the Progressive Party said.
If Vekos does not resign, the party added, Addison County’s delegation to the state Legislature should start the process of impeaching her.
Some state leaders have previously called for Vekos’ resignation. After she was arrested for allegedly drunken driving in January 2024, a number of lawmakers in the  county demanded that she step down, though she did not.
Asked Wednesday if she would resign in the wake of Scott’s and the other leaders’ comments this week, Vekos was defiant, writing in an email: “Absolutely not.”
“There is no reason for me to step down. I’ve done nothing different than any other prosecutor in VT or anywhere,” she said. “And, anyway, it would be unfair to the residents in Addison County to leave them in the lurch. Not to mention unfair to my staff.”
Vekos also said the Democratic Party chair’s call for her to resign was “short-sighted and rash.” 
“He should have first reached out to me — rather than blindly accepting the truth of a one-sided story,” she said, referring to VTDigger’s reporting this week.
In a separate statement Vekos sent Tuesday after VTDigger published its story, Vekos said she was “distressed to hear that some victims are still suffering from the pain and frustration related to the outcomes” of cases described in VTDigger’s reporting. However, Vekos called those outcomes “an unfortunate reality of criminal court.”
“The choices I made in handling these cases was consistent with preceding prosecutors,” she said. Her office, she later wrote, was “crushing it.”

The Education Freedom Savings Account Oversight Committee will hold a public meeting Dec. 16 at 10 a.m, according to the committee’s official webpage. 
The scheduling move came after the Bulletin reported about the lack of meetings Monday. The committee last met in November 2024. It is required by statute to “monitor the implementation of” education freedom accounts, which allow families to access state education funding to use toward private and home school education expenses.
According to state law, the committee must produce a report by Nov. 30 of each year detailing its findings and any recommendations for changes to the program, but because it hadn’t met this year, the committee missed that deadline 
Sen. Ruth Ward, a Stoddard Republican and the chairwoman of the committee, said in a statement last week that the committee had not met because of scheduling challenges with House representatives.  The committee consists of two senators and three representatives and requires a quorum of three members to meet; Ward said House travel restrictions over the summer and the resignation of Rep. Glenn Cordelli had prevented that quorum from being met.
Democratic members of the committee, meanwhile, have criticized the lack of meetings, noting that they come as the  education freedom account program has nearly doubled after lawmakers removed the income limits and imposed a 10,000-student cap. That increase makes the role of legislative scrutiny particularly important, they argue. 
Oversight over the accounts has become fraught amid increasingly intractable partisan attitudes around the program. Republicans say the program provides important financial support for families who do not believe public school is the right option for their children; Democrats say state funds should only support public schools.

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)A House legislative oversight hearing at the North Carolina General Assembly Wednesday devolved into shouting and book-throwing by the committee chairman.
Republican lawmakers pressed Chapel Hill-Carrboro school leaders over whether the district had complied with the requirements in the state’s “Parents’ Bill of Rights,” which became law in 2023.
It was so heated that Rep. Amos Quick (D-Guilford), who had been watching the hearing remotely before arriving, ruefully described the proceedings as “pretty good TV.” 
“There was book throwing, there was cussing, there was all of that,” Quick said. “I’ve been elected here for going on 10 years, and I have to say… I had secondhand embarrassment for the way this meeting was being conducted.”
For nearly two hours, members of the House Select Committee on Oversight and Reform grilled Superintendent Rodney Trice and former School Board Chair George Griffin and accused them of defying the law. 
Both men were called to appear after Board Chair George Griffin was recorded  at a school board meeting saying that CHCCS was openly defying Senate Bill 49, the state law requiring schools to notify parents when a student changes their name or pronouns. The video clip went viral among conservatives.
“You’re not here today because of a misunderstanding. You’re here today because you chose to wage war against the law, you chose to deceive the public, and now you’re here because you got caught,” Chair Rep. Brenden Jones told the men in his opening remarks. 
Both Trice and Griffin maintained throughout the hearing  that the district was following the law.

Griffin repeatedly declined to say whether he believed the law was constitutional, saying he was not an attorney. When pressed, he said only, “I think there’s a part of the law that singled out a subgroup of students.”
For his part, Trice defended the district’s practices saying, “Parents are essential partners, and we believe in involving them in every decision affecting their kids.”
Griffin said the board ultimately voted to follow Senate Bill 49. 
“That evening, we enacted seven parts of the bill—all the parts—except for putting in policy the one clause on pronouns,” Griffin said. “It was our understanding that the board should direct staff to develop written guidance for that issue, and that is what we did. ‘In our judgment, that is in complete compliance with the law, and that’s where we left things at the end of the night.”
Rep. Jeff McNeely (R-Iredell) asked, “So you thought the law that we gave you was multiple choice? You could kind of choose what you liked?” he asked.
McNeely also questioned Trice about the district’s finances and reliance on state funding. “So y’all don’t have the money to be able to educate these kids with your own money, you’re going to need some help, aren’t you?”
“Certainly we need state funds to help educate our kids at a high level,” Trice replied.
“There’s a darn good chance you may not get them,” McNeely shot back. “We’re not going to put up with rogue school systems who have no money and will not comply with the laws of this state. Do you understand what I said there?”
‘Attack on gay, trans people’
Jones also accused the school district of “grooming” students, saying it had “promoted sample pronoun surveys for kids without telling their parents” and “pushed gender support plans that included a check box to exclude parents.”
Jones read from several pro-LGBTQ+ children’s books he said were recommended by the district to K-4 students, denounced them as “pure trash,” and slammed them to the floor. He also accused the district of “indoctrinating” students.
Rep. Allison Dahle (D-Wake), one of the few openly LGBTQ+ lawmakers in the General Assembly, described the committee’s scrutiny as an “attack on gay, trans people.” 
“This is a way for everybody to be afraid of something that is 1% of this population,”she said. 
Dahle also noted the difficulties school administrators face in balancing the needs of all students, including LGBTQ+ students. 
“The school system is between a rock and a hard place,” she said. “You’ve got kids that are on one end of the spectrum to the other, and you have to do everything you can to help each and every person learn.” 
Democratic lawmakers on the committee criticized Republicans for focusing on the school district rather than addressing broader funding issues. 
In a joint statement, Reps. Maria Cervania (D-Wake) and Eric Ager (D-Buncombe) said the hearing was a distraction from the legislature’s failure to pass a budget or fully fund public schools, including rural districts that are severely under-resourced.
“Instead of being angry when local schools try to protect our kids and teach them the truth,” they said, “perhaps the majority should follow the Leandro court order, fully fund education in North Carolina, stop starving rural school districts of funding, teachers, and capital improvements, and scrap the disastrous and bloated school voucher welfare program that shuffles money to the wealthiest members of our community.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0557-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-10 16:57:28.161333

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas attorney general is dropping his federal lawsuit that targeted health care for immigrants across the U.S.
Kris Kobach announced Wednesday he voluntarily dismissed the lawsuit, but health care for certain immigrants was stripped away more than three months ago when President Donald Trump rescinded the Biden-era rule that offered health care plans to people who migrated to the U.S. as children.
The roughly 10,000 immigrants in the United States under Deferred Action of Childhood Arrivals who purchased health insurance from the marketplace were removed from their plans by Oct. 1. An estimated 525,000 people are in the U.S. under DACA.
Kobach initially filed the lawsuit involving 18 other states after the Biden administration adopted rules in November 2024 enabling DACA participants to enroll in public health insurance plans, which wasn’t previously possible under the Affordable Care Act. Kobach argued in court against the policies, winning a preliminary injunction.
“This is a big win for the rule of law,” Kobach said in a Wednesday announcement. “Congress never intended that illegal aliens should receive Obamacare benefits.”
The lawsuit is one piece of Kobach’s broad range of anti-immigration efforts. He helped Kansas earlier this year become one of the first states in the country to deputize state law enforcement agents to enforce immigration law.
He is party to another lawsuit that seeks to exclude certain immigrants from U.S. Census counts. Kobach argued counting people in the country without particular documentation or with temporary visas skews congressional district apportionment. The U.S. Constitution mandates a count of “the whole number of persons in each state” every 10 years.
He also spent years defending anti-immigration ordinances on behalf of cities, and, as a law professor, he helped craft controversial legislation in Arizona.
Most recently, he announced federal election fraud charges against a native Mexican man who served as mayor in a small Kansas town.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PA010179-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-10 16:57:28.161333

The nine-member Senate Study Group on Women, Children and Families, chaired by Sen. Nicole Boyd, a Republican from Oxford, was formed in 2022 after the overturning of Roe v. Wade. The group’s mission was designed to make the state safer for moms and babies. In Tuesday’s five-hour meeting at the state Capitol, stakeholders touched on health care, child care, youth court, foster care, food aid and addiction services. They suggested ways to improve the interrelated structures surrounding the Mississippi mothers who risk their lives giving birth and the children who grow up supported – or not – in a state with some of the nation’s highest rates of infant mortality, poverty and hunger. 
“We saw legislation that we need to go back and change, which is important always to look at the things that were or were not effective, or something that needs to be tweaked,” said Boyd.  
One example is the Child Care Tax Credit, passed in 2023, which offers a 50% income tax credit to employers who either provide their employees with child care during work hours or provide at least $6,000 in a stipend to a licensed child care provider for their employees. 
The program has had next to no uptake, said Biz Harris, director of the Mississippi Early Learning Alliance. Harris attributes that to mid-size employers not having the bandwidth to take on the administrative burden the program currently has, and the $6,000 minimum being too high. 
Currently, employers have to complete a long list of requirements to take advantage of the program. These duties include verifying if employees are eligible and providers are licensed, keeping detailed records and reporting to the Department of Revenue. 
“While we know some of those responsibilities have to remain with employers, we really hope you’ll explore ways to lower that minimum amount per employee and streamline the requirements so the credit can be more accessible and practical as an employee benefit.”
That kind of public-private partnership is important since Mississippi child care is getting hit hard right now. Efforts to fix those issues are competing with  the needs of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, serving over 350,000 residents, or about 1 in 8 Mississippians. 
“Those are the two things I think that I deal with that are going to have the most immediate impact on women, infants and children – particularly in the next year,” said Mississippi Department of Human Services Director Bob Anderson during the meeting.

Looming federal changes will shift an estimated $140 million in SNAP costs to the state. Meanwhile, Covid-era funding that dried up has forced nearly 20,000 eligible families who rely on child care vouchers – essentially coupons making child care more affordable – onto a waitlist, Anderson said. That number is up nearly 4,000 from last month, according to state estimates provided this week. 
Anderson requested $15 million from the Legislature in September’s Legislative Budget Committee hearing to cover the immediate cost increases for SNAP, after the federal budget bill shifted states’ administrative cost burden from 50% to 75%. But in the next two years, Mississippi expects to pay an additional $125 million to cover a portion of the actual nutrition benefits, which used to be completely covered by the federal government.
National policy experts have also expressed concerns about the toll new SNAP work requirements will place on state agencies’ aging technology. 
“Replacing your state’s administrative systems is usually not high on any legislator’s list of priorities, but we do pay the price for that later,” Elaine Waxman, a senior fellow in the Tax and Income Supports Division at the Urban Institute, told Mississippi Today. 
Vicki Lowery from the Mississippi Administrative Office of Courts shares that concern. 
“Our system is based on technology from 1999,” she said. “Think about what you were using in terms of technology in 1999 – a flip phone.” 
Health and mental health
In his presentation to lawmakers, State Health Officer Dr. Daniel Edney drilled down on obesity as a leading cause of preterm birth. In Mississippi, one in four children are battling obesity – the highest rate in the nation. Edney commended Mississippi Medicaid for covering GLP-1 drugs, which are used to treat type 2 diabetes and weight loss. 
“If we’re going to take fluoride out, can we put GLP1s in? Putting GLP1s in the water might help this,” Edney joked.

But data suggest reliable access to nutritious food already poses an immediate need for many Mississippians. Seventy-seven percent of Mississippi’s counties are considered food deserts, leaving many of the state’s residents without access to fresh fruits and vegetables. People in these areas rely on high-calorie, low-nutrient foods from convenience stores and fast food chains, contributing to obesity and disease. 
Several communities in Mississippi have begun the process of discontinuing fluoride treatment of water. Decades of research has shown a link between fluoride and the reduction of dental health disparities, particularly fewer dental cavities in children. Edney said that if the state is determined to take fluoride out of the water, the Legislature should put money in the Medicaid budget to “pay for the rotten teeth of the kids that are coming.”
Christina Dent, founder and president of End It For Good, a nonprofit advocating for a shift away from a criminal justice approach and toward a health-centered approach in addressing drug use, added context to some of Mississippi’s health woes. 
“When we think of childhood trauma, we tend to think of a one-time experience,” Dent said. “But trauma doesn’t just impact us at the moment that it happens. It creates this toxic stress that lives in our bodies and often has this long-term, decades-long outcomes in our health.”
Studies show that trauma, instability and abuse as a child can influence the risk of later developing chronic illnesses and diseases, such as obesity, cancer and heart disease, as an adult. If a person has five adverse childhood experiences – experiences of abuse, neglect, household dysfunction and community violence that undermine a child’s sense of safety, stability and bonding – that person is seven to 10 times more likely to use illicit drugs, according to one estimate. 
When the term adverse childhood experiences was first coined, its definition was limited to family and household trauma and received scrutiny for not taking into account broader issues like systemic racism and neighborhood violence. The definition has since evolved. Some schools of thought have worried ACE screening locks individuals into outcomes rather than taking into account the resiliency of people. 
In order not to perpetuate the cycle of trauma and addiction, it’s important to make sure pregnant women struggling with substance use are not cut out of the health care system, Dent said. Those women are often afraid to seek care for fear of criminal justice and loss of custody. 
“When you look at the research on states that have punitive-first policies related to substance use on prenatal or parenting women, they are worse outcomes – not just for the mother but for the baby, as well,” said Dent. “And we end up with all those things we’re trying to move away from.”
Dent’s organization hopes to play a bigger role in being part of the solution for Mississippians who need help. It was one of 127 groups to apply for opioid settlement money in September. Her organization’s proposal, which would create family support groups in the state aimed at helping families develop evidence-based skills to support loved ones battling addiction, was scored in the second-highest tier. It will be up to lawmakers whether or not to grant the $209,000 she requested as they consider the Opioid Settlement Fund Advisory Council’s recent recommendations about how to spend millions of dollars awarded that corporations have paid out for the role they played in contributing to the deaths of 10,000 Mississippians since 2000.
“When you hear from these programs, it really reiterates over and over how important prevention is,” Boyd said. “The quicker you can get at a problem or issue, the most effective and less expensive it’s going to be.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/09142233/3X0A6700.jpg,,,2025-12-10 16:57:28.161333

NCDEQ has denied the mining permit application from Horizon 30 LLC. (Drone shots courtesy of Leo Sharp) North Carolina has cut its state environmental agency more deeply than any other state in the country, according to a report released Wednesday by the Environmental Integrity Project, a nonprofit advocacy group.
The report, titled “State of Decline: Cuts to State Environmental Agencies Compound Damage from the Dismantling of EPA,” examines impacts of the Trump administration’s planned downsizing of the Environmental Protection Agency.
With cuts to the EPA, the federal government plans to shift certain tasks to the state level. But states may not have the capacity to shoulder additional responsibility for environmental oversight, the EIP found in its report.
Almost two thirds of states – 31 – cut jobs at their environmental agencies from 2010 through 2024, leading to the elimination of 3,725 positions, according to the document.
North Carolina is one of the fastest growing states in the country and home to a large and expanding manufacturing and farming sector, Jen Duggan, executive director of the EIP, said.
Despite this, North Carolina’s Department of Environmental Quality has lost nearly a third of its staff since 2010, the steepest decline of any state in the country at 32%. This translates to 394 eliminated jobs in pollution control and other environmental programs, according to the EIP.
Connecticut (26%), Arizona (25%), and Louisiana (24%) are next on the list in terms of percentage cuts.
“The effectiveness of our nation’s environmental laws relies on a well-resourced EPA working in partnership with capable state agencies,” Duggan said. “When states have the necessary authority, expertise and commitment, the EPA can delegate many responsibilities to them, but this shared system only works when both levels of government are adequately supported.”
The cuts are harmful to the state, said Drew Ball, Southeast campaigns director for the Natural Resources Defense Council. Reduced staffing leads to weaker enforcement, which in turn results in dangerous conditions for North Carolinians.
Ball described stories of a family in eastern North Carolina noticing their tap water turning cloudy after a heavy rain and a neighborhood near Wilmington smelling ammonia from a poultry operation. Because of the decrease in staff, state inspectors could not immediately investigate, leading to public health concerns.
“The very agency responsible for protecting these families is facing a growing burden,” Ball said. “That’s a recipe for disaster in states like ours, where the state agency is already stretched thin.”
In addition to federal cuts that have already occurred, there could be more in the upcoming months. Congress is expected to vote on the EPA’s budget for fiscal year 2026 in January.
Earlier this year, the White House said President Donald Trump wants the EPA to cut 65% of its spending, POLITICO previously reported.
The agency put out a statement in response saying the president and EPA administrator Zeldin are working towards creating a more efficient and effective federal government.
“Compared to 2024, the total amount spent year over year at EPA will deliver significant efficiencies to American taxpayers by cutting wasteful grants, reassessing the agency’s real estate footprint, and delivering organizational improvements to the personnel structure,” the statement read.
Ball compared the situation to dismantling the fire department when a house is already burning.
“North Carolina cannot keep its people safe if the agencies meant to protect them are left to wither, and the federal government cannot expect states to do more while it simultaneously knocks their legs out from under them,” he said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mining-along-Nolichucky-River_Photo-LeoSharp.jpg,,,2025-12-10 16:57:28.161333
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-10 21:17:33+00:00,CT Mirror,Lamont: CT savings habits are paying big dividends,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/10/ct-pension-payments/,Officials said next year's pension payment would have been $857 million more if CT hadn't put $10 billion into its pensions in recent years.,"By pouring more than $10 billion in budget surpluses into its cash-starved pension system since 2020, Connecticut has stemmed the skyrocketing costs that threatened public service programs in the 2010s, Gov. Ned Lamont announced Wednesday.
Lamont, who was joined by Treasurer Erick Russell and Comptroller Sean Scanlon during a late morning press conference in the State Office Building, also challenged the General Assembly to remain faithful to the budget caps that have generated these surpluses, warning that the global economic future remains uncertain.
Analysts project Connecticut must contribute at least $3.62 billion next fiscal year to its pension systems for state workers and municipal teachers. That’s only $14 million less than the minimum contribution it must make this fiscal year — essentially the same amount.
But Lamont, Russell and Scanlon say next year’s required payment would much greater — by about $857 million — had Connecticut not poured $10 billion extra in budget surpluses into its pensions over the past six years.
When calculating the minimum contribution Connecticut must budget for, analysts consider likely earnings for decades to come through the investment of pension assets. If the pension funds hold an extra $857 million, then likely investment income over the next 25 to 30 years will be significantly greater. And if that’s the case, the state’s minimum contribution doesn’t have to grow as much year to year, making it easier to balance the budget and avoid tax hikes.
“The perception of the state is incredibly important,” the governor said, adding that Connecticut’s fiscal prosperity in the 2020s, which followed a decade marred by numerous deficits and some huge tax hikes, has been noticed.
“It means we’re a place where businesses want to be and where individuals want to be,” the governor said. It also has led Wall Street credit rating agencies to repeatedly upgrade its evaluations of Connecticut in recent years, helping to lower borrowing costs for school construction, transportation work and other capital projects.
Thanks also to the robust 10.1% return that pension investments generated in 2025, “Connecticut continues to make undeniable progress in strengthening its pension funds and restoring long-term fiscal stability,” Russell said.
Lamont often touts these pension contributions savings as a huge boon to other programs in the state budget, such as education, human services and municipal aid. “You can put that [$857 million savings] to social services, take care of people,” the governor said Wednesday.
And certainly, these programs would be at risk of steep cuts if Connecticut had to find an extra $857 million next fiscal year to cover its minimum mandatory pension contribution.
But that also doesn’t mean all, or even most, of this extra $857 million will be invested in schools, Medicaid, programs for vulnerable populations or grants to cities and towns.
Connecticut has a spending cap designed to keep most budget growth in line with household income and inflation. According to the legislature’s nonpartisan Office of Fiscal Analysis, the preliminary $28.6 billion budget lawmakers and Lamont approved last June for the fiscal year that begins next July 1 has room for only $70 million more in appropriations before it hits the cap.
In other words, Connecticut will dodge a big increase in mandatory pension spending that could gut core programs but also will keep most of that savings, not invest it in other services. And this has been the case since Connecticut imposed a more aggressive budget cap and other fiscal controls in 2017.
Many of Lamont’s fellow Democrats in the General Assembly have argued for several years that these caps are focusing too heavily on shrinking pension debt while siphoning huge dollars from municipalities, schools, health care and social services. While state budget surpluses have averaged an unprecedented $1.8 billion since 2017, annual spending in most non-pension areas hasn’t kept pace with inflation for more than a decade, leaving some to charge most vital programs are slipping.
Critics also note that Connecticut amassed its huge pension debt, which still exceeds $33 billion, over more than seven decades prior to 2011. And since it took at least three generations to create the problem, one generation can’t pay it off responsibly, not without doing great harm to other programs.
The Lamont administration currently projects the state’s unfunded pension liabilities will be eliminated by the mid-2040s.
Given the huge debt still unresolved, and growing fears of a looming global economic recession, both Lamont and Scanlon said it’s important Connecticut remains focused on paying down its unfunded liabilities.
“It is important that we continue to find the balance between maintaining Connecticut’s fiscal health and responding to residents’ needs,” said Scanlon, who served in the General Assembly when the 2017 budget controls were enacted. “I am proud of the progress we’ve made and look forward to continuing to work with this administration.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DBA8D6B4-58A1-4B53-ABC3-B1F764C93D2D-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-10 16:57:28.161333

A century-old program pays for schools, roads and other services in 39 California counties.


Rural schools and communities are poised to receive millions in funding after Congress resurrected a program left for dead a few months ago.
The Secure Rural Schools Act, which Congress passed overwhelmingly this week, is headed to President Donald Trump for final approval. It would bring $471 million for schools, roads, fire prevention, public safety and other critical needs. In California, 39 counties would share more than $40 million.
“It’s absolutely amazing,” said Jaime Green, superintendent of Trinity Alps Unified in Trinity County, which is set to receive almost $4 million from the bill. “A lot of people worked very hard to make this happen. I’ve never been more proud of our country than I am right now.”
Secure Rural Schools was created a century ago to reimburse communities that have large tracts of untaxable federal land. The program had been funded almost continuously until this year, when it apparently fell victim to the so-called Department of Government Efficiency’s push to eliminate programs it deemed wasteful.
But relentless bipartisan badgering by rural politicians and school officials apparently worked. Green, for example, visited Washington D.C. more than a dozen times to push for the bill. Rep. Doug LaMalfa, a Republican who represents much of northeastern California, hounded Speaker Mike Johnson for months until he placed it on the House calendar for a vote. A bipartisan group of more than 80 senators and representatives sent a letter to Johnson last week asking for the bill to be fast-tracked.
Public pressure, spurred in part by CalMatters coverage, also made a difference, Green and others said.
Razor-thin budgets
The money is especially important to rural communities because overall funding is so low to begin with. Rural school districts often operate on razor-thin budgets, with very little extra money to make up for swings in revenue. Trinity County, where 70% of the land is owned by the federal government, was anticipating layoffs, program cuts, deferral of costly repairs and other money-saving measures to make up for the loss of Secure Rural Schools funds.
Counties received their last Secure Rural Schools payment in March. The current bill will reimburse counties for the past nine months and cover the next two years, as well. The first checks will arrive 45 days after Trump signs the bill. 
“When the program lapsed, rural schools and counties were cut short of the funding they rely on to provide basic services,” LaMalfa said. “This bill restores that funding and keeps future payments on schedule.”
He added that a long-term solution would be for the government to help rural communities re-establish their timber economy, so programs like Secure Rural Schools aren’t necessary.
Another long-term solution would be to extend Secure Rural Schools from a 3-year bill to a 5- or 10-year bill, said Allan Carver, superintendent of Siskiyou County, which will receive more than $4 million through the bill. 
That would allow schools to make more permanent funding decisions — such as hiring classroom aides — and not have to continually lobby for the bill’s passage. A longer-term bill, spanning at least one presidential term, would also avoid some political skirmishes in Washington D.C., he said.
“We’re all celebrating today. This was truly an all-hands-on-deck effort,” Carver said. “But we’d love to see a permanent solution to this, so we’re not right back out there advocating a year from now.”
Other cuts on the horizon
James Gore, a Sonoma County supervisor and former president of the National Association of Counties, agreed that Secure Rural Schools should be exempt from the shifting political winds in Washington. Not only does it have strong bipartisan support, but the money is absolutely necessary for rural schools, he said.
“This is an unequivocal lifeline for kids in rural communities,” he said. “We’ll take the win, but it’s a shame that something so important was used as a negotiating tool.”
The fight is far from over, he added. Rural communities, which are disproportionately low-income compared to their urban and suburban counterparts, are facing federal cuts in Medicaid, food assistance, education and other programs which will have a far greater impact on residents’ day-to-day lives, he said.
“We all know that reform is needed,” Gore said, citing social services cuts in the Republican spending bill also called the One Big Beautiful Bill. “There’s going to be so many more fights in the next few years. Secure Rural Schools is only the first of 10 or more.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/052125_Paradise-School-Mental-Health_MG_CM_02.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-10 16:57:28.161333

(Photo by Anna Padilla for Source New Mexico)The New Mexico Higher Education Department on Wednesday asked lawmakers for $1.5 billion to fund public colleges and universities across the state. The department’s budget request prioritized creating free access to high school equivalency testing, as well as loan forgiveness for teachers and healthcare workers.
Department Secretary Stephanie Rodriguez, who presented the budget request to the Legislative Finance Committee, said that of the $1.5 billion requested, more than $1.3 billion will go directly to higher education institutions. The funding will maintain the Opportunity Scholarship, which covers fees and program costs for state residents who take at least six credit hours of instruction at a public college or university, and cover testing fees for New Mexico adults who want to earn a high school equivalency credential through a test like the GED. State lawmakers earlier this year passed legislation to make these tests, which the state estimates cost $145 each, free for the first time.
Rodriguez said college enrollment has increased for four consecutive years in New Mexico, while it declined nationally from 2020 to 2023. The nearly 114,000 residents across the state are pursuing educational paths ranging from career training certificates to graduate degrees at public institutions this semester, an increase of 3.6% from 2024, she said.
“I’m incredibly proud of this department,” Rodriguez told lawmakers. “Oftentimes you hear we’re last in education. That is not the case for higher education, adult education and early childhood education.”
The proposed HED budget for the upcoming fiscal year represents a 3% increase in “new money” and a $30 million increase to base funding. Rodriguez proposed directing $976.7 million of the request to instruction and general funding and $128.3 million to research and public service projects.
The budget proposal included new appropriation requests, including $25 million for a health professionals loan repayment program; $5 million for a teacher loan repayment program; $5 million for adult education programs; $3 million for the New Mexico Longitudinal Data System, which analyzes education and workforce data to guide policy discussions; and $1.25 million to cover high school equivalency testing fees across the state.
The new spending comes as the Trump administration moves to eliminate a Biden-era loan forgiveness program.

Representatives from the Council of University Presidents and New Mexico Association of Community Colleges also presented a unified budget request for higher education institutions across the state.
They credited the Lottery and Opportunity scholarships for ranking New Mexico fifth-lowest for student debt in the nation. The group sought funding for employee pay raises, campus safety, cybersecurity, building renewal and replacement equipment renewal and replacement. 
Cybersecurity was of particular concern to the group, whose officials cited an April cyberattack at Western New Mexico University.

But it remains unclear whether the Senate GOP caucus has enough support to pass the measure.
The chamber met for just 30 minutes with little of the marathon discussion that marked Monday’s six-hour committee hearing.
House Bill 1032 targets Indiana’s current two Democratic U.S. House members and is designed to create a 9-0 Republican map ahead of the 2026 midterm election — as demanded by President Donald Trump.
No Republican amendments were filed Wednesday, and all three Democratic proposals failed on voice votes.
The bill passed the Senate Elections Committee 6-3 earlier this week.
Sixteen GOP senators have publicly supported the bill; 14 have said they oppose it; and 10 — including several who supported advancing the bill out of committee — have not revealed how they plan to vote on the chamber floor.

Indiana’s Constitution requires a majority of the 50-member Senate to approve legislation, meaning the 40-seat Republican supermajority must muster at least 26 votes if all 10 Democrats vote no. GOP Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith can break a 25-25 tie if all members are present.
But not all senators have been at the Statehouse this week. 
Several GOP senators were missing on Monday and Tuesday, and by Wednesday, Republican Sens. Jim Buck, Scott Alexander and Ryan Mishler remained absent. 
Sen. Linda Rogers, R-Granger, noted in committee Wednesday morning that Alexander recently had open-heart surgery and said he was “doing really well,” but Senate Republican staff could not confirm who would or would not be present for Thursday’s vote.
Uncertainty surrounds Thursday vote
The bill’s advancement follows a Monday committee vote where two Democrats and one Republican opposed the measure — although several Republicans who voted to move it to the floor said they could still vote no on final passage. 
That included Sens. Greg Goode, Stacey Donato and Rogers. The three are among the 10 GOP lawmakers who have not publicly committed to mid-cycle redistricting.
Goode, R-Terre Haute, said after Wednesday’s Senate session that he remained undecided ahead of Thursday’s expected vote.
“I’m going to give it one more night to sleep on it, and then I want to hear one more time among my colleagues the arguments for and against,” he told the Indiana Capital Chronicle.
Goode said he has had two phone calls with Trump about redistricting, the most recent one on Monday and another call with White House officials Wednesday morning.

Goode described those calls as “very spirited advocacy,” but said has has”never felt threatened or pressured by the White House.”
At least a dozen legislators, many Senate Republicans — including Goode — have publicly disclosed being targeted in swatting attempts, bomb threats and more. The incidents have prompted an ongoing investigation now led by the Indiana State Police.
Sen. Mike Crider, R-Greenfield, said Wednesday he remained a firm opponent of the redistricting plan and that senators needed to resist such intimidation attempts.
“When you get kind of bullied and threatened, if that tactic works, then you can expect to deal with that for the rest of your political career,” Crider said after Wednesday’s Senate session. “This has been really kind of a discouraging thing that we’re experiencing this in Indiana. It’s not been our style in the past, and I’m hopeful that it’s not something we deal with in the future.”
Goode and Crider, who are both members of the budget-writing Senate Appropriations Committee, said they wouldn’t be swayed by arguments that the Trump administration could financially punish Indiana if the Senate doesn’t support the redrawn maps.
Goode said he believed the federal government would fulfill any obligations to the state.
“Now, can the administration potentially slow walk something? Could a grant request or some type of line of funding take a little bit longer, possibly,” Goode said. “But I have not, and I will not, make my final decision based on worrying of what could happen. That’s not the way, I think, we should govern.”
Crider said he expected Indiana’s congressional delegation to stand up to any financial threats.
“My opinion is that the spread on votes are so thin in Congress that if our federal delegation won’t stand together and say, ‘Leave Indiana alone,’ then they’re not doing their jobs,” Crider said. “I think that they have the ability to say, ‘If you’re going to hurt Indiana, then we’re not passing anything out of the House of Representatives until you stop that.’ That’s what I think should happen.”
Democrats keep amendments brief
The House approved the redistricting bill Friday, as expected, on a vote of 57-41. Twelve Republicans joined all Democrats present in opposition.
Gov. Mike Braun has stood by threats that he and Trump have made to support Republican primary challengers against senators who reject the new maps.
Wednesday’s floor debate in the Senate centered on three Democratic amendments, each defeated in a matter of minutes.
Outside the chamber, just a handful of protesters lingered in the hallway, and the usually crowded Senate balcony sat nearly empty — also a shift from the packed committee room on Monday.
Indiana Senate committee pushes redistricting bill forward though future still unknown

An amendment offered by Sen. Fady Qaddoura, D-Indianapolis, would have deleted the bill entirely and replaced it with a prohibition on redrawing congressional districts except immediately after the decennial census.
Qaddoura has already filed similar substantive language for the 2026 session in Senate Bill 53.
“The amendment deletes the content of House Bill 1032 completely, A to Z, and it explicitly adds language to prohibit mid-cycle congressional redistricting, because that’s not what Hoosiers asked us to come and do during this session,” Qaddoura said. “Hoosiers did not send us here to do a mid-decade redistricting of congressional seats.”
Sen. Mike Gaskill, R-Pendleton, the bill’s sponsor, urged colleagues to oppose what he called a “strip-and-insert” amendment. 
Another amendment from Sen. J.D. Ford, D-Indianapolis, would have required counties to report costs related to implementing new maps and authorized the state comptroller to reimburse them.
Ford noted that clerks — particularly in Marion County — testified that implementing new congressional boundaries so close to the 2026 election cycle would require new materials, additional staff and overtime hours, and substantial public-information efforts.
“These folks are likely to be saddled with extra costs … including updating ballots, hiring more temporary staff, moving the appropriate voters and conducting information campaigns,” Ford said. “At a time when Hoosiers families are begging for relief … we should not be forcing local governments to spend scarce taxpayer dollars on political power grabs such as this.”

Gaskill, in opposition, maintained that the amendment “basically creates an appropriation,” which would make it procedurally out of order at this stage in the legislative process.
Sen. Lonnie Randolph, D-East Chicago, offered a third amendment, which aimed to strike language that limits where and how lawsuits challenging the maps could be filed. The current draft of the bill would bar temporary restraining orders against the maps and route appeals directly to the Indiana Supreme Court.
Randolph called his proposal a “simple amendment,” arguing that trial courts should retain jurisdiction and that forcing precincts to straddle multiple congressional districts would create confusion for local precinct officials.
Gaskill urged the Senate to defeat that amendment, too. He defended the bill’s legal-challenge language as a way to avoid “chaos and confusion.”
“Often, throughout the country, chaos and confusion has been created with election related lawsuits,” he said. “And this sets up a clear procedure … and gets them expeditiously to the Indiana Supreme Court. … I think that’s very important, regardless of which side of the redistricting issue you’re on.”
