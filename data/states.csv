Wed Moore (D) in a Democratic primary.","Baltimore businessman Ed Hale Sr. during a campaign event Wednesday in Canton, where said he will switch parties and run for governor next year as a Rebublican. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Ed Hale Sr., a Baltimore businessman, sports team owner and longtime Democrat, ended speculation about his party affiliation and declared Wednesday that he will run for governor as a Republican.
Hale described himself as a moderate, but said his party switch was rooted in political pragmatism more than ideology.
“There’s no way I could win running against Wes Moore with that machine he’s got,” Hale said of the incumbent Democratic governor. “He takes all the money and oxygen out of the room. I can’t do it. I’m a pragmatist and I’m a moderate person. That’s just the way I am.”
Hale made the announcement — one that was expected — in an east Baltimore waterfront park that he once owned and sold to the city. It came after he hired Annapolis pollster Patrick Gonzales to look at a head-to-head race between himself and Moore.
“I don’t believe I had a chance, based on the polling that was done, to beat him,” Hale said of Moore. “I had a chance, but it was not as good as it would be running as a Republican.”
Hale said later that the poll only looked at him against Moore and did not include other Republicans who have filed or announced for governor, or who are the subject of speculation.
Hale, 78, is well-known in the business community but is an unpolished political candidate.

“So, the big thing here is, I like building things.  I like making things. I like hiring people. That’s the way it is,” Hale said. “ What we have right now are these career politicians with smiling faces that really, really don’t give a sh-t. You all know it. I do. I care.”
While Hale was blunt about his reasons for switching, Senate Minority Leader Stephen S. Hershey Jr. (R-Upper Shore) was equally blunt, casting doubt on Hale’s affiliation switch and portraying him as a political opportunist.
“We’ve built a Republican movement in Maryland that stands for more than just opposition to the far left — it stands for authentic leadership and a clear governing philosophy,” Hershey said in a statement. “Our voters expect more than opportunism — they expect commitment.”
Hershey noted that Hale has “spent decades” supporting Democrats.
In remarks to reporters, Hale noted his relationships with former Baltimore mayor and Maryland Gov. William Donald Schaefer, a Democrat. He also spoke about raising money for Democrats including Dutch Ruppersberger, the former Baltimore County executive and congressman, and former Sens. Ben Cardin and Barbara Mikulski.
“I did it because they were going to win and if you don’t do that, you’re just not very pragmatic or prudent,” Hale said.
But he noted he also voted for Republicans, including former Govs. Larry Hogan and Robert Ehrlich.
“It’s just the way that I am. I want to vote for the winner,” he said.
Hale grew up in Baltimore. He said his record “stands for itself” more than political affiliation.
“If you want to talk about labels, I’m the wrong person,” he said. “You’re born in Baltimore — I’m from east Baltimore not too far from here — and you’re automatically a Democrat. But I stopped thinking about party affiliation except when I voted.”
He described his Democratic affiliation as a business tool.
“If you’re building anything, you have to go with the party that’s in place, so you have someone to call to get a permit,” Hale said. “I can sugarcoat it any way you want, but that’s the tool.”
Hershey, in his statement, questioned Hale’s commitment to core Republican principles.

“The Republican nomination for Governor will not be handed out to the highest-profile defector from the left. It must be earned,” Hershey said in his statement. “Maryland Republicans expect their leaders to stand firm on limited government, lower taxes, and personal responsibility.
“We’ll be scrutinizing Ed’s record closely to ensure he genuinely embraces our values, not simply our party label,” Hershey’s statement said.
Hale may also find himself at odds with Republicans aligned with President Donald Trump.
“Now, I am not a Donald Trump guy. I’m going to make that very clear,” Hale said, but added that he would try to work with the president, who is very unpopular in Maryland.
Hale said he would not “poke” Trump as Moore and other Democrats have done.
“You have to have some pragmatism and common sense … so that you know that you’re going to be doing the right thing to make jobs in the state of Maryland,” he said.
Hale laid out a platform of opposing taxes and fees and accused Democrats of misrepresentation as some, including Moore, claimed to have cut taxes.
“I want to attack … what we all know is a problem,” Hale said. “I think we have dishonest people telling us things that are just not true, making us try to try to make us believe that these things are true, that the taxes are not going up. That fees are not going up. We all know it’s not true.”
He said he backs nuclear power as a way to lower energy costs in the state and hinted at a tough-on-crime position, calling for juveniles as young as 14 to be jailed and for parents to be held responsible.
“I think we should lower the date that they could go to jail — the age — down to 14,” Hale said. “If that’s the one stealing the cars and doing that, put them in jail. Find the parents and get judgments against the parents, too. That will begin the parenting.”
Hale joins a growing field of Republicans who have formally filed or announced for governor.

John Myrick, who previously ran an unsuccessful campaign for U.S. Senate, and Carl A. Brunner Jr., a Carroll firearms instructor, have both formally filed for the GOP nomination.
Freshman Del. Christopher Bouchat (R-Frederick and Carroll) said he will run for governor rather than re-election to the House. Carroll County farmer Kurt Wedekind has also said he will seek the Republican nomination. Neither Bouchat nor Wedekind have formally filed their candidacy.
And then there is the ongoing speculation about Hogan mulling a possible return to office. The former two-term governor has used social media to stoke that speculation.
Hale himself raised the possibility of another Republican former governor – Ehrlich — attempting a comeback.
“If Larry Hogan wants to run, if Bob Ehrlich wants to run — I’ve heard that, too – have at it. Let’s have a contest,” he said.
Hale’s announcement Wednesday does not make him a formal candidate. He must change his party registration, something the Talbot County resident said he could do as early as Wednesday.
Hale must also register his campaign committee with the Maryland State Board of Elections, as well as financial disclosure forms. Hale said some of that may also be done as early as Wednesday afternoon.
He cannot file his formal candidacy with the state board until he chooses a running mate.

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)Thirty people have died so far this summer due to heat-related illness in Maryland, the highest number of heat deaths in the state in more than a decade, according to the latest state data.
And the grim milestone comes with weeks still remaining in this year’s “heat season,” the Maryland Health Department said.
David McCallister, public information officer for the health department, said in a written statement that the agency is reaching out to the departments of Aging and of Human Services to push messaging on heat safety practices, especially as older individuals make up a majority of heat-related fatalities.


Cooling centers
For information on cooling centers in all 23 Maryland counties and Baltimore City, go here.


He said the department is working on “reminding people, especially caregivers, to check on older clients, neighbors and family members on hot days to make sure they are keeping cool and have working air conditioning.”
During the summer, the Maryland Department of Health releases a weekly report called the Heat-Related Illness Surveillance Report, tracking the number of 911 calls, emergency room visits and fatalities that occur during the “heat season” that runs from April through September.
This week’s report, published Wednesday, shows data through Aug. 16, and says that 80% of the 30 heat fatalities this summer were elderly victims.
“As the heat season progressed, we noticed a high proportion of deaths were older adults 65 and over,” McCallister said in the statement. “To this date, 24 out of the 30 deaths reported this season were people aged 65 and over.”
The elderly population in the state is one of the most vulnerable groups affected by heat illness, according to state health officials, along with young children and people facing significant health challenges.
As of this week, the report also features new data to show where those deaths occur – indoors, outdoors or in vehicles. Sixteen of this summer’s heat deaths occurred indoors, nine were in an outdoors setting and the remaining five were inside vehicles.


The only time the number of deaths has been higher was in 2012, according to available historical data, when 46 Maryanders died. That summer, storm-driven power outages left many without air conditioning for days.
Trips to the emergency room due to heat-related illnesses also continue to climb this summer, after reaching a five-year high last month. At least 1,561 people had landed in the emergency room or in urgent care due to heat-related illnesses this summer, compared to 1,206 for all of 2024. While emergency department visits are up, however, the 1,008 emergency medical service calls for heat-related stress so far this year still lag behind the 1,502 recorded in all of last year.
There are still weeks left in the 2025 heat season. Along with checking on elderly neighbors and family members, health officials continue to press heat safety measures in the waning weeks of summer.
The department reminds Marylanders to drink plenty of fluids to help cope with the hot weather and urges folks to avoid alcohol, caffeine and overly sweetened beverages. Officials also encourage people to wear sunscreen and stay in the shade when possible. Those in need of a cool location can contact their local health departments or call 211 to find the nearest cooling center.

Thompson Federal Courthouse in Nashville. (Photo by John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)NASHVILLE — Lawyers for Kilmar Abrego Garcia are asking a federal judge in Tennessee to dismiss human smuggling charges against him, calling the case a clear example of “selective and vindictive prosecution” by the Trump administration.
In a motion filed late Tuesday, just days ahead of Abrego’s expected pretrial release, the attorneys conceded their argument to dismiss the case is “infrequently made and rarely succeeds.”
“But if there has ever been a case for dismissal on those grounds, this is that case,” they wrote. “The government is attempting to use this case — and this Court — to punish Mr. Abrego for successfully fighting his unlawful removal. That is a constitutional violation of the most basic sort.”
The government has not yet filed a legal response. “The United States’ position is set forth in Mr. McGuire’s statements in court and our pleadings,” a spokesperson for Acting U.S. Attorney Robert McGuire said in an email Wednesday.
The 35-page petition seeking to dismiss all charges narrates a chain of events that began with Abrego’s detention by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in March, while driving with his son in Maryland, through his deportation days later to a Salvadoran prison. Abrego remained for months in the notorious maximum security CECOT prison, despite the admission by a government attorney he had been sent there in error.
Abrego subsequently said he was tortured while in CECOT.
‘A wide-ranging and unprecedented retribution campaign’
Attorneys for Abrego challenged his removal to El Salvador for lack of due process in a separate lawsuit filed in federal court in Maryland, where the 29-year-old sheet metal apprentice had been living with his wife and children.

“The government did not take steps to fix its mistake,” his Tennessee lawyers wrote Tuesday. “Instead, in response to his lawsuit — and to the substantial publicity it received — the government undertook a wide-ranging and unprecedented retribution campaign against Mr. Abrego.”
The human smuggling charges brought against Abrego in Tennessee are part of that campaign, his lawyers argued.
A Tennessee grand jury in June returned the indictments for “conspiracy to unlawfully transport illegal aliens for financial gain” and “unlawful transportation of illegal aliens for financial gain.” Prosecutors contend Abrego participated in a national scheme to move immigrants who entered the United States illegally to points around the country. Abrego, as his attorneys refer to him in legal filings, has pleaded not guilty.
The charges are tied to a 2022 traffic stop in Putnam County, Tenn., where Abrego was pulled over for speeding with nine passengers in the back of his car. Abrego was neither ticketed nor arrested in the stop.
A Department of Homeland Security special agent later testified he was not tasked with investigating the Tennessee traffic stop until April 28 of this year. By then, a Maryland federal judge had ordered the government to facilitate Abrego’s return to the U.S. and the Supreme Court had upheld the decision.
The government returned Abrego to Tennessee to face charges on June 6.
Case draws national scrutiny
The case generated widespread public scrutiny of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown tactics during his initial months in office, which were criticized for undermining due process rights guaranteed to both citizens and noncitizens.
Abrego, a Salvadoran national who entered the United States illegally as a teenager, is subject to a 2019 immigration court order that prohibits the government from deporting him to El Salvador, where he says he faces threats of gang violence.
After his wrongful deportation, administration officials, including President Donald Trump, singled out Abrego in their public comments, calling him a “gangbanger,” “monster,” “illegal predator,” “illegal alien terrorist,” “wife beater,” and “human trafficker.”
Abrego’s attorneys accused the administration of a public smear campaign intended to paper over its embarrassment over his wrongful deportation and to retaliate against his legal efforts to assert his due process rights. Abrego has denied gang affiliation.

The administration’s public statements, Abrego’s attorneys argued, bolster their claims that the prosecution against him is retaliatory.
“The unprecedented public pronouncements attacking Mr. Abrego for his successful exercise of constitutional rights by senior cabinet members, leaders of the DOJ, and even the President of the United States, make this the rare case where actual vindictiveness is clear from the record,” they wrote.
Lawyers seek to curb Trump administration comments about the case
Earlier this month, Abrego’s attorneys sought, for a second time, a court order restricting government officials’ remarks about the case as prejudicial and contrary to standard court rules.
In response, U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw, who presides over the Tennessee criminal case, directed all “counsel and those working with counsel” to note in their public communications that Abrego is presumed innocent.
“Our Constitution requires that Abrego is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt by a jury,” Crenshaw wrote in his July 31 order.
Separately, in response to Abrego’s attorney’s waiver of the right to a speedy trial, the court set a trial date of Jan. 27.
Abrego remains in the custody of the U.S. Marshals, who have jurisdiction over pretrial detainees in federal cases.
Abrego has already been cleared for release pending trial by a Tennessee magistrate, an order placed on hold at the request of his attorneys amid uncertainty over whether federal immigration officials intend to detain or deport him to a “third country.”
Abrego’s attorneys on Tuesday requested the magistrate move forward with releasing him Friday, the day the hold expires.
The attorneys noted a Maryland federal judge has barred the government from taking Abrego into immigration custody and required immigration officials to provide 72-hours written notice before removing him to a third country.
His Tennessee lawyers, Sean Hecker and Rascoe Dean, also wrote they are “retaining a private security firm that has experience providing court-approved pre-trial transportation and security services in criminal cases to transport Mr. Abrego from Tennessee to Maryland upon release.”
The lawyers requested details about the security arrangements be kept under seal “in order to protect Mr. Abrego’s safety.”
A federal magistrate on Wednesday set a tentative hearing for Friday if prosecutors oppose any of the conditions of Abrego’s release sought by his attorneys.

(Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)A Cecil County sheriff’s deputy faces more than 40 criminal counts for repeatedly searching a law enforcement database to turn up information about his wife, romantic partners and others, the Maryland State Prosecutor announced Wednesday.
The law only permits police officers to search the database in furtherance of a legitimate investigation, according to the prosecutor’s office. But charges against Dontae Odom said the patrol officer continually searched individuals in the database with whom he had a personal relationship, who were not the subject of a law enforcement investigation.
Odom, 36, who had served since 2019, resigned from the department on Friday, according to a spokesman.
Documents filed in Cecil County Circuit Court said the searches began in 2024, and Odom was notified that December that he was facing a criminal investigation for his use of the database. But a few of the dozens of unauthorized searches occurred in early 2025, to documents say.
Prosecutors listed seven victims, including Odom’s wife, romantic partners, and relatives of his romantic partners. Odom reportedly searched the database for an employee of an Ocean City hotel he visited with a romantic partner. None of the victims were named in the documents.

	Cecil County Sheriff Scott A. Adams said his department told the state prosecutor about the situation after receiving a complaint.
“We received the initial complaint and upon review, decided that in the spirit of transparency, that an independent investigation would be best served in this case,” Adams said in a statement. “We take our job as public servants very seriously and expect all of our deputies to serve with the utmost integrity and professionalism.”
When Odom was told of the criminal investigation, he was ordered to cease contact with victims, including “Victim 4,” a romantic partner who worked in the same building that he did and who had witnessed the Ocean City search. But Odom continued to contact Victim 4 through social media, texts and emails, according to the court filing, and secretly recorded a conversation in March when they met at a secluded location, leading to a wiretapping charge.
In all, Odom faces 28 counts of misconduct in office, 16 counts of unauthorized access to a computer and one count of unlawful interception of communications. Attorneys listed for Odom in online court records did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.

Maya Homan/Georgia RecorderCOLUMBUS, Ga. — For the third consecutive year, efforts to limit lawsuits were on the agenda at the Georgia Chamber of Commerce’s annual congressional luncheon.
The event, which was held this year at the Columbus Georgia Convention and Trade Center in Columbus, drew roughly a thousand attendees from hundreds of companies in Georgia’s business community. Headlining speakers included Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff and Republican Congressmen Buddy Carter and Mike Collins, both of whom are vying for Ossoff’s Senate seat in 2026.
Former University of Tennessee football coach Derek Dooley, the Gov. Brian Kemp-backed candidate for Senate, was also in attendance, though he declined to take questions from the press.
Georgia’s lawsuit reform package could go national
For the past few years, Kemp has used the annual luncheon to highlight the need for what he has termed “tort reform,” or policies overhauling the civil litigation system to make it harder for plaintiffs to file and successfully win lawsuits. The issue was Kemp’s top priority during the 2025 Legislative session, and he signed major lawsuit overhaul legislation into law this past April.
This year, it was Collins who called for the proposal to be adopted on the federal level during a fireside chat with U.S. Rep. Austin Scott and former Congressman Drew Ferguson, both Georgia Republicans.
“Insurance has gone sky high, and until we get true tort reform on the federal level, you’re not going to fix this problem out there,” Collins said.
Collins, who the day before held the official kickoff event for his Senate campaign, sought to cast himself as a candidate who could work with both conservative and moderate wings of the Republican Party.
“They know I’m MAGA, everybody knows,” he said. “But they also know that I can talk to the more moderate Republicans that we have out there.”
Carter calls for loosened pollution regs, mail-in ballot ban

During a separate fireside chat with Public Service Commissioner Fitz Johnson, Carter also touted proposals that would loosen air pollution regulations and increase Georgia’s energy independence, which he claims will help boost businesses in the state.
“I love the environment,” he said. “Georgia is my home, of course I love it. But at the same time, we’ve got to be realistic about the impact we’re having on businesses.”
Carter, who has branded himself a “MAGA warrior” in his Senate campaign, also told reporters he supports Trump’s push to ban the use of mail-in ballots as a method of voting in the U.S., despite the fact that the U.S. Constitution gives states explicit control over voting procedures.
“I quit questioning the realistic views of Donald Trump long ago,” he said. “He has exceeded anything I ever thought could happen.”
Ossoff talks China, foreign aid
Ossoff, Georgia’s lone Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate, headlined a fireside chat with Georgia Chamber of Commerce Chair Ed Elkins, discussing workforce development and national security issues, particularly when it comes to China.
“It is very much a jump ball between the U.S. and China right now, and frankly, we are engaged in tremendous self-harm right now in this competition,” Ossoff, who sits on the Senate intelligence committee, told Elkins.
Though he never mentioned Trump by name, Ossoff criticized the Trump administration’s stance on foreign policy, which he said has caused a “brain drain” of workers from the U.S. and frayed relationships with global allies.
“It matters when the United States supports global response to natural disasters,” he said. “It enhances our credibility, our power, our prestige.”
Trump’s move to withdraw most foreign aid has not been taken lightly, Ossoff added.
“Now our allies across the Indo-Pacific take note of that. When you have private conversations with them, they are now questioning our staying power and the credibility of our assurances in the region.”

(File photo by Danielle E. Gaines/Maryland Matters)Two newcomers and an old hand will fill three open seats on the seven-member board that oversees the multibillion-dollar Blueprint for Maryland’s Future education reform plan, as the program enters its fourth year of implementation.
Gov. Wes Moore (D) on Wednesday appointed Contina Quick-McQueen and Robin Werner and reappointed Joseph Manko to the Accountability and Implementation Board for terms of six years.
Their appointments must be approved by the Senate in the legislative session that begins in January, but they can serve in an acting capacity until then. The board is not meeting this month, but will meet next on Sept. 18
The three were chosen from six finalists out of field of 36 applicants. Besides serving on the board, Manko works as an education program director at the Abell Foundation in Baltimore.
Quick-McQueen has worked since 2014 as a supervisor of instruction in college and career readiness for St. Mary’s County Public Schools. She’s served since 2022 as part of a statewide Expert Review Team visiting schools to assess growth in academics and professional development for staff, among other educational factors.
New teachers, new policies as students, staff start to head back to school in Maryland

Werner is director of teaching and learning for Talbot County’s public schools. Besides working for the school system since 2008, She also serves on an advisory committee for the college and career readiness pillar of the Blueprint.
Riya Gupta, executive director for Strong Schools Maryland, which focuses on protecting the Blueprint, said in a statement that her group welcomes the three appointee.
“The Blueprint is at a pivotal point, and this moment brings an opportunity to strengthen stewardship and spark the creative, transformative thinking needed to build an education system that truly meets the needs of all students,” said Gupta, whose group plans to hold its third summer community conversation on the Blueprint next Wednesday.
“We’ll be there every step of the way to hold the AIB accountable to its charge and to keep Marylanders engaged as we work together to make the Blueprint’s vision a reality for students and school communities,” Gupta said.
Manko reapplied for his old job, but Werner and Quick-McQueen replace Mara Doss and Laura Stapleton, whose last meeting was June 26.
Stapleton, who chairs the Human Development and Quantitative Methodology Department at the University of Maryland, College Park, chose not to reapply after her term ended July 1. Doss, a former associate vice president for teaching, learning and student success at Prince George’s Community College, resigned with a year left on her term.
The new members join the Blueprint board after tweaks it approved last month to the overall comprehensive plan, which include revisions based on policies adopted this year by the General Assembly.

Alander Rocha/Georgia RecorderThe Georgia Department of Public Health is navigating a period of financial uncertainty due to the Trump administration’s proposed cut federal funding, state leaders said Wednesday. Some view the shift as an opportunity to focus on Georgia-specific priorities, while others raised concerns about the state having to fill in spending gaps down the road.
During the first meeting of the House Study Committee on Evaluating Funding for Public Health, state Health Commissioner Dr. Kathleen Toomey said potential budget cuts to public health provide a chance to prioritize the state’s approach to public health, adding that the current shifts in federal funding are not the first time Georgia has faced such changes. 
The state has a long history of adapting to “episodic” funding adjustments, she said, and the current situation could be a chance to focus on what the state and local communities need most, rather than following a universal federal model.
“As we’re seeing these changes at the federal level, it’s giving us an opportunity to look at what is important for us, because we often apply for grants that may or may not have been relevant,” she said. “They weren’t developed with our state specifically in mind, with our data, and we were following guidelines that were universal across every state,” Toomey said.

She said the Maternal, Infant, and Early Child Hood Home Visiting Program, which provides home visits to expectant and new parents who are at-risk for poor health outcomes, “reflects exactly what public health should be.” The program, which she said was created using data collected by clinicians and epidemiologists in local communities, provides care tailored specifically to each family’s needs, such as addressing issues like transportation barriers.
“[The program is] specific to that community … you will see that it really is quite different from one county to another, one community to another, because it reflects the needs of that community. That’s public health,” Toomey said.
William Bell, the state health department’s chief financial officer, said that the total appropriation for fiscal year 2026 is $922.5 million, with federal funds budgeted at $464.8 million. He said that the most significant impact occurred in March 2025, when 11 federal COVID-19 funding sources were terminated, resulting in a reduction of $323.7 million in unspent funds from an initial $877.6 million awarded.
“DPH is a predominantly federally funded agency, with around half of our FY ‘26 budget comprised of federal funding sources,” he said.
U.S. senators from both parties recently pushed back against Trump’s proposal to cut medical research and health services funding and instead agreed to increase spending for fiscal year 2026, which starts October 1. Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican from Maine and chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said that the appropriation bill “prioritizes funding to make Americans healthier.”
Lawmakers on the study committee, while acknowledging the opportunity, expressed some concern about the financial gap.
Swainsboro Republican Rep. Butch Parrish said he didn’t need an immediate answer but asked Toomey what the state will do if the reduced federal funding continues long-term.
“Obviously, we can help some, but I don’t think we can make up all of those dollars,” Parrish said and encouraged Toomey to evaluate programs that aren’t “working as we thought.”
Carolyn Mullen, senior vice president of government affairs at the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, who presented a national perspective on impending budget cuts, said that states across the country, regardless of which party is in charge, agree that they need more flexibility with federal funds, as current restrictions make it difficult to allocate money where it is most needed.
“It’s very difficult for many states when the funding is very restrictive, and it prevents the movement of dollars,” Mullen said.
Rep. Dexter Sharper, a Valdosta Democrat, said after the meeting that he believes Georgia has no choice but to find a way to make up for the financial shortfall to ensure citizens do not experience a reduction in services.
“Georgia as a whole has to look for ways to get funding to help subsidize what we’re going to be missing from the federal government,” he said. “We’re also trying to ensure that even at the county levels, they are able to understand that we all got to get this together and make sure we get the funding we need without cutting the services to the people.”
Sharper said this will require a collective effort at both the state and county levels. He said the committee is taking the issue “very seriously” and that they want to avoid cutting any necessary services. In addition to seeking funding from counties, he hopes to work with the governor to secure additional funding for the state health department, particularly for salaries, which he believes will help make the workforce more competitive and ensure the state can retain top talent to continue serving the public.
“The counties more than likely are going to have to contribute a little bit more to what they’re already contributing, and the state is going to have to contribute more than we’ve been contributing to try to catch these shortfalls,” Sharper said.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DSC06123-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-08-21 01:57:37.043342

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderOne of Georgia’s largest mass voter cancellations is wrapping up after 40 days, as election officials seek to purge outdated registrations from the state’s voter rolls.
Roughly 478,000 registered but inactive voters had been slated for removal, according to the secretary of state’s office. An additional 218,000 active voters were notified that they risked becoming inactive unless they reached out to their local elections office.
Officials with Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger’s office say that the purge is part of a routine maintenance process that states are required to undergo to ensure that voter rolls are accurate. 
“We conduct every phase of the list maintenance process as publicly as possible, and in accordance with State and Federal law, because transparency helps shore up public trust in the accuracy and integrity of the entire election process,” Raffensperger said in a statement.
A resident’s voter registration can be switched to “inactive” status if they do not vote for two consecutive federal elections, and they are eligible to be removed if they do not vote for the next two federal election cycles after that. 
According to Gabriel Sterling, who until recently was the secretary of state’s chief operating officer, the majority of those flagged during the most recent round of voter roll maintenance are believed to be people who have moved out of the state.
“Four thousand have let us know they’re here, another 700 went ahead and pre-canceled themselves,” Sterling said. “So it’s exactly what we think. These people have been gone for 10 to eight years, and they’re going to be off of our voter rolls, which helps us keep the cleanest voter rolls in America.”
Of the active voters who risked being moved to inactive status, Sterling said, “so far, we’ve had about 300 people cancel themselves completely, and another 4,000 who have said, ‘Yes, we’re still here.’”
In recent years, conservative activists have fixated on Georgia’s voter rolls, reiterating unproven claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. Many activists have also taken it upon themselves to challenge voter registrations they find suspicious, sometimes filing tens of thousands of voter registration challenges at a time.
Efforts to preemptively remove inactive voters may quell fears from right-wing activists. However, Raffensperger’s efforts have been opposed by groups like Fair Fight, which say that voter roll purges disproportionately impact Black voters.
“After excluding voters who cast ballots in other states and likely moved, this purge list disproportionately targets Black Georgians who likely still live here,” Fair Fight CEO Lauren Groh-Wargo said in a statement. “Once again, politicians are rushing to remove voters based on unreliable data – and young Black voters are bearing the brunt.”
Sterling also said he was considering launching a campaign for secretary of state in 2026. If he decides to run, he will join a field of candidates that includes state Rep. Tim Fleming, a Covington Republican, and Kelvin King, the husband of State Election Board member Janelle King.

I’m really sorry. In case you haven’t heard, last week the cabal of developers that Gov. Ron DeSantis appointed to “protect” you and Florida’s other wildlife voted to allow people to hunt you with guns, bows and arrows, and even, a year from now, dogs.
There was a ton of opposition to the decision. Of 13,000 online comments, three-quarters came from people against the hunt. This is just like 10 years ago, the last time they voted to hold a hunt despite strong public opposition. That one turned into a colossal disaster, with hunters — in only two days! — killing 304 bears, nearly the entire weeklong quota allowed, including 34 lactating females. I’m betting this one will be just as disastrous.
There’s still a chance the hunt could be halted before it begins in December. An environmental group called Bear Warriors United has filed a legal challenge, seeking to overturn the decision by the Florida Fish and Wildlife “Conservation” Commission.

“The very agency that’s been entrusted to protect these animals is now in the business of destroying them,” Raquel Levy, the attorney at the Atlantic Law Center who’s handling the case pro bono for Bear Warriors United, told me.
If the name of Levy’s client sounds familiar, it’s probably because Bear Warriors United recently won a huge lawsuit against the Florida Department of Environmental Protection over how that state agency failed to protect manatees from the consequences of water pollution.
“In a state where it’s so hard to ever win anything for the environment in court,” Katrina Shadix, founder of Bear Warriors United, told me at the time, “this is a big victory.”
As for her new suit, Shadix said she hopes it will “shine a bright light to expose the FWC’s culture of corruption, as well as demonstrate the desperate and immediate need for massive agency reform.”
Shadix isn’t guaranteed to win this case, even though she won the last one. But after reading over the suit, I have to tell you bears that I think she’s got a chance at saving your furry hides.
It’s about science and the law — or rather, the lack thereof.
 Flying blind

We humans frequently joke about you bears doing, ummmm, certain things in the woods. We’ve even featured you in a series of ridiculous toilet paper commercials based on that joke.
But the truth is, we don’t really know a lot about what you do in the woods. Our ignorance is so vast, it includes not knowing how many of you there are.
Before the disastrous 2015 Florida bear hunt, scientists estimated there were about 4,300 of you wandering in what was left of our wilderness.
Ten years later, biologists are still working on coming up with an accurate count. But they have produced another estimate. Now they estimate there are 4,050 of you doing your business in the woods.
I’m no wild-haired math wizard like Albert Einstein, but even I can see that’s fewer than we had a decade ago. Yet despite that disparity, the commissioners seemed hell-bent on blowing some of you away.
By the way, I should mention that about 300 of you bears get killed each year by humans — drivers of cars and trucks, mostly, plus a few poachers. (By contrast, the death of an 89-year-old man in Collier County in May marked the first time in recorded history that a Florida bear killed a human being.)
I wish we humans were doing something to prevent that, such as building more wildlife underpasses and overpasses. Instead, a small percentage of us seem bound and determined to kill even more of you.
  Rodney Barreto (image via screen grab)
During the commission meeting last week, Commission Chairman Rodney Barreto — who recently got caught lying under oath to a legislative committee — bragged about the process behind their vote.
“We make decisions based on science,” said Barreto, a wealthy developer.
The lawsuit says just the opposite is true, accusing the FWC of “flying blind as to the black bear population in making decisions.”
 Interpreting the language

I have a theory that we human Florida natives grow up hearing so many bogus sales pitches that we become experts at picking out what’s really being said.
  George Warthen of Fish Wildlife Commission (Image via screen grab)
During last week’s wildlife commission meeting, the FWC’s conservation director, George Warthen, laid out the hunt’s reasons and rules. More than once, he said that a hunt “provides access to the resource.”
When he said that, what I heard was: “All the Elmer Fudd wannabes get to blast away at more wild animals, woo-hoo!”
Warthen also talked about how your population has expanded since 1992, which was nice to hear. But he never mentioned that your population appears to have declined in the last decade.  
Why not? Perhaps because it didn’t fit the narrative that his bosses wanted to hear.
But failing to discuss that sets up the Bear Warriors United lawsuit, which takes aim — oops, sorry! — at the lack of science underlying the vote. It calls the rules of the hunt “woefully vague and unsupported by any current scientific evidence.”
For his presentation, Warthen went through a PowerPoint that included, on a single slide, the date upon which the official bear population estimates were made.
The FWC has divided the state into seven “bear management units,” and for three of them, the date of the most recent population estimate is 2015. A fourth one is from 2014 — before the last hunt. In other words, those numbers are out of date.
Warthen talked about how these population numbers were “good for a generation” but what I think he meant was, “We don’t really have any recent estimate for most of the bear population, but I know y’all are going to do what you want anyway.”
He talked about the amount of habitat occupied by you bears. You’re probably feeling squeezed by all the development going on these days, some of which was done by members of the wildlife commission. While the bear population has declined, the human population has definitely ballooned.
But Warthen told his bosses that you have enough habitat now for the 4,000 or so that live here. Here’s how he spun that:
“While there is enough habitat to support our current bear population, a highly regulated hunt would prevent future negative impacts.”
What I heard was: “If we let hunters kill enough bears now, then the developers who basically run the DeSantis administration can continue destroying even more of their habitat.”
The Floridian interpretation game got really fun when Barreto started bragging about what a great job the commission has been doing.
First he mentioned how alligators have bounced back from the days when they were considered an endangered species. Then he said, “Manatees have been an incredible success story for Florida.”
What he failed to mention is that the comebacks occurred while these species were protected from hunting. In fact, it’s been illegal to kill a manatee in Florida since 1893.  
As of 2019, the FWC estimated that there were about 6,000 manatees swimming around Florida. They’re classified as a threatened species, and yet their population is larger than yours. File that under what Arsenio Hall used to call, “Things that make you go hmmmm.”
Considering the massive manatee die-off caused by the loss of seagrass beds, I don’t think we’ll be seeing the commission declare an open season on sea cows anytime soon. But hey, you never know!
The founding father
The FWC is itself a rare creature. It’s the only state-run wildlife agency in America that’s set up to be an independent commission.
  Clay Henderson via subject
“The idea was to get politics out of wildlife management,” said Clay Henderson, a longtime Florida environmental activist and lawyer.
Henderson is credited with writing the part of the state Constitution that created the wildlife commission. Now, he told me, “I’m the founding father who’s disappointed in his children.”
The state has a Black Bear Management Plan, approved in 2019, that’s intended to govern everything the commission does as it deals with its bear issues, he pointed out. The commission ignored that plan in voting to bring back the hunt, he said.
The Bear Management Plan is supposed to be the blueprint for statewide black bear management until 2027. It emphasizes conflict resolution, habitat protection, and teaching people who move into your habitat how to get along with you, since you were here first.
The Bear Management Plan also encourages the commissioners to use their statutory and constitutional powers to influence land use and development decisions in bear habitat.
Barreto, on the other hand, made a big deal last week about how the commissioners have no control over land-use decisions. He insisted they can’t do anything to protect your habitat from being paved over.
Bowing to a minority
I grew up hunting in the Panhandle, so I’m familiar with the joys of tromping around in the woods to “access the resource” with a Remington 12-gauage.
As a student of Florida history, I also know how important hunters have been in preserving our most important environmental spaces, including the Big Cypress Swamp.
These days, though, hunting is no longer a popular pastime. Only one out of 100 people in Florida owns a hunting license. Yet our public agencies continue acting with extreme deference toward what this small group of people want.
Last December, the FWC staff presented to the commissioners a routine update on the bear management plan. They offered no recommendations for changes.
  Wildlife commissioner Gary Lester, via FWC
But almost as soon as the biologist was done speaking, Commissioner Gary Lester, who works for the developer of The Villages, piped up.
He said he wanted the staff to bring back a proposal for a bear hunt.
There was no preamble, no lengthy discussion, not even a statement of why he wanted it. He just dropped that bombshell and his colleagues voted to make it so.
Lester, by the way, is the person who made the motion last week to approve the unscientific hunting proposal for this year.
When the motion passed, Barreto smirked at the crowd and said, “Anybody surprised?”
Delegating life and death
Here’s the other problem with what the commissioners voted for: It’s unconstitutional.
The item that they voted on specifically calls for holding not just one bear hunt, but bear hunts every year from here on out.
But the commissioners agreed to leave it up to their executive director to pick the dates, set the number of bears to be killed and work out the other details, such as how many hunting licenses to issue. They didn’t even set a specific number of bears to be killed this December. That, too, was left to their executive director.
“They’re delegating these important life-and-death decisions,” Henderson said. “They did this deliberately, so they don’t have to go through the public hearing process every time.”
Considering that nearly 200 people lined up last week to tell the commissioners what they thought of them, you can see why they might want to skip that in 2026, 2027, and so on. But the law says they can’t avoid taking that heat.
Handing off their authority to the executive director is not allowed under the rules for how the commission is set up, said Henderson, who probably knows more about those rules than anyone else.
Thus, the Bear Warriors United lawsuit attacks that weakness as well.
“By removing the bear hunt decision to the ‘executive director or designee,’ the public is denied the due process to be heard concerning the issue and to have the constitutionally appointed officers make the decision,” the lawsuit says.
In a way, though, the ultimate decision on this matter is up to a different public official. I’m talking about the guy who thought it would be a good idea to build golf courses in our state parks and set up a prison camp in the Big Cypress National Preserve.
All seven wildlife commissioners were appointed by Ron DeSantis. One of their number, Gary Nicklaus (yes, the son of the Golden Bear himself, Jack Nicklaus), apparently felt uncomfortable voting for hunting the non-golden variety. He resigned mere days before last week’s meeting.  
  Commissioner Joshua Kellam (Image Fish and Wildlife Commission)
DeSantis — who waited six months to appoint a replacement for his lieutenant governor — fairly leapt to appoint a replacement for Nicklaus ahead of the vote. His pick, who took office two days before the meeting: Joshua Kellam, president of a Palm Beach development and mining company. You can probably guess which way he voted on hunting you poor bears.
My point here is that if the Bear Warriors United lawsuit succeeds in overturning the wildlife commission vote, that’s good for you guys as well as for the value of public opinion in shaping public policy.
But if the Division of Administrative Hearings rules against the Bear Warriors United suit, then it’s time for you bears to act. I can’t tell you what to do, but if you were to show up in large numbers at the governor’s mansion to show him what you normally do in the woods, I think everyone would completely understand.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-21 04:01:01+00:00,CT Mirror,Restorative justice must guide CT’s early childhood investments,Georgia Goldburn,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/21/restorative-justice-must-guide-cts-early-childhood-investments/,CT must adopt a restorative justice  approach in reforming its early childcare education system —one that acknowledges past injustices against Black women.,"Long before “childcare” became a public concern, it was an economic necessity, met by the labor of enslaved and later impoverished Black women. 
Black women cared for white children while being denied the right and opportunity to care for their own. When the government crafted social safety nets under the New Deal, Black women were intentionally excluded from the economic protections that shaped the American middle class. During the New Deal era, landmark labor protections—including Social Security, minimum wage laws, and the right to unionize—excluded domestic and agricultural workers. 
This was no oversight. These were acts of legislative design driven by racial animus and economic convenience; a deliberate compromise with Southern lawmakers seeking to preserve racial hierarchies. These exclusions forced Black women into low-wage, unprotected labor, particularly as caregivers.  As such, America’s childcare system is not broken —it is operating exactly as it was designed: to privatize care, devalue the labor of Black women, and shift costs onto those least able to afford them, producing the fragmented, underfunded, and inequitable system we see today.
This year, Connecticut passed two landmark legislations —House Bill 5003 and Senate Bill 1— that commit over $300 million to early childhood education. These bills aim to establish a permanent funding stream to expand access, stabilize providers, and support families with subsidies and capped co-payments. These are transformative steps in the right direction. 
However, as Connecticut enters a new era of early child care education reform and public investment, we must ask: “What would it mean to repair the harm done to Black women within a reimagined early child care education system?”  I believe Connecticut can offer a model for reparative investments. 
To do so, Connecticut must adopt a restorative justice lens and approach in reforming its early childcare education system —one that explicitly acknowledges past injustices and centers Black women in policy design as leaders and owners, not just as laborers.  Connecticut’s restorative justice measures must encompass more than expanded access, aspirations for equity, and community listening sessions. It must recognize that racialized policies and legislation systematically excluded Black women from wealth-building opportunities and intentionally relegated them to underpaid care work. It must acknowledge that the legacy of these policies has entrenched Black women in low-wage childcare roles while creating barriers to ownership and decision-making. Restorative justice would require nothing less than honoring Black women’s role as America’s first institutional childcare providers, preserving their ownership stake in the system they built, and creating space for them to lead its rebirth.
As Connecticut positions itself to reimagine and reform its early childhood education system, it must resist universal rollout without racial equity safeguards. The risk of not embedding and implementing reparative measures is not only inefficiency, but also the perpetuation of the very inequities this funding seeks to address. Restorative justice demands that implementation be oriented towards those historically harmed, and who continue to be most affected by the legacy of racialized legislation. That success is measured not just by the number of slots created within and for communities of color, but by who benefits and how they benefit. 
While this may be controversial, especially in the age of President Trump, this is not about preference or “DEI” (the way it’s prejoratively and erroneously used) —instead, it’s rooted in the principle of repair.  Far from being a novel or fringe concept, restorative justice is already embedded in Connecticut’s public policy.  The state’s marijuana legalization framework embedded restorative justice by expunging certain low-level past cannabis convictions, reserving half of all new licenses for social equity applicants, and steering tax revenue into communities harmed by the War on Drugs through its Social Equity Fund.
A similar approach would seek to center Black women as leaders, designers, and owners within Connecticut’s reimagined early childhood education system, which is not just restorative—it is imperative. The childcare industry in Connecticut stands on the brink of significant expansion, presenting what I believe is a generational transfer of opportunity.  Yet without intentional policies, legislation, or pathways to leadership and ownership for Black women, we risk replicating the injustice of the past—this time masked as progress.
Connecticut has an opportunity to develop an early childhood education system that reflects our highest values. A system that does more than serve children and families. One that repairs, restores, and reckons with its origins.  Restorative justice means that Black women, who built the early childhood education system through sacrifice and exclusion, are now recognized as its rightful leaders and stewards. For centuries, Black women have been entrusted with the care of America’s children. It is time to entrust them with the resources, respect, and power to lead this industry.
Restorative justice is not just a moral imperative—it is a policy necessity. Because a society that repairs what it has broken can truly nurture every child.  In Connecticut and across the nation, we must deign to build not only a better early childhood education system, but a reparative and just one.

Part One described the emergency effort to rescue Washington state’s last population of Snake River spring and summer Chinook salmon, in the Tucannon River.
The Nez Perce Tribe and its collaborators will try to eke out a few more years’ survival for Tucannon River Chinook.
“But,” Jay Hesse says, “we also had to ask: What about all the other populations? So in 2021, we started modeling quasi-extinction for all the Snake River spring/summer Chinook and steelhead populations listed under the Endangered Species Act. The results are giving us a better picture of real conditions, and a stronger case for the urgency of action.”

	Mr. Hesse is the director of Biological Services for the Nez Perce Department of Fisheries Resources Management.
Some years ago, federal scientists at National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries developed the “quasi-extinction threshold,” which the NOAA uses in planning.
For Snake River Chinook salmon and steelhead, the threshold is fewer than 50 adult fish in a population returning from the ocean for four consecutive years. Below that floor, the population’s continued existence can no longer be scientifically assumed or predicted. It is an emergency signal, flashing red and near black.
The Nez Perce Tribe is applying this science to management of populations below or near the extinction threshold, as well as to public education and long-term science.
Nez Perce Fisheries provided me two maps from its upcoming extinction threshold report for Snake River spring/summer Chinook, and steelhead, updated through 2024 fish returns. These maps show some of the findings, but much else in it will deserve attention.

  Hesse, J.A. and Kinzer, R.N., 2025. Snake River Anadromous Fish Status: Quasi-Extinction Threshold Analysis. Department of Fisheries Resources Management. Version: 09 June, 2025.


	The quasi-extinction threshold results are mapped in four colors:  populations at or below the 50-fish extinction threshold four consecutive years; those at or below the 50-fish threshold in the most recent year; those predicted, on current trend, to be at the 50-fish line within five years; and those predicted to be above that threshold five years from now.

  Hesse, J.A. and Kinzer, R.N., 2025. Snake River Anadromous Fish Status: Quasi-Extinction Threshold Analysis. Department of Fisheries Resources Management. Version: 09 June, 2025.


	Together, the first three categories, all in red-orange shades, are what I call the critical list: populations at dire, perhaps irreversible risk now, and those on their way to that same status within five years at current rates of decline.
Lump those red-orange shades together as you look at the maps. With a little imagination, you will see the near-term extinction trajectory for Snake River salmon and steelhead in geographic motion.
As updated through 2024 fish returns, the report shows six Snake River steelhead populations, 27% of the species’ total number, are on the critical list, below the extinction threshold or heading there soon. Ten Snake River spring/summer Chinook salmon populations, 29% of  that species’ total, are on the critical list. The maps show their locations.

Populations colored yellowish are all those predicted to be above the 50 fish threshold in 2029. These are in motion too. Current rates of decline, if continued, will put a next batch on the critical list soon. The data underlying the maps suggests which and where those will be.
It is not scientific news that Snake River salmon and steelhead are going extinct. These findings further confirm the fact, by newly estimating the current rate and trend of decline at population level.
What’s new, for me, is how extinction threshold analysis, as mapped and made public yearly, allows fish managers, all stripes of salmon people, interested reporters, and Northwest governors and members of Congress to observe Snake River salmon extinction in motion.
The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife also conducts an extinction threshold analysis for these same Snake River populations, with some differences in methodology and data.
“ODFW’s quasi-extinction approach is a little more conservative than the Nez Perce Tribe’s,” says Tucker Jones, the agency’s Columbia River program manager. “Our two results so far are slightly different, but both analyses have arrived at largely the same conclusions and same trend.  When you take different approaches, but come to nearly the same conclusions, that provides more certainty we’re on the right track.”
The department also plans to update its analysis this year.
The extinction threshold findings can be annually volatile, as one somewhat better bad return re-sets its stringent clock. Thus the main story is the trends, for individual populations and the aggregate species.
The 2024 Nez Perce Fisheries’ analysis estimates a 6% per-year decline is occurring across the Snake’s spring-summer Chinook populations, and 11% per-year decline across steelhead populations. The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife’s trend estimates will be known soon.

Snake River salmon and steelhead extinction is in motion
Two distinctions between this scientific work, and my use of it here, should be made.
First, extinction in motion is my phrase, not Hesse’s or his Nez Perce Fisheries’ co-author Ryan Kinzer’s.
They are conducting a careful, annually-updated estimate, employing both raw fish counts and modeling, of the rates at which extirpation of individual populations are currently proceeding (or not, should the data show that), and thus extinction of the species continues to approach (or not).
The focus on rates of decline toward extirpation and extinction is a main value this science has now, as salmon scarcity and Tucannon River-like dilemmas multiply. The same science will track the pace and places of salmon recovery, should the actions necessary to produce recovery be taken.
My phrase combines two facts.

	Snake River salmon and steelhead extinction is in motion because current numbers are very low, current distribution badly amputated, and decline is the steady year after year, decade after decade, trend, with a few blips up that were not sustained. And, the Nez Perce Tribe’s quasi-extinction threshold maps allow us to watch this motion, place by place, across years.
Second, except when quoting, I say extinction threshold, without the word quasi. This will not change the Nez Perce Tribe’s, Oregon’s or the NOAA Fisheries’ use of the full phrase in scientific, management and legal contexts where it is a defined, necessary term.
But for most of us that word just gets in the way. Good scientists have developed a last gasp check-point – 50 or fewer fish returning, four years in a row – to mark the entry, by a steelhead or salmon population, into an extinction momentum that will be very difficult to escape.
It is an extinction threshold. For the salmon, rivers, watersheds, communities and salmon people facing it, there is nothing quasi about it.
Salmon risks multiply when numbers plunge so low
Please look again at the maps.
Most of these geographies hold from 50 to 150 miles of identified habitat for one or both fish. Thus, at the official 50 fish extinction threshold, one female or male Chinook, out of 25, must find a partner, also out of 25, in 50 to 150 miles of water.
“That is just a terribly low number of salmon in so much river,” Jay Hesse says.
A landslide or flood scour could destroy a few salmon redds (nests) and their overwintering eggs, when a few are all that exist. Some eagles, bears and humans will find some returning fish before the fish find each other to spawn.
Such local events, of little harm to healthy populations, are major risks to those so near extinction. More destructive are recurring large-scale events – poor ocean conditions, low flows through reservoirs and dams, extended hot water during their long, obstructed upstream migration – that do outsized damage to populations already scraped so low.
The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, and NOAA Fisheries, both make the main scientific point.
The department: The 50 fish or less threshold “is not a milestone on a linear path to extinction.” It is “a tipping point into accelerated extinction risk,” with a “higher likelihood populations will no longer be able to respond favorably to improved conditions.”
The NOAA: “Quasi-Extinction Thresholds represent tipping points for population collapse, where the actual extinction potential may not be predictable or, in some cases, avoidable … The result can be an extinction vortex …”
An extinction vortex operates something like your sink’s drain operates on the last remaining water. It’s too late.
Returning salmon drive the ecology
Hesse always reminds his audiences of the contexts for this extinction analysis.
“Keep in mind that salmon ecology is based on abundance,” he says. “Numbers of returning salmon are not just about salmon. Salmon drive the whole ecology of that population’s geographic area. Fifty or fewer fish signals a total break in that watershed’s ecology, with effects that go well beyond the fish.”
Some breakage is visible to us; many fewer bears, eagles and people hunt the rivers and creeks in season. Much is still invisible to most of us, though nutrient loss is being documented. Salmon nutrition for the waters, lands and life of the territories on the maps above has been close to nothing for 60 years.
“And the harvest cycle, the cultural cycle, which is based on abundance, is also broken,” Hesse says. “That is important to all salmon people, but particularly to tribes that cultural connection is absolutely necessary.”
Hesse and Kinzer use another map to add more context: past extirpations.

  Hesse, J.A. and Kinzer, R.N., 2025. Snake River Anadromous Fish Status: Quasi-Extinction Threshold Analysis. Department of Fisheries Resources Management. Version: 09 June, 2025.


	The colored area is the maps just described. The gray area, north and especially south, is the vast geography, in Oregon, Idaho and Nevada, from which Chinook salmon have already been extirpated, mainly by dams.
Of an estimated 70 abundant populations of Snake River spring/summer Chinook prior to invasion and settlement, 30 are now extirpated. Of 40 steelhead populations pre-settlement, 16 are now extirpated.
The scales of what once was, and what now remains, are so disparate it is hard to put both on one graph or graphic.
In his presentations to public and agency audiences, Hesse experiments with visual ways to relate that not-so-long-ago abundance with today’s plunge to extinction. (Two to six million salmon and steelhead annually is one pre-Caucasian estimate for the Snake River alone.) His most effective way so far is a 16-ounce Starbucks’ Grande cup – the past salmon abundance when filled, today a couple disconnected damp spots on the  bottom of the cup.
“We cannot lose sight that salmon abundance is our goal,” Hesse says.   
Salmon, steelhead and people in northeast Oregon
Eastern Oregon’s tributary watersheds to the Snake River are too varied and distinctive for this stranger to ably summarize, ecologically or humanly.  The mountain, valley and canyon topography does intricate wonders with cold mountain waters that birth the Grande Ronde River, and then steadily refresh it on its long course to the Snake River. (The Grande Ronde has crossed into Washington when it reaches the Snake; 92% of the watershed is in Oregon.)

	Human works add to and subtract from each river. When my interviewees said the names – Wallowa, Lostine, Minam, Wenaha, Grande Ronde, Imnaha, Joseph Creek – I heard something of the depth the names carry for people who know these streams.
Some echoed Kevin March, a retired acupuncturist in La Grande: “One thing here is that many of these rivers and stretches are hard to get to. In canyon country, you can always leave people behind.”
Or John Milbert, a veteran fisherman, gatherer of foods, and writer: “I like to get high in the little tributaries. I enjoy fishing these tributaries because I get to know them intimately from walking and wading them. You get surprises.”
The extinction threshold data led me first to the upper Grande Ronde River, and its large tributary Catherine Creek. (The upper Grande Ronde is roughly the river’s watershed above the town of Elgin.)
In both, significant damage to river function has occurred in headwater areas, from past logging, roading and grazing, and, in both, the salmon nurseries in and passages through the big valleys are now mostly disconnected and ditched.
In the early 1990s, scientists identified eight populations of Snake River spring and summer Chinook in northeast Oregon. Two are deemed extirpated since then: the Lookingglass and Big Sheep populations, in the lower Grande Ronde and Imnaha respectively. Washington’s Asotin population, upstream of the Tucannon, is also extirpated.
“Though extirpated for now, the Tribe does not want any of these taken off the Endangered Species list,” Hesse says. “We don’t want them forgotten, and over time we want them back.”
The Upper Grande Ronde and Catherine Creek host two of northeast Oregon’s six remaining Chinook populations.
Retired lawyer David Baum remembers fishing for salmon long ago, far up the Grande Ronde, at Tony Vey Meadows. And as a boy in the 1950s, he made a spearing platform on a bridge across Catherine Creek at his grandmother’s home.
“A salmon would come up every few minutes in season,” he said. “I had no success, but I saw a lot of salmon going up Catherine Creek.”
No longer. I will offer some numbers, which need not be retained. Their scale and trend is what matters.
Upper Grande Ronde Chinook, returning to 144 miles of identified Chinook habitat, had an estimated return, 2016 through 2022, of 43, 19, 39, 7, 57, 24, 98 and 19 fish. (The Nez Perce update should include the 2024 estimate.) At 20 returning fish, a Chinook must find at least one of 10 possible mates in 144 miles of stream habitat to secure a next generation.
The Nez Perce Fisheries’ map projects that, at current rates of decline, this Chinook population will be at or below the extinction threshold, joining the critical list, by 2029.
In Catherine Creek’s 89 miles of Chinook habitat, the estimated range of adult returns, 2016-2023, is 31 to 190 fish. For now, the Catherine Creek population remains among those not projected at or below 50 fish within five years, but it is uncomfortably close.
The Upper Grande Ronde and Catherine Creek share one steelhead population, with 808 miles of identified habitat. Its return was last above 1,000 in 2016. The 2017-2023 range is 247 to 874. Northeast Oregon wild steelhead are generally in better shape than its Chinook, but are also in decline. Four digit returns become three digit become … is the trendline.

	None of the local fishers I spoke with were surprised.
“If not extinct in Upper Grande Ronde, Chinook must be perilously close,” says John Milbert. “The last carcass I saw was probably 15 years ago.”
Kevin March is a steelhead fisherman: “I don’t fish the upper Grande Ronde, because those are wild fish and the stocks are too low. And I don’t fish for salmon anywhere in eastern Oregon. There are too few.”
John Appleton and his wife Anieta own Alpine Archery and Sport, La Grande’s fishing shop.
“Wild salmon are very low in the upper Grande Ronde; steelhead are better but not good,” Appleton told me.
As for fishing, “in all of northeast Oregon, Chinook fishing any more is really minimal,” he continued. “There is some hatchery-based coho fishing in the fall.”
Fall steelhead fishing, on hatchery stocks, attracts people, though that fishery too can be uncertain.
Kyle Bratcher is district fish biologist for Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. His district includes the lower Grande Ronde from the Wallowa River down, and the Imnaha River.
“In my territory, the salmon in most trouble are Wallowa/Lostine spring Chinook, and Imnaha spring Chinook,” Bratcher said. “They’re not as bad as in the Tucannon, but it’s clear we need to do more for them.”
This Wallowa population was last estimated above 1,000 in 2014, its 2015-20 range is 189 to 750 (the Nez Perce and Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife reports should include more recent data), and it has 137 miles of habitat.
Bratcher and Hesse confirmed the department and Nez Perce Tribe have begun discussion of interim “safety net” actions for Wallowa/Lostine Chinook. Decisions will not be simple.
“Steelhead are depressed in my territory, far below recovery goals, but they are a bit more stable than salmon,” Bratcher added. “Steelhead can use more of our wilderness and inaccessible habitat.”
The fishing people I spoke with generally have more hope for steelhead in the Grande Ronde and Imnaha than for salmon.
“Steelhead range more, they can go up the small streams and creeks, to many more places,” Kevin March said. “I know a farmer who sees them in his little creek.”
Biologist Rick George, now retired from the Confederated Umatilla Tribes, lives in Troy, Oregon, on the lower Grande Ronde. “The Umatilla Tribes are doing some excellent habitat restoration in the Upper Grande Ronde – the McCoy Creek project, for example,” he said. “But I can’t see much hope for salmon in the Grande Ronde with eight dams on the lower Snake and Columbia. We’ve put billions into increasing salmon over several generations of salmon now. I don’t see even a blip of recovery. The systems are pretty empty of salmon, and, without that ocean nutrient freight train, the rivers are more sterile. We have large rivers that look beautiful, but without salmon that is deceiving.”
“I’ve been on the Imnaha for 30 years,” Joe McCormack told me.  “Watching the natural processes, what I see over those 30 years is less and less naturally spawning salmon and steelhead.”

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Election officials turned over at the highest rate in at least a quarter century during the last presidential election, according to new research from the Bipartisan Policy Center.
An analysis of shifts in election officials published Tuesday found nearly 41% of election officials administering the 2024 election were different than those in 2020. Turnover has accelerated over the past two decades, rising from about 28% in 2004 to 40.9% last year.
The growing percentage of departing election officials comes after years of challenges. They navigated the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, as well as harassment and false conspiracy theories surrounding stolen elections that persist today.
The analysis released by the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington, D.C.-based group that seeks to foster policy cooperation across party lines, represents an updated version of a report that previously examined turnover from 2004 to 2022. The new research, which extends the data through 2024, shows the turnover rate continued to climb.

The change means that, over time, election officials have less experience. The research found that the share of chief local election officials with six or more years in their role has dropped from 60% in 2006 to 47% in 2024.
But last year, 60% of election officials had previously overseen the administration of a presidential election in their jurisdiction.
“Despite increasing turnover and loss of experience, the majority of chief election officials still have experience running at least one presidential election cycle,” the analysis said. “This is important because presidential elections typically see the highest turnout and are the most visible elections administered.”
The analysis found that over the long term, election official turnover rates have been rising gradually in small jurisdictions, defined as areas with fewer than 100,000 voting-age residents. But large jurisdictions have experienced a more sudden jump in turnover.
Small jurisdictions had a 27% turnover rate in 2004 that had risen to 40% in 2024. But large jurisdictions enjoyed a turnover rate as low as 31% in 2018 before climbing rapidly to nearly 46% last year.

Jim Pillen meets with troops at the southern border in Texas. (Courtesy of the Governor's Office)LINCOLN — The media spectacle of Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen unveiling plans for a new Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility in the southwestern part of the state follows a political playbook from the Trump administration.
President Donald Trump’s Department of Homeland Security touted the new facility, saying it would help ICE agents “remove the worst of the worst” — despite the governor and state agency heads explaining it would house only low-level and medium-risk immigration-related detainees.
Speaking inside McCook’s Ben Nelson Regional Airport as protesters gathered outside, Pillen said he was “proud to be a part of Trump’s Team” in an effort to “make sure we keep our community safe. He pointed to a previous arrest of an MS-13 “kingpin” in Omaha as a justification for the ICE partnership.

“This stuff hits close to home and hits every corner of this state and country,” Pillen repeated in a Wednesday evening post on X. “Government’s most important job is to keep us safe.”
Dona-Gene Barton, a political science professor who studies political behavior at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, said it was no surprise Nebraska would want to join Trump’s expansion of ICE detention efforts as the agency tries to meet its goal of increasing deportations.
“This is a Republican governor showing support for a Republican president’s agenda,” Barton said.
Trump, throughout his 2024 presidential campaign, promised voters what he called “the single largest Mass Deportation Program in History,” after the Biden administration saw illegal border crossings spike at the end of 2023 but start decreasing last year.  
ICE is poised to become the highest-funded federal law enforcement agency because of the recently passed “One Big Beautiful Bill” that pays for much of Trump’s domestic agenda. Roughly $45 billion in the law was set aside to build, rent and staff new centers to detain immigrants, like the one Nebraska plans to operate for ICE at the state prison system’s McCook Work Ethic Camp. 
Other funding would be allocated toward hiring 10,000 ICE officers within five years, providing retention bonuses, covering the transportation of immigrants, upgrading ICE facilities, detaining families and hiring ICE immigration lawyers for enforcement and removal proceedings in immigration court.
Using Nebraska’s McCook facility, a medium-security prison, is part of a detention expansion strategy aimed at reviving dormant prisons, repurposing military bases and securing partnerships with private prison contractors, local sheriffs and GOP governors to house a record number of detainees, The Washington Post reported. 
The nationwide ICE expansions come as recent polling suggests a majority of Americans now disapprove of Trump’s handling of immigration, though most Republicans still support it. Recent polling indicates a shift in people’s attitudes from last year, when more Americans supported less immigration and stricter immigration enforcement. 
The state also experienced an ICE raid on Glenn Valley Foods in Omaha earlier this year, which sparked protests in the state’s largest city and in Lincoln.

Several local Democrats, advocacy groups, and everyday Nebraskans have raised concerns about the federally dubbed “Cornhusker Clink,” calling it a “​​harmful, dangerous and rapid expansion.”
The Nebraska Democratic Party said the facility is “yet another ‘bend the knee’ moment by top Republicans in Nebraska.” It said Republicans promised to “go after criminals” but “instead locked up hardworking” people who contribute to the state’s agricultural economy.
State Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln, a Democrat in the officially nonpartisan Legislature, told the Examiner he had questions about whether the facility would require the state to provide funding and whether an ICE detention center is needed in the state.
“For [Pillen] to be showing off to the federal administration in this way just seems out of touch with everyday Nebraskans,” Dungan said. “All of it is because we have an administration that’s failed to actually deal with any kind of real immigration reform.” 
Most Republican state senators reached by the Examiner have said they are on board with the new effort in Nebraska. State Sen. Loren Lippincott of Central City, a conservative who has carried bills Trump sought, including efforts to change how Nebraska counts its Electoral College votes for president, said he fully supports the McCook facility “as Nebraskans in service to a safer America.” 
State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston, often a conservative swing vote in the Legislature, told the Examiner, “If Nebraska has the capacity to help out, I don’t think that we should resist … as long as it’s a good and fair and legal process.”
The Nebraska Republican Party said the announcement “demonstrates the seriousness of the crisis and the need for leadership that prioritizes Nebraska families.”
Pillen’s office said any “backlash to this initiative is politically motivated.”

“It’s simple. Those who are opposed to Nebraska doing its fair share in securing our nation’s border want to relive the failed Biden-era open-border policies,” said Laura Strimple, a Pillen spokeswoman. “Nebraskans spoke loud and clear last November and demanded order at the border.” 
Barton, the UNL professor, said the tough talk on immigration from Pillen is a similar political playbook to ones used by Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis when it came to “Alligator Alcatraz,” the Florida-run immigration detention facility in the Everglades. 
“The issue is this rhetoric doesn’t match reality,” Barton said. “This rhetoric doesn’t even match what Governor Pillen has said about the facility being used to house low to medium security risks.”
Nebraska officials said the facility will be the Midwestern hub for ICE detentions. Pillen, during his Tuesday press conference at McCook, said the center could hold migrants from nearby states. Neighboring Colorado, led by Democratic Gov. Jared Polis, has recently pushed back against helping ICE with immigration enforcement.
The Work Ethic Camp in McCook would be converted to house up to 300 migrants. The state prison was designed to house up to 200 people. Florida’s “Alligator Alcatraz” was designed to house 3,000 and could accommodate up to 5,000. Indiana’s new ICE facility, which the feds nicknamed the “Speedway Slammer,” is expected to hold up to 1,000. 
As for the Nebraska facility’s name, it appears to be part of a broader PR strategy by the White House to use visuals that aim to persuade migrants without legal status to leave the country, while also signaling that the administration will not tolerate resistance.
Homeland Security, for instance, posted an AI-generated photo of a cornfield with ICE hats with a caption of “Coming Soon: The Cornhusker Clink” next to a corn emoji.
The names of the immigration detention facilities and online memes surrounding them are aimed at gaining media attention and riling up a part of the GOP base that supports Trump’s approach to immigration enforcement, Barton said. 
Barton said the Nebraska facility’s small capacity shows it is “largely symbolic,” meant to demonstrate support for Trump’s approach. 
“It’s not only a way to show support for Donald Trump’s agenda, but show the electorate that these detention centers are going to be throughout the United States,” she said.

Mikie Sherrill (D) saying Wednesday she would freeze utility rates if elected and Jack Ciattarelli (R) accusing Sherrill of backing ""failed energy policies."" (Photos by Reena Rose Sibayan/Amanda Brown)The rising cost of electricity became a central focus of the governor’s race on Wednesday when Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D) pledged to freeze utility rates if she’s elected and Jack Ciattarelli (R) argued Sherrill’s party is to blame for the spike in rates customers saw starting in June.
Sherrill, speaking outside a private residence in Kenilworth, said she would declare a state of emergency over utility rates on “day one” if she becomes New Jersey’s next governor. She said rising electric bills are “breaking the back of too many families when we have an overall affordability crisis.”
“So much of that pain is coming from electric bills, and the rate hikes are forcing families to make impossible choices between putting food on the table and paying for electric bills,” she said.
Sherrill said the average New Jersey family would not see an increase in utility rates for one year under her plan.
She also pledged to “massively increase” in-state power generation to bring down the cost of energy, including by supporting new solar and battery storage projects, expediting upgrades at existing nuclear plants, modernizing natural gas plants, and more.
It’s not clear whether Sherrill, if she’s elected governor, would have the power to freeze utility rates. She said it would be an action no other governor has taken.
Sherrill and Ciattarelli are competing in November to succeed Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat wrapping up two terms in office.
A spokesman for Ciattarelli, who has hammered New Jersey Democrats as responsible for soaring utility rates, did not comment directly on Sherrill’s pledge to freeze rates. But in a statement, Ciattarelli said Sherrill has been a “lockstep supporter of Phil Murphy’s failed energy policies.” 
“When I’m Governor, things are going to change. I’ll ban offshore wind and diversify our energy sources in New Jersey to once again include natural gas and nuclear,” he said. “I’ll rewrite our master plan and deliver safe, clean, and sustainable energy to everyone in our state at a price you can afford.”
New Jersey Democrats, anxious over New Jersey’s November election, when the governor’s race and all 80 Assembly seats will be on the ballot, have tried to pin the blame for rising electric bills on PJM Interconnection, the grid operator for New Jersey and 12 other states. They say PJM has been too slow to add renewable energy projects to its grid. Republicans say the fault lies with Murphy’s focus on renewable energy, including offshore wind projects that have failed to materialize.

June 14, 2025. | Photo by Erick Diaz VelizBlocking public roadways and highways in an act of mass protest could saddle groups expressing their First Amendment rights with misdemeanor charges, heavy fines and possible jail time under a Republican bill discussed Wednesday by a Michigan House panel.
House Bill 4664, sponsored by state Rep. Alicia St. Germaine (R-Harrison Township), was before the House Judiciary Committee, which adopted a substitute altering the bill but took no further action after hearing testimony.
St. Germaine said her bill was aimed at ensuring public safety and preventing obstructions to traffic when groups hold political actions in areas designated for motor vehicles.
The bill would change the current civil infraction for blocking the flow of traffic to a misdemeanor punishable by up to 93 days in jail and up to a $5,000 fine, or both.
“It’s a problem, and we all have the right to free speech and to assemble to express our opinions,” St. Germaine said. “Where that ends is when you block people or hold them hostage, because that’s exactly what’s going on in some of these scenarios.”

The bill sponsor showed the committee short, edited and glossed up TikTok videos of protests where it was insinuated that demonstrators had caused some kind of dangerous obstruction.
But state Rep. Kara Hope (D-Holt) noted that it appeared that some of the videos showed instances where the drivers were in the wrong because they drove their vehicles into protesters, thereby assaulting them in the process.
The conversation broke into a short debate over who was at fault in situations where drivers become aggressive against protesters, with St. Germaine saying it was unfair to not hold a protester accountable for blocking a roadway. She was also adamant that blocking someone in their car for a long period while protesters made their political points amounted to hostage taking and false imprisonment.
State Rep. Kelly Breen (D-Novi) was quick to note that the bill covers only fault for the protesters, some of whom might become injured through the aggressive actions of a driver if they ram protesters with their vehicle. Breen said that protesters could, under the bill, become seriously injured by someone who was frustrated with the protest and then also face jail time for expressing their right to free assembly.

Macomb County Prosecutor Peter Lucido and Oakland County Sheriff Mike Bouchard testified in favor of the bill.
Bouchard said the current civil infraction doesn’t provide for a meaningful deterrent against the unlawful blocking of a roadway, especially in the instance of a group making a political statement.
“We’ve seen individuals and groups shut down highways with little or no consequences, and it creates a significant risk to public safety,” Bouchard said. “Blocking a roadway is not merely an inconvenience. It has life and death ramifications for first responders that rely on open roads to reach people in need, and even a delay of minutes, which I’ve seen tragically as a former fatal accident investigator, means the difference between life and death and losing someone.”
There was some debate about whether the bill expressly prohibited protests or just groups of people. St. Germaine noted instances of parties forming on highways as a gimmick.
The substitute adopted by the committee on Wednesday changes the initial language from a group of 10 or more people to an assembly of individuals.
Bouchard said, however, that an assembly is not a clearly defined term, pulling from his time in the Legislature.

Kyle Zawacki, legislative director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan, said his organization was opposed to the bill. He said the ACLU was deeply concerned about what the bill would mean for the free exercise of speech and the right to peacefully assemble.
“Demonstrations on public streets have long been utilized for political speech, marches, rallies. Protests all require a physical space to occupy in order to exist,” Zawacki said. “Michigan’s highways do not exist in a vacuum, and vehicular blockades are not a new form of protest, nor are the government’s frequent attempts to suppress these public demonstrations and silence dissent through police force and legal intimidation.”
Zawacki added that it was apparent that drivers hate to be inconvenienced when protests block streets.
“However, driving is not a right, it is a privilege,” Zawacki said. “Protesting, on the other hand, is a fundamental constitutional right.”
That comment started a debate between Zawacki and state Rep. Jay DeBoyer (R-Clay), who said that he and others have a fundamental right to move freely unimpeded through the state and across state lines.
“That has been affirmed over and over and over again by courts and the Supreme Court,” DeBoyer said. “I know that we’re not talking about lawful protest, we’re talking about unlawful protest. … There is a significant difference.”
Zawacki said he wanted to be clear that the ACLU’s position was that it was against the increase of penalties from a civil infraction to a misdemeanor. As to whether a roadway is a proper or protected venue for a protest, Zawacki noted Hague v. The Committee for Industrial Organization, a U.S. Supreme Court case from 1939, which spelled out that such a right does exist.
DeBoyer, undeterred, cited Saenz v. Roe, a 1999 U.S. Supreme Court case. Although the Saenz ruling did reaffirm the right to free travel, the holding had other key components limited to the case, which had to do with residency requirements for welfare benefits in California. The ruling mostly held that “the right to travel prevents states from imposing durational residency requirements that withhold the privileges and immunities of a state’s citizens from people who have newly arrived in that state,” according to the legal information website Justia. 
The case didn’t deal with the free travel rights of individuals throughout the U.S. unimpeded by roadway protesters, either.

“We’re not complying with the court orders,” said Commissioner Bridget Thorne, a Republican who represents north Fulton. “We’ve had two hearings, one on Friday, one on Monday, forcing us to comply. And the decision today was to not comply.”
The vote came down 2-2 with three members of the commission not present.
Georgia Republican Party Chairman Josh McKoon called the development “outrageous” and called fort he commissioners to be punished.
“A Petition for Contempt of Judge (David) Emerson’s Order should be filed immediately and I hope the Judge will consider not only a fine but jail time for the unlawful defiance of a lawful court order!” McKoon said in a statement.
Commissioner Dana Barrett, a Democrat whose district includes all of the Atlanta neighborhoods of Buckhead and parts of Midtown and the suburb of Sandy Springs, said she doesn’t know what could come next.
“It’s really hard to say. I don’t know what’s in the judge’s mind about that,” she said. “He can choose jail or fines, I think, and that’s really going to be up to him. I think the jail thing is a little bit confusing because when it is a civil charge like this, the whole idea is that you’d be in jail until you solved the problem – which, we can’t vote from jail — so I’m not sure if it really works in this case, but I think he has the ability to do it. So making the vote, for me, I had to be prepared to face those consequences.”
The politics and policy behind the case
The Fulton County Registration and Elections Board consists of two members appointed by each major political party and a chair selected by the Board of Commissioners. Fulton County, which is home to Atlanta, is Georgia’s most populous county with more than 1 million residents, and among the likeliest to support Democratic candidates, though the northern suburbs are more conservative.
In May, the Fulton County Republican Party nominated incumbent board member Julie

Adams and newcomer Jason Frazier, but the commissioners declined, citing concerns about their past actions.
Adams refused to certify the 2024 results in Fulton’s presidential preference primary and filed a failed lawsuit against the county, arguing that board members have the option to refuse to certify election results if they have concerns. In a ruling similar to the one now at issue with the commission, judges said election superintendents’ roles are actually to certify the results and not to investigate or veto them.
Democrats say Frazier challenged thousands of Fulton County voter registrations.
Speaking at the May meeting, Commissioner Marvin Arrington, a Democrat whose district includes parts of Atlanta and south Fulton, said he could not approve the two because of their politics.
“The problem we have in this country is the far right and the far left,” he said. “The answers and the solutions are in the middle. And I want to applaud the Democratic Party for nominating people that are in the center and not nominating people that are in the far left. And I think the Republican Party ought to take a look at their people and not nominate people that are on the far right and nominate people that are in the center. That’s where all of our answers and our solutions are. There is no way I can vote to support either of these people.But if y’all present some people that are in the center, they can get approved.”
Arrington was not present for Wednesday’s vote.
Obligations of the word ‘shall’ 
The county GOP took the commissioners to court, where the legal debate centered around the meaning of the word “shall” in state law.
The law says the members of the board “shall” appoint two members appointed by each major party, while the chair is appointed by the board of commissioners.
The county GOP said that shall means the board’s job is to approve the people nominated by the parties as long as they meet basic required standards like living in the county, being an elector and not being an elected official.
Democrats on the board said the word “shall” leaves more wiggle room – that the power to appoint also includes the power to reject.
“I am very willing to appoint from nominees that are put forth by the Republican Party of Fulton County,” Barrett said. “But not everybody gets a pass. What if they put up a murderer? I’m not going to appoint a murderer. So there has to be some discretion on my part to say no to particular nominees, but still only to choose from their nominees.”
Superior Court Judge David Emerson agreed with the Republican Party, issuing an Aug. 3 order calling on the commissioners to approve Adams and Frazier.
“There is nothing in the statute to support the BOC theory that the county commissioners can veto the chairperson’s nominees other than for failure of the nominee to meet the two qualifications and one restriction,” Emerson wrote.
“The General Assembly placed the discretion in the county executive committee chairperson. It is up to the Fulton County Commission to follow the law and honor that person’s nominations,” he added.
They didn’t do that Wednesday, and Commissioner Mo Ivory, a Democrat who represents Atlanta and parts south, indicated that she’s not likely to change her stance.
“No one should force an elected official or any voter to cast a particular vote. We’re opening up a very scary door to do that, no matter where your politics lies. Our residents deserve appointees who are unquestionably committed to fairness, transparency, and ethical standards in our election administration. This is not about personalities or politics, although that’s what grabs the headlines. It is about ensuring that the board of registrations and elections in Fulton County is held to the highest level of accountability and that our elections are fair.
The Board of Commissioners has filed an appeal in the lawsuit.
What about next week’s election?
A special election to replace former state Sen. Brandon Beach, a Republican who stepped down to serve as U.S. Treasurer under President Donald Trump, is scheduled for Tuesday. The district includes part of north Fulton County and much of neighboring Cherokee County.
Thorne said that race can be certified even if the situation is still unsettled next week.
“Julie Adams continues to serve on the board until they appoint someone else, and so (Republicans) will just only have one member on that board to certify the elections, look over the results, follow that,” she said. “They’ve just got to get a majority of the board. So it’s supposed to be a five-member board, so if they get three votes, they’ll go ahead and certify the election.”
Thorne said Adams will be forced to vote yes on the winner even if she has reservations because of a rule similar to the one she wants the Democrats on the commission to follow.
“Under her lawsuit, they told her she ‘shall’ — just like here, she ‘shall’ certify — on Monday at 5 o’clock, and she can’t vote no,” Thorne said. “So they should have four votes to certify, no matter what.”

(Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)Administrators representing the three colleges located at Denver’s Auraria Campus during a hearing Wednesday defended the institutional responses to an anti-war encampment that occurred last year.
The 10-member Colorado Advisory Committee to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights oversees an investigation into alleged antisemitism at the Auraria Campus, site of the University of Colorado Denver, Community College of Denver and Metropolitan State University of Denver.
In April 2024, anti-war demonstrators set up an encampment on the Auraria Campus quad, in protest of university policies relating to Israel and the war in Gaza. They called for the university to condemn “the genocidal actions of Israel” and divest from companies that manufacture weapons or operate in Israel.
Police in riot gear arrested at least 40 demonstrators a day after the encampment was set up. Anti-war protests continued on the Auraria Campus throughout the spring 2024 semester. Skip Spear, the chief administrative officer and general counsel for the Auraria Higher Education Center, said during the committee’s virtual hearing that 81 people were arrested in relation to the anti-war demonstrations, 33 of whom were affiliated with the colleges.

“(The Auraria Higher Education Center) did everything in its power to keep our campus safe through our limited police department, but we did not have the resources to respond to a disturbance this large, without assistance,” Spear said. 
In response to last year’s anti-war encampments on college campuses across the country, the Trump administration has targeted universities like Harvard, Columbia and UCLA for antisemitism probes and research funding freezes.
The committee’s goal with the investigation is to “contribute to more informed approaches to federal, state, and education policy in higher education and develop recommendations” directed to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights and other federal entities.
David Fine, the general counsel for MSU Denver, said that few of the April 2024 demonstrators were MSU Denver students.
“MSU Denver is very different from a school like Columbia, for example, where parents can afford to spend roughly $100,000 a year to have their students sit in encampments for weeks,” Fine said. “Our students are working their way through school, and they’re here to get a degree and get a job.”
After college administrators spoke during the Wednesday hearing, the committee hosted a community forum, which was also virtual. Several professors, alumni and students spoke.










The encampment was mostly coordinated by undergraduate students, who were protected by nothing but tents and their trust in each other, staring down armed police in riot gear on their own campus, without escalating.

Chloe East, an economics professor at the University of Colorado Boulder who previously taught at the Auraria campus, said during the forum that she went to the encampment several times and spoke to student demonstrators. East said the encampment was an “inclusive and welcoming space.”
“We are seeing attacks on free speech at the federal level, with the Trump administration targeting students and others around the country whose views he does not agree with,” East said. “I urge the committee not to bring these kinds of attacks on free speech to our state and to our schools.”
Jessica Ellis, a student at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, said she attended the April encampment, where she saw an “atmosphere that was peaceful, positive and prioritized growth and learning.” 
“In my entire life, this encampment was the largest, most intentional and authentic display of interfaith and multiethnic cooperation and respect,” Ellis said. “The encampment was mostly coordinated by undergraduate students, who were protected by nothing but tents and their trust in each other, staring down armed police in riot gear on their own campus, without escalating.”
Ellis added, “I emphatically disagree with the allegations of widespread antisemitism during this encampment.”
Brandon Rattiner, the senior director of the Jewish Community Relations Council of Colorado, said in a July interview with Colorado Newsline that he hopes the work of the committee can spotlight “the experiences that made life on campus really difficult for Jewish students, and also create pressure for universities to do better.”
He added, however, that there “are many people in our community who are uncomfortable with the way combating antisemitism has been used to attack higher education in the abstract in this country.”
“We want to make sure that this process stays focused on our real concerns, and doesn’t turn Jewish pain into a political football that is being used to advance political agendas,” Rattiner said.
Since Israel’s intense bombardment and ground invasion of Gaza began after Oct. 7, 2023, when a Hamas-led attack killed more than 1,200 people in Israel, at least 60,000 Palestinians are reported to have been killed, while many more have been injured and face widespread hunger.
The committee’s next public hearing is scheduled for Sept. 3, when Auraria Campus student organizations and other impacted people are set to testify.

“We’ve had a healthy working relationship with the federal government over these past 11 months since Hurricane Helene swept through western North Carolina,” Stein said. “In terms of the extent of federal support, it has not met the moment.”

According to Stein, federal agencies including the Federal Emergency Management Administration, U.S. Department of Transportation, and others have provided less than $5 billion in relief toward the roughly $60 billion in damages the state suffered from the disaster.
He expressed dismay that the Trump administration’s response to Helene has been to float ending FEMA altogether.
“The scale of these storms are massive — $60 billion in western North Carolina from Hurricane Helene,” Stein said. “Those kinds of resources don’t exist in western North Carolina to respond. Heck, our state two-year budget is $66 billion, so essentially we would have to forgo the entire two-year budget just to get western North Carolina back to where it was before.”
The state legislature has appropriated more than $1 billion in funding to support Helene recovery since January, though that represents less than 2% of the storm’s toll on the region. In February, Stein traveled to Washington to request $19 billion in relief — meeting with North Carolina senators Thom Tillis and Ted Budd — though in the months since, Congress has not passed further Helene aid.
“We’re going to continue to make our case to our congressional delegation and to the administration to urge them to support western North Carolina to the degree that is necessary,” Stein said. “We need a lot of help for western North Carolina, and we hope that that funding will come.”
Earlier this month, Stein wrote to the Trump administration seeking a major disaster declaration due to the impacts of Tropical Depression Chantal.  That storm left more than 100 roads impassable due to flooding, washouts, sinkholes, and structural damage. Orange County residents forced from their homes by Chantal’s torrential rains pleaded for additional relief on Wednesday.  Many worry they could be homeless when disaster assistance from the county and private citizens runs out at the end of the month.
As for the prospect of federal help in response to Hurricane Erin — projected to bring severe winds and flooding to the North Carolina coast and especially the Outer Banks through Thursday — Stein said it “remains to be seen.”
“We haven’t needed to call upon those resources to respond to the immediate aftermath of the storm,” Stein said. “We just have to wait and see what the extent of the damage is and whether it has any impacts on our ongoing ability to get the support we need from the federal government.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages2025-Helene-MarioTama-1024x698.jpg,,,2025-08-20 20:57:28.022083

Chris Wilson, R-Logan, listens during a press conference with Senate leadership at the Capitol in Salt Lake City on the first day of the legislative session, Tuesday, Jan. 21, 2025. (Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Earlier this year, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox vetoed a bill that would have given him and the state Senate power over choosing the next Utah Supreme Court chief justice — but now, Utah lawmakers are moving to bring it back in a potential special session in September. 
This time, however, the bill’s sponsor, Senate Majority Whip Chris Wilson, R-Logan, has included a key change: the next chief justice would have a single, eight-year term, rather than being subject to reappointment every four years. 
Currently, the Utah Supreme Court’s five justices elect their own chief justice. But earlier this year, the Utah Legislature passed SB296, one of several bills that sought to exert more legislative influence over the judiciary. It would have required the Utah Supreme Court chief justice to be subject to reappointment from the governor — and Senate confirmation — every four years.
Cox, when he issued his veto, specifically took issue with the four-year term provision included in SB296, calling it “problematic” to require reappointment so often. But Wednesday, while presenting his draft legislation to the Judiciary Interim Committee, Wilson said a deal has been struck. 
Cox vetoes bill that would have given governor power over appointing Utah chief justice

“This … is a compromise bill that we’ve been negotiating with the governor,” Wilson said. 
If lawmakers pass his bill as currently written, after Utah’s current Chief Justice Matthew Durrant vacates his seat or his term ends in April 2028, the governor will appoint a new chief justice, subject to confirmation from the Utah Senate. The bill would also limit a justice from serving as  chief justice for more than one, eight-year term. 
Wilson also said the bill would align Utah with 13 other states that allow the governor to appoint their chief justices. Currently, Utah is among 22 states that let justices elect their chief justice. 
Wilson said with these changes, “the governor is completely on board with this legislation.” 
“We’ve been negotiating with him for a number of months,” Wilson said. “So yes, he is on board with this bill.” 
Cox’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday seeking to verify Wilson’s comments. The judiciary also hasn’t taken a public position on the new bill. A spokesperson for the Utah Supreme Court said the judiciary didn’t have a comment on it. 
The Judiciary Interim Committee later voted to favorably recommend Wilson’s draft legislation for consideration during the potential special session next month. The motion passed on a vote of 7-4 from House committee members and 4-1 from Senate committee members, with Democrats voting against. 
No veto override session this year, Utah legislative leaders say

The apparent compromise came after Republican legislative leaders announced this spring that they would not be calling a veto override session this year after Cox stopped SB296, along with five other bills, from becoming law. Instead, they said they would “focus on constructive dialogue and thoughtful policymaking during the interim to find the best path forward that benefits all Utahns.” 
Cox had previously said he expected to call a special session in May to deal with several bills he signed with the expectation that they would be tweaked to address various issues, but the month came and went without a call as discussions took longer than expected. Now, he’s expected to issue the call for sometime in September. 
Cox hasn’t yet issued an official agenda, but lawmakers this week discussed several drafts of legislation they expect to be considered, including the new version of SB296. 
Why do Utah lawmakers want to change how the chief justice is selected?
Wilson has argued that requiring the chief justice to be appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Senate would allow for more public input in the selection of the chief justice, who leads the state’s Judicial Council, the policy-making body for the judiciary. 
But the bill also came during a time of unusual tension between lawmakers and the Utah Supreme Court, which has issued several rulings that have upset Republican legislative leaders. 
Wilson’s SB296 was one of several bills that surfaced during the 2025 Utah Legislature that sought to exert more control over the judiciary. The tension between the GOP-controlled Legislature and the judiciary reached a fever pitch during the 2025 session, when legal professionals and even some Utah Supreme Court justices criticized lawmakers’ bills as an attack on the judicial branch’s independence. 
But that clash largely fizzled when Utah’s Republican legislative leaders announced they had struck a deal with the judiciary to drop the most controversial proposals, including a bill that would have given legislators a say in judicial retention elections. In exchange, other bills including SB296 would advance, with the Judicial Council taking a neutral position. 
After weeks of division, Utah legislative leaders announce deal with judiciary

Despite that compromise, however, Cox vetoed SB296 anyway. He wrote in a letter to legislative leaders that while the new power was “tempting,” he took issue with requiring the chief justice to be reappointed every four years. 
“Supporters of the bill correctly point out that the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court is appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. If that were all the bill did, it is something I could support,” Cox wrote. “However, this bill takes a very meaningful and problematic additional step: requiring the appointment process to occur every four years.”
Cox also wrote that it’s “not lost on me that this bill actually gives me — the governor — more power than I currently possess.”
“I admit it is very tempting to sign this bill and assure that the Chief Justice would need to stay in my good graces to retain his or her position,” Cox continued. “Knowing the head magistrate of our state’s highest court would have to think twice before ruling against me or checking my power is difficult to reject.” 
However, Cox concluded, “just because I can doesn’t mean I should.” 
After Cox’s veto, House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, and Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, issued a joint statement saying Cox’s decision “undermines that good-faith compromise” between the Legislature and judiciary that ultimately led to lawmakers abandoning the other bills, and the Judicial Council and Utah State Bar taking a neutral position.”

They also said the Legislature “remains firm in its commitment to improve transparency, efficiency, and integrity within all branches of government to ensure we’re responsive to and representative of the people in our state.” 
Arguments 
During the bill’s public comment period on Wednesday, a Utahn, Steven Rosenberg, opposed the change, questioning its need. 
“If something isn’t broken, then why are we changing it? If it’s worked through the history of this great state of Utah, why must we change it now?” Rosenberg said. “Leave it alone. Let it be. Let the justices choose their own leader and let the branches be separate as they were intended.” 
Sen. Todd Weiler, R-Wood Cross, pushed back, arguing the Utah Constitution allows the Legislature to decide the process for how the chief justice is selected. 
The Sutherland Institute, a conservative think tank, also circulated a statement to the Judiciary Interim Committee expressing support for the bill, saying it was “grateful the Legislature is considering measures to strengthen the institutions of free government through creating reasonable checks and balances.”
“This will help ensure that the judiciary can focus on its constitutional mandate to faithfully apply existing law,” the Sutherland Institute’s statement continued. “Ultimately, what is needed is for each branch of government to fulfill its constitutional functions fully and independently. For the judiciary, that requires judges to be committed to the constitutional principle that the text of the constitution and of the laws enacted pursuant to its authority governs their decisions rather than considerations of policy.”
During the bill’s debate, Weiler made a point of noting that the chief justice doesn’t have the power to tell the Utah Supreme Court’s other four judges how to rule on decisions or decide what cases get heard. 
Utah Supreme Court disputes lawmakers’ allegations that it’s not productive enough

Rather, the chief justices’ duties primarily entail acting as the chief administrative officer for the judiciary, responsible for administering the day-to-day operations of the court. The chief justice also acts as presiding officer of the Utah Judicial Council, which is the governing body of the courts’ administrative rules. 
Sen. Brady Brammer, R-Alpine, argued that many other top positions within other state agencies and branches of government are chosen through appointment and confirmation processes. 
He also said “underlying this” bill are “some administrative concerns as far as decision work load within the court.” 
“Some of this is to say, ‘Hey, there may be at times something that isn’t quite functioning on the broader scale in terms of the number of decisions,’ which have decreased quite a bit over the last few years,” Brammer said, alluding to a complaint he made earlier this year that the Utah Supreme Court was being “productive” enough. 
In a rare statement issued in February, the Utah Supreme Court disputed those allegations. 
“I think they’re working to fix that,” Brammer added, “but that is one of the things that was an impetus for making this change, so there’s a little more input, a little more push, on the commitments that are made with regards to the nuts and bolts functioning of the court, which the chief justice has a lot to do with.”

Powell County will pay a $500 fine for violating the Stream Protection Act after an amphibious vehicle on contract with the county rolled through a portion of the Blackfoot River.
Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks notified Powell County it was in violation in an August 11 letter, and Commissioner Dan Sager said Wednesday the county agreed to pay the fine.
“We really had no grounds to fight it. Our subcontractor was definitely in violation, and it comes back to us,” Sager said.
An earlier news release from the county said the contractor should have consulted with the county’s weed coordinator or acquired a permit prior to the weed control work.
Sager said the weed board agreed the fine should be paid, commissioners approved the payment Wednesday, and the private company will reimburse the county for the fine.
The contract was not available from Powell County on Wednesday afternoon.
In a statement, Commissioner Bill Hooker earlier apologized to the Powell County community and all who enjoy the Blackfoot River.
“Powell County takes pride in its stewardship of one of the state’s most popular and cherished recreational streams,” Hooker said. “We will continue to strive to make sure we protect the natural wonders we are so fortunate to enjoy.”
FWP spokesperson Greg Lemon said $500 is the maximum penalty allowed by law.
However, a conservation advocate who is among a group that reported the incident to FWP and a federal official said the amount might not be enough to deter other bad actors.
Keith Hammer, chairman of the Swan View Coalition, said he’s heard the way some operators dismiss penalties, such as snowmobilers who motor into closed areas.
“We call that bragging rights,” Hammer said of the way some perpetrators react to fines.
He said $500 is minuscule compared to the cost of the vehicle itself, potentially tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars. Hammer also said he believes the penalty should “sting” and possibly be equal to a portion of the contract.
“If it doesn’t take a big chunk out of their profit on that contract, it’s essentially meaningless,” Hammer said.
Hammer was among 20 conservationists including organization leaders who signed an August 11 letter to FWP and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service expressing “our utmost disgust” at the incident.
The letter said the vehicle ran at least 9.5 miles down the river including through bull trout pools — and, Hammer said, possibly churning through springs in the river where bull trout try to stay cool.
The letter said the event took place at a time the native and threatened species are under increased pressure from heat, drought and low water levels.
“Crashing through pools caused great damage,” the letter said.
Just this week, FWP itself warned anglers against causing stress on federally protected bull trout. A news release and corresponding materials said the species need cold and clear water to survive and are “highly vulnerable” to silt.
FWP spokesperson Lemon said the agency called the perpetrator out of the river the same day it received a report of the incident, and they complied.
He said FWP put staff on the river one day later and found only minimal impacts.
“We saw tracks in the gravel, which we expected to see, but there didn’t seem to be much impact, and we didn’t see any dead fish,” Lemon said.
Hammer said he doesn’t believe fish need to immediately die to be harmed, and he said he hopes the federal Fish and Wildlife Service conducts an investigation too.
A spokesperson for the Fish and Wildlife Service could not be reached Wednesday.
Commissioner Sager said he is not aware of any federal investigation, but he said the county views the fine from the state as reasonable.
“It could have been a lot worse — and shouldn’t have ever happened in the first place,” Sager said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1380958948-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-20 19:57:33.227057

AmeriCorps members were cut from the program at Bur Oak in April 2025, as were AmeriCorps participants across the country. (Photo courtesy of Bur Oak Land Trust) Bur Oak Land Trust, an Iowa nonprofit organization, joined more than a dozen groups from across the country in a lawsuit against the Trump administration for continuing to withhold funding for AmeriCorps programs. 
Bur Oak, and 13 additional nonprofits won a preliminary injunction in July from a lawsuit in response to Department of Government Efficiency cuts to AmeriCorps program funding and staffing. Despite the injunction, the expanded suit alleges the White House’s Office of Management and Budget is withholding the funds. 
Jason Taylor, Bur Oak Land Trust’s executive director, said the cuts meant the group lost all of its AmeriCorps staff for the summer, which greatly impacted the projects the trust could complete. The trust works to restore native habitat, remove invasive species and maintain infrastructure at various nature preserves in the state.
“The whole idea that all of this was behind efficiency – our funds were cut as part of the DOGE program – this has been such an incredibly inefficient summer for us, because we’re dealing with all these other things on top of our normal jobs,” Taylor said.

The lawsuit alleges that the withholding of funds and “dismantling” of the AmeriCorps program, which was established in 1993, has caused “irreparable harm” to the associated nonprofits, individual program participants and members of the AmeriCorps Employees Union, AFSCME Local 2027.
AmeriCorps places participants at service locations like schools, local governments and nonprofits focusing on health, disaster relief, environmental stewardship, workforce development and veterans. 
Since April 2025, the lawsuit alleges, the administration has effectuated program closures, “arbitrary” funding withdrawals, layoffs that “crippled” organizations and left staff in “disarray.” 
Despite the preliminary injunction, issued by a federal district court in Maryland to return $400 million in funding to the affected nonprofits and individuals, the lawsuit alleges the feds have “flouted” the court’s orders to return funding. 
AmeriCorps is under siege. What happens in the communities it serves?

The new action on the lawsuit lists the OMB as an additional defendant and adds more organizations that have been harmed by the withholding of funds. According to a press release from Democracy Defenders Fund and Democracy Forward Foundation, which are organizing the effort, the suit represents AmeriCorps grantees from 26 states. 
Norm Eisen, executive chair of the Democracy Defenders Fund, said the administration’s efforts to “kneecap” the programs are more than just illegal. 
“They’re an attack on one of the most fundamental American ideas: that we Americans help each other,” Eisen said in the press release. “With this amended complaint, we look forward to building on last month’s order that such funding be restored to ensure the vital services these organizations provide can continue.”
The lawsuit asks the court to declare it was unlawful to withhold AmeriCorps funding and terminate staff and programs. It also asks for the OMB to release the funds already appropriated to AmeriCorps programs. 
A status report, filed on behalf of the Corporation for National and Community Service, the lead defendant, notes the office has restored affected jobs and is “in compliance” with statutes and appropriations that require it to carry out programs and award grants.
This filing was the fourth of six required status updates to be filed by the offices per the July ruling in the case, and was filed one day after the nonprofit groups expanded the lawsuit to include OMB.
The expanded filing from the nonprofit organizations said, in reference to the previous three reports, that while the administration alleges it is in compliance, the withholding of appropriated funding is a “blatant” statutory violation.
Impact to Iowa
In the petition, Bur Oak Land Trust is named as a single entity and as a representative of similar nonprofit organizations in the country that have been similarly impacted. 
Taylor said while the impacts to Bur Oak over the summer were difficult and the instability has been “frustrating” the trust will be able to bring in a new group of AmeriCorps members regardless of if the OMB releases funding. 
Taylor said funding from the federal program is more efficient and easier to manage, but if the office does not cede the funding, Volunteer Iowa has said it will step in to fund the program. 
Since 2019, Bur Oak Land Trust has had an AmeriCorps crew to help with prescribed burns, mowing, removing invasive species, leading guided hikes and restoring natural spaces in the state.
Taylor said the crew is never a guarantee, as nonprofits have to apply for federal funding for the program each year.
“But we’ve never had questions about whether or not the program may or may not exist at the federal level before,” Taylor said. “This is the first time that we’ve seen all this uncertainty there.”



Other plaintiffs
Other plaintiffs named in the case include AmeriCorps Employees Union AFSCME Local 2027, Aspire Afterschool, Democracy Maine, Evelyn Rubenstein Jewish Community Center, Elev8 Baltimore, HandsOn Suburban Chicago, Housing and Community Development Network of New Jersey, Michigan College Access Network, National College Attainment Network, North Carolina Housing Coalition, Partners for Campus-Community Engagement, Rainbow Labs, Red Cloud Indian School, Seed Coalition, The Corps Network, and The Service Collaborative of WNY.

(Photo by Shannon Heckt/Virginia Mercury)Hurricane Erin continues to churn up the East Coast, whipping up dangerous waves and winds even as it stays offshore. The storm is not expected to make landfall, but Virginia is preparing for rough waters, tropical-storm-force gusts, and bands of heavy rain as warnings go into effect. 
Gov. Glenn Youngkin on Wednesday updated the public on the storm’s potential impact expected for Thursday morning. Hurricane Erin is a massive storm, already being felt along South Carolina’s Outer Banks Wednesday evening, capable of throwing tropical weather across several states.
“We also are seeing coastal floods watches announced across the whole region as we see the tidal flooding risk really enhanced,” Youngkin said. “This is a dangerous storm, and because of the size of this storm, even though it is offshore, we will see rain bands that will bring heavy rain.”
The governor said first responder resources are staged in Hampton Roads and the Eastern Shore in case swift water rescues are needed. Utilities and the Virginia Department of Transportation are also prepared to clear fallen trees and restore services as tropical-storm-force winds arrive.
“We also have asked state police to preposition resources, and that includes boats and crews on the Eastern Shore into Hampton Roads, particularly and on this side of the tunnel to make sure that we have adequate resources who can move quickly should they be needed, and we also have our aerial support through helicopters and our fixed-wing capabilities,” Youngkin said.
As of Wednesday evening, bridges and tunnels as well as the Jamestown ferry were expected to remain open, though conditions could force changes if the storm worsens. 
Virginia Department of Emergency Management Director John Scrivani urged the public to steer clear of beaches and keep boats off the water until Erin passes.
“There is going to be dangerous marine conditions, rip currents, tidal flooding, beach and dune erosion, as well as those hazardous seas,” Scrivani said. “That’s why you see those warnings over water, not just over land. Outer rain bands can impact the coastal areas. We do not anticipate much impact as we get further inland.”
Flood-prone coastal communities are being told to stay alert. So far, there have been no evacuation orders, voluntary or mandatory, and no emergency declaration. The governor said his team continues to monitor the storm’s track and is ready to adjust if needed.
“I believe what we have staged is sufficient for what we are currently expecting. If circumstances change then we will react very quickly,” Youngkin said. 
“Often an emergency declaration is paired with utilization of the Virginia National Guard, and moving even more resources, and at this point, we see such extensive resource capability in the Hampton Roads region. And with the state assets we’ve already moved, we do believe we’re reacting appropriately.”

(Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)The Idaho state government pays governors a housing stipend.
That’s because Idaho is one of five states without an official residence for the governor.
After expressing interest in buying or building a home for the governor last year, a panel of state lawmakers briefly revisited it on Wednesday. 
But for now, the Governor’s Housing Committee voted to keep the governor’s monthly housing stipend at $4,551 each month, which is roughly $54,600 a year.
Idaho Gov. Brad Little earns $151,400 each year as governor. He lives in a home in Emmet, but also owns a condo in downtown Boise.

At the end of the meeting, Rep. Jaron Crane, R-Nampa, asked the Department of Administration to prepare a list of state properties that might work to remodel or reuse for a governor’s residence. He floated the Alexander House near the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, which is just by the Idaho State Capitol Building.
“I know that the governor may not want to live there. He may want to actually use his personal home. I don’t blame him for that. But I guess my question was, could that be in consideration for a property as maybe a governor’s mansion, for more of a permanent residence that he could have hosted” U.S. Health secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Crane asked.
Idaho Department of Administration Director Steve Bailey said the agency could get started on a list.
“I know that’s a discussion that comes up just about every year, is having a permanent residence for the governor. And for one reason or another, you don’t seem to get traction on it,” Bailey said. 
Only two of the four lawmakers on the committee were present for Wednesday’s meeting. Crane and Sen. Ali Rabe, D-Boise, attended virtually.
Rep. Brooke Green, D-Boise, was appointed to the committee late Tuesday to fill in for former Rep. Todd Achilles, a Boise Democrat who resigned from the Legislature to run as an Independent challenger to Republican U.S. Sen. Jim Risch. The committee’s other member, Sen. Todd Lakey, R-Nampa, did not attend.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)LENEXA, Kansas — A 74-year-old certified public accountant’s misunderstanding and subsequent call to the Kansas Bureau of Investigation sparked a police inquiry into a Lenexa City Council member’s citizenship, public records show, igniting public scrutiny and leading to records requests from local residents.
Melanie Arroyo, who became a U.S. citizen in 2018 and has served on the Lenexa City Council since 2021, disclosed the police investigation during an Aug. 5 council meeting. Her decision to go public that night caught colleagues and city staff by surprise, according to newly disclosed documents.
In a rare move, the city of Lenexa turned over the police investigative file and a copy of Arroyo’s citizenship certificate in response to records requests made by Kansas Reflector, the Kansas City Star and two local residents. The documents identify Douglas Shipe as the Lenexa man who made the initial complaint, and they shed new light on how police proceeded with their investigation into Arroyo.
Arroyo said she understands why police felt obligated to investigate but that she was disappointed in how they went about it.
“It just kind of confirms to me that they are not sensitive with how to handle immigration situations,” Arroyo said.
Shipe, a registered Republican and CPA who lives in Lenexa, called the KBI on July 8 and requested an investigation into Arroyo’s citizenship status based on written testimony she had provided to the Legislature in February.
Arroyo wrote about growing up “as an undocumented immigrant girl” in the testimony she provided in opposition to Senate Bill 254, which would have eliminated in-state tuition and other benefits for immigrants. She also wrote that she resolved her immigration status in order to attend college in Kansas. The Senate didn’t vote on the bill.
KBI agent Jeff Muckenthaler described Shipe’s call in an email to Lenexa police on July 16. Muckenthaler said he was forwarding the information “to handle however you deem appropriate.”
Lenexa police Detective Bill McCombs opened an investigation on July 21. His first move was to call Special Agent Hayden McGrath with Homeland Security Investigations to ask for assistance regarding Arroyo’s immigration status. McCombs provided Arroyo’s Social Security number and date of birth.
Arroyo said she was concerned to learn police had contacted HSI about her.
“That alarmed me a little bit,” Arroyo said. “What the hell, bro?”
Two days later, the investigative file shows, McCombs read Arroyo’s testimony. He noted that Shipe had “not understood” Arroyo’s testimony.
“As written, one would assume her immigration status was satisfied,” McCombs said.
In the meantime, Police Chief Dawn Layman had called Arroyo to let her know about the investigation. Arroyo responded by hiring an attorney who then sent a copy of Arroyo’s citizenship certificate to police. McCombs’ report said he cross-referenced the certificate with Arroyo’s driver’s license to verify that her full name and Social Security number matched. HSI’s assistance was no longer needed.
Lenexa police Capt. Justin Schopfer reported that he called Shipe on Aug. 5 to provide an update. Schopfer explained that police had confirmed Arroyo’s citizenship, which predated her election to the city council.
“After ensuring Shipe had no further questions, I ended the call,” Schopfer said.
Shipe didn’t respond to Kansas Reflector phone calls or emails. Kansas Reflector attempted to knock on his door on Friday, but the apartment number he lists on his voter registration doesn’t exist. An employee in the leasing office for the apartment complex said she would give Shipe a copy of a Kansas Reflector business card, but he never called.
Online records show Shipe donated $100 to Republican Kris Kobach, who rose to prominence as a political figure for his anti-immigrant rhetoric and policies, when Kobach was running for governor in 2018 and again in 2022 when he was running for attorney general. Shipe also donated a total of $925 to former state Sen. Julia Lynn, a Republican from Olathe, between 2012 and 2019.
Arroyo said she went public with her frustration over the police inquiry after federal authorities on July 30 raided El Toro Loco restaurants in Lenexa and Kansas City, Kansas. She voiced her concerns at the Aug. 5 council meeting, where numerous members of the public spoke in support of Arroyo.
“I understand why people would be frustrated with me,” she said in an interview Wednesday. “Speaking up is risky, and I recognize that, absolutely. At the same time, not speaking up also poses a major risk for everyone. So I really had to weigh my options here, and ultimately I decided that speaking up is in support of not just our immigrant community but in defense of constitutional rights and also in defense of our humanity. I could never regret doing that.”
Tim McCabe, a Lenexa resident who has testified before the Legislature about his displeasure with facemasks during the COVID-19 pandemic and his concerns that China could influence the outcome of local elections, submitted a Kansas Open Records Act request directly to Arroyo seeking documents related to her citizenship status and the police investigative report.
Kansas Reflector asked McCabe why he submitted the request, if he was surprised by anything the city provided, and whether he is satisfied Arroyo is a U.S. citizen. He replied via email with a one-word response: “Nope.” He didn’t respond to an email seeking clarification.
Laura Owen also asked for police records and whether city staff had invited media to the Aug. 5 council meeting. She declined to comment.
MacKenzie Harvison, deputy city attorney, told her city staff were “entirely unaware” that Arroyo intended to talk about the investigation that night, until media outlets began to ask questions in the hours before the meeting.
The city could have exempted the requested records under state law because they are part of a police investigative file, Harvison said, but provided them in the interest of transparency.
Kansas Reflector submitted a Kansas Open Records Act request on Aug. 14 for other requests and the city’s response. The city failed to respond within three business days as required by law. On Wednesday, Harvison apologized for the delay.
“We had what felt like a million balls in the air last week and this simply fell through the cracks,” she said. “The city of Lenexa takes its commitment to transparency very seriously, and we strive always to meet and exceed the requirements of KORA. I know that we didn’t do so in this instance, and I apologize on behalf of all of the staff involved. Rest assured that this mistake was not intentional at all, just simply human error.”

Eighteen months after Roberts’ actions incited global outrage, a grand jury decided the Daniel resident should face felony charges.
The post Grand jury indicts Cody Roberts, infamous Wyoming wolf captor, on felony animal cruelty appeared first on WyoFile .","Sublette County law enforcement officials announced today that a grand jury has indicted Cody Roberts for the charge of felony cruelty to animals, a crime that could net the Daniel resident up to two years in prison. 
The announcement came in a press release that provided few details about the grand jury, which meets behind closed doors and is confidential in nature. The 12-person panel, selected by the 9th District Court, met during the second and third weeks of August. After “receiving evidence and deliberation,” the notice said, the grand jury returned a “true bill” resulting in the indictment against Roberts.
Sublette County Prosecuting Attorney Clayton Melinkovich could not be reached immediately for an interview. 
Early on during fallout from the incident, which incited global outrage, the county attorney suggested that he disagreed with the Wyoming Game and Fish Department, which took the lead in responding to the Feb. 29, 2024 incident. Game and Fish has maintained that wolves are not protected by animal cruelty laws in Wyoming where they are designated as predators by the state.

Mark Gordon and other state officials on Dec. 15, 2023 at a town hall-style meeting focused on Wyoming’s mental health struggles and resources.

“While many of the animal abuse provisions do not apply to the hunting, capture, killing, or destruction of a predatory animal, there are narrow circumstances where a person could be charged and convicted of animal abuse,” Melinkovich said in an announcement in early April 2024. 
Nearly a year and a half later, the grand jury agreed.
In the spring of 2024, Game and Fish’s investigation and subsequent citation were handled without public notice in the days after the incident. Roberts was fined $250 for possessing the wolf, though the investigating wardens could have issued steeper penalties and sent the case to court but declined to take that step. The leniency of the penalty stoked outrage that exploded globally when Roberts’ stunt with the injured wolf became widely publicized, with photos of him and the injured animal splashed across the internet.
In the aftermath, the Wyoming Legislature even convened a “Treatment of Predators Working Group,” which included lawmakers and other stakeholders. That group workshopped a bill intended to deter the torture of predatory animals. 
In addition to up to two years of imprisonment, felony animal cruelty can be punishable with a fine of up to $5,000.

Felony animal cruelty is committed in Wyoming if a person, “knowingly, and with intent to cause death or undue suffering, beats with cruelty, tortures, torments or mutilates an animal,” according to Section 6-3-1005 of the criminal code.
At the one-year mark after Roberts’ stunt with the wolf, the Wyoming Game and Fish Department declined to comment on Sublette County’s law enforcement proceedings. 
“The Wyoming Game and Fish Department cannot comment on pending or ongoing litigation within or outside of our jurisdiction,” Chief Warden Dan Smith said in a statement at the time.

(Photo by Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor) North Dakota fire departments and ambulance services are understaffed and facing financial constraints while at the same time responding to more calls and serving large areas, emergency responders told lawmakers Wednesday.
The Legislature has a new interim committee, the Emergency Response Services Committee, that’s working to find solutions.
Rep. Jim Grueneich, R-Ellendale, chair of the committee, said rural communities can be hit the hardest with even small personnel challenges with emergency service providers.
“I think we have to look at what we can do to help these essential services in rural North Dakota, and of course in our urban areas as well,” Grueneich said.
One of the committee’s tasks is a study of volunteer emergency responder recruitment and retention that was mandated by the passage of House Bill 1311 during the 2025 legislative session.
Grueneich said he expects to have legislation drafted ahead of the 2027 legislative session to help emergency services. He added the committee plans to hold four more meetings during the interim with the last meeting focused on debating and editing draft legislation.
Rep. Todd Porter, R-Mandan, owner of Metro-Area Ambulance Service which serves Morton and Burleigh counties, said he thinks one of the most important fixes is recruiting more young people to the profession. 
“I do think that we have to start utilizing our CTE (Career and Technical Education) centers, and getting them fully engaged, and doing some of that initial training with our high school students to get them interested in these kinds of important careers,” Porter said.
Porter said the state will still need to subsidize some of the emergency services in rural North Dakota, but having a stable pipeline of workers entering the career field would alleviate some of that stress.
Emergency services personnel from across the state testified to lawmakers about their challenges, including low wages, rising insurance costs, a lack of housing and competition among rural providers for staff and grants.
Some employers have stopped letting volunteer firefighters respond to calls during the workday, said Travis Bateman, director of Badlands Search and Rescue.
He said he understands if oil and gas workers can’t leave their posts to respond to a fire because something might blow up, but he sees more employers not affiliated with critical operations withholding emergency volunteer employees from calls.
“If it’s a non-critical, non-essential role, that’s ridiculous,” Bateman said.

He added some employers do allow their staff to respond to emergency calls and even leave them clocked in as a way to honor their employee’s service.
State Fire Marshal Doug Nelson said North Dakota has 357 fire departments, of which 334 are entirely volunteer-based. Those departments have more than 8,100 firefighters, including about 7,400 volunteers.
The incidents those firefighters respond to have more than doubled over the last decade, he said. 
In 2024, firefighters across North Dakota responded to more than 51,500 incidents, up from more than 22,000 in 2014. Those incidents in 2024 included more than 3,000 fires, up from nearly 2,000, 10 years earlier.
Recruitment issues, a lack of resources and increasing equipment costs are not things that will be fixed overnight, Nelson said.
“We just kind of want to come up with some of those basic steps, really ideas, that we need to build further consensus with the fire service and our partners into this committee to make sure we’re all going in the same direction,” Nelson said.
Porter said there are multiple emergency service issues the committee will discuss at future meetings.
“I think there are models out there that would work for our rural areas that don’t necessarily mean an ambulance sitting on every corner,” he said. “In the end, we should be looking at making a huge commitment to solidifying the delivery of those services that people are expecting.”

Displaced residents of Camelot Village in Chapel Hill are growing anxious as time runs out on their stay at the Comfort Inn in Durham. The residents were forced to leave their rental homes in early July after rain from Tropical Storm Chantal sent Bolin Creek overflowing its banks and spilling into the nearly 60-year-old townhome community.
At a press conference Wednesday, the residents told reporters that they must leave the hotel Aug. 29 after disaster assistance from Orange County, Triangle Mutual Aid and private citizens runs out.
“I’m gonna be homeless, pretty much because I haven’t found a place to go that I can afford,” said Jessica Tickles. “I had to take out of work to find housing, so I’m like restarting back to work and it’s like starting from zero.”










Their rent and those deposits are their money and that’s not being returned so that they can move forward with their lives, get housing, return to their dignity.


– C.R. Clark, Triangle Tenant Union


Residents complained that landlords and town and county officials have been slow to respond to concerns and have not done enough to help as they struggle to find housing in the aftermath of the storm, which they say left them financially strapped and stressed.
With the help of the Triangle Tenant Union, the residents issued these demands:

Return of July rents due to the uninhabitability of the units after the storm.
Return of security deposits to assist tenants in securing new housing.
Cancellation of leases and August rent for tenants who want to move.
Relocation assistance in securing permanent housing that meets their needs.
Temporary accommodations for tenants who want to return after building repair and remediation.

“It’s unlawful to charge rent for an uninhabitable apartment in North Carolina,” said C.R. Clark with Triangle Tenant Union. “This is a legal violation, but we’re trying to ensure that people can make demands of this landlord and move that forward rather than trying to go through court.”
Clark said the former tenants have only one week to secure housing and the county is telling them to “just figure it out.”
“A lot of these people have been through so much trauma that figuring it out is really hard …” Clark said. “Their rent and those deposits are their money and that’s not being returned so that they can move forward with their lives, get housing, return to their dignity.”
He said “people are gonna be in on the street” if Chapel Hill Mayor Jess Anderson doesn’t step up and provide staffing to “get some of these things done, to get some relocation assistance, to pay for some of these application fees … so that folks can get relocated and begin to rebuild their lives.”
Many residents lost everything in the flood and as many as three-fourths of them were unhoused before moving into Camelot Village, Clark said. The townhome rentals provided low-income residents with rare  affordable housing in affluent Chapel Hill, he said.
Some residents had federal Section 8 vouchers which means their rent was based on income. Others without vouchers pay as much as $950 a month to live there.

“Camelot was the only affordable housing that I was able to be placed in, and I was not made aware of a flooding situation until the time of signing my lease, and at that point, I could not back out because of how the system works with people that are on county funding and things like that,” said Heather Gibbs. “If you say ‘no’ to something in the process, then you are put out on the street and left to find housing somewhere else on your own.”
Gibbs said she has applied to three or four places for housing and paid more than $300 in non-refundable application fees. The fees aren’t refunded even if the unit doesn’t pass required inspections for Section 8 vouchers, she said.
“It’s been really complicated for us to get in somewhere else that is safe,” Gibbs said. “I definitely would not return there [Camelot Village].”

Dale Weldele, a recent amputee who now walks with the aid of a prosthetic leg, said he barely survived the flooding at Camelot Village.
“The neighbors saved my life, they got me to safety,” Weldele said. My prosthetic came off in the current. I couldn’t stand against it, so I’m on one leg with crutches, trying to make it to the stairs …”

The prospect of starting over is daunting,” Weldele said.
“Everything got destroyed. It’s starting all over at an old age, and the whole thing, so it’s really hard,” he said.










Putting someone who is not stable on their feet in a ground level unit that you know floods and to leave them there and walk away, that should be illegal.


– Devin Gilder, volunteer Triangle Mutual Aid


Devin Gilgor, a volunteer with Triangle Mutual Aid, said many Camelot Village tenants have medical conditions and cannot afford to be unhoused.
Gilgor noted that one of the former tenants is a paraplegic and that Weldele is still learning to navigate the world with his prosthetic. He said neither is capable of living in a tent in the woods if they’re unable to find safe, affordable housing.
“They’re not capable of being unhoused,” Gilgor said. “They have medical conditions, they have special equipment for mobility purposes and some of them have intellectual disabilities that are creating massive hurdles for us in terms of getting through the application process for apartments.”
Long history of flooding
Camelot Village has a long history flooding, Gilgor said.
“I’ve lived down the street from Camelot my whole life, but my first memorable flood in Camelot was in 1972,” he said. “I’ve been over there and mucked out apartments eight times now.”
Apartments are currently being refurbished, he said, with plans to put new residents in them, despite flooding and safety concerns. Some units are privately owned and others are corporate owned.
“They’re rebuilding to put more people in who are going to be low income, who are going to be on vouchers, who are going to have a special needs, and someone’s going to drown,” Gilgor said. “Putting someone who is not stable on their feet in a ground level unit that you know floods and to leave them there and walk away, that should be illegal.”
Gilgor lamented the fact that few elected officials attended the press conference despite being invited.
“I think the citizens need to take a good, hard look at town council,” Gilgor said. “Being that this is an election year, I would venture to say you’d think more people would have showed up today because I personally invited everybody from town council and the mayor of Chapel Hill.”

The law weakens health care and food assistance more than any legislation in history. Combined with tax cuts that give a whopping $1 trillion to the richest 1%, no law has ever done so much to enrich the wealthy while hurting those of modest income.
What does it mean for your state and community? For starters, states will lose billions in federal funding for health care, food, and other necessities.
Federal funds provided more than one of every three dollars that states spent last year — and much more in places like Mississippi, Indiana, and South Dakota. In Louisiana, federal aid delivers fully half of state spending. But we’re likely to see layoffs of federal employees in every state — and potentially of state and local employees whose paychecks rely on federal dollars, too.
For families, it means less access to the basics.
Hospitals and nonprofits (like food banks) depend on federal funding and will reduce staff at best and shutter at worst. More than 300 rural hospitals face likely elimination. And because of Trump’s health care cuts, more than 50,000 Americans will die early every single year.
In addition to these cuts, Trump has also illegally withheld congressionally authorized funding for health care, Head Start, child care, disease control, disability services, and more, causing crises at organizations nationwide.
Funding is also getting cut for community colleges, four-year universities, financial aid, loans, and first-generation students. This will block access to degrees for working-class kids coast-to-coast.
Federal emergency funding, long the bedrock of state response to floods, hurricanes, and other disasters, is also on the chopping block — meaning more devastation, less recovery, and billions in costs shifted to states. Transportation projects will stall too, harming commuters and construction jobs.
All in all, this law will leave our communities sicker, less educated, and less safe.
Only the federal government can raise sufficient funds from those most able to pay and distribute them to poorer states like Alabama, Mississippi, and West Virginia, who have less capacity to raise dollars locally.
But policymakers can fill some of the gap with improved state and local taxation. With Trump and Congress turning their backs on American families, states have to rise to the moment.
States have many options.
They can raise more by bolstering income taxes on the wealthiest— policies that have won recently in Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Minnesota. They can also tax income from wealth by improving capital gains income taxation. Washington, Maryland, Minnesota, and New Mexico have passed such reforms recently.
And they can stop corporations from hiding profits in other states, as most states now do, or in other countries, something innovators are increasingly proposing.
Localities have options too: enacting mansion taxes, as cities in California, Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland, New Mexico, and New York have done, and passing local income taxes as thousands of communities in Ohio, Indiana, and 13 other states do. At the very least, local policymakers could rein in costly corporate tax breaks that shortchange schools.
Tax dollars pay for essentials that make America healthy, educated, and safe. If Trump and his allies slash those fundamentals to enrich the richest, we must insist that states and cities get creative in taking care of the rest of us.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/trumpjuly42025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-20 18:57:13.288984

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)LENEXA — A 74-year-old certified public accountant’s misunderstanding and subsequent call to the Kansas Bureau of Investigation sparked a police inquiry into a Lenexa City Council member’s citizenship, public records show, igniting public scrutiny and leading to records requests from local residents.
Melanie Arroyo, who became a U.S. citizen in 2018 and has served on the Lenexa City Council since 2021, disclosed the police investigation during an Aug. 5 council meeting. Her decision to go public that night caught colleagues and city staff by surprise, according to newly disclosed documents.
In a rare move, the city of Lenexa turned over the police investigative file and a copy of Arroyo’s citizenship certificate in response to records requests made by Kansas Reflector, the Kansas City Star and two local residents. The documents identify Douglas Shipe as the Lenexa man who made the initial complaint, and they shed new light on how police proceeded with their investigation into Arroyo.
Arroyo said she understands why police felt obligated to investigate but that she was disappointed in how they went about it.
“It just kind of confirms to me that they are not sensitive with how to handle immigration situations,” Arroyo said.
Shipe, a registered Republican and CPA who lives in Lenexa, called the KBI on July 8 and requested an investigation into Arroyo’s citizenship status based on written testimony she had provided to the Legislature in February.
Arroyo wrote about growing up “as an undocumented immigrant girl” in the testimony she provided in opposition to Senate Bill 254, which would have eliminated in-state tuition and other benefits for immigrants. She also wrote that she resolved her immigration status in order to attend college in Kansas. The Senate didn’t vote on the bill.
KBI agent Jeff Muckenthaler described Shipe’s call in an email to Lenexa police on July 16. Muckenthaler said he was forwarding the information “to handle however you deem appropriate.”
Lenexa police Detective Bill McCombs opened an investigation on July 21. His first move was to call Special Agent Hayden McGrath with Homeland Security Investigations to ask for assistance regarding Arroyo’s immigration status. McCombs provided Arroyo’s Social Security number and date of birth.
Arroyo said she was concerned to learn police had contacted HSI about her.
“That alarmed me a little bit,” Arroyo said. “What the hell, bro?”
Two days later, the investigative file shows, McCombs read Arroyo’s testimony. He noted that Shipe had “not understood” Arroyo’s testimony.
“As written, one would assume her immigration status was satisfied,” McCombs said.
In the meantime, Police Chief Dawn Layman had called Arroyo to let her know about the investigation. Arroyo responded by hiring an attorney who then sent a copy of Arroyo’s citizenship certificate to police. McCombs’ report said he cross-referenced the certificate with Arroyo’s driver’s license to verify that her full name and Social Security number matched. HSI’s assistance was no longer needed.
Lenexa police Capt. Justin Schopfer reported that he called Shipe on Aug. 5 to provide an update. Schopfer explained that police had confirmed Arroyo’s citizenship, which predated her election to the city council.
“After ensuring Shipe had no further questions, I ended the call,” Schopfer said.
Shipe didn’t respond to Kansas Reflector phone calls or emails. Kansas Reflector attempted to knock on his door on Friday, but the apartment number he lists on his voter registration doesn’t exist. An employee in the leasing office for the apartment complex said she would give Shipe a copy of a Kansas Reflector business card, but he never called.
Online records show Shipe donated $100 to Republican Kris Kobach, who rose to prominence as a political figure for his anti-immigrant rhetoric and policies, when Kobach was running for governor in 2018 and again in 2022 when he was running for attorney general. Shipe also donated a total of $925 to former state Sen. Julia Lynn, a Republican from Olathe, between 2012 and 2019.
Arroyo said she went public with her frustration over the police inquiry after federal authorities on July 30 raided El Toro Loco restaurants in Lenexa and Kansas City, Kansas. She voiced her concerns at the Aug. 5 council meeting, where numerous members of the public spoke in support of Arroyo.
“I understand why people would be frustrated with me,” she said in an interview Wednesday. “Speaking up is risky, and I recognize that, absolutely. At the same time, not speaking up also poses a major risk for everyone. So I really had to weigh my options here, and ultimately I decided that speaking up is in support of not just our immigrant community but in defense of constitutional rights and also in defense of our humanity. I could never regret doing that.”
Tim McCabe, a Lenexa resident who has testified before the Legislature about his displeasure with facemasks during the COVID-19 pandemic and his concerns that China could influence the outcome of local elections, submitted a Kansas Open Records Act request directly to Arroyo seeking documents related to her citizenship status and the police investigative report.
Kansas Reflector asked McCabe why he submitted the request, if he was surprised by anything the city provided, and whether he is satisfied Arroyo is a U.S. citizen. He replied via email with a one-word response: “Nope.” He didn’t respond to an email seeking clarification.
Laura Owen also asked for police records and whether city staff had invited media to the Aug. 5 council meeting. She declined to comment.
MacKenzie Harvison, deputy city attorney, told her city staff were “entirely unaware” that Arroyo intended to talk about the investigation that night, until media outlets began to ask questions in the hours before the meeting.
The city could have exempted the requested records under state law because they are part of a police investigative file, Harvison said, but provided them in the interest of transparency.
Kansas Reflector submitted a Kansas Open Records Act request on Aug. 14 for other requests and the city’s response. The city failed to respond within three business days as required by law. On Wednesday, Harvison apologized for the delay.
“We had what felt like a million balls in the air last week and this simply fell through the cracks,” she said. “The city of Lenexa takes its commitment to transparency very seriously, and we strive always to meet and exceed the requirements of KORA. I know that we didn’t do so in this instance, and I apologize on behalf of all of the staff involved. Rest assured that this mistake was not intentional at all, just simply human error.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/P8190854-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-08-20 18:57:13.288984

The Department of Financial Regulation issued an order late last week that sets guardrails around any agreements the state’s two largest health insurers enter into with half of Vermont hospitals.

Vermont’s insurance regulator has intervened to set significant guardrails on the contracts that hospitals and insurers are negotiating for the coming year in an effort to reduce health insurance costs for individuals, families and businesses in the state.
On Aug. 14, the Vermont Department of Financial Regulation — the state agency tasked with ensuring the solvency of insurance companies of all types — issued an order that escalated its involvement in what have largely been private negotiations between hospitals and commercial insurers over payment rates. Those negotiated prices — along with how much and what kind of health care hospitals provide to insured Vermonters — are a major factor determining the cost of monthly health insurance premiums for the year. 
The department’s order requires Vermont’s two largest insurers — Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont and MVP — to demonstrate in writing that any agreements the companies make with the state’s larger hospitals and hospital network will lead to a “material reduction” in commercial health insurance premiums. The order also requires any contract to contain “discount provisions and other cost containment provisions that reflect industry standards.”
“The point of the order is to be flexible but also hold the feet to the fire for all parties in the negotiations. There needs to be cost savings here. The status quo will not do,” said Kaj Samsom, the Department of Financial Regulation’s commissioner, who issued the order. 
This year, the average monthly premium for the benchmark plan on Vermont Health Connect, the state’s Affordable Care Act marketplace, hit $1,277 per month. That is the highest cost premium anywhere in the United States, 22% higher than a comparable plan sold in the next most expensive state, Alaska; more than twice as expensive as one sold in Maine; and almost four times the cost of one in neighboring New Hampshire, according to the health care data analysis nonprofit KFF. 
Although just a fraction of people covered by commercial health insurance in Vermont purchase plans through the marketplace, the cost of those plans are impacted by the same factors that drive other premiums — the cost of health care services and how often they are used. The marketplace plans are also standardized in their coverage, so they allow for an easier comparison across states.
The department’s order is explicitly aimed at shoring up the finances of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont, which has lost nearly $152 million between 2021 and 2025 and faces insolvency without drastic changes in its costs and revenue. However, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont (BCBSVT) and MVP Health Plan, Inc. (MVP) are the only two insurers who sell health insurance plans on the Vermont Health Connect marketplace, so the department extended the order to apply to MVP as well, in order “to assure reasonable competition,” as the order states. 
“There was a lot of hope by all parties that in the regular cadence of negotiation, Blue Cross and MVP could prevent some of the necessary insurance rate increases, through negotiated cost reductions with providers,” Samsom said. “All parties are trying to find common ground, but the fact is that they’ve failed.” 
The order only applies to contracts between the two insurers and certain hospitals, generally the state’s larger ones: University of Vermont Medical Center in the Burlington area; Rutland Regional Medical Center; Central Vermont Medical Center in Berlin; Southwestern Vermont Medical Center in Bennington; Northwestern Vermont Medical Center in St. Albans City; Brattleboro Memorial Hospital and Porter Medical Center in Middlebury — the latter because it is part of the University of Vermont Health Network. 
Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont sees this move from the department “as strongly supporting a more affordable healthcare system for Vermonters” as they work through negotiations with hospitals, Andrew Garland, a vice president and spokesperson for the insurer, wrote in an email.
Jordan Estey, an MVP vice president and spokesperson, also acknowledged the order’s significance in “addressing both affordability for Vermonters and long-term sustainability within the health care system,” in an email.
The Green Mountain Care Board, the state’s independent health care regulator, is tasked with setting guidelines for plans sold on the Vermont Health Connect marketplace and approving the annual premiums.
Due to a series of health care reforms signed into law this June, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont has been able to lower its requested average premium increases — from 23.3% for individual plans and 13.7% for small group plans in May, to 15.1% for individual plans and 7.4% for small group plans. The care board expects to issue its guidelines for the 2026  marketplace rates on Friday.
While the department is pushing for even lower rates, it is unclear how the order will apply to the Green Mountain Care Board’s decisions on insurance rates. Regardless, the department is asking that board members give the move consideration as it makes hospital budgets decisions next month. 
The power of the department’s order is limited, because the agency only oversees insurers and cannot compel hospitals to make the same cost-cutting efforts in their negotiations, Samson, the department’s commissioner, explained in a letter to board Chair Owen Foster. The letter suggests that complementary action from the Green Mountain Care Board could secure the savings needed to reduce premiums.

Foster acknowledged the letter but declined to indicate how the care board will act on the department’s action, citing its ongoing deliberations. But generally, “this all works better if we all work in alignment,” he said. “We work closely and very, very well with DFR every single day.”
Samsom said the care board could make a similar order, either by placing a revenue cap on major hospitals or ordering across-the-board unit cost reductions. 
“[The Care Board] are the experts and they hold the keys necessary to understanding to where cuts can be made,” he said.
Both insurers expect fewer plans will be sold in the individual marketplace for 2026.  With the likely end of federal subsidies at the end of this year, costs will increase dramatically for many purchasers. The expected disenrollment is one factor driving up the cost of premiums for those still insured.
“This is a crisis,” Samsom said of the end of the subsidies. “Those tax credits helped make things — I wouldn’t say affordable, but — more affordable and within reach for a lot of [individual marketplace] insurance buyers.” 
Still, insurers and hospitals must find a path to move forward. 
“At the end of the day, they have to come to an agreement,” Samsom said.  “We cannot have the UVM Health Network be an out-of-network provider. At some point, we have to have a contract between all parties and an agreement.”
The order essentially bolsters insurers in their negotiations as the department has to approve any contracts the hospitals and insurers enter into. Despite that, Samsom said he will be sparing with his veto power.
“At this point we are looking for a plan,” Samsom said. That could look like BCBSVT and MVP striking tentative agreements with major hospitals on certain service cost reductions, or some type of risk-sharing component that helps cap the maximum claims, he said. “That’s what it would take for me to endorse the findings of such a contract.”
“I’m putting my thumb on the scale here to say we need more cost reductions from the major hospitals,” he added.

Ron DeSantis appeared with Attorney General James Uthmeier to lay out reasons for the state to conduct a mid-decade redistricting.Florida is calling on federal authorities to remedy alleged errors in the U.S. Census and want the state awarded an additional seat in Congress — or at the very least updated population data so that the state is in line for increased federal funding.
Attorney General James Uthmeier earlier this month sent a letter to U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick that outlined the state’s concerns that Florida was “egregiously undercounted” during the last Census, conducted under the first term of President Donald Trump but certified by the administration of President Joe Biden.
Gov. Ron DeSantis and Uthmeier appeared together in Palm Beach County on Wednesday, where the governor cited the letter and laid out other reasons that he contended could require the state to do a mid-decade redistricting.
 Something we’re going to have to address
“We’ve had really significant growth and migration, and our congressional map should reflect that,” DeSantis said. “So, this is something that we are going to have to address as a state.”
The Republican governor said he had “spoken with some folks in the Florida Legislature and I think that there’s broad acknowledgement that this is something — you know — that is going to have to happen.”
DeSantis asserted that the U.S. Supreme Court could in the next few months issue a ruling in a closely watched case over redistricting that questions whether the deliberate creation of majority-minority districts is constitutional. 
The governor suggested that at least one seat in South Florida — if not a second — would need to be redrawn if that occurred. The seat DeSantis appeared to be referencing is held by Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick, a Democrat whose district includes parts of Broward and Palm Beach counties.
A tussle over redistricting has broken out among red states and blue states since Trump pushed Texas to redraw its congressional districts so that Republicans could pick up extra seats during the 2026 midterm elections. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has responded, pushing ahead with his own map that could bolster the number of Democrats elected there.
While this has been unfolding, DeSantis has been calling for state legislators to draw a new congressional map. He has said several times that the decennial Census should be redone so that Florida could gain additional seats. But DeSantis has also cited a state Supreme Court decision that upheld Florida’s existing map, which eliminated the North Florida district that had been held by Rep. Al Lawson, a Black Democrat.
Following the 2020 Census, Florida was awarded one new congressional seat, for 28 total, and it was included in a new map pushed into law by DeSantis that resulted in Republicans gaining four seats in Florida.
DeSantis said he had been told by the Trump administration that it was likely the state would get two additional seats. He said the Commerce Department itself had acknowledged problems with the survey after it occurred.
Send a letter
In his letter, Uthmeier contends that nothing precludes the Commerce Department from conducting a “streamlined” recount that corrects “now discovered errors.” During the press event, both Uthmeier and DeSantis speculated that Florida and other Republican-controlled states had been purposely harmed. Uthmeier called it a “deep state effort to manipulate the Census.”
Nikki Fried, chair of the Florida Democratic Party, blasted the latest efforts by DeSantis to push for a mid-decade redistricting.
“This is yet another manufactured crisis from Ron DeSantis — speculative, corrupt, and a complete waste of taxpayer dollars,” said Fried. “Floridians are facing increased costs of living, meanwhile, Ron’s trying to stir chaos to distract from his failures, all in pursuit of Gavin Newsom-style headlines.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/OklahomaVoice)OKLAHOMA CITY — In an attempt to limit risks to its investments, an Oklahoma state board plans to try to shape some major companies’ policies pertaining to the dispensing of medications, “discrimination” in charitable giving and child pornography.
The Tobacco Settlement Endowment Trust’s board of investors voted 3-1 Wednesday to ask the shareholders of 10 companies to vote on changing policies related to a variety of issues including child pornography, “politicized and anti-religious discrimination in charitable gift matching,” “gender ideology activism,” and the dispensing of mifepristone. The board also wants the companies to disclose “risks of executive compensation plans” that include diversity, equity and inclusion and environmental, social and governance policies, and the risks of “China exposure” on investment returns.
They would not say which companies would be targeted. The requests would be made publicly available once submitted, according to a spokesperson for Treasurer Todd Russ, who serves as chair of the board.
Members of the Oklahoma board said they were concerned the policies at the 10 companies could open their trust, which oversees the investment of about $2 billion in public dollars, up to backlash and potential litigation. 
Jerry Bowyer, CEO of Bowyer Research, a portfolio construction and asset allocation consulting firm, said the sale of mifepristone, which can be used to help induce abortions, could prevent pregnancies. That would reduce future sales of items like diapers, which could harm overall investment returns.
He also said a company that has diversity, equity and inclusion policies that run counter to the Trump administration’s position could lose out on federal contracts, harming shareholders.
“One could be credibly accused of not exercising full fiduciary responsibility,” he said. 
Bowyer said public pressure brought by “activists” often drives company policies. TSET’s proposals would offer shareholders and management an alternate option.
“It helps them to resist activist pressure,” he said. “And that’s generally the design of these proposals, to help companies to do what they want to do and do what they know they should do.” 
Most public companies give shareholders the opportunity to vote on compensation packages for executives and let management know their views on issues that could affect the value of shares. 
Some shareholders also have the opportunity to add proposals or recommended action items to the agenda at shareholder meetings. That’s what the TSET board voted to do. 
TSET’s board of investors makes decisions on investing the proceeds of Oklahoma’s settlement with the tobacco industry. A different TSET board then spends the interest on programs and other grants aimed at improving health. 
Russ, who chairs the board of investors, said the proposals are a way to “responsibly protect shareholder value and financial returns.” 
“These investments currently have good financial returns, so simply pulling them is not the solution,” he said in a statement after the meeting. “Submitting proposals allows us to address potential risks while maintaining the value of the investments for the fund.”
Russ said the board wasn’t acting in response to a directive from any official. He said it is the board’s responsibility to pay attention to these issues and protect the fund’s investments with the processes available. 
“The goal of the proposals is to bring attention to shareholder concerns and encourage companies to avoid behaviors that could ultimately create financial risk,” he said. 
He said he doesn’t know what the TSET board will do if the companies’ don’t take action on the concerns. 
John Waldo, the sole dissenting vote, said the board should communicate directly with these companies to express their concerns before telling them how to conduct business. 
Some companies have already separated from diversity, equity and inclusion policies, he said. 
A previous attempt by Russ to pass similar proposals failed in June. At the time, he had targeted companies like Amazon, Lululemon and Netflix for policies on issues including diversity and gay rights, according to reporting from Oklahoma Watch.

(Photo by Stephen Maturen/Getty Images)After a string of high-profile incidents of political violence, along with an uptick in threats and harassment of elected leaders around the country, a group of Pennsylvania lawmakers announced they plan to introduce a series of bills intended to help keep legislators safe, and ensure seats are filled immediately in the event one is killed.
The proposed measures follow a series of high profile attacks on government officials, including the firebombing of the Governor’s Mansion in Harrisburg in April, and shootings that targeted two Democratic state lawmakers in Minnesota in June. Melissa Hortman, who was the former speaker of the Minnesota House of Representatives, was killed.
“These incidents only underscore the fact that political violence is on the rise, including here in Pennsylvania,” Rep. Greg Scott (D-Montgomery), said in a statement Tuesday. “Political violence has no place in our democracy, and it is paramount that state legislators are safe while serving the people of Pennsylvania.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
While two of the four measures address the immediate safety of lawmakers, others limit their exposure to the public and would ensure representation in the event a Pennsylvania legislator dies while in office. 
Advocates, however, have raised concerns about some of the proposals, but agreed, given the state of political rhetoric in the country, lawmakers are right to have concerns for their safety.
One proposal would exempt their home addresses from disclosure under Pennsylvania’s Right-To-Know laws. A similar rule already exists for state judges.
“Our safety as legislators is threatened, and we must not let fear be a deterrent to our work,” co-prime-sponsor Rep. Roni Green (D-Philadelphia) said in a statement. 
Philip Hensley-Robin, executive director of Common Cause PA, a government watchdog group, said he understood the concerns lawmakers might have with their addresses being public record, but worried about their constituents’ ability to ensure that they’re meeting residency requirements. 
“Holding public office is a public trust, and there are some attendant transparency that comes along with that,” Hensley-Robin said. “There’s an existing state constitutional requirement that legislators are able to establish residency in their districts, and maintain it. For that requirement to be at all enforceable, someone has to be able to confirm residency.”

Hensley-Robin acknowledged, however, without seeing the bill’s language, which has not been released yet,  it’s difficult to know whether it satisfies that requirement.
Another  measure would place the Capitol Police, who guard the state Capitol building, under a new police board. Currently, they serve under the governor.
According to a press release from Nicole Baxter, a House Democratic Caucus spokesperson, the measure, “mirrors how the U.S. Capitol police force operates and would enable the legislature to evaluate whether security arrangements are sufficient in this politically volatile environment.”
A third measure doesn’t directly deal with a lawmaker’s safety, but would allow an incumbent to bypass the signature-gathering requirements to appear on a ballot. Instead, they  would be able to file what’s called a certificate of nomination, creating a process similar to one allied for magisterial district judges.
Andrew McGinley, the vice president of external affairs at the Committee of Seventy, a nonprofit focused on ethics, democracy and transparency in Pennsylvania government, criticized the proposal.
He said the signature-gathering process is “almost like a proof of concept for a campaign that demonstrates that someone has support from a community.”
“Elected officials need to interact with voters and I don’t think getting rid of that step would increase security,” he said.

Moreover, he worried that only allowing incumbents to bypass signature requirements would give them an inherent advantage in the election.
In a call with the Capital-Star, Scott defended his proposal. 
He said he didn’t believe that an incumbent skipping the signature-gathering process would have an advantage. 
 “The truth is, it’s gonna cost you more money and more time and energy,” Scott said of campaigns that skip the step.” Because those votes you would get — the people who go out and sign your petition are likely going to vote for you anyway. You still have to work for that, so it’s not like it’s a clear advantage.”
He also said, while the bill’s language is being finalized, he is considering including a provision that would bar a candidate who skips the petition process from challenging the petitions of other candidates.
A fourth bill would propose a constitutional amendment that would allow lawmakers to name three successors each in the event of their deaths, one of whom could be chosen by the House speaker to serve temporarily until a special election is held. 
As it stands, a lawmaker’s seat is held vacant after they die until a a special election is held and the winner is sworn-in.
That’s what happened after Pittsburgh-area Democratic Rep. Matt Gergely died in January, leaving his seat vacant — and control of the chamber effectively tied — until a special election was held in March.
In order for the Pennsylvania Constitution to be amended, lawmakers in both chambers must pass identical measures by majority vote in two consecutive sessions. Then, the amendment would have to be voted on by Pennsylvanians during an election. 
McGinley was also critical of this proposal, saying that allowing lawmakers to choose their own replacements was “undemocratic.”
“It reminds me of a monarchy sort of proposal,” he said. 
Scott, however, said that, in a state where partisan control of the House is separated by a single vote, allowing somebody from the same party to serve in the event of a legislator’s death would help ensure the will of the voters is enacted. 
He pointed to Minnesota, where, following the assassination of Hortman, the Democratic lawmaker, Republicans took control of what was previously an evenly split chamber.
“Let’s remove any type of incentive for an assassin to take one of us out, by saying, ‘This won’t shut down the chamber,’” Scott said. “We want to make sure government continues to operate and that those constituents still have a voice.”
He said he’s also considering a provision that would bar the temporary replacement from running in the special election.
Hensley-Robin, from Common Cause PA, noted that similar systems are in place in other countries. In elections for France’s National Assembly, for example, candidates’ potential replacements are on the ballot with them, in the case they become unable to serve.
“I think that would be an interesting way to approach this,” Hensley-Robin said. “It would be strengthened by having the names of their replacements right there on the primary and general election ballots for people to know who they’re voting for.”

(Photo by Kaveh Mowahed / KUNM News)New Mexico’s foster care, juvenile justice and child welfare programs have not made significant progress in the last six months toward complying with a landmark settlement agreement, a court-appointed arbitrator found this week.
The 2020 “Kevin S” settlement stems from a lawsuit filed two years prior against the Children, Youth and Families Department, along with the agency now called the Health Care Authority, which alleged state officials had failed to uphold their legal obligations to keep children in their custody safe.
Charles Peifer, the Albuquerque attorney appointed as the arbiter in the case, found in January that New Mexico failed to meet the settlement’s requirements. Then after hearing from both sides in July, Peifer on Monday issued a second order finding that the state still “has not made significant progress in its efforts to come into compliance” with the settlement’s terms.
Those terms include: hiring and properly training caseworkers to determine a child’s needs; finding foster families to care for them; and connecting children to services.
“The evidence and submissions provided to me establish that the State is preparing to make progress and has indeed obtained additional funding that will assist in future progress, but that, measured by outcomes for children, measurable and verifiable progress is lacking,” Peifer wrote. “Children and youth remain at imminent risk of harm and time is of the essence.”
The state Legislature in its most recent session created a new Office of the Child Advocate, attached administratively to the state Department of Justice, to provide more oversight of CYFD.

In a meeting on Tuesday with state lawmakers on the interim Legislative Health and Human Services Committee, Native American Disability Law Center Executive Director Therese Yanan, who represents one of the children in the initial lawsuit, said Monday’s order represents a measure of accountability for the state’s failures.
“This system is not working for our kids,” Yanan said. “We are also hoping that this committee and other committees can hold the state to account as well, because there needs to be some accountability.”
Dr. George Davis, a child and adolescent psychiatrist and former CYFD psychiatry director, said it’s impossible for the state to comply with the settlement so long as caseworkers are overworked, foster families turn over and children don’t receive the services they need.
Davis said many foster families withdrew from the system during the COVID-19 pandemic “and they have never, ever recuperated.” Even though the state brought on 134 new foster families in 2024, he said, approximately the same number left in the same period.
Without foster families to care for children, Davis said, authorities place them into either residential treatment centers or congregate facilities, which are “not a place to raise a child” and “not a substitute for foster care.”
“Beds are not what we need,” he said. “Families are what we need.”
Jesse Clifton, an attorney with Disability Rights New Mexico, which represented another plaintiff in the case, told the committee one of the main reasons his organization joined the lawsuit was New Mexico’s placement of children into residential and congregate settings, which he called “needless institutionalization of youth.” He said state officials continue to propose expanding congregate care in New Mexico, but doing so won’t solve the problem.
“It does stand to reason to expand that network of providers — especially if we’re not also making the same efforts and investments in community-based mental health services — that we’re going to see a return to that practice,” Clifton said.
Under Peifer’s order, CYFD and the HCA must make “continual and continuous progress” to comply with the settlement between now and Dec. 31. He will hold hearings in October and November to check their progress and will again determine whether they have complied in January.
A spokesperson for CYFD told Source NM on Wednesday that the agency is reviewing Peifer’s findings, compiling the requested data and will respond by the deadline imposed in the order.
“We are disappointed by these findings, some of which are troubling, but we intend to address them as best we can and continue improving the way in which we protect New Mexico children in vulnerable circumstances,” CYFD Deputy Director of Communications Jessica Preston said in a statement.

(Photo by Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images)This week, the Trump administration’s Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) announced an effort to check the immigration status of people who get their health insurance through Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program.
Medicaid is the public health insurance program for people with low incomes that’s jointly funded by states and the federal government. For families that earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to afford private insurance, CHIP is a public program that provides low-cost health coverage for their children.
The feds will begin sending states monthly enrollment reports that identify people with Medicaid or CHIP whose immigration or citizenship status can’t be confirmed through federal databases. States are then responsible for verifying the citizenship or immigration status of individuals in those reports. States are expected to take “appropriate actions when necessary, including adjusting coverage or enforcing non-citizen eligibility rules,” according to a CMS press release.
“We are tightening oversight of enrollment to safeguard taxpayer dollars and guarantee that these vital programs serve only those who are truly eligible under the law,” Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who oversees CMS as secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said in a press release announcing the new program.
As of April, roughly 71 million adults and children nationwide have Medicaid coverage, while another 7 million children have insurance through CHIP. Immigrants under age 65 are less likely to be covered by Medicaid than U.S.-born citizens, according to an analysis from health research organization KFF.
Immigrants who are in the country illegally aren’t eligible for federally funded Medicaid and CHIP. Only citizens and certain lawfully present immigrants — green card holders and refugees, for example — can qualify.
But some states have chosen to expand Medicaid coverage for immigrants with their own funds. Twenty-three states offer pregnancy-related care regardless of citizenship or immigration status, according to KFF. Fourteen states provide coverage for children in low-income families regardless of immigration status, while seven states offer coverage to some adults regardless of status.
The tax and spending package President Donald Trump last month cuts federal spending on Medicaid by more than $1 trillion, leaving states to either make up the difference with their own funds or reduce coverage. But the new law also includes restrictions on coverage for certain immigrants, including stripping eligibility from refugees and asylum-seekers.

The new provisions in Act 73 halt what had been an increasing amount of public tuition dollars from flowing to Vermont's religious schools. Legislators say that is a side effect, not the intent.

Since 2021, religious schools in Vermont have been receiving an increasing amount of money through Vermont’s school tuitioning program. But Act 73, Vermont’s wide-ranging education reform law signed into law in July, effectively halts that trend.
Last week, the state Agency of Education finalized a list of 18 private schools (called independent schools under state law) that remain eligible for the public tuition dollars under the new law’s provisions. Students who were already enrolled in ineligible schools prior to the law’s passing can continue receiving public dollars until they graduate. 
Vermont’s public tuition system allows families in districts without a public school for certain grades to use public dollars to send their children to public or private schools elsewhere.
Under the new law, however, private schools located in the state must now pass two tests to remain eligible for public funding: they must be located in a school district or supervisory union that does not operate a public school for some or all grades, and they must have had at least 25% of their student body from the 2023-24 school year funded by a Vermont public school district.
The provisions leave the 12 religious schools that last year received public tuition dollars ineligible for that funding. That includes Rice Memorial High School and Mount St. Joseph Academy, two prominent Catholic high schools based respectively in South Burlington and Rutland that, like others, have received an increasing share of public dollars since 2021.
To be sure, a very small percentage — about 100 students, or less than 4% — of the state’s roughly 3,000 students who used public funds for independent school tuition were going to religious schools. Meanwhile, a little over 2% of the $59,752,073 in education fund dollars that went to private schools in 2023-24 flowed to religious schools.
But the effect that Act 73’s eligibility requirements have on the state’s formerly eligible religious schools marks a departure from a trend seen in recent years that followed significant federal court rulings which bolstered the use of public tuition for religious schools.
In 2021, a federal appeals court judge ruled that three Vermont school districts could not exclude Catholic school students from the state’s tuition system.
Then, in 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Carson v. Makin held that Maine — which runs a similar tuition funding program to Vermont’s — could not award some parents a “public benefit,” specifically, tuition money, while in other cases “denying the benefit based on a recipient’s religious exercise.”
Since then, the number of religious schools receiving tuition has increased, as well as the amount of public funding flowing to them.
Rice Memorial High School received $644,385 in public tuition dollars for the 2023-24 school year, according to data provided by the Agency of Education, a more than 60% increase from the $386,925 in tuition dollars the school received during the 2022-23 school year.
Other prominent schools now ineligible for public funding include the Mid Vermont Christian School in Hartford, the Rutland Area Christian School and Mount St. Joseph Academy in Rutland. The latter received $395,250 in public tuition funds for the 2023-24 school year — a roughly $70,000 increase from the prior year.
VTDigger used information on schools’ websites to identify religious affiliation since the Agency of Education does not categorize schools as “religious.” Data for the 2024-25 school year was not available.
‘Non-religious criteria’
Now that that funding has been halted, questions remain over whether Vermont’s new independent school eligibility requirements, and their effect on religious schools, could be litigated.
Peter Teachout, a professor of law at Vermont Law School, said in an interview that the criteria around independent school eligibility is on solid footing regarding religious schools, at least based on the precedent set by the U.S. Supreme Court in the Carson v. Makin case.
The criteria that state lawmakers used in determining public tuition eligibility are religiously neutral, he said, and potential plaintiffs seeking legal action would need to prove these criteria were “somehow surrogates for excluding private, religious, independent schools.”
“That would have to be the argument: that in fact, the Legislature was seeking to exclude private, religious schools, and then it came up with non-religious criteria that would achieve that consequence,” he said. “That would be an extremely hard case to make, because the state is absolutely free to decide which independent schools get funding or don’t get funding, provided the criteria are not exclusively based on religion.”
Lawmakers who spoke to VTDigger said that the changes to funding for religious schools were a side effect of the policy changes enacted last session.
“The fact of the matter is what we implemented was really just a generally applicable standard to reflect continuing use of those schools that have served historically as public schools,” said Rep. Peter Conlon, D-Cornwall, the chair of the House Committee on Education who helped craft the final contours of Act 73.
Sen. Seth Bongartz, D-Bennington, the chair of the Senate Committee on Education, said he and others advocated for tuition dollars to continue to go to schools that “were integral to the delivery system” of education in Vermont.
Still, religious school officials said this will have an effect.
David Young, the superintendent of schools for the Diocese of Burlington, said the new eligibility requirements “certainly will hurt.” But he specifically took issue with the July 1 deadline imposed by lawmakers around independent school eligibility.
Young said the process around Act 73 feels “in disarray,” and noted that, while Act 73 immediately set requirements around the state’s tuitioning system, many aspects of the law remain unresolved.
As part of Act 73, Vermont’s School Redistricting Task Force has begun work to consolidate Vermont’s 118 school districts, contained within 51 supervisory districts or supervisory unions, into anywhere from 10 to 25 future districts.
“I just feel like it would have been better to say, ‘Let’s be clear on the procedures in the process. Let’s then set the date,'” he said. “If you’re going to draw these lines that encompass some of the larger districts in with others, you probably ought to understand that first before you upset the apple cart a little bit.”

Barrus in the Montana Department of Corrections rather than the state’s mental hospital.
Barrus was sentenced to three life sentences without the possibility of parole for his role in a drug- and alcohol-fueled, anti-government shooting spree in 2017 that left Broadwater County Deputy Mason Moore dead, Barrus’ son dead, while shooting at other law enforcement repeatedly after a high-speed chase across part of the state.

The shooting was notable because it involved multiple agencies and mixed Barrus’ long-held conspiracy theories with drugs and alcohol. During the original prosecution, the court found that Barrus was incapable of assisting in his own defense, and psychiatrists prescribed a treatment to restore his mental health.
When Barrus refused, district court Judge Kathy Seeley ordered him to comply with the treatment, which included medication, or be forcibly treated. After he complied, doctors a year later determined that he was stable and able to help in defense of the charges.
On Sept. 21, 2021, a jury returned a verdict of guilty on one count of deliberate homicide, and two counts of attempted deliberate homicide, and Seeley ordered him to prison on three life sentences without the possibility of parole.
However, Barrus and his attorney appealed the decision saying that he should have been sentenced to the care of the state Department of Public Health and Human Services where he would be under psychiatric care.
In a unanimous decision on Tuesday, the Montana Supreme Court ruled that Barrus should remain in the care of the Montana Department of Corrections, which includes prison instead of the state’s mental hospital. Montana Supreme Court Justice Cory Swanson recused himself from participating in the case because he was the Broadwater County Attorney at the time and prosecuted Barrus.
  The meaning of ‘appreciate’ 

The decision the state’s highest and only appellate court had before it wasn’t simply confirming whether Barrus suffers from any psychiatric condition — something well established by the original trial. Instead, in order for the Supreme Court to make a decision on whether he should have been sentenced to the state mental hospital, it must consider whether Barrus, at the time of the crime, could appreciate the criminal repercussions he could face for his actions.
The judges determined that because the violent shooting spree began with anti-government rants and plans, and because he knew that drugs and alcohol could exacerbate his mental condition, that Barrus understood the consequences of his actions, even remarking after he had been apprehended that he wished that law enforcement agents would have shot him, effectuating a suicide-by-cop.
Even during his trip to jail, Barrus seemed to indicate he understood the gravity of the situation, according to court documents.
He told deputies that he wanted to be hung, “like the old vigilantes,” at one point asking, “Why don’t you guys shoot people anymore?”
He said he would rather be executed than “hanging around a bunch of god—n criminals.”
It wasn’t Barrus’ first time confronting law enforcement, and it wasn’t the first time he’d been in a shoot-out. In 2000, court records show that Barrus and one of his other sons, Jeffrey, had led a high-speed vehicle chase with a shoot-out and stand-off with law enforcement in the Mojave Desert. Both he and his son were charged with multiple felonies. Barrus served time in California from then until 2013, and had maintained a clean record after being released from prison.
That changed on the night of May 16, 2017. Barrus told his family that “all police should be hung (sic),” and warned his grandchildren against brainwashing by teachers, according to the court documents. He encouraged his son to help against the government, and ordered his son’s girlfriend to delete texts on her phone.
After heavy drinking, Barrus talked of a “suicide mission” and signed a copy of a manifesto, “We the People or Them the Government?” He drove a Chevrolet Suburban along with his son, Marshall, when they stopped in Townsend to get beer and gas in the early morning hours. Shortly after, they passed Moore at speeds in excess of 100 mph.
After a brief chase, Barrus slowed, apparently to allow Moore to get within range of Marshall’s rifle, according to court documents. Moore was struck in the face and he struggled to keep control of the vehicle. For three minutes in his squad car, which had left the highway, Moore attempted to get free and get help. That’s when Barrus and his son returned. The video footage captured Marshall yelling, shots being fired, then the Barruses fleeing.
Moore was found with tire tracks near his car and spent .308 shell casings. He was pronounced dead at the scene.
Later that morning, the father-son duo were brought to a stop approximately 120 miles away, west of Drummond on Interstate 90, even after driving on the rims of the wheels at 70 mph while shooting. Officers from four different counties were able to stop Barrus, but not without a volley of gunfire, which had managed to disable two other patrol vehicles.

The Supreme Court outlined the details of the grisly shoot-out, emphasizing Barrus’ understanding and knowledge of the situation, which lasted hours:	
    
“As the driver of the Suburban, Barrus returned to Deputy Moore’s stopped vehicle to allow Marshall to eliminate Deputy Moore as a witness so that his son was not charged with attempted murder — a rationale that suggests a recognition of legal consequences, strategic reasoning, and an understanding of their actions…Upon his surrender to law enforcement Barrus remained cogent and articulated the preceding events and his participation in them, including an expressed awareness that he had transgressed the laws of Montana, and that the state would inevitably prosecute him for his actions.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/GettyImages-1185364093-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-20 18:57:13.288984

(Getty Images)Idaho reported the state’s third measles case in the last two weeks, after not reporting any infections this year during a national surge. 
Health officials say they don’t know of a link between the new measles case in Bonner County reported Wednesday and a separate case reported last week in Kootenai County, which are both in North Idaho. That means measles is likely spreading more, said Dr. Christine Hahn, Idaho’s state epidemiologist.
“Without any link between these two confirmed cases in north Idaho or travel outside of their communities, it’s reasonable to suspect that there is more measles circulating,” Hahn said in a statement. “As we’ve seen with other states around the nation, cases can begin to multiply quickly.” 
Idaho’s three measles cases are all in unvaccinated children. Vaccination is the best way to prevent measles, which is highly contagious and usually leads to hospitalization for one in five children younger than 5 years old who are infected. 
Last week, eastern Idaho health officials confirmed a measles case in Bonneville County. But officials said they didn’t think the public was exposed. 
In both regions of Idaho that have seen measles cases this year, the infections are the first reported in more than three decades and came shortly after early signs of the virus locally. Idaho hasn’t reported local measles cases since 2023, when an outbreak in southwest Idaho led to 10 infections.
The U.S. is experiencing the worst outbreak of measles in decades. This year, health officials have confirmed 1,375 measles cases across 41 states by Tuesday, according to the Centers for Disease Control, or CDC. About 13% of measles cases in the U.S. this year led to hospitalizations, the CDC reports.

 Officials encourage people to verify vaccination records

Measles is highly contagious but rare. Up to 90% of non-immune people in contact with an infected person can become infected. The virus can live in the air up to two hours after someone infected leaves.
Symptoms typically appear seven to 14 days after exposure and include high fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and a distinctive rash, the CDC says. While many recover without problems, measles can lead to serious complications, especially in very young children and people with weakened immune systems.
Health officials encourage people to verify their family’s vaccination records with their primary care provider or through the Docket App. A person is considered immune if they were born before Jan. 1, 1957, have a documented history of laboratory-confirmed measles or have documentation that they received both doses of the MMR vaccine. 
Idaho has a spotty record for measles vaccinations, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
The virus’s serious complications can include pneumonia, encephalitis (an inflammation of the brain) and, in rare cases, death.
People with measles symptoms should not enter health care settings without calling ahead, and they should contact their health care providers. People exposed to measles should monitor for symptoms for 21 days after exposure.
There is no antiviral treatment for measles, according to the CDC.

(Main photo courtesy of the University of Iowa; form courtesy of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security)The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is seeking the dismissal of a lawsuit filed by University of Iowa students who fear they’ve been targeted for deportation.
The federal agency argues that it has complied with court orders in the case by reversing a decision in April to alter the students’ status within the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System — a move that could have paved the way for deportation.
By reversing course, the agency’s lawyers argue, Homeland Security has rendered the lawsuit moot. The plaintiffs, they argue in their motion to dismiss the case, “have obtained the relief they originally sought. There is nothing more for the court to do.”
In their motion, lawyers for Homeland Security acknowledge the judge in the case, when responding to a different motion, had previously ruled that “actions compelled by court order are not actions that moot a case.”
Attorneys for the students have yet to respond to the motion to dismiss. The students’ attorney, Katherine Melloy Goettel, declined to comment on the matter. A hearing in the case is scheduled for Aug. 27.
Judge has rejected prior requests from DHS
In April 2025, the three UI international students and one international-student graduate sued DHS for wrongful termination of their student status, which they alleged caused irreparable stress and anxiety due to fear of imminent seizure and deportation.
On May 15, 2025, a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction requiring DHS to maintain the plaintiffs’ status as students in its Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) records. The judge also ordered DHS to add to the records a notation of active student status that would be backdated to the date the agency had terminated that status — ensuring that other entities wouldn’t act on the termination and attempt to deport the students on that basis.
On June 12, 2025, DHS filed a motion seeking to revise the injunction. The department argued that due to technological limitations with SEVIS records, the system did not allow the creation of written notations that would be visible to other users of the system, such as schools and employers, outside of DHS.
DHS asked that the court issue a ruling indicating it had fulfilled the requirements of the injunction, while also arguing the injunction was overbroad and amounted to a prohibition against any sort of prosecution for crimes the students might commit.
Noting that DHS had made no assertions as to what, if any, efforts had been made to remedy the claimed technological limitations within SEVIS, U.S. District Court Judge Rebecca Goodgame Ebinger denied DHS’ motion to revise her order.
With regard to DHS’ claim that the injunction bars future criminal prosecutions, Ebinger noted that her order does not apply to state, county, or local law enforcement acting separately from DHS and not at DHS’ instruction.
Also, she ruled, the injunction “prevents neither arrests nor the commencement of prosecutions. Rather, as to the plaintiffs — four individual people whom the court previously found to be likely to succeed on their claims of unfounded and harmful status record interference — the court’s order requires advance notice to the court as part of defendants’ due process efforts. The order does not prohibit law enforcement actions.”
DHS officials describe Student Criminal Alien Initiative
As part of their recent request for a dismissal of the lawsuit, attorneys for Homeland Security provided the court with a sworn statement from Akil Baldwin, the acting assistant director of the National Security Division of Homeland Security Investigations within the department.
In his statement, Baldwin said he oversees the Student Exchange Visitor Program “in support of ICE efforts to identify, disrupt and dismantle transnational criminal enterprises and terrorist organizations.” He said the four UI students’ criminal histories — which, according to the students’ attorney, are limited to misdemeanor-level offenses such as drunken driving — led to the revocation of their student visas.
The process, he said in his statement, began when Homeland Security Investigations, or HSI, launched what he called the Student Criminal Alien Initiative.
As part of that initiative, he said, HSI obtained access to the federal criminal database maintained by the National Crime Information Center to determine “whether any nonimmigrant students had criminal records.”
HSI then sent its findings to the U.S. Department of State “to take action as it deemed appropriate,” Baldwin said. The Department of State then revoked “some nonimmigrant student visas with an NCIC record,” Baldwin stated.
Then, at the Department of State’s request, HSI terminated the SERVIS records of those students who now had no valid student visa. In April, amid a flurry of litigation related to its actions, Homeland Security reversed course and began restoring the students’ SEVIS records to “active” status.
During a District of Columbia court hearing in April, Homeland Security’s assistant director for national security, Andre Watson, discussed the agency’s Student Criminal Alien Initiative.
Watson testified as to how 10 to 20 ICE employees spent several weeks combing through the records of 1.3 million holders of student visas to determine whether any of them might have had some form of interaction with law enforcement, such as a traffic violation that was later dismissed.
An exasperated D.C. District Court Judge Ana C. Reyes asked Watson, “Are you telling me that with all of the cost cutting that we have going on right now — because apparently we’re spending too much money in the federal government doing things like, oh, I don’t know, funding cancer research, can’t afford to do that — that we had, not ‘we,’ but ‘someone,’ had 10 to 20 federal employees spend their time going name by name in a database to see what hits they got for 1.3 million people? Is that what happened? Yes or no.”
“Yes,” Watson replied. He explained that of the 1.3 million student names, less than half of 1%, or roughly 6,400 student names, were passed on to the State Department. The State Department then revoked visas to travel into the United States for 3,000 of those students, and then told Homeland Security to terminate those students’ status in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System.
After hearing from Watson, Judge Reyes cited what she called the federal government’s “utter lack of concern for human individuals who we have invited into our country and who have (made) communities richer by being students who have contributed to our colleges and who have paid our colleges.”

(Photo by Nancy Lavin/Rhode Island Current)Staring down an estimated $1.1 million budget gap resulting from congressional defunding, Rhode Island’s recently merged public media entity is cutting staff — first on a volunteer basis, and later, potentially through layoffs.
Pam Johnston, CEO of Rhode Island PBS and The Public’s Radio, notified employees of cuts in a staff meeting Wednesday. The internal announcement was followed up with a statement published on the company’s website shortly after. 
Citing the “significant and painful cut” prompted by the federal rescission package, which eliminated federal support for public broadcasting, Johnston said the company will be offering voluntary buyouts to “most” staff members. If not enough workers take the offer by the Sept. 5 deadline, the next step is organizationwide layoffs, according to the email.
Meg Geoghegan, a spokesperson for the company, referred to Johnston’s email when asked for comment.
The news comes less than two years after the premiere state media organizations announced plans to merge, pooling talent and resources. The merger was approved by state and federal regulators in the spring of 2024, with Johnston, a Massachusetts broadcast veteran, brought on to lead the newly created company in July 2024. At the time of the merger application, the company said it would have roughly 100 employees.
An updated staffing number for the newly christened Ocean State Media was not immediately available.
Nationwide, public media outlets have been grappling with the fallout of federal funding cuts, which have provided a key source of money to public radio and broadcasting stations for nearly 60 years. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting announced it would be closing its doors by the end of the year due to eliminated federal funding.
In Rhode Island, the estimated $1.1 million cut represents 10% of the public media entity’s combined operating budget, according to news reports.
“We have scrutinized our budget and reduced expenses wherever possible while navigating the complexities of our merger,” Johnston wrote in the email sent to staffers. “We’ve also received an outpouring of support from our community and have hosted two of our most successful pledge drives ever. Despite these efforts, it is not enough to close the financial gap.”
Staffing cuts will not affect programming until further evaluation of the remaining workforce, Johnston said.
“This federal funding cut happened to us; we have no choice but to respond,” she said. “As I have said before, this moment will change us, but it will not stop us. Despite these challenging times, we will continue evolving, adapting, and innovating. Our audiences, who rely on us for trusted local news and information, expect nothing less.”

Five famous Floridians who identified as Sunshine State residents, including musician Jimmy Buffet, were awarded the Governor’s Medal of Freedom Wednesday.
In addition, Gov. Ron DeSantis bestowed the medal upon the late Democratic Govs. Bob Graham and Buddy MacKay Jr.,  South Florida Congressman Lincoln Díaz-Balart, and former Florida State University President John Thrasher.
“I’m proud to recognize the legacies of these great Floridians,” DeSantis said. “Our state is better for their contributions, and we’re proud they called Florida home. They have each earned the honor of being awarded the Governor’s Medal of Freedom.”
Buffet wasn’t born in Florida but had a strong connection to the state, living here for many years. He was active in conservation efforts, including performing in 2015 at the Florida Capitol at an Everglades Coalition rally. 
Buffet died in 2023; the Florida Legislature designated A1A, the road that meanders along Florida’s eastern coast, “Jimmy Buffett Memorial Highway.”
Buffet was friends with fellow honoree Graham, a Democrat born in Coral Gables who served as governor from 1979-1987 and as U.S. senator from 1987-2005. After retiring from the Senate, he remained active in public policy and civic education, giving back to his alma mater, the University of Florida, through the Bob Graham Center for Public Service. Graham died in April 2024.
MacKay served as governor for less than a month following Gov. Lawton Chiles’ death and is the second Democratic politico who received the medal. Mackay, who died in January, was the last Democrat to serve as governor in Florida, marking the bridge between two political eras. He had just lost to Jeb Bush in the 1998 governor’s race when Chiles died in December of that year.
MacKay was just two years removed from a bid for the U.S. Senate that he narrowly lost to Connie Mack when he became Chiles’ running mate. Part of Mack’s signature line against MacKay was, “Hey, Buddy you’re a liberal.”
The Governor’s Medal of Freedom was established in 2020 under Section 14.35, Florida Statutes, which allows the governor to recognize any person who has made an especially meritorious contribution to the interests and citizens of the state, its culture, or other significant public or private endeavor.
Attorney and Republican politician Díaz-Balart was born in Havana, Cuba. He served in the U.S. House for 18 years and authored key pieces of legislation including provisions of the Cuban Liberty (Libertad) Act which codified the U.S. embargo against the Cuban dictatorship in 1996. 
He also co-founded the Congressional Hispanic Leadership Institute in 2003 to help advance economic opportunities for the Hispanic community in Washington, D.C., and across the country. Before Congress, he served in the Florida House and Senate. He died in March 2025.
Thrasher was president of FSU from 2014 through 2021, the culmination of a lengthy career that began with him lobbying for the Florida Medical Association and eventually led him to serve in both chambers of the Florida Legislature. Thrasher, born in South Carolina but raised in Jacksonville, was speaker of the House for his last two years in the chamber.

A federal judge has cleared the way for Vermont’s ECFiber broadband network to transition to a new operator, issuing an order aimed at ensuring stability of service for its roughly 10,000 rural customers.
ECFiber and its current operator, Great Works Internet or GWI, have traded several legal blows over their contract in recent months. GWI filed a suit in March against ECFiber board chair F.X. Flinn, accusing him of spying on the company and attempting to poach its employees in a plot to replace it. ECFiber moved for a preliminary injunction in June, seeking to force GWI to comply with a transition policy it said the operator was resisting. 
The Aug. 11 decision from Judge Mary Kay Lanthier dictated that GWI must comply with certain transitional measures, but also limited what the communications union district could require of its current operator before the switch to the new provider on Jan. 1. At that time, the Vermont ISP Operating Company, or VISPO — a new nonprofit created by members of ECFiber’s board — will take over the network’s operations. 
While GWI is not required to train VISPO employees or share confidential practices, the court ordered the company to provide access to infrastructure and management systems for representatives of the district.

Granting the injunction reflects the court’s belief that a smooth transition between operators is crucial to avoid harm to the public, Lanthier’s decision states. For many in ECFiber’s service area, the only alternative to the broadband network would be Digital Subscriber Line — or DSL — internet, which runs along telephone lines and provides much slower speeds for sending and receiving information. 
Although the parties to the suit describe the events of the last six months very differently, one thing they all agree on is that it’s expensive to provide internet to rural areas in Vermont. That’s why communications union districts — municipal bodies with the ability to fund fiber network infrastructure — were formed.
“Nobody else is serving them,” said Christine Hallquist, executive director of the Vermont Community Broadband Board, which was created in 2021 to advance the goal of universal, high-quality broadband access across the state.

Areas only covered by DSL are considered underserved by the state of Vermont. And even in places where other options exist, some locals say ECFiber is far better than the alternatives.
Holly Lague, the director of libraries in Thetford, said a lack of access to ECFiber’s broadband services would be a “huge hurdle” for the services she provides. Though other providers reach the area, she said she’s heard concerning reports that their services suffer from a lack of reliability and quality.
“I would probably panic,” Lague said.
But Hallquist said the community broadband board had a “high level of confidence” that ECFiber’s network will continue to operate smoothly through the transition, though acknowledged the possibility of “a lot of strain” on staff and board members.
The injunction, Hallquist said, provides a clear path through differences of opinion for the switch to happen.
“The law ruled in favor of ECFiber,” she said. “It really is that simple.”
GWI argued in court that VISPO would not be adequately prepared to step into its new role come January, citing concerns about the new organization’s experience and staffing levels.  
Gopi Sundaram, the newly appointed CEO of VISPO, declined to comment on his company’s operational progress. The nonprofit’s board chair, Alessandro Iuppa, said there was “no question in my mind” regarding VISPO’s ability to take on the ECFiber operations.

However, S&P Global released a report in May revising ECFiber’s rating outlook to “negative,” based largely on risks associated with the district’s transition to an untested operator. 
Scott Sagen, the primary analyst for the report, said the risks lay in the new operator’s lack of experience and an absence of employed staff in May. The outlook revision translates roughly to a 1-in-3 chance that Sagen’s company could downgrade the district’s rating for the municipal revenue bonds it might issue in the future, he said. ECFiber has used this type of bond before to help finance its construction efforts.
“We just felt like the plan change in 2026 could present additional operational challenges that could potentially weaken financial metrics,” Sagen said.
A downgrade wouldn’t be good, Flinn said, but it wouldn’t be an existential threat. The district doesn’t have specific plans to borrow more money in this way at the moment, he said, and when ECFiber issued unrated bonds with a higher interest rate in the past, they made it work financially.
In the Aug. 11 decision, Lanthier wrote that the court could not reasonably draw a conclusion on VISPO’s readiness, and that the court’s focus was ensuring a smooth transition to the new operator.
The decision came during a moment of uncertainty at GWI, during which Mac Mountain, a Vermont-based broadband investment company, exercised warrants for control of the internet service provider. 
According to an Aug. 14 Federal Communications Commission Filing by Mac Mountain, which holds a controlling interest in GWI, the move was prompted by an “emergency situation.” Several company officers, per the filing, fired a number of senior employees without notice, stopped paying some vendors, and planned to file for bankruptcy, among other actions with which Mac Mountain took issue.
Those officers are no longer employed at the company, said Alex Rozek, CEO of Mac Mountain and owner of GWI. There is also a new board of directors. 
Rozek said he had no doubts about the company’s stability. GWI’s former leadership did not respond to requests for comment.
Tom Cecere, a longtime manager at GWI, did not comment on the reasoning behind the decisions of previous leadership. 
“It had nothing to do with an immediate cash problem,” he said.
Cecere resigned from his position at GWI in the chaos preceding Mac Mountain’s takeover before returning to work the following week. Now, he said, the financial situation at GWI is stable, even with the impending loss of the ECFiber contract.
The company still has agreements with Northwest Fiberworx and DVFiber, two other Vermont communications union districts.
Rozek said he considers the transition “very risky” for the stability and financial health of the communications district. 
In response to criticisms from the district that GWI has an interest in keeping hold of the ECFiber contract, Rozek said the operator’s employees “also all live here, and have a vested interest in having the internet.”
In July, GWI posted an open letter to ECFiber customers detailing concerns around the district’s transparency, and VISPO’s preparedness. Flinn called the operator’s messaging on the transition “a campaign to create fear, uncertainty and doubt.”
Hallquist reaffirmed her confidence in ECFiber’s operation, and said that if it became necessary, her board could step in. 
“We will make sure people do not lose service,” she said.

DemasA Republican bill to ban ranked choice voting in the state of Michigan, which was introduced in the House of Representatives last month and rammed through committee on Tuesday after just one hearing, was passed in the lower chamber Wednesday with opposition from the chamber’s Democrats.
House Bill 4707, sponsored by state Rep. Rachelle Smit (R-Martin), would ban the voting method if signed into law. The measure passed 55-44 with nine members of the House not voting.
Each vote affirming the passage of the bill came from a Republican member of the House, while each no vote came from the chamber’s Democrats. Eight Democrats and just one Republican – state Rep. Phill Green of Watertown Township – did not vote on the bill.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In a statement following the bill’s passage, Smit said her years as a township clerk taught her that clear, straightforward election rules were “the only way to maintain public trust.”
“Ranked Choice Voting, with its rounds of counting and reallocation, only breeds skepticism – especially when every close contest invites lawsuits and recount battles,” Smit said. “Michigan doesn’t need ballot-box gymnastics. We need integrity, clarity, and confidence, which are all qualities Ranked Choice Voting cannot deliver.”

The voting method allows voters to rank candidates for a position based on preference, rather than casting a ballot for a single candidate. It has been floated as an option to break up partisan gridlock and the grip of the two-party duopoly in American politics, but it gained further traction this year after the primary win of New York Democrat Zohran Mamdani, who became that party’s nominee for New York City mayor in an upset of former Gov. Andrew Cuomo. The city uses ranked choice to select its mayoral primary candidates.
Smit acknowledged during a Tuesday hearing of the House Elections Integrity Committee that the law could likely be overturned at the ballot box next year if an initiative to institute ranked choice voting is affirmed by voters.
Some Michigan cities adopted measures to introduce the method in local elections, but existing state law has kept those plans from taking root. The Rank MI Vote initiative would make that method the law of the land for all statewide and federal elections.
Still, Smit and House Republicans said it would cause chaos for clerks and introduce confusion into an elections system that Republicans have – and without evidence – accused of being rife with fraud and irregularities.
“This may sound interesting in theory – but in practice, it’s a logistical nightmare,” Smit said. “Ranked Choice Voting creates serious confusion at the ballot box. Studies and real-world elections have shown that Ranked Choice Voting disproportionately impacts minority voters and those who don’t vote in every election. Instead of empowering voters, Ranked Choice Voting risks silencing them. It doesn’t strengthen democracy; it weakens it. Ranked Choice Voting has no place in Michigan.”
Smit advocated for the bill’s passage on the House floor Wednesday, as did Republican state Rep. Ann Bollin of Brighton and state Rep. Josh Schriver of Oxford.

Rising to oppose the bill in a floor speech was Democratic state Rep. Penelope of East Lansing.
“When somebody talks about banning something that is already banned, you have to ask, ‘what else is going on?’” Tsernoglou said. “I ask what those who believe rank choice voting violates these principles would say to the number of jurisdictions here in Michigan, where when left to the voters, a majority of the voters in those communities decided that they wanted to use ranked choice voting for their local elections. When communities across Michigan decide through their own ballots that they want ranked choice voting, that should be the end of the conversation.”

Earlier this year, lawmakers passed House Bill 137 to establish the Strategic Water Supply, which includes $40 million to treat salty waters in aquifers and alleviate the stress from climate change shrinking rivers and depleting freshwater supplies in aquifers.
The bill represented a slimmed-down version of the project touted by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, which would have included efforts to treat wastewater from oil and gas projects and had a half-a-billion dollar price tag.
Leadership at the Office of the State Engineer and the New Mexico Environment Department, which manages the program, told lawmakers at the legislative Water and Natural Resources Committee meeting this week in Las Cruces that the $40 million will exclusively be used for grants for local governments or contracts with private companies.
“The goals for the program are to encourage communities to be able to withstand that potential future of less water supply available, and to allow them to diversify supplies that they have amongst service water, groundwater, recycled water elements,” said Deputy State Engineer Tanya Trujillo.
While no specific projects have been put forward, cities like Eunice are increasingly looking to desalination to increase water supplies.
For desalination to work, some of the water may have to be treated for more than just salt, in order to address contaminants such as arsenic or uranium. As part of the new initiative, the state is undertaking a yearslong process to determine the shape, size and quality of New Mexico’s aquifers. Researchers at New Mexico State University, in partnership with the environment department, the New Mexico Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources and private owners say they have thus far sampled water from 19 aquifers to test for quality.
Pei Xu, one of the NMSU researcher in the civil engineering department, said further research will be needed.“The challenges and opportunities of developing brackish water is understanding the quantity and the quality of the water aquifers,” Xu said.
Officials said they would have feasibility studies to compare the costs of any proposed projects for treating brackish water with benefits to the community or impacts on the environment.
“We don’t want a science experiment,” Deputy Cabinet Secretary John Rhoderick told lawmakers. “We want results.”
Rhoderick said he anticipates requests for grant funding will “greatly outstrip” the $40 million allocated by the Legislature, and said the departments would likely seek further funding in the 2026 session.
Rep. Patricia Roybal Caballero (D-Albuquerque) asked how the push to install expensive infrastructure for desalination is being balanced with cheaper policy options to conserve water.
Rhoderick and Trujillo said an “all of the above approach” is necessary.
“Nothing is more apparent than the reality that the only way we solve water problems in New Mexico is by utilizing 100 different methods,” Rhoderick said. “There is no one-size-fits-all solution.”

State House Speaker Rep. Phillip DeVillier, R-Eunice, has asked lawmakers to keep their schedule flexible between Oct. 23 and Nov. 13, which is just days after the Supreme Court justices are scheduled to hear arguments in Louisiana v. Callais, a case that could lead to the overturning of Louisiana’s congressional maps. 
Rep. Beau Beaullieu, R-New Iberia, chairman of the House and Governmental Affairs Committee that oversees redistricting, said the speaker wants lawmakers to be available in case they need to take action in response to the court’s ruling. A decision is not expected until months after arguments, perhaps as late as June of next year, prompting some lawmakers to call the planning premature. 
“First of all, there can’t even be a special session until the courts rule,” Rep. Jack McFarland, R-Jonesboro, said, “and if they don’t rule in October, then why would you have a special session?” 
DeVillier did not respond to a request for comment. 
Several lawmakers interviewed for this report said they believed calls to prepare for a special session come from Gov. Jeff Landry, rather than legislative leaders. 
Landry spokeswoman Kate Kelly declined to comment. 
The jump to tackle redistricting is in line with other states with Republican governors and party majorities in their legislatures that have announced their intent to draw new districts that favor Republicans ahead of the 2026 congressional midterm elections. 
Rep. Edmond Jordan, D-Baton Rouge, chairman of the Louisiana Legislative Black Caucus, said not only would it be too soon to hold a special redistricting session without a Supreme Court ruling, it would also be disingenuous. He referenced a separate redistricting lawsuit, Nairne v. Louisiana, in which Black voters sued over new state House and Senate maps that did not increase the number of majority Black districts despite an increase in Louisiana’s Black population percentage. 
A U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals panel upheld a district judge’s ruling that found the maps violated the Voting Rights Act, but the state won’t have to update until the outcome of the Callais case is determined. 
“I think if we’re going to [ask for a] stay on the state court case pending the ruling of the Supreme Court in the federal court case, it seems to make sense that we would hold off on the congressional maps pending the decision of the Supreme Court,” Jordan said. 
In the Callais case, in which non-Black voters sued over the creation of a second majority-Black congressional district, the Supreme Court has indicated it will consider the constitutionality of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. Its provisions prohibit actions and policies that restrict a person’s right to vote based on their race, color or membership in a language minority group.
Justices were expected to rule on the case in the spring. But in a rare move, they scheduled additional arguments in October. The delay meant not only that a new congressional map, if necessary, would not be in place until the 2028 election, but that the legislature would be delayed in crafting new state House and Senate districts. 
“They want to slow roll this and take full advantage of these unconstitutional maps,” Jordan said, referring to the legislative district maps. “But then, when it comes to try to implement maps that are constitutional, that would be fair and just for African Americans in this state, they want to slow roll it and play judicial games with us.” 
“We’re not naive about this,” Jordan added. “We’re certainly cognizant of what’s happening and … voters in Louisiana need to wake up and pay attention to what’s happening.”

Dan McKee took to the Rhode Island State House Wednesday afternoon for a ceremonial signing of two bills he approved nearly two months ago that will expand Rhode Island’s Temporary Caregiver Insurance (TCI) — the state’s form of paid family leave.
McKee may have waited to celebrate the bills, but Rhode Islanders will also have to wait to enjoy the new law’s benefits, as they don’t kick in until Jan. 1, 2027. The perks include gradually raising TCI’s weekly income replacement from 60% to 70% of a worker’s usual wages. The wage replacement will rise again to 75% of full weekly income on Jan. 1, 2028. 
The legislation also increases the taxable wage base for Temporary Disability Insurance — TCI’s funding source — from $38,000 to $100,000 to boost the program’s solvency. 
The new law builds on legislation approved last year that lengthened paid family leave from six to seven weeks. That law went into effect on Jan. 1, and starting Jan. 1, 2026, qualifying workers will be eligible for a full eight weeks. By the time the 2025 legislation goes into effect, workers will be able to enjoy a full eight weeks of benefits, with the income replacement calculated by a formula based on a worker’s highest quarter of earnings.
“By expanding paid family leave, we are reinforcing the message that workers in Rhode Island should not have to choose between their paycheck and their family,” McKee said in a statement. “This expansion of the wage replacement rate helps us stay competitive and a national leader on this issue.”
McKee first OK’d the legislation on June 26, shortly after the end of the 2025 legislative session, when the bills sponsored by Senate President Valarie Lawson, an East Providence Democrat, and Rep. Joshua Giraldo, a Central Falls Democrat, passed both chambers. Lawson and Giraldo joined McKee, advocates, and labor leaders Wednesday for the signing ceremony.
In 2013, Rhode Island became the third state in the nation to offer paid parental leave — an amenity that’s common in other wealthy countries, but not in the United States. Neighboring states Connecticut and Massachusetts both provide benefits for longer than Rhode Island does — up to 12 weeks — but use more complex payment formulas.
Connecticut benefits are tied to the state minimum wage and max out at $981 a week, replacing up to 95% of weekly pay for lower earners. Massachusetts calculates benefits based on the “state average weekly wage” for a maximum benefit around $1,170 a week. In Rhode Island, benefits are currently capped at $1,103 weekly. 
Lawson echoed McKee and said in a statement the legislation will help Rhode Island catch up in temporary leave benefits after having “fallen behind other states.” 
“A society in which people have the time to bond with their babies and care for their loved ones is a healthier society, in every sense of the word,” Lawson said. “This proven program is funded not through employers but through a modest assessment on the workers themselves.” 
Giraldo said in his own statement that “the gift of time that TCI provides is priceless,” given his own experiences caring for his prematurely born daughter.
Lawson and Giraldo also sponsored the bills approved last year that expanded the amount of time workers were eligible for paid leave. The successful versions of these bills followed an initial push for 12 weeks of benefits, which was eventually whittled down to the model now in effect. 
The newly approved legislation does, however, accomplish a goal left unfulfilled from last year’s efforts, by adding siblings to the roster of eligible family members for which workers can take paid leave.  
Rhode Island’s paid family leave is funded entirely through payroll deductions and allows workers to take time to bond with a new child or care for an ill family member, such as a parent, spouse, domestic partner, grandparent, sibling, or in-law. Eligible workers include people who earn their income in Rhode Island, pay into the TDI fund, and make at least $18,000 annually, or meet an alternate threshold. 
According to a legislative press release when the bills passed in June, workers making up to $89,200 will see no increase in contributions. A person making a salary of $100,000 would see a weekly increase of about $2.70 a week.
Full details about the program, including applications, are available on the Department of Labor and Training’s website.

Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte made a criminal referral to the Department of Justice on Wednesday, accusing Cook of falsifying bank documents and property records “to acquire more favorable loan terms,” for properties in Ann Arbor, Michigan and Atlanta, Georgia.
Former President Joe Biden, a Democrat, nominated Cook to fill an empty seat on the board in 2022. She is the first Black woman to serve on the board of governors. She was confirmed for an additional, full term in 2023, with her tenure set to expire on Jan. 31, 2038. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Before she was appointed to the board, Cook was a professor of economics and international relations at Michigan State University as well as a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research. She was previously on the faculty for Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government. 
Cook also served as a senior economist on the Council of Economic Advisers under Democratic former President Barack Obama from 2011 to 2012. She served as a senior adviser on finance and development in the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of International Affairs from 2000 to 2001.
Chelsea Grate, media relations assistant for the board, said they did not have anything to share when asked for comment. 
The allegations against Cook have emerged amidst Trump’s ongoing feud with the Fed’s Chair, Jerome Powell, with the president pressuring Powell to resign over his refusal to lower interest rates.  
Pulte has also made referrals against New York Attorney General Letitia James, who secured a $464 million fraud judgment against Trump for misrepresenting his assets in financial statements, and Sen.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Florida’s new second-in-command is headed to California to extradite a man who was driving a semi-truck in Florida and allegedly caused an accident that resulted in three people dead. 
Lt. Gov. Jay Collins and Gov. Ron DeSantis said Wednesday that Collins will to to California to “ensure” Harjinder Singh, an immigrant from India without permanent legal status “is extradited back to Florida.”
Garnering national headlines over the weekend, including a dashcam video the White House responded to on social media. Singh is seen attempting a U-Turn on the Florida Turnpike in St. Lucie County in an “official use only” turning lane, blocking traffic. The video shows a minivan with three people inside crashing into the truck. 
“Today I’m sending Florida’s new Lt. Gov. Jay Collins to California and tomorrow morning he is going to take possession of this illegal alien, extradite him back to the state of Florida, and we’re going to throw the book at him when he gets back here for what he did, so you can count on that,” DeSantis said during a news conference Wednesday afternoon.
According to DeSantis, once it was determined that Singh could’ve committed a crime, federal authorities “were able to provide pretty much the whole dossier on this guy.”
The information included, DeSantis said, that Singh entered the country in 2018 through the U.S.=Mexico border and applied for work authorization in 2020, was rejected, then accepted in 2021.

Day in court
The Modesto Bee reported Wednesday that Singh signed extradition papers Tuesday, giving Florida 30 days to take him into custody. Singh had a fugitive warrant and appeared in San Joaquin Superior Court in Stockton, the Bee reported. 
“Dressed in an orange jail jumpsuit Tuesday, Singh stood before Judge John Soldati and was assisted by an interpreter. He confirmed he understood his rights, and the judge appointed a public defender to represent him. Singh then signed extradition forms, which Soldati also signed, starting the process for Florida authorities to take custody,” the Bee reported. 
According to DeSantis, Singh obtained a commercial driver’s license from the state of Washington, then used that license to obtain a commercial license in California. 
Singh “abysmally failed” an English test conducted in the past few days, DeSantis said. 
“Not even close, not even broken English, like this guy did not know English and yet somehow he was given a CDL by Washington and a CDL by the state of California, and that should not have happened,” DeSantis said. 
The company Singh worked for, White Hawk Carriers, is no longer permitted to operate outside of California after losing its insurance, the Bee reported. 
“The company put him in there. Did the company not look to see whether he could speak English?” DeSantis said.
“That’s a huge problem with the company, so we’re looking through that,” DeSantis said.
DeSantis criticized the GOP-majority Congress for not taking action against states with more welcoming immigration policies. 
“Why doesn’t Congress use the power of the purse and say, ‘Your funding is contingent upon following federal law with respect to immigration, you can’t be a sanctuary jurisdiction,’” DeSantis said. 
Collins is a former Green Beret who suffered a leg amputation in the line of duty and left his spot in the Florida Senate this month to become lieutenant governor. 
Attorney General James Uthmeier said Singh will face immigration charges at the conclusion of the vehicular manslaughter charges. 
State Rep. Alex Andrade, a Republican who has traded jabs with the DeSantis administration over Hope Florida, criticized the “political stunt” on social media.

(Courtesy photo from the city of Providence)Providence Police are now tapping into private cameras to try to solve crimes quicker — and it’s all being done voluntarily.
The city this week announced the launch of a “Real Time Crime Center” where detectives can access live feeds from hundreds of cameras to gather “actionable” information to rapidly respond to incidents via Fusus, a police surveillance technology.
Providence is the first city in Rhode Island to launch an operations center of this kind, according to the city’s announcement.
“By equipping our officers with real-time tools and intelligence, we are modernizing our approach to policing and ensuring faster, more coordinated responses that keep our communities safer,” Mayor Brett Smiley said in a statement.
The new operations center located inside the police department’s Major Crimes Unit integrates security cameras, license plate readers, body cameras, and 911 data that analysts can share in real-time with officers.
Private citizens and businesses can voluntarily register their cameras to assist police in tracking crimes. 
So far, 21 private citizens or businesses have given Providence Police access to 145 cameras, city spokesperson Anthony Vega confirmed in an email to Rhode Island Current. An additional 145 city-owned cameras are part of the system.
As of Wednesday, the city had around half a dozen pending applications from residents who wanted to link their cameras to the new crime center, Vega wrote.
The city will pay Arizona-based Axon Fusus $750,000 to run the system through at least July 2028, according to the contract the city signed in June 2024. The agreement technically runs for two years from the active start date, but automatically renews each year for up to three more years, as long as the Providence Board of Contract and Supply approves the funding.
Another vendor, Constant Technologies, has also worked on the real-time crime center, according to Smiley’s office. A copy of that contract was not immediately made available.
To cover the cost, the city is using a $1 million federal earmark secured by U.S. Sen. Jack Reed in 2023, according to the city’s announcement.
Reed said the new operations center will help Providence police stop, and solve, crimes while ensuring that “law enforcement is accountable to the public.”
“As with any new technology used by law enforcement, balancing public safety, privacy, and civil liberties is paramount and there must be stringent safeguards and oversight,” Reed said in a statement.
But the city’s crime center has drawn concerns from the American Civil Liberties Union of Rhode Island, which is drafting a formal letter to the city over what it calls the “normalization of constant surveillance.”
“Making a whole web of someone’s movements throughout the day can really do a number on surveillance,” Madalyn McGunagle, a policy associate for the ACLU of Rhode Island, said in an interview Wednesday.
The mayor’s office stressed that officers will not monitor security cameras in the system 24/7, nor will they pull up live feeds randomly. Shared footage is used solely in response to active criminal incidents or public safety emergencies, according to the city’s announcement. 
The Real Time Crime Center is staffed for 16 hours a day, Vega said.

Swimming in natural waters, also known as open water swimming, has taken over the world recreationally and competitively. These Vermont swimmers talk about the serenity it brings them, but also how it empowers their connection to nature.

Kate Kampner is a reporter with the Community News Service, part of the University of Vermont’s Reporting & Documentary Storytelling program.
HYDE PARK — When New Zealand native Charlotte Brynn moved to Vermont in 1998, it didn’t take long for her to discover the natural waters of Vermont. 
Brynn grew up swimming in glacial lakes and the waters that surround the island country. Now she’s been the executive director of the Swimming Hole, a nonprofit community pool and fitness center in Stowe, since 2001. 
While she transitioned to her life in the United States, she began open water swimming in Vermont at the Green River Reservoir in Hyde Park. In 2006, Brynn entered a YMCA Burlington event to swim eight miles across Lake Champlain from Willsboro Point in New York to Burlington. 
She quickly fell in love with long-distance open water swimming and eventually set a goal to swim the English Channel, the part of the Atlantic Ocean that separates southern England and northern France. Brynn was able to do the 21-mile swim in 11 hours and 43 minutes. 
The 12-year journey to success would deepen Brynn’s relationship with the natural waters of the world and strengthen her passion for protecting the environment. For many open water swimmers like Brynn, concern for the environment plays a large role in their swimming careers. 
“As open water swimmers, we gain an appreciation for the environment,” said Paula Yankauskas, a resident of Hyde Park and another long-distance swimmer who uses Green River Reservoir for training. “Without it, we wouldn’t be able to do what we do.” 
Yankauskas has been swimming since she was 11 years old and swam for the University of Vermont. Eventually, she would train and successfully swim the English Channel, making her the oldest woman in the United States to do so in 2016. She and Brynn also both swam the Catalina Channel and around the island of Manhattan. 
“You start to want to care about [the natural waters] and do what you can to help keep things clean and available,” Yankauskas said. 
Brynn said that Green River Reservoir is well-maintained and protected from bad water quality and doesn’t appear to have runoff. Both Crystal Lake and Lake Willoughby, other natural waters in the Vermont and New Hampshire area, she said, are also pretty clear. “Lake Memphremagog saddens me because I’ve noticed a real decline,” Brynn said. 
Brynn has been swimming in Lake Memphremegog since 2009 and has seen a variety of manmade waste, bleaching and discoloration of rocks on the side, and occasionally white and foamy bubbles on the surface. In 2021, Canadian officials found traces of PFAS in the lake. 
Lake Memphremagog, which crosses over into the Canadian border, is 31 miles long. Three-quarters of it is in Vermont and it serves as a water source for 200,000 people. 
“I’m in there an hour to five to ten hours,” Brynn said. “There’s definitely a concern.”

Brynn said she has her own test kit to test any of the waters she swims in after flooding or if there’s discoloration. 
She also said, despite its great swimming community and accessibility, Lake Champlain has work to do. She monitors swimming areas online to make sure they are safe from harmful recurring contaminants like cyanobacteria or phosphorus runoff. 
Another concern that Yankauskas raised is the recent increase in wildfire smoke in the state. When open water swimming in a group, she noted how one of their members, who has asthma, hadn’t been able to swim on days with bad air quality. In response, their practices have been moved indoors if the air quality index is high enough. 
But despite concern for water and air quality, as well as their health, both Brynn and Yankauskas keep on swimming. 
“The water really produces a giant hug and the ripples of it just wash away stuff,” Brynn said. “It’s very much like meditation or yoga where once you are one with the water and you’re swimming, those other stresses and worries, whether they’re relevant or not, they melt away.” 
Brynn said she felt her relationship with nature had changed during the process of training for the English Channel, especially with the Green River Reservoir. 
“I know every tree and rock along that shoreline,” Brynn said. “You have such an appreciation for the beauty.” 
Franny Cohen is a New Hampshire resident who spends time swimming in Vermont’s natural waters. She said she feels like part of the landscape when open water swimming.
“You’re aware of the loons and the ducks in New England,” said Cohen. She called her time swimming in the Boston Harbor euphoric. 
Yankauskas recalled swimming in the Catalina Channel at night and swimming through bioluminescent organisms in the water. “It’s like shooting diamonds and lightning off your fingertips,” she said. “It’s just really beautiful.” 
Brynn said sometimes when she’s swimming she can feel fish swim under her bodies’ shade, hiding from people who are fishing in the lakes. 
These swimmers’ passion and commitment for the open waters only empowers them to communicate, educate, and inspire others to think about how important good water quality is for the planet. 
Brynn called water the resource of the future.

(Pool photo by Bethany Baker/The Salt Lake Tribune) When campaigning for president in 1992, Bill Clinton raced back to Arkansas to oversee the execution of Billy Ray Rector. Clinton’s actions had nothing to do with addressing Arkansas’ record crime rates at the time. It was political theater. Mr. Rector’s crime was atrocious. He also suffered from mental illness to such an extent that on his way to be executed, he deliberately left behind the dessert from his last meal. He said he was “saving it for later.”
Yet Clinton believed it better politically to watch a mentally ill man put to death than to show mercy. Although sadly he may have been proven right, the execution is “remembered as a disgrace” to the state of Arkansas.
Utah may be poised to join Arkansas and other states as having executed a person with mental illness. After going over a decade without executing anyone, our state chose to execute Taberon Honie in 2024. Now the state seeks to execute Ralph Menzies.
In 1986, Mr. Menzies committed a terrible crime, kidnapping and murdering Maurine Hunsaker. Today, he is 67 years old. He relies on a wheelchair. He breathes with aid of an oxygen tank. And like Mr. Rector, he suffers with mental illness, having been diagnosed with dementia.
There is not an apparent reason why his crime compared to others requires the punishment of death. Combined with the 11 other people put to death or currently on death row, his crime represents less than one percent of the over 2250 murders in Utah between 1986 and 2024. By any definition, killing Ralph Menzies is an arbitrary infliction of extreme punishment for punishment’s sake only.
When the United States Supreme Court briefly abolished the death penalty in 1973, it was the arbitrary nature of its use that led to it being declared cruel and unusual in violation of the constitution. Justice Potter Stewart described that “death sentences are cruel and unusual in the same way that being struck by lightning is cruel and unusual.” He explained that for all the people sentenced to death, their crimes did not stand out for any reason other than they were among a “random handful upon whom” the sentence of death has been imposed.
As for Mr. Menzies, his crime does not stand out for any reason from the other notable, and thousands of less notable, murders over the decades in Utah. Mark Hofmann avoided the death penalty. He used bombs to kill two people to cover up a scheme to defraud The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. There is the “self-described ‘white-power skinhead’” who murdered Corrections Officer Stephen Anderson in an escape attempt. He too avoided the death penalty. Of the four other people on Utah’s death row, two sit there while their co-defendants do not.
It may be said that even if the death penalty is arbitrarily imposed, it must exist as a deterrent. Not so. The death penalty is not a deterrent. It is a fact that overall states without it have lower murder rates than states with it and that states that have recently abolished the death penalty saw no increase in their murder rates. In contrast, six of the seven states with the highest murder rates all have the death penalty, with five having executed someone since the start of 2024.
What about victims? Ms. Hunsaker’s daughter recently came out against the execution, writing that she does not “believe that justice will be served by taking another life.” Ms. Hunsaker’s son has publicly supported the execution, saying the family is ready for “closure.” No one can question his feelings or the reasonableness of wanting closure. But closure comes in many forms. What cannot be known is how anyone would feel about closure if the case had ended in any other fashion. As Mr. Menzies’ case typifies, waiting for imposition of the death penalty inhibits closure.
Which comes back to Mr. Menzies. Whatever led him to commit the horrendous crime is long since gone. Whoever he was then is not the person we see today. That is true due to the passage of time. It is true because none of us should be defined by the worst thing we ever did. And it is true because he is an elderly, sick man.
We can be better than this. Or Utah will go through with killing a man with dementia who needs an air tank to breathe. It will be our own unforgettable disgrace.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/250813_MENZIESCOMMUTATION.081325_2006_bb-1024x673.jpg,,,2025-08-20 17:57:31.176127

(Official White House Photo by Daniel Torok)South Florida U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Oregon U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley have written a letter calling on the heads of the Department of Homeland Security, ICE, and FEMA to provide detailed information regarding the operation of the Everglades immigration detention facility known as “Alligator Alcatraz.”
“Human rights experts have condemned the plan as ‘cruel and inhumane’ by design,” reads the letter, co-signed by more than 60 other Democrats from the House and Senate.
“Construction progressed at ‘turbo speed,’ and it remains unclear whether the facility has plans to ensure medical care, rapid hurricane evacuation, access to counsel, and sufficient infrastructure for sewage, running water, and temperature controls, despite being located in one of the ‘hottest parts of the state.’”
The lawmakers say they want federal authorities to provide extensive information about the facility by Sept. 3, including:

Identify the legal authority that allows Florida to run the facility;
Confirm that it meets federal standards for the treatment of detainees;
Identify private vendors contracted to operate the facility;
Identify criteria are used to segregate detainees;
Explain what is being done to prevent contamination of drinking water;
Explain any consultation with the Miccosukee and Seminole tribes before construction of the facility; and
Tell whether any minors or women have been detained at the facility.

Six of the eight members of the Florida Democratic congressional delegation signed the letter; the only members who did not were South Florida Rep. Jared Moskowitz and Central Florida’s Darren Soto.
A federal judge on Monday dismissed part of a lawsuit over the legal rights of detainees at the facility.
U.S. District Judge Rodolfo Ruiz in the Southern District of Florida ruled that claims detainees at the facility lack confidential access to immigration court were rendered moot when the Trump administration designated the Krome North Processing Center near Miami as a site for the cases to be heard.
The court order transferred the case to the Middle District of Florida. The detention site is in Collier County, under the Middle District’s jurisdiction.
Eunice Cho, senior counsel at the ACLU National Prison Project, said Wednesday that because of the lawsuit the federal government is now allowing immigrants at Alligator Alcatraz the ability to petition the immigration court for release from detention.
Related litigation
A second lawsuit over environmental concerns at the facility by Friends of the Everglades and the Center for Biological Diversity has resulted in U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams ordering a 14-day pause on additional construction on the site while witnesses testify at a hearing.
Gov. Ron DeSantis announced last week that state officials are now working on opening a second immigration detention facility that will be called “Deportation Depot” within the Baker Correctional Institution, a temporarily closed state prison in Northeast Florida. It will hold around 1,300 detainees and is expected to open sometime next month.

Entergy Louisiana plans to spend $3.2 billion on a power plant to run the center, plus additional money on a related gas plant in south Louisiana and transmission lines. (Meta)PLAQUEMINE – State utility regulators approved a plan Wednesday to install three natural-gas fueled power plants for the tech company Meta, which needs the electricity for a massive data center it’s building in Northeast Louisiana. 
The Louisiana Public Service Commission voted 4-1 to approve the unprecedented project from Entergy Louisiana to supply a massive amount of power for a single customer. Commissioner Davante Lewis, D-Baton Rouge, cast the lone dissenting vote, saying an agreement Meta and Entergy struck with other stakeholders before the vote felt rushed with too many questions still left unanswered. 
“There’s a lot of things I just can’t verify at the moment,” said Lewis, who has previously voiced support for the Meta data center. 
The Public Service Commission originally expected to vote on Entergy’s plan in October, coinciding with a deadline it set for its administrative law judge to settle any disputes involving businesses and groups opposed to the power generation project. The judge would then issue a recommendation to the commissioners about whether Entergy could move forward. 
Instead, Entergy, Meta and parties previously against the project told regulators last month they had reached an agreement with Entergy  ahead of the deadline, and a vote could take place to allow the power plant to advance. Entergy then filed a request to immediately place the matter on this month’s Public Service Commission meeting, held at the Carl F. Grant Civic Center in Plaquemine, rather than wait on the judge’s recommendation. 
This shortcut around the normal project approval process drew concerns from the public and ratepayer advocacy groups, who spoke for hours in opposition to Entergy’s plan. 
The three turbines dedicated to the Meta facility will have the capacity to generate 2,200 megawatts of electricity. They will increase Entergy’s statewide generation capacity roughly 20%, as the data center’s power needs are over twice the amount the entire city of New Orleans uses on a hot summer day, according to the Alliance for Affordable Energy. The ratepayer advocacy group wanted the Public Service Commission to delay its vote until October.
Meta has 20 other data centers around the world, and its Richland Parish facility would be the largest. While Entergy’s power complex is being built specifically for the data center, it will be connected to the larger electric grid and could supply power to other customers.
Entergy’s proposal has the full support of the commission’s consultants, who studied it for 10 months. One of the consultants, Lane Sisung, said Meta is covering 100% of the cost of all three turbines.

Read it here.
Desde 2020, los demócratas han soñado con derrotar a la representante republicana Young Kim de su escaño en el Condado de Orange, solo para ver cómo sus candidatos eran vencidos por amplio margen. 
Pero eso no ha disuadido a Lisa Ramírez, una abogada de inmigración, mejor conocida por haber ayudado a liberar a un padre migrante de tres hijos marines estadounidenses que fue detenido por ICE , de sumarse a la carrera para 2026.
Hija de una madre inmigrante, Ramírez citó lo que describió como la ola de detenciones masivas, la falta de proceso, el desprecio del presidente Donald Trump por las órdenes judiciales y el estado de derecho como las principales razones para postularse.
 “Para mí, esta carrera se ha tratado fundamentalmente de proteger nuestra Constitución, nuestra democracia y, en última instancia, mi comunidad”, dijo Ramírez en una entrevista con CalMatters antes del lanzamiento de su campaña hoy.
Kim es uno de los cuatro republicanos en el Congreso de California cuyos escaños el informe no partidista Cook Political Report ha identificado como competitivos.
 Si bien nunca ha ocupado un cargo público, Ramírez destaca sus décadas de defensa, asistencia legal y trabajo pro bono como prueba de que tiene el currículum de servicio público necesario para representar al Condado de Orange en el Congreso. Dijo que era obvio que representaría a Narciso Barranco, el paisajista del Condado de Orange cuyo arresto por parte del Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas (ICE) en junio se hizo viral después de que varias organizaciones comunitarias y funcionarios electos lo recomendaran a su oficina.
“Soy un fan de los desvalidos, por así decirlo”, dijo Ramírez. “He trabajado muy duro para forjarme la reputación de que, cuando hay mucho en juego y los casos son realmente difíciles, soy la persona a la que recurren”.
 Ramírez se suma a un amplio campo demócrata, que incluye a la ex miembro de la junta del Distrito Escolar Unificado de Chino Valley Christina Gagnier, la comerciante de arte autofinanciada Esther Kim Varet y el más reciente rival de Kim, Joe Kerr, quien perdió el escaño por más de 10 puntos porcentuales el año pasado.
Kim ha demostrado ser una formidable rival para los contendientes demócratas desde que el Distrito 40 de California pasó de ser un bastión liberal a un escaño republicano tras el censo de 2020. Con casi 4 millones de dólares en efectivo, su eventual oponente enfrentará una batalla cuesta arriba. Y eso antes del plan de redistribución de distritos del gobernador Gavin Newsom, que, de ser aprobado por los votantes en unas elecciones especiales el 4 de noviembre, convertiría el Distrito 40 en un escaño aún más republicano.
 Pero Ramírez dice que planea postularse sin importar lo que los votantes decidan en los mapas.
 “Mi compromiso es cambiar el escaño y contribuir a que la Cámara cambie su resultado”, dijo. “Estoy aquí para ganar esta campaña, y la ganaremos sin importar las fronteras geográficas”.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/052418-Young-Kim-AP-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-20 16:56:52.851165

This story by Matthew Thomas was first published in The Montpelier Bridge on Aug. 19, 2025.
At a time when Montpelier is overwhelmed by increasing numbers of people experiencing homelessness — and President Donald Trump has decreed that homeless people be removed from public spaces — the Montpelier City Council discussed amendments to the city’s public camping policy at Wednesday’s city council meeting. 
The amended policy proposed by the City Manager’s Office passed along with two amendments during the meeting: one, proposed by Councilor Pelin Kohn, stipulated that the policy be reviewed again in six months; the other, by Councilor Cary Brown, removed the language from the city manager’s amendment designating all city parks as “High-Sensitivity Areas,” passing with help from the mayor’s tie-breaking vote.
“The city’s approach to camping in the city has not changed, and we’re not suggesting it would at this time,” said Acting City Manager Kelly Murphy. Murphy added that while the city does not allow public camping, it is also not looking to roust those who camp who aren’t causing a disturbance. So long as they are not doing so in “High-Sensitivity Areas,” a hot topic during discussion of proposed amendments to the city’s encampment policy.

Among the particulars of the amended policy are removing the Montpelier Police Department from tasks such as triaging the city’s response to moving an encampment. The Fire, EMS and Parks departments will now be part of the group notified by the City Manager’s Office of an encampment. The city manager will now coordinate the response, relieving the beleaguered police department from such responsibility. 
Murphy said that her proposed amendments were not intended to be transformative. Rather, she said, they sought to bring the policy in line with de-facto city practice and also to account for current staff capacity. For example, Murphy cited the current practice of storing items cleared out of unattended encampments for 90 days; her office proposed the time limit be amended to 30 days so as to line up with the city’s actual storage capacity. 
Councilor Adrienne Gil said she’s not interested in talking about changes until the city’s partners have also reviewed current policy and had a chance to offer input. “We need guidance in enforcement,” Murphy said in response. To which Gil replied, “We need an emergency meeting with our partners to go through this policy to have an understanding about what we want in our community. … Just having one side of the story, updating a policy, is not sufficient.” 
Councilor Cary Brown agreed with Gil. “If we’re going to review this policy, it does need to be with everyone involved,” she said. “I think it’s a good idea to pull this policy out, to dust it off, take a look at it, because we went through a lot to put it in place.”
Brown did take issue with one of the proposals, which she deemed an “extremely substantive change,” a line in the notification letter affixed to the policy, which was amended to designate all city parks as “high-sensitivity areas,” and, therefore, subjecting any encampments within them to removal. According to Brown, this change negates the spirit and meaning of the entire original policy. 
Contained in Murphy’s response was the paradox that has flummoxed the city for years and would return throughout the meeting: If public spaces are increasingly off limits to camping, where are unhoused people supposed to go?
Councilor Sal Alfano said the policy has “many inconsistencies” and suggested the whole thing be scrapped and the city start over. As an example, he noted where the policy states that shelter will be offered when moving campers out of prohibited areas. The problem is that the city has no shelter space to offer. 
Members of the public weighed in as well. 
Richard Sheir, of Montpelier, suggested that matters related to the parks fall under the jurisdiction of the elected Parks Commission, and perhaps not the city council. 
Montpelier resident David Kitchen spoke about the encampments by the river near where he lives, and said he has instructed his son to no longer ride his bicycle on the bike path near the transit station but instead ride in traffic, as it’s “safer,” according to Kitchen. 
“I rode through there the other day,” Kitchen said, “and two individuals blocked the path and they could tell I wasn’t going to stop. They split. One guy gives me the ‘finger gun,’ pulling his trigger. The other guy mentions something about ‘destruction,’ that he’s going to ‘destroy’ me.” 
Montpelier residents Stan Brinkerhoff and TJ Poor both said that they do not allow their children to use the bike path by themselves. Poor said his daughter is afraid of using the bike path, and when she is downtown often crosses the street many times to avoid confrontation. 
Bonnie Robertson, a 30-year resident of Montpelier, described her experience of using the bike path, citing broken glass on the ground, litter down by the river, fighting, and “half-naked” people relieving themselves by the river, among other examples of disorder. While noting that she does not want to see people moved, Robertson said “I would like to see the law being enforced,” a sentiment that was echoed throughout the meeting. 
“I don’t have a solution for homelessness,” Robertson said. “But I don’t see why we can’t enforce the laws that are already on the books.” 
Multiple residents, while expressing empathy for the unhoused, also registered their discontent with what they characterized as lawlessness by some members of the city’s homeless encampments, prohibiting use of public spaces by the larger public. Poor said the problem is bigger than Montpelier and should be tackled by the state. 
“The empathy and compassion that was well intentioned with the policy has really enabled entitlement,” Poor said. “Entitlement that these public places belong only to a small portion of those who are unhoused, really, and not to the rest of the community. We’re making a choice without policy. We’ve devoted our priority. We’ve done it away from our children, done it away from the economic vitality of the community, and that really needs to change. Our town is unwelcoming now.”

The federal agency argues that it has complied with court orders in the case by reversing a decision in April to alter the students’ status within the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System — a move that could have paved the way for deportation.
By reversing course, the agency’s lawyers argue, Homeland Security has rendered the lawsuit moot. The plaintiffs, they argue in their motion to dismiss the case, “have obtained the relief they originally sought. There is nothing more for the court to do.”
In their motion, lawyers for Homeland Security acknowledge the judge in the case, when responding to a different motion, had previously ruled that “actions compelled by court order are not actions that moot a case.”
Attorneys for the students have yet to respond to the motion to dismiss. The students’ attorney, Katherine Melloy Goettel, declined to comment on the matter. A hearing in the case is scheduled for Aug. 27.
Judge has rejected prior requests from DHS 
In April 2025, the three UI international students and one international-student graduate sued DHS for wrongful termination of their student status, which they alleged caused irreparable stress and anxiety due to fear of imminent seizure and deportation.
On May 15, 2025, a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction requiring DHS to maintain the plaintiffs’ status as students in its Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) records. The judge also ordered DHS to add to the records a notation of active student status that would be backdated to the date the agency had terminated that status — ensuring that other entities wouldn’t act on the termination and attempt to deport the students on that basis.
On June 12, 2025, DHS filed a motion seeking to revise the injunction. The department argued that due to technological limitations with SEVIS records, the system did not allow the creation of written notations that would be visible to other users of the system, such as schools and employers, outside of DHS.
DHS asked that the court issue a ruling indicating it had fulfilled the requirements of the injunction, while also arguing the injunction was overbroad and amounted to a prohibition against any sort of prosecution for crimes the students might commit.
Noting that DHS had made no assertions as to what, if any, efforts had been made to remedy the claimed technological limitations within SEVIS, U.S. District Court Judge Rebecca Goodgame Ebinger denied DHS’ motion to revise her order.
With regard to DHS’ claim that the injunction bars future criminal prosecutions, Ebinger noted that her order does not apply to state, county, or local law enforcement acting separately from DHS and not at DHS’ instruction.
Also, she ruled, the injunction “prevents neither arrests nor the commencement of prosecutions. Rather, as to the plaintiffs — four individual people whom the court previously found to be likely to succeed on their claims of unfounded and harmful status record interference — the court’s order requires advance notice to the court as part of defendants’ due process efforts. The order does not prohibit law enforcement actions.”
DHS officials describe Student Criminal Alien Initiative
As part of their recent request for a dismissal of the lawsuit, attorneys for Homeland Security provided the court with a sworn statement from Akil Baldwin, the acting assistant director of the National Security Division of Homeland Security Investigations within the department.
In his statement, Baldwin said he oversees the Student Exchange Visitor Program “in support of ICE efforts to identify, disrupt and dismantle transnational criminal enterprises and terrorist organizations.” He said the four UI students’ criminal histories — which, according to the students’ attorney, are limited to misdemeanor-level offenses such as drunken driving — led to the revocation of their student visas.
The process, he said in his statement, began when Homeland Security Investigations, or HSI, launched what he called the Student Criminal Alien Initiative.
As part of that initiative, he said, HSI obtained access to the federal criminal database maintained by the National Crime Information Center to determine “whether any nonimmigrant students had criminal records.”
HSI then sent its findings to the U.S. Department of State “to take action as it deemed appropriate,” Baldwin said. The Department of State then revoked “some nonimmigrant student visas with an NCIC record,” Baldwin stated.
Then, at the Department of State’s request, HSI terminated the SERVIS records of those students who now had no valid student visa. In April, amid a flurry of litigation related to its actions, Homeland Security reversed course and began restoring the students’ SEVIS records to “active” status.
During a District of Columbia court hearing in April, Homeland Security’s assistant director for national security, Andre Watson, discussed the agency’s Student Criminal Alien Initiative.
Watson testified as to how 10 to 20 ICE employees spent several weeks combing through the records of 1.3 million holders of student visas to determine whether any of them might have had some form of interaction with law enforcement, such as a traffic violation that was later dismissed.
An exasperated D.C. District Court Judge Ana C. Reyes asked Watson, “Are you telling me that with all of the cost cutting that we have going on right now — because apparently we’re spending too much money in the federal government doing things like, oh, I don’t know, funding cancer research, can’t afford to do that — that we had, not ‘we,’ but ‘someone,’ had 10 to 20 federal employees spend their time going name by name in a database to see what hits they got for 1.3 million people? Is that what happened? Yes or no.”
“Yes,” Watson replied. He explained that of the 1.3 million student names, less than half of 1%, or roughly 6,400 student names, were passed on to the State Department. The State Department then revoked visas to travel into the United States for 3,000 of those students, and then told Homeland Security to terminate those students’ status in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System.
After hearing from Watson, Judge Reyes cited what she called the federal government’s “utter lack of concern for human individuals who we have invited into our country and who have (made) communities richer by being students who have contributed to our colleges and who have paid our colleges.”

Students, faculty and alumni were left in disbelief when Mississippi’s higher education board announced Marcus Thompson’s resignation in May, just five days after graduation and two years into his term. 
He was the third president to suddenly depart at the state’s largest historically Black university in less than seven years. His predecessor, Thomas Hudson left after two years. Before that, William Bynum resigned after three years, following his arrest in a prostitution sting at a Clinton hotel. The typical college president has been in their current job for 5.9 years.
Yet, in all three cases, the JSU presidents left without formal explanation from the Institutions of Higher Learning board. 
During summer break, alumni have taken up the torch, leading email campaigns to voice their frustrations to board members, state lawmakers and elected officials about the university’s chronic leadership turnover. 
The effort forced the college board to confront lingering questions about its past choices of university presidents and, more importantly, scrutinize how it plans  to make the right decision this time. 
Still, the board only pulled back some of the curtain to reveal insights into its executive search process. It has remained mum about most of the plans for seeking the university’s next president. 
In any other era, a search committee and timeline would have been publicly announced by now. But, the pressure to hire a permanent leader has grown increasingly complex, polarized and secretive in a contentious higher education climate. 
“Discussions on the process have begun, but it’s important to make sure this process is efficient, thorough and timely,” John Sewell, a spokesperson for the board, said in a statement to Mississippi Today. 
The board says it wants to ensure Denise Jones-Gregory, the university’s current interim president, who was appointed immediately after Thompson’s departure, has the opportunity to settle into the role. 
But, repeated criticism about the board’s history of elevating internal hires and appointing interim leaders among Mississippi’s eight universities has left advocates increasingly wary that the IHL board will continue to ignore its own procedures to provide a fair and transparent search for Jackson State.  
Mississippi Today asked the board if Gregory had expressed interest in the role, the board said it was a “personnel matter” and members “have no comment on it.”

Jackson State’s next leader will enter the post amid sweeping federal research funding cuts, uncertainty about federal student loan programs and college support services like Upward Bound, TRiO and GEAR UP, and the Trump administration’s crusade against diversity, equity and inclusion policies. 
The university is also experiencing its own set of challenges: student housing shortages, financial constraints, fluctuating enrollment, low morale from faculty and staff, almost a decade worth of mistrust from alumni, community members and supporters. 
And there are the perennial questions of how to deal with the many and sometimes conflicting constituencies including the governor, state legislators, political activists and college governing board members.  
“This is certainly not a job for the weak,” said Mark Dawson, who chairs Thee 1877 Project, a renegade group of alums who aren’t affiliated with the university’s national alumni association. 
Through self-described “guerilla” methods, the group created a qualitative questionnaire for its roughly 3,000 email subscribers this month inquiring about leadership traits alums are looking for in the  university’s next president. 
They collected more than 370 survey responses, with specific qualities emphasized as being important, like “strong appreciation for HBCU culture, history and legacy,” “financial accountability and budget management” and “unwavering integrity and ethics.”
“Overwhelmingly, people were telling us in our survey that character counts,” Dawson said. 
The group’s data mimics national findings: A 2024 report by Academic Search, an executive headhunting firm, found that top education executives commonly listed attributes like trustworthiness and resilience as relevant traits for their presidencies. 
Among the 700 college presidents surveyed, more than 90% listed those qualities as “very relevant” to the job, with “behaves in a way that is trustworthy, consistent and accountable” cited the most frequently at 96%. Listening to and understanding stakeholder concerns was also highly cited. 
The alumni group said it will share its survey results with IHL board members at a meeting Thursday. With these efforts, they aim to send a clear message: If you’re going to be responsible for selecting  presidents, make sure you listen to all voices. 
“What we heard from IHL last month is that they believe their processes work and that to me sounds like they’re unwilling to change,” said Sharolyn Love, a member of Thee 1877 Project. “We really want to be in collaboration with IHL to get this right. These results let them know that we are also holding them accountable and we want someone living, breathing and walking these values.” 
‘It’s an eight-day-a-week job’ 
The role of a university president has shifted in recent decades to focus on external relations, while the provost handles many internal issues, said Judith Wilde, a George Mason University professor who studies college presidential searches. 
Most can agree being chief of a university has become increasingly harder. For HBCU leaders under Trump, that means a delicate dance of advancing legislative goals and bracing for change while addressing student fears. 
“I quote The Beatles and say, ‘it’s an eight-day-a-week job’’ ” Wilde said. “One of the most important qualifications that boards seem to look for now in a university president is their ability to raise money and that requires a lot of time meeting with tons of stakeholders at local, regional and statewide (levels).” 
Public universities rely on private donations due to decreasing state appropriations. Just this year, the Mississippi Legislature decreased support for public universities by 4.2% from last year, with an appropriation of $838.4 million to all eight institutions for the 2026 fiscal year.

Even IHL commissioner Al Rankins stated during June’s IHL board meeting that the role of college president has become tougher and many universities “fight above their weight” to keep faculty and staff on campus. 
For years, Mississippi’s institutions have all agreed that faculty and staff are underpaid. The average salary of a professor at one of the state’s universities is $87,865 according to data compiled by The Chronicle of Higher Education. But despite several years of state-funded pay raises, Mississippi’s faculty and staff continue to make far less than those in other Southern states.
“We’re at a time in higher education where we’ve seen more change and more flux than I’ve seen over my entire career,” said Rankins, who previously served as president of Alcorn State University. “We can’t continue to go backwards. If we do, it will be very hard for these individuals to provide the quality education and experience that they provide for our students.” 
Jackson State and  Mississippi’s other HBCUs have experienced historic underfunding compared to their predominantly white counterparts like Mississippi State University and the University of Mississippi, which have deep pockets and big stadiums largely due to private support. 
Constant leadership turnover can also disrupt private donor alumni relationships, as well as research funding. While many grants remain in limbo because of the federal administration, other unfriendly policies around international students at tuition-driven institutions could pose a problem. 
But Wilde said the  job will still attract qualified candidates, appealing to those interested in generous salaries and benefits and mansion-like residences on campus. Currently, Jackson State University presidents make $450,000 annually. 
“It’s not a crass way to think about it,” Wilde said. “Of course, there are problems with these jobs and it may attract individuals who don’t have any higher education experience.” 
Amid the many challenges, turnover at the president level is a growing problem. The years of experience of those in the job has been declining steadily for nearly two decades, and 55% of surveyed presidents say they plan to step down in the next five years, according to the American Council on Education’s 2023 college president report. 
Wilde also said it is not unusual for college boards to choose insiders rather than taking a chance on newcomers. Facing political and financial pressures, university boards appear to have grown more allergic to risk. 
In many cases, the IHL board can give itself two options when it searches for a new university president, according to its policy: an extended search with a consultant, or an expedited process in which trustees interview candidates that are “known to the board.” The board has latitude to flip-flop between the two types of searches. 
In 2023, the board spent $115,000 on Academic Search, an executive head hunting firm for Jackson State’s president search, after Hudson resigned. 
The board appointed Elayne Hayes-Anthony, chair of the journalism department, as temporary acting president. When Anthony expressed interest in the role, the board opted not to pick her for the permanent position. It followed its protocol, announcing a search committee, building a search timeline, and scheduling community listening sessions and a survey. 
But then the board went with an internal hire, yet again, and chose Thompson, who was the board’s communications chief and had no experience leading a university. While plans for the current search remain unclear, Wilde said the choices for fairness and transparency are up to those in charge of the process. 
“Search firms promote secrecy,” Wilde said. “What you’re really looking for is someone who has been president before and is maybe ready to do it again.” 
‘A gemstone that needs to be reset’ 


This week kicked off fall semester classes at Jackson State. One student,  Rayvn Webster, said she hopes her next president will prioritize needs around mental health and burnout. 
“So many of us are coming from out of state, and witnessing that instability of president changes since I’ve been here has made our school have a rocky foundation,” Webster, a junior from Memphis, Tennessee, studying industrial technology with a concentration in electrical systems. “We want to think of this place as our home away from home and not a place we can’t trust or feel free.” 
Angel Edwards, a sophomore studying political science, said she does not fault any president for leaving abruptly. 
She had admired Thompson for his engagement with students, which she saw as his biggest strength. He bridged JSU alums and new generations of future alums. 


“I think he understood that this school was our path to a better career, life and opportunity for many of us and our families, and the bonds we built here were sacred,” Edwards said. “But, it was also a lot of kids and a lot of responsibility. So, I get it.” 
From the outside, the job of Jackson State president may not seem appealing. 
The role requires overseeing nearly 6,000 students, four satellite campuses, a $250 million operating budget and millions of dollars in federal research funding. The next leader will also walk a tightrope, needing to please a mainly white board and advocate for the school. 
“Jackson State University is a gemstone that just needs to be polished and reset,” Dawson said. “We have a rich legacy and history and whoever takes the helm needs to understand where we are coming from, where we’re going and what we hope to achieve in the future.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20114243/MT-JSU-President-Survey-FeatImage-01.jpg,,,2025-08-20 16:56:52.851165

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – Four Republicans and one Democrat have filed paperwork indicating they are running for lieutenant governor.
Republican Lt. Gov. Matt Pinnell is serving his second term and can’t seek reelection to the post.
Republicans seeking the post are State Auditor and Inspector Cindy Byrd, state Sen. Darrell Weaver, state Rep. J.J. Humphrey and political newcomer Victor Flores.
Kelly Forbes of Oklahoma City is the sole Democrat thus far to file paperwork with the Oklahoma Ethics Commission indicating an intention to run.
Byrd, 52, of Coalgate, wants to focus on promoting tourism and the music industry.
She said the lieutenant governor sits on a lot of boards and commissions that drive economic development involving millions of dollars. Her skill set makes her ready to start on the first day, she said.
About 80% of every tax dollar is spent on education and health care, but the state ranks at the bottom in outcomes, she said. She wants to do a deep dive into the reasons and assist the next governor on making improvements, she said.
Weaver, 63, of Moore, is the former head of the Oklahoma State Bureau of Dangerous Drugs Control, an agency in which held various positions.
He and his wife operate Weaver clinics, which provide medical care.
Weaver said his relationships in the Capitol and law enforcement and business background make him a good fit for the office.
He said his background as a pilot has taught him about all of the opportunities the state has in the aerospace industry.
Flores, 47, of Edmond is a small business owner and a partner with a national accounting firm.
He would like to improve the relationships between the tribes, state agencies and the executive branch.
Flores said he wants to focus on making sure economic development is happening statewide, especially in rural areas.
Humphrey, 59, of Lane, is a rancher and retired probation and parole officer.
He said the Oklahoma House leadership has shut down his efforts to expose problems at the Oklahoma Department of Corrections and Oklahoma Department of Human Services.
“I hope to use the lieutenant governor’s position to make the state aware of these things and expose corruption,” he said.
He also wants to improve the state’s educational system and broadband access in rural Oklahoma so businesses can grow.
Forbes could not be reached for comment Wednesday.
The filing period is April 1-3 at the state Capitol for federal, state, legislative and judicial offices.
The primary election is June 16, followed by a Aug. 25, 2026, runoff. 
The general election is Nov. 3, 2026.

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota’s court system declared a judicial emergency Wednesday in response to an ongoing outage of state websites, data portals and communication systems.
Since Tuesday, people in and outside the judicial system have been unable to get court records or court dates, file documents like protection orders, trial motions, civil lawsuits or small claims cases. Public access points like ecourts.sd.us remain inaccessible, and court system employees can’t access records through their own non-public information portals.
The court system is also unable to take electronic payments of fines, though a press release from the Unified Judicial System said clerks can take payments in person.
The judicial emergency suspends “all deadlines, time schedules, due dates and filing requirements imposed by applicable statutes, rules and court orders” until ordered by the court.
Power outages across South Dakota government stymie services statewide

The emergency declaration is part of the fallout from a power outage in the state’s data center, which is the term used by the Bureau of Information Technology to describe the hardware scattered across the state and connected through the state’s network.
Driver’s license exam stations and self-service kiosks remained inaccessible Wednesday, as did vehicle registration and vehicle licensing, birth and death records and the state’s voter registration database.
Law enforcement has been affected, as well. Faulk County Sheriff Kurt Hall said his dispatch was unable to run license plate and warrant checks for deputies doing traffic stops for most of Tuesday.
“We couldn’t run plates yesterday, but we can today,” said Hall, whose office polices a county of 2,100 and runs a 32-bed jail.
Law enforcement has been affected, as well. Faulk County Sheriff Kurt Hall said his dispatch was unable to run license plate and warrant checks for deputies doing traffic stops for most of Tuesday.
Minnehaha County Sheriff Mike Milstead, who oversees the deputies patrolling South Dakota’s most populous county and one of its largest jails, said state system services have been spotty at best and mostly inaccessible. Metro Communications, which dispatches for both the county and the Sioux Falls Police Department, has been able to communicate with law enforcement, even as some state resources have been unavailable.

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)“We couldn’t run plates yesterday, but we can today,” said Hall, whose office polices a county of 2,100 and runs a 32-bed jail.
Milstead’s office has relied on its local warrants database for information, but adding warrants to the system has been cumbersome with the state court system down. Deputies have had to hand-deliver court information for warrants, he said, and for orders to release jail inmates from custody.
“This is certainly demonstrating how dependent we are on the state network,” Milstead said, adding that he can’t recall an outage that’s lasted as long as this one in the years since his office has been using it.
Attorney General Marty Jackley, who oversees the state Division of Criminal Investigation, said Wednesday that his office has also been impacted, as the consumer protection division is unable to process complaints. 
Jackley’s office also oversees the State Automated Victim Notification System, through which victims or the public can sign up for alerts about court dates, incarceration status or release dates for people accused or convicted of crimes. That SAVIN system wasn’t sending out alerts as of Wednesday. 
Milstead said “we still have processes in place” to notify victims using the information held on local servers without SAVIN. 
“That’s kind of a check and balance, not in every case, but in most cases,” Milstead said. “I would call it more of a workaround, but the jail still does victim notification if we have a victim on file.”
The Bureau of Information Technology’s spokesperson, Lisa Rahja, said in an email that the state is continuing its work to mitigate the power outage that “affected all state hosted services and some network communications.”
She wrote that the state engineer’s office has investigated the “root cause” of the outage, and that “recovery efforts are a top priority.” 
The power outage wasn’t caused by a cybersecurity breach, she wrote.

The panel, hosted by Byrum & Fisk Advocacy Communications partner Dianne Byrum, a former Democratic lawmaker, featured members of the Economic Alliance of Michigan, the Michigan Education Association and the Small Business Association of Michigan, alongside perspective from small business CEO Carrin Harris. 
Bret Jackson, Economic Alliance of Michigan president and CEO, told attendees that health care costs for his employees had increased 41% over the past three years. As a result of these increasing costs, Jackson said he was not able to offer his employees an increase in wages this year, and with an expected rate increase of 11% for next year, Jackson said he was doubtful he’d be able to increase wages next year. 
According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, health care premiums for a family of four cost $5,791 in 1999, whereas in 2024, worker contributions alone had risen to $6,296. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Jackson also noted that the costs of health insurance have outpaced what a family of four will pay in state and federal taxes combined. 
When looking to address this issue, Jackson noted two thirds of Michigan hospitals have double digit operating profit margins. While some rural hospitals are struggling to stay afloat, those double digit operating profits showcase where the money is going, Jackson said.

Jackson also pointed to data from the Michigan Health Purchasers Coalition showcasing differing costs of procedures between hospitals. 
For childbirth, vaginal delivery of a baby carried a median cost of $5,810 at Trinity Health Oakland, the least expensive facility in Metro Detroit, compared to $14,671 at the Detroit Medical Center’s Harper Hutzel hospital. 
 For cesarean births, Trinity Health in Oakland was again the least expensive facility, with the median cost of care coming in at $7,590 compared to $14,712 at the Detroit Medical Center’s Receiving Hospital. 
“Again, same patient, right? Could be. Different facility, substantially different cost. Bottom line is health care costs are going up at an incredibly unsustainable rate, and it’s impacting employers’ ability to pay their employees more, to hire more workers, to invest in their companies,” Jackson said.  
These rising costs also carry a higher impact on women who overwhelmingly make the health care decisions for their families, Jackson said. 
“Not only are they making health care decisions based on what information they know, they’re also seeing the bills as they come in, and perhaps not focusing on themselves, because they see how much it costs to take care of their families, and they want to make sure that their families are being taken care of,” Jackson said. 
Kelli Saunders, the vice president for policy and engagement at the Small Business Association of Michigan said that for the past 10 years small business owners have had to grin and bear increasing health care costs, though the strains of recent years have raised questions on whether they can continue to offer these benefits. 
In a survey of 300 small business association members earlier this year, 76% said the cost of health care was impacting their ability to hire employees while 51% said they had to reduce or eliminate benefits due to costs. 
“This is a red flag moment where our small business owners – who make up over half of the jobs in our state – are saying, ‘I don’t know what to do, and it’s either shut my doors or reduce benefits.’ And that’s not the right answer, so let’s get around the table and try and solve it,” Saunders said.

School districts face a dilemma
Chandra Madafferi, president and CEO of the Michigan Education Association shared how rising health care costs had placed a similar strain on budgets for schools, stretching beyond personnel like teachers and school counselors. 
In Michigan, the cost of health care seems to have exploded in recent years, placing it out of reach for many, Madafferi said. 
While some educators have received great raises in recent years, those earnings have largely been wiped out by the increased cost of health care, Madafferi said.
It has also raised questions among young educators on whether they will be able to afford to have more than one child, she said.
When looking at the cost of education, one question that gets asked is how a district can provide an excellent workforce, Madafferi said. 
“We have got to still attract the best and the brightest, and that means providing a competitive salary,” Madafferi explained.

However, increased health care costs have impacted districts’abilities to offer competitive salaries and benefits, Madafferi said, pointing to hospital consolidation as another piece of the problem. 
According to a report published by global policy thinktank RAND, hospital consolidation is tied to an increase in price, with quality of care either remaining the same, or worsening. 
A report from the Detroit Free Press in 2023 ahead of the Henry Ford and Ascension Michigan merger noted the effort would place 59% of Michigan hospitals under three health systems.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/unnamed-10.png,,,2025-08-20 16:56:52.851165

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Secretary of State Sarah Godlewski launched her bid for lieutenant governor on Wednesday — passing on running for governor and becoming the first to enter the field for the position.   
At the Madison Labor Temple, Godlewski was joined by her 5-year-old son, Hartley, who from the podium shyly told people to vote for his mom, and her parents, who she said gave her advice that has led to her decision to run. 
“When you see something wrong, you’ve got to stand up and you’ve got to do something is what has guided me my entire life,” Godlewski said. “Whether it is my career where I started in national security to working in local government to supporting small businesses to eventually running the constitutional amendment to save our state treasurer’s office and now serving statewide, to me, this has always come down to one thing, which is how I can make the biggest difference in Wisconsin.”
Godlewski has served in her current office since March 2023. She was appointed by Gov. Tony Evers to fill a vacancy left when former-Secretary of State Doug La Follette, who had served in the position since 1983, abruptly stepped down less than three months into his term. The position in Wisconsin has been diminished over the years, in part because Republican lawmakers took away its responsibilities and in part because the office lacked resources, though Godlewski has worked to modernize its operations.
Godlewski previously served as state Treasurer from 2019 to 2022, running for the office just a couple of months after leading a successful campaign to urge voters to reject a Republican ballot measure that would have eliminated the position from the state constitution. 
When she won the election for Treasurer in 2018, she flipped nine counties in Wisconsin that voted for Trump in 2016 — something that she noted Wednesday in making the case for her candidacy. She didn’t run for reelection in 2022 because she ran in the Democratic primary for the U.S. Senate that year, withdrawing before the August primary election. 
If elected, the lieutenant governor’s office would be her third statewide position in Wisconsin. Godlewski said her sisters jokingly asked whether she was going for a record when she told them about her campaign. 
“All kidding aside, I’m not running for this office because I need another title,” Godlewski said. “I’m running for this office because I want to be a part of the team that’s not only going to win but is actually going to deliver for the state of Wisconsin.”
Former Democratic Lt. Gov. Barbara Lawton, the first female to hold the office in Wisconsin, and several Democratic state legislators were also at the announcement. Godlewski said she has endorsements from Lawton and 27 of state lawmakers — about 54% of the Democrats in the state Legislature.

Jodi Emerson (D-Eau Claire), at the podium, were also at Sec. of State Sarah Godlewski’s announcement. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)
Rep. Jodi Emerson (D-Eau Claire) called Godlewski “Eau Claire’s favorite daughter,” saying she “knows how to build coalitions and bring people together across communities and even across partisan divides.” 
“When she sees a problem, she rolls up her sleeves and she digs in and she talks to people who need to get it fixed, from saving the treasurer’s office to revitalizing the treasurer’s office and the Secretary Secretary of State’s office to managing a $1.4 billion dollar trust fund to invest in our communities,” Emerson said — a reference to the Board of Commissioners of Public Lands, which Godlewski has served on both as state treasurer and secretary of state. 
Godlewski has said she has heard from people across the state who are struggling financially to afford their homes, health care and other expenses. 
“They’re fed up that workers who are critical to our community, like EMT workers and nurses and teachers, can’t even afford a home in the communities that they serve, while they’re watching these billionaires get tax write-offs for their second and third vacation home,” Godlewski said. “They’re fed up that corporations are cashing in on some of the largest tax breaks in our history, and families are getting the scraps.”  
She said she wants to help find solutions for those issues, but can’t work on them as secretary of state. 
Godlewski criticized Republicans and said Wisconsinites deserve better leadership. 
“In Madison this year alone, we’ve seen how Republicans have had an opportunity to expand Medicaid to 90,000 more Wisconsinites. They said no. Republicans had an opportunity to expand postpartum care for new moms. They said no. The Republicans had an opportunity to invest in our kids’ future by supporting and funding public schools. They said, no. But when it comes to giving tax write-offs for corporations and perks to the well-connected, they said yes, yes, yes,” Godlewski said. “This isn’t leadership. It’s betrayal.”
Godlewski told reporters that she decided to run for the number two position over running for governor because she thinks it will be the right fit for her. 
“We’ve got some major challenges we’ve got to solve in Wisconsin, whether it’s affordable health care to families being priced out of their communities, and I want to be a part of the team that’s going to help solve these problems for Wisconsin,” Godlewski said.
In Wisconsin, voters cast votes separately for governor and lieutenant governor during the partisan primary. After the primary, the winners run on the same ticket in November and voters choose them as a pair. 
Wisconsin’s partisan primary is about a year away and the Democratic field for governor is still taking shape. Godlewski didn’t make any endorsements in the race Tuesday.  
“We have a really impressive bench in the Democratic party, and so I look forward to seeing who’s going to get in” and to working with whoever is the nominee, Godlewski said. 
Gov. Tony Evers’ decision not to seek a third term has made the race for governor the first open one in Wisconsin in 16 years and is leading to some other open seats as well, including lieutenant governor and now secretary of state. With Evers not on the ballot, the Wisconsin governor’s race has been rated a toss-up by Sabato’s Crystal Ball. 
Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez jumped into the race for governor less than 24 hours after Evers announced his retirement. Other Democrats considering a run for governor include Attorney General Josh Kaul, Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley, state Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison) and state Rep. Francesca Hong (D-Madison).
Washington County Executive Josh Schoemann and Whitefish Bay manufacturer Bill Berrien are the two announced Republican candidates so far. U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany is also considering a run for the office. 
Godlewski told reporters Democrats need to listen to people if they’re going to win statewide in 2026.
“We’re seeing how folks don’t trust politicians, and it’s because they feel like they’re not hearing us. They’re watching a system that’s working for corporations and not for them, and so, how do we build trust? We’ve got to travel the state, meet them where they are, listen and that’s how we rebuild it,” Godlewski said. 
She added she recently met a mom in Kenosha, who “literally has two jobs just to support her family” and met another family in the northern parts of the state who “are still drinking bottled water because they have PFAS that are coming out of their faucet.” 
“These are real big issues, and that’s what I look forward to talking about — things that are keeping Wisconsinites up at night — and actually doing something about it,” Godlewski said.

(Photo by Ellen Schmidt/Minnesota Reformer)Minnesota’s statewide minimum wage will increase 28 cents to $11.41 per hour on Jan. 1, a 2.5% increase based on the annual rate of inflation. 
The minimum wage applies to virtually all employees since the Democratic-controlled Legislature eliminated a lower minimum wage for small businesses, workers younger than 18 and workers on J-1 visas in 2024. (As before, tips cannot be counted toward the minimum wage.)
Only workers under 20 years old in their first 90 days of training may receive a lower wage of $9.31 per hour starting in 2026. 
Minneapolis and St. Paul each have higher minimum wages of $15.97 per hour, which will increase with inflation in 2026. Small and micro businesses in St. Paul may pay a lower minimum wage, but the city is phasing in a single minimum wage for all employees by 2028. 
Minnesota’s minimum wage is higher than most of its neighbors’ (save South Dakota), but it isn’t enough to cover basic living expenses. The cost of living for a childless, working-age adult requires earning $17.68 per hour, according to the state Department of Employment and Economic Development. A household with two children requires two parents earning at least $24.25 per hour. 
The federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour has remained unchanged since 2009 and is the effective minimum wage in 20 states, including Wisconsin. 
Minnesota’s minimum wage has been indexed to inflation since 2018 but was limited to annual adjustments of 2.5% until last year when lawmakers raised the threshold to 5% to ensure the lowest paid workers receive larger raises in periods of high inflation. 
The increase will directly affect a relatively small number of workers. Fewer than 90,000 salaried and hourly jobs out of more than 3.3 million in Minnesota were paid at or below the minimum wage in 2023, according to the state’s latest minimum wage report. Still, a rising minimum wage puts upward pressure on jobs paying just above minimum wage, creating a ripple effect across a larger number of workers.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Minnesota-Reformer-File-61-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-20 16:56:52.851165

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)State spending in Rhode Island has surged. Public tracking of how state agencies and programs are using that money has not.
And the Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council (RIPEC) is sounding the alarm as part of a new analysis of the state’s fiscal 2026 budget published on Wednesday. The 49-page report by the business-backed research group reprises warnings of years past regarding unsustainable spending. This year’s report features a sterner admonishment than usual over lack of transparency in how state administrators craft the budget, or monitor the results from multibillion-dollar spending. 
“Despite a statutory requirement for agencies to include performance measures in their budget requests, the actual utilization of these measures in state budgeting decisions is unclear,” the report states. “While [the Office of Management and Budget]’s Performance Management Unit is tasked with maintaining and updating these measures, much of their work is internally facing and public reporting on program effectiveness has been minimal. This limited public data makes it challenging for the public to evaluate how effectively tax dollars are being utilized for programs administered by state departments and agencies.”
Derek Gomes, a spokesperson for the Rhode Island Department of Administration, which includes the state office, said in an emailed response that the budget office has worked to bolster agency performance reporting, which now includes 244 separate measures aligned with Gov. Dan McKee’s long-term, RI 2030 state plan. Annual reports are published online, alongside quarterly updates, Gomes said. 
“The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is committed to providing timely and accurate information about its roles in terms of developing the Governor’s annual budget proposal and collecting performance metrics from state agencies,” Gomes said. “OMB regularly posts information on state websites to include up-to-date agency budget instructions, quarterly budget reports, and agency performance data.”
McKee’s office did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment Wednesday. McKee let the spending plan take effect July 1 without his signature, an unprecedented move meant to symbolize his concerns with increased state taxes and fees.
Legislative leaders continued to defend state spending in a joint statement Wednesday.
“We have a responsibility as elected leaders to invest in health care, education and housing for Rhode Islanders, especially as Republicans in Congress cut federal support for Medicaid and other programs to states,” House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and Senate President Valarie Lawson said.
They are still reviewing RIPEC’s comments about public transparency, Larry Berman, a spokesperson for Shekarchi’s office, said via email.
The $14.3 billion fiscal 2026 budget features a record $5.81 billion in state general revenue, up 3.8% over the fiscal 2025 budget even though the total bottom line is less.
The state share of spending is 13.8% higher than fiscal 2019, even when accounting for inflation, according to RIPEC’s analysis. 
Meanwhile, the fiscal 2026 budget imposed new or higher taxes and fees on gasoline, property sales, high-value second homes, and health insurance, cementing the need for more open information sharing on how the extra funds are being spent, said Michael DiBiase, president and CEO of RIPEC.
“The tax burden has been going up, and people are paying for these things,” DiBiase said in an interview Wednesday. “It’s time to reflect on what we are getting for that money.”

A veiled process 
As a former state administration director under then-Gov. Gina Raimondo, DiBiase is more familiar than most with the behind-the-scenes components of the state budget process.
Each year, state agencies submit an initial funding request to state budget-crunchers. The memos span hundreds of pages, with details on how agencies spent the last year’s money, and justification on requests for more. The submissions are reviewed internally and used to shape the governor’s initial spending plan, typically released at the beginning of the calendar year. Lawmakers then update and revise the governor’s proposal to finalize a spending plan ahead of the July 1 start date.
Agency budget submissions are available by request, but not otherwise released publicly. And follow-up reporting is also kept behind closed doors.
“That’s a choice,” DiBiase said. “Politically, it’s more difficult to expose some of these things and talk about things that are working and not working.”
But difficult choices must be made, especially as state revenue growth slows and federal budget cuts curtail aid to key programs like Medicaid and food assistance.










The tax burden has been going up, and people are paying for these things. It’s time to reflect on what we are getting for that money.


– Michael DiBiase, president and CEO of the Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council


Rhode Island House fiscal advisory staff projected a $304.3 million deficit for the next fiscal year, swelling to $462.1 million. The forecast does not include any impact from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which is expected to bring major changes to federal health and social services aid, as well as tax changes, over the next five years.
How Rhode Island will fare amid forthcoming federal budget cuts remains under review by RIPEC and separately by a set of governmental advisory groups mandated to study and prepare for possible funding changes, reporting back to the Rhode Island General Assembly by Oct. 31.
Among the biggest sources of concern for state lawmakers and budget analysts is how changes to federal Medicaid eligibility and funding will affect Rhode Island. The $4.9 billion in Medicaid funding included in Rhode Island’s fiscal 2026 budget (from both federal and state sources) is more than one-third of the bottom line. Medicaid funding has steadily risen over the last eight years even though Rhode Islanders participation in the government-subsidized health care program fell, according to RIPEC’s report. 
Medicaid costs keep rising
The $1.82 billion in state revenue directed toward Medicaid in fiscal 2026 is more than twice the 3.8% annual growth in state revenue. The spending includes extra money to increase reimbursement rates for primary care providers, nursing home workers, and hospitals in an attempt to lessen the gap between Rhode Island’s low rates and the higher rates in neighboring states. Yet DiBiase questioned if more money was actually solving the problem, noting that commercial insurers have also proposed double-digit rate increases for next year.
“It just doesn’t seem like the system is finding any relief,” DiBiase said. “We’re not really seeing, for the most part, where this money is going.”
RIPEC’s budget analysis also pointed to funding for K-12 education, despite fewer students, and on state employees (largely due to new bargaining agreements that include salary hikes and other benefits) as areas in need of more public financial reporting and reined-in spending.
The report largely centered on what’s wrong with state spending, and how to improve it. But RIPEC also offered praise to a pair of provisions tucked into the fiscal 2026 spending plan that will already make small strides in improving financial reporting. First, a change in the state Office of Internal Audit — in name and function — that expands the administrative power to subpoena and investigate potential fraud in state assistance programs, and recover misappropriated money. The fiscal 2026 budget offers $1.2 million extra money for two additional staffers to carry out the work of the rechristened Office of Internal Audit and Program Integrity.
The current year’s spending plan also provides a policy change to let the state Division of Taxation more effectively crack down on scofflaws with unpaid and overdue income and business taxes by putting levies on their assets. The access to out-of-state tax delinquents’ bank accounts, coupled with the ability to put levies on their assets, is expected to bring in an extra $5.3 million in revenue this year.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Nurses working at UnityPoint hospitals in Des Moines submitted a request Wednesday for voluntary recognition of a union, calling for the health care system to provide safer work space, better wages, and adequate staffing.
A group of UnityPoint nurses, supporters and Democratic candidates gathered near the entrance of the UnityPoint Health complex in Des Moines, calling for the hospital network to voluntarily recognize the union and begin negotiations as soon as possible. Alex Wilken, a critical care nurse, told the crowd he and two other nurses had returned from delivering a letter to UnityPoint executives requesting voluntary recognition through a card check agreement.
The proposed “United Nurses of Iowa” union would be comprised of nurses who work at Iowa Methodist Medical Center, Blank Children’s Hospital, Methodist West Hospital and Iowa Lutheran Hospital, four UnityPoint hospitals in the Des Moines metropolitan area. The union, which is organizing through Teamsters Local 90, would represent about 2,000 nurses at the bargaining table.

At the Wednesday event, several nurses said union representation was needed because UnityPoint leaders are not addressing their needs as workers. Nurses called for higher wages and benefits to be competitive with other states and retain their workforce, and for UnityPoint to hire more nurses to deal with staff shortages that could put patients in danger. Several also said UnityPoint is not meeting nurses’ safety needs as they face dangerous situations while working with patients and visitors.
Sammi Ladd, a critical care unit nurse at the Iowa Methodist Medical Center, said a union was needed because “we are quite literally fighting for our lives.”
She said she was assaulted by a critically ill patient in the hospital’s Intensive Care Unit two months ago that left her with bruises and has faced numerous instances of violence, including having remotes and lights thrown at her while she was 32 weeks pregnant. Another emergency room nurse, Ladd said, was recently stabbed by a patient. The nurse “did everything in her power to avoid harm, but because her concerns were either ignored or downplayed, she will have to carry that physical, mental and emotional trauma with her for the rest of her life.”
“UnityPoint is aware of these incidents, and instead of finding ways to keep us safe, we are being forced to work short-staffed, while simultaneously caring for sicker and sicker patients,” Ladd said. “Instead of hiring more nurses to help us, UnityPoint is paying $450 an hour to outside consultants that are trying to convince nurses to fight against these unions.”
UnityPoint CCU nurse Gail Grimes said as nurses have expressed their frustrations to UnityPoint and moved toward unionization, the health care company has hired outside consultants, like Crossroads Group Labor Relation and C Hunt Management Consulting, to work to persuade individual nurses to oppose a union. Leaders at UnityPoint have also held listening and dialogue sessions with nurses, Grimes said, which have not resulted in the changes workers say are needed.
“They come in and tell us things that they would like to improve, but they’re almost certainly never the things that we’re asking for,” Grimes said. “We’re asking to have metal detectors put in at the entrances instead, they’re like, ‘We bought you 150 new chairs.’ It’s kind of like, well, that’s not going to keep us in a weapon-free environment. So just a lot of our requests falling on deaf ears.”
While the letter was intended to be delivered to Scott Kizer, the CEO of UnityPoint, Wilken said Kizer was not present, and the letter was given to Jon Rozenfeld, market president of UnityPoint Health Des Moines. Wilken said Rozenfeld directly told them he would not recognize the union — meaning the nurses plan to file for an election.
UnityPoint did not respond to a request for comment.
Grimes said the union will be filing for an official vote with a National Labor Relations Board. Calling an election requires 30% of the employees in the bargaining group have to signed an interest card, which she said the nurses union has surpassed.
Several Democrats running for the U.S. Senate and House came to the event to show support for the union, including Iowa Sen. Zach Wahls, D-Coralville and former Knoxville Chamber of Commerce director Nathan Sage, both running for Senate, as well as former Iowa House Minority Leader Jennifer Konfrst, who is running in Iowa’s 3rd Congressional District.
Konfrst said she believed union protections are necessary to keep nurses safe, saying Lorena Schulte, an Anamosa State Penitentiary nurse who was killed in 2021 by two inmates, “would still be alive today if she had had strong union protections when she was at Anamosa and she was caring for patients.”
“These people don’t deserve that,” Konfrst said. “They deserve better. Let me tell you this right now: This is what democracy looks like. Don’t wait for that to give it to you. Take it from them. That’s what it takes. They’re not going to voluntarily give up their money unless it’s to a union-busting firm.”
Wahls was endorsed by Teamsters Local 90, the union representing the UnityPoint nurses. On Monday, he was  endorsed by Ironworkers Local 89, a Cedar Rapids union.
Wahls, who is running for the seat currently held by U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst, said supporting labor is a key component of his campaign. He said his track record as a state legislator shows his support for organized labor, and that if elected to serve in Washington, he would vote in support of the PRO (Protecting the Right to Organize) Act, a bill that would expand some workers’ rights to unionization and bargaining. Passing this bill would strengthen the ability of workers like the UnityPoint nurses to have their contracts approved faster and create penalties for employers that engage in illegal retaliatory practices related to organizing, he said.
“We know that we have a broken economy that’s working great for the people at the very top, but not for the rest of us,” Wahls said. “One of the best ways that you can level the playing field is by joining a union and being able to bargain collectively, prepare contract better wages, better workplace protections and better benefits. … It is so important that workers have democracy in the workplace the same way that we have democracy in our politics — that’s what this is all about.”
Sage also said he supports the PRO Act and would work to support workers and unions if elected to the Senate.
“I think at the end of the day, it’s working alongside labor unions to give them more negotiating powers,” Sage said. “… The PRO Act obviously needs to be passed to give labor unions the strength they need to be able to work for the workers that they represent.”

In July, Alachua School Board Vice Chair Tina Certain asked a public commenter, Jeremy Clepper, to leave the room after he caused what board members called a disruption. Before deputies could escort the man from the room, the district’s attorney advised against removing him. The board then went into recess.
During a Board of Education meeting Wednesday, public commenters, state board members, and the chair and vice chair of the Alachua County board took turns explaining their perspectives on a First Amendment concern that arose out of the county board meeting in late July. 
Certain, presiding at the time, maintained that all speakers had been granted time to speak and that she called for Clepper’s removal after he began shouting on his way back to his seat, and that he had disrupted the meeting earlier. 
“At all times, I upheld the board’s obligation to allow public input and to maintain order,” Certain said, adding that she hoped to clarify “significant mischaracterizations” of the events. 
“He was recognized, he spoke, and he was heard. He was allowed to use his full two minutes to express his personal views, many of which were sharply critical of the board members. … He was not silenced, he was not removed during or immediately after his comments,” Certain said. 
The state board voted to approve the recommendation Education Commissioner Anastasios Kamoutsas proposed: That there is probable cause that Alachua officials did not comply with parental freedom of speech protections and that board members should participate in free-speech training. 
Additionally, the state will monitor the board during the new school year “to ensure that there is not another violation of First Amendment rights for parents in that district.”
If the board finds violations, it will deny Alachua board members their paychecks. 
“This is the moment to restore trust in the Alachua County School Board, to reinforce the First Amendment and parents’ rights, promote transparency, and ensure that parents and students are not silenced when they speak up,” Kamoutsas said. 
In a letter Kamoutsas wrote to Alachua board Chair Sarah Rockwell on Aug. 1, he said “all members should be held accountable for creating an environment where citizens’ constitutional rights are under attack,” going on to say that he has found probable cause that state laws were violated during the meeting.

The comment
Clepper attended the Alachua meeting shortly after Rockwell came under criticism for a social media comment she made after pro wrestler and GOP figure Hulk Hogan died. 
“Oh did Hulk die? I didn’t even know. Good. One less MAGA in the world,” Rockwell commented online about the wrestler who spoke during the 2024 Republican National Convention. 
Since the Alachua meeting in question, board members underwent a public comment training session and Rockwell made public apologies for her remark, which she maintains is protected speech. 
“Chair Rockwell, I’m proud that you owned up to it and apologized for those comments,” state board member Daniel Foganholi said. “But I believe that this shouldn’t be about politics and, again, we get caught up in a situation talking about something that is not about our students. These are adult problems that we’re spending time on. Literacy is nonpartisan, student achievement is nonpartisan.” 
Earlier this summer, the board called the Hillsborough County superintendent to defend that district’s review of library books.
“If this would have happened to a left-leaning parent, we would have done the same thing, let me make that abundantly clear,” Kamoutsas said. 
During the state board meeting, public commenters filled the room in support of and in opposition to taking action against Alachua County, one of the few Democratic-majority counties in the state. 
Tim Marden, mayor of Newberry and chair of the Alachua Republican Party, spoke during the public comment period. 
“Y’all are completely over the target here, 100%,” Marden said. “This is just a symptom of greater disease that we have going on in the school board of Alachua County. The reason there’re not more conservatives in that room is because of the toxic environment that has been created in and outside of these meetings.”
The Florida Education Association slammed the state board’s action.
“The Governor’s playbook was in full display today when the school board discussed protecting parents’ rights, but in practice, are only concerned about the rights of those who agree with them,” the FEA said in a news release. “There’s no better example of that than the Florida Department of Education’s effort to ban books, censor learning, and dictate whose voices and stories are allowed in our schools.”

Trump called states ""merely an ‘agent’ for the federal government in counting and tabulating the votes,"" Hageman disagrees.
The post Gray, Wyoming Freedom Caucus back Trump plans to ban mail-in ballots, voting machines appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming’s chief elections officer is backing the Trump administration’s plans to restrict how voters are able to cast their ballots ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. 
In a lengthy Truth Social post on Monday morning, President Donald Trump announced he would “lead a movement” to stop states from using mail-in ballots and voting machines.
“Remember, the States are merely an ‘agent’ for the Federal Government in counting and tabulating the votes,” Trump wrote. “They must do what the Federal Government, as represented by the President of the United States, tells them, FOR THE GOOD OF OUR COUNTRY, to do.”
Such an executive order is likely to face legal challenges — the U.S. Constitution vests the power to determine the “times, places, and manner” of elections with the states. That was the case with Trump’s earlier executive order that would have required documentary proof of U.S. citizenship to register to vote. A federal court temporarily halted the order in April. 
Shortly after Trump’s announcement Monday, Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray said he was in “complete and total support” of the president’s plans. 
“The election integrity measures President Trump outlined are very important and are supported by the people,” Gray wrote in a press release, pointing to similar legislation Wyoming lawmakers voted to sponsor last week.

The Wyoming Freedom Caucus also expressed its support on Monday. 
“Here in Wyoming, we’ve already led the way in advancing President Trump’s agenda by requiring documentary proof of U.S. citizenship to vote, enhancing voter list maintenance statutes, and banning ranked choice voting,” the caucus wrote in a post on Facebook.  
The caucus said it “will prioritize” pen-and-paper ballots as the default in Wyoming but stopped short of spelling out its stance on mail-in ballots. 
Meanwhile, Gov. Mark Gordon “continues to believe that Wyoming has the most secure elections in the nation,” Michael Pearlman, spokesperson for Gordon, told WyoFile. 
“I appreciate the President’s concerns and recognize that our Constitution chooses a Republican form of government over a centralized one,” Gordon wrote in a statement. 
Both the primary and general elections in Wyoming were unanimously certified by the state canvassing board — a committee on which both Gray and Gordon sit. Ahead of last November’s election, almost 90% of Wyoming adults said they expected their county’s tally of ballots for president in the 2024 election to be very or somewhat reliable, according to a University of Wyoming survey. 
Local election officials also say voter fraud is exceedingly rare.

Lawmakers, however, have spent considerable time and resources in recent years aiming to revamp the state’s election system. Forty-five election-related bills were filed in the 2025 legislative session and one committee may choose to sponsor as many as 10 new bills modeled on failed 2025 bills in next year’s session. 
If Trump’s agenda is enacted — whether through an executive order or legislation at the state level — Wyoming’s elections could look dramatically different for some voters. 
Absentee voting, which accounts for both mail-in and early voting in Wyoming, is popular amongst Equality State residents. At least 45% of the state’s registered voters cast their ballots absentee in the most recent election.
Most states, including Wyoming, allow voters to request ballots that they can fill out at home and mail in or deliver via official dropboxes. Secretary Gray has been pushing to eliminate drop boxes in Wyoming, going so far as to say that state law does not currently allow for them. While county clerks have not taken a stance on banning ballot drop boxes, they have defended them as a longstanding, legal method for people to cast their ballots. Eight states and Washington, D.C., meanwhile, allow elections to be handled entirely by mail. Oregon, for example, credits its vote-by-mail system as increasing voter turnout and security.
As for voting machines, only Laramie County, the state’s most populous county, relies on them. More specifically, the county uses “express voting,” which has voters use a touchscreen to select their candidates. The machine then prints a ballot of their selections to be tabulated. But if they so wish, Laramie County voters may request a pen-and-paper ballot. 
Wyoming’s other 22 counties already use pen-and-paper ballots as the default. 
At the most recent Joint Corporations, Elections and Political Subdivisions Committee, lawmakers debated the extent to which the federal government should play a role in Wyoming’s elections. 
Amid discussion on a bill to ban ballot drop boxes, Gray told the committee that such a policy “is a huge priority of the Trump administration.” 
Gray also said returning ballots via the postal service is “more secure and regulated” than ballot drop boxes. 
Soon thereafter, Jackson Democrat Rep. Mike Yin recalled Gray’s opposition to previous executive orders related to elections, including one during the Biden administration.  
“I think it was just two years ago we were talking about, ‘Why would we ever federalize our elections?’” Yin said. “So I do want to take issue with the, ‘Oh, this is the federal administration’s position, so this is my position, too.’”
“And I’m curious whether you think that our elections should be decided by Wyoming or should they be decided by D.C.?,” Yin said. 
Gray responded that he’d long opposed “the Biden-Obama-Harris attempt” to decrease rural post office services, which can deliver absentee ballots. When Yin interrupted to ask that “federal personalities” be kept out of the conversation, committee co-chairman Sen. Cale Cale, R-Lander, called a point of order. 
“We don’t need to drag in all the world’s politics into this discussion,” Case said. 
After last week’s meeting, Yin told WyoFile he’s “happy to get advice from the federal government if they want to find ways for us to have more people vote.”
“I think that can be a shared goal between the state and federal government,” Yin said. “But if the federal government is going to start dictating ways for us to prevent people from voting, I don’t think the federal government should be telling the state what to do.”
Several hours after Trump’s announcement, Wyoming U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman held a town hall in Casper. 
A constituent asked Hageman, a staunch ally of the president, about Trump’s forthcoming executive order. 
“So elections are run by the states,” Hageman said. “So I don’t know that President Trump is going to succeed at that.”

The U.S. Service has already corrected the violations that “needed to be immediately addressed,” according to the Department of Ecology. 
If leaking or damaged packages contain materials such as insecticides, propane, paints, or cleaning products, the facility is required to properly identify the substances, assess the related hazards, and then safely store and dispose of the waste.
The Postal Service has 30 days to pay the penalty or appeal to the state Pollution Control Hearings Board.
The penalty is due to several violations of dangerous waste laws that inspectors found at the facility in 2024. 
Those violations include failure to identify dangerous waste; failure to safely store dangerous waste; failure to properly manage waste like batteries and fluorescent bulbs; and failure to maintain personnel training records. 
The Department of Ecology noted that containers awaiting disposal were often unlabeled and stored in crowded areas. 
Inspections completed at the facility in 2018, 2019, 2022 and 2024 all found deficiencies in how the Seattle Bulk Mail Center was identifying and storing packages containing dangerous wastes, according to the Department of Ecology. 
Inspectors also reportedly found that hazardous wastes from regular operations and vehicle maintenance at the facility were also an issue. 
The U.S. Postal Service has corrected issues related to all four violations, such as changing how they store dangerous materials, safely disposing of their accumulated waste, and recording their weekly inspections, according to an Ecology spokesperson. 
There are other compliance issues, such as a training plan for employees that they are continuing to work on with Ecology, the spokesperson said. 
“We expect businesses that generate hazardous waste to take the regulations seriously,” said Christa Colouzis, Northwest Region manager for Ecology’s Hazardous Waste and Toxics Reduction program.

Photo by Madison McVan/Minnesota Reformer.Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison sued the Trump administration for the 35th time this year, this time alleging that the federal government is illegally placing conditions on funds for services and resources for crime victims.
Ellison joined 20 other attorneys general in filing the suit. 
The Victims of Crime Act, signed by President Ronald Regan in 1984, created grant programs to pay for victim and witness advocacy services; emergency shelter; medical, funeral, and burial expenses; crime scene cleanup; sexual assault forensic exams; and more. 
This year, the U.S. Department of Justice, which administers the program, imposed new conditions on the grants, mandating that they may not be used for “any program or activity that, directly or indirectly, violates (or promotes or facilitates the violation of) federal immigration law…including by failing to…give access to DHS agents, or honor DHS requests and provide requested notice to DHS agents.”
In other words, states — and the organizations that provide crime victim services, like domestic violence shelters, rape crisis centers, child advocacy centers  — can’t access the funds without agreeing to cooperate with President Donald Trump’s immigration priorities.
“Crime victims deserve so much better than to be used as political leverage, so I am filing a lawsuit to put an end to that and make sure victims get the support and compensation they deserve,” Ellison said in a press release. 
Over the past four years, Minnesota has received an average of nearly $2 million per year in Victims of Crime Act grants. Last year, grant recipients served more than 115,000 individuals in Minnesota, according to DOJ data.
The lawsuit alleges that the DOJ violated the Administrative Procedure Act, which requires federal agencies to work within the language of the law approved by Congress — the Victims of Crime Act makes no mention of immigration. 
The lawsuit also accuses the federal government of violating the separation of powers outlined in the Constitution by refusing to spend money allocated by Congress.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/P1130286-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-20 16:56:52.851165

(Photo by Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)Two pipeline companies are competing for a financial guarantee of up to $500 million from the North Dakota government to bring natural gas to the eastern half of the state.
The North Dakota Industrial Commission is expected to decide on Thursday which project to back.
The state wants more pipeline capacity to help oil and gas operators in the Bakken reach customers in the east, said North Dakota Pipeline Authority Executive Director Justin Kringstad. Right now, eastern North Dakota gets its natural gas from one source — the Viking Gas Transmission pipeline, which brings gas down from Canada. 
A pipeline connecting the area to the west would support economic development as well as make the power supply in the east more secure, Kringstad said.
“There’s long been a risk in having a single source of supply,” he said.
A west-to-east natural gas pipeline also would benefit Bakken oil producers. As Bakken wells age, they produce a higher percentage of natural gas. Inadequate natural gas pipeline capacity could cause producers to cut back on oil production — which would reduce state oil tax revenue.
The state has had a program to encourage businesses to increase natural gas pipeline capacity since 2007, but it went unfunded for years. The Legislature in 2023 made $30 million per year in financing available. The 2025 Legislature then voted to increase this amount to $50 million per year. The state’s support was essential to get companies interested in the project, Kringstad said.
WBI Energy and Intensity Infrastructure Partners put their hats in the ring for the contract. Representatives from both companies pitched their vision for the pipeline project in July presentations to the Industrial Commission, which consists of the governor, attorney general and agriculture commissioner.

WBI Energy proposes building the first phase of the new pipeline from McKenzie County to Washburn, and the second phase from Washburn to Mapleton, just west of Fargo. The company would also build out an extension from Jamestown to Ellendale, home to a data center. WBI’s timeline is to have phase one in service in November 2029, and phase two in service in November of 2030.
WBI’s project, known as Bakken East, is expected to transport about 1 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day to eastern North Dakota, Kringstad said, noting the initial designs could change as the project progresses. North Dakota produces more than 3 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day.
WBI’s pipeline would be built entirely in North Dakota but would be considered an interstate pipeline because it connects with other pipelines that leave the state. That means it would be permitted by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, not the North Dakota Public Service Commission.
Intensity Infrastructure Partners pitched a pipeline that would first extend from Watford City to Underwood in phase one, and then connect Underwood to Casselton in phase two. Intensity said it would aim to finish the first leg of the project by July 1, 2029, and the second phase by Jan. 1, 2030. The capacity to central North Dakota would be about 1.1 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas. The capacity to eastern North Dakota would be about 430 million cubic feet of natural gas per day, expandable to 875 million cubic feet, Kringstad said.
However, Intensity officials told the Industrial Commission the second phase of the project is not yet firm. Intensity is seeking up to $50 million per day from the state for phase one of the project, or $30 million per year for a smaller version of phase one.  
The Intensity project would be considered an intrastate pipeline, which means it would be regulated by the North Dakota Public Service Commission. It also would require some certificates from FERC for connections with other interstate pipelines. Intensity has a partnership with Rainbow Energy, which operates Coal Creek Station at Underwood.
Gov. Kelly Armstrong, who chairs the Industrial Commission, indicated in July that the board would select a winner during its August meeting.
“We have tough decisions to make, but it’s a whole lot better than not having any decision,” Armstrong said.
After a project is selected, the state would negotiate specific terms with the company, Kringstad said. 
North Dakota is purchasing capacity on the pipeline as a financial backstop. However, the state plans to release its pipeline capacity to private businesses. WBI Energy said in its application that it’s confident a customer will want to acquire the state’s capacity. Kringstad said there are already companies expressing interest. 
If the state can’t release its capacity, another option would be for the North Dakota Pipeline Authority to work with a gas marketing firm to try to recoup the state’s investment, Kringstad said.
In a worst-case scenario, the state would provide up to $500 million, or $50 million a year for 10 years, and not be able to recoup its investment. The funding would come through a loan from the Bank of North Dakota, to be repaid with state dollars from the Strategic Investment and Improvements Fund. 
“The No. 1 goal of the program is to release that capacity back to the private sector as quickly as possible,” Kringstad said.

Young Kim in a district that could be drawn redder by Gov. Gavin Newsom’s gerrymander.,"In summary
An immigration attorney who represented an ICE-detained Orange County father of three military sons is the latest Democrat to challenge Republican Rep. Young Kim in a district that could be drawn redder by Gov. Gavin Newsom’s gerrymander. 


Democrats since 2020 have dreamed of ousting Republican Rep. Young Kim from her Orange County seat, only to watch their candidates get trounced by near double digits. 
But that hasn’t deterred Lisa Ramirez, an immigration attorney, best known for helping free a detained migrant father of three U.S. Marine sons, from jumping into the race for 2026. 
The daughter of an immigrant mother, Ramirez cited what she described as the wave of mass detentions, the lack of due process and President Donald Trump’s disregard for court orders and the rule of law as main reasons for running.
“To me, this race has fundamentally been about protecting our Constitution, our democracy, and ultimately my community,” Ramirez said in an interview with CalMatters before her campaign launch today.
Kim is one of four California incumbent congressional Republicans whose seats the nonpartisan Cook Political Report has identified as somewhat competitive. 
While she’s never held public office, Ramirez points to her decades of advocacy, legal aid and pro bono work as proof that she has the public service resume to represent Orange County in Congress. She said it was a “no brainer” that she would represent Narciso Barranco, the Orange County landscaper whose arrest by Immigrations and Customs Enforcement in June went viral after several community organizations and elected officials referred him to her office. 
“I’m kind of a fan of the underdog, if you will,” Ramirez said. “I’ve worked really hard to create a reputation that when the stakes are high and cases are really challenging, I’m kind of the go-to person.”
Ramirez joins a crowded Democratic field, which includes former Chino Valley Unified School District Board member Christina Gagnier, self-funding art dealer Esther Kim Varet, and Kim’s most recent challenger Joe Kerr, who lost the seat by more than 10 percentage points last year.
Kim has proven a formidable foe for Democratic challengers ever since California’s 40th District was redrawn from a liberal stronghold to a purple swing seat after the 2020 census. With nearly $4 million cash on hand, her eventual opponent will face an uphill battle. And that’s before Gov. Gavin Newsom’s redistricting plan, which if approved by voters on a widely anticipated Nov. 4 special election, would draw the 40th District into an even redder seat. 
But Ramirez says she plans to run no matter what voters decide on the maps.
“My commitment is to flip the seat and to contribute to the flipping of the House,” she said. “I’m in it to win this campaign, and we’ll take it regardless of the geographical boundaries.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/052418-Young-Kim-AP-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-20 15:57:08.315343

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) The Iowa Utilities Commission on Wednesday held its first monthly public commission meeting since August 2023, and heard public comment from landowners opposed to the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline.
IUC decided to resume regular public meetings shortly after Gov. Kim Reynolds vetoed a bill that would have restricted the use of eminent domain for hazardous liquid pipelines. In her veto, Reynolds also called for greater transparency in the commission through increased attendance at hearings and informational meetings. 
The commission has held meetings and public hearings scheduled for specific docket items, many of which move into closed session. Commission Chair Sarah Martz said at the top of Wednesday’s meeting that input from the public, governor and stakeholders showed there was a need to bring the public meetings back. 
“Part of this is the desire of the commission to be more transparent and have a more open decision-making process,” Martz said. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Martz said the commission additionally has plans to hold more of its deliberations and other meetings in a public format. She said more details will be released in the coming weeks. 
While the majority of public comment focused on the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline, for which the IUC granted a conditional permit  in 2024, the pipeline was only on the agenda for an update to a lawsuit. 
More than 100 landowners sued the commission over its decision to grant Summit a permit. According to a staff attorney for IUC, final briefs for all parties in the case are due later this week and oral arguments for the case will likely be set for sometime in the fall. 
Landowners in attendance, donned in their signature red shirts, thanked the commission for allowing them the public space to voice their concerns. Commissioners, per the meeting rules, did not respond to public comments.
Landowners brought up continued worries about devalued land, water use, safety and daily disruption from the pipeline project and asked the commissioners to dismiss the project’s phase two permit application and to review the permit issued for phase one. 
Colleen Tucker, a landowner from Mitchell County, said the repeated and loud outcry from Iowans shows an “overwhelming mandate” that they do not want the project. 
“I wonder how you can defend and justify the fact that Summit is given a permit to desecrate our land,” Tucker said. “We are ordinary citizens, and we are here because we love our land, our state and our country.” 
Jess Mazour, the conservation program coordinator with the Iowa chapter of the Sierra Club and an organizer with the landowners, reminded commissioners of the “immense power” they had to impact “other people’s lives” and “their legacies.” 
Mazour held up print outs of the Exhibit H documents that show the status of easements secured along Summit’s phase two route. This route would connect to additional ethanol plants along the pipeline and represent an increase of more than 300 miles of pipeline.

A spokesperson for the Iowa Utilities Commission said Exhibit H files are required documents from the IUC that show where a company does not have a voluntary easement and is requesting eminent domain. 
Mazour noted in many counties, per these exhibits, voluntary easements had not been secured along the route, which she said shows “a failing project.” 
The IUC spokesperson noted it is “very common” for a company to file Exhibit H documents and later submit withdrawals of the exhibits as it obtains more voluntary easements through negotiation. 
“The filing of Exhibit H in no way confers a right to use eminent domain,” the spokesperson said in an email.
Landowners also suggested the IUC revoke or reevaluate the permit for phase one of the project because Summit has been unable to secure a permit through South Dakota. Per the IUC, in order to begin construction on the project, Summit had to secure permits in North Dakota and South Dakota. 
Permits have been approved in North Dakota, but are tied up in litigation. South Dakota regulators have denied permit applications from the company twice, and enacted a bill this spring that restricts CO2 pipelines from using eminent domain. The company has received a permit to cross through Minnesota. 
One landowner said the setbacks in the Dakotas mean the project is a “pipeline to nowhere.”
“We all have these Iowa values that we were brought up with, working hard, integrity, taking care of others,” Mazour said to commissioners. “Remember that the decision that you three have is going to shape the lives of 1000s of Iowans, and it can be for the better, or it can be for the worse.
Summit Carbon Solutions did not respond to a request for comment.

Article Summary

The Illinois State Board of Elections fined Senate President Don Harmon $9.8 million for accepting greater campaign donations than the law allowed in 2024.
Harmon loaned his campaign money during the 2024 primary, lifting the donation cap under a “self-funding” exemption.
But the board ruled fundraising caps should have been reinstated after the March primary and Harmon should have filed a new notice of self-funding.
Harmon is appealing the fine. His attorney argued the fundraising limits should remain suspended through the 2026 election because Harmon was not on the ballot in 2024.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

CHICAGO – How long can a political candidate’s decision to loan their campaign money allow them to take unlimited donations from donors? As long as four years for a state senator, according to Senate President Don Harmon’s attorney.
The Illinois State Board of Elections had a different take earlier this year when they fined Harmon’s campaign $9.8 million following Chicago Tribune reporting that Harmon, an Oak Park Democrat, accepted $4 million more than was allowed during the 2024 election.
The donations in question involve a state law that limits contributions to campaigns during an election cycle. Under the law, a campaign becomes “self-funded” when the candidate puts more than $100,000 into the campaign. Once that happens, the candidate and their opponents are no longer subject to limits on how much people or political action committees can contribute to the campaign.
Harmon contributed $100,001 to his own campaign in January 2023. However, the State Board of Elections ruled the contribution only lifted the cap through the primary – meaning about $4 million collected after the primary was accepted improperly.
Harmon is appealing the board’s decision, and his lawyer argued in a hearing on Wednesday that the self-funding exemption should have remained in place, because Harmon’s name was not on the ballot in 2024.
While Harmon wasn’t on the ballot, legislative leaders frequently eliminate fundraising caps each election cycle to use their campaign funds to contribute to other candidates in their caucus.
Harmon’s objection
Harmon’s attorney Mike Kasper said he shouldn’t have had to make another $100,001 loan to reactivate the self-funding exemption when the primary season concluded. And it should still be in effect through the 2026 election, he argued before a State Board of Elections hearing officer.
“Once you become a candidate for that office, you remain a candidate for that office … until the election for that office,” Kasper, a long-time election law attorney for Illinois Democrats, told the hearing officer.
Though Harmon began self-funding his campaign in the middle of an election cycle in which he was not on the ballot, Kasper said reestablishing caps either after the 2024 primary or general election would establish new limits on fundraising in the middle of Harmon’s term. Though Kasper argued fundraising limits should have been off for Harmon through the 2026 election, he said at a minimum they should have been off through the entire 2024 election.
“If it’s unfair to have the caps reattached after the primary when there’s a self-funder, it seems even more unfair to apply it halfway through the election,” Kasper said. “I don’t think anyone ever intended for the caps to be put back on in the middle of an election.”
Citing the state law that allows candidates to self-fund without limits, Kasper said the board’s interpretation “stretches the statute into a pretzel I think is incomprehensible” and limits an opponent’s ability to financially compete against the self-funding candidate.
An attorney for the board declined to defend the penalty at Wednesday’s hearing.
Prior violations
The alleged 2024 violation is not the first time one of Harmon’s political committees has been fined for improperly accepting contributions.
The State Board of Elections fined the All for Justice political action committee $108,500 for not timely filing reports for how it spent more than $7 million during the 2022 campaign.
The committee, backed by Harmon, was established to help elect two Democrats to the Illinois Supreme Court. It was disbanded shortly after the fine.
Harmon currently operates three campaign accounts for his Senate seat, township committeeman position and his bid to be elected next year to the Democratic Party of Illinois’ State Central Committee.
His main account for his Senate campaign that he also uses to support other Democratic candidates for Senate had $14.5 million at the end of June, according to State Board of Elections records, meaning a $9.8 million fine would seize most of the money he has available. Harmon filed a new notice of self-funding in January after depositing another $100,001 into his campaign. However, the notice only indicates self-funding and the suspension of contribution limits through the March 2026 primary.
The State Board of Elections could rule as soon as their meeting on Sept. 16 whether Harmon will have to pay the full fine, a smaller penalty or no fine at all. The board’s ruling is likely to set a precedent for future campaigns on how long contributions limits can remain suspended in an election.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Americans are becoming well acquainted with data centers’ use of electricity via their utility bills, but the power-hungry warehouses that fuel our insatiable appetite for memes, movies, pics and posts is thirsty for an even more important resource: water. 
One large-scale data center can consume as much water as 12,000 households, according to the the Alliance for the Great Lakes.
“We are going to see more water conflicts as the data center sector expands at the same time as we see an expansion of irrigated agriculture into areas that haven’t needed it as much,” said Helena Volzer, a water policy manager for Alliance for the Great Lakes, in an interview. 
A Minnesota Department of Natural Resources order temporarily barring new or expanded irrigation allowances along Little Rock Creek portends broader conflicts over groundwater use across the Great Lakes region, the Alliance said in a report released Wednesday. 
The DNR’s April 2024 order found “substantial evidence” that agricultural irrigation and other authorized uses harmed the Mississippi River tributary, which runs along the boundary of Benton and Morrison counties in central Minnesota. Elsewhere in the region, proposed mines, factories and data centers threaten to deplete the underground aquifers that supply up to 40% of the Great Lakes’ volume — and drinking water reserves for nearly three-quarters of Minnesotans. 
Climate change, the artificial intelligence race, and pressure to mine and manufacture more on U.S. soil mean “we are seeing a convergence of increasing water demand from different sources,” said Volzer, who spent a year compiling the report. 
Data centers with evaporative cooling systems, in particular, can consume vast amounts of water. Though most of Minnesota lies outside the Great Lakes basin, Volzer said the concerns raised in the report apply to other major watersheds, too.
Minnesota statute allows the DNR to limit groundwater appropriations in designated groundwater management areas. But it can only take that step after determining that groundwater draws hurt nearby surface waters, as it did last year in the Little Rock Creek case, or when “there are competing demands among existing and proposed users which exceed the reasonably available waters,” Volzer said in the report.
That restricts the DNR to act only in situations where actual or proposed water withdrawals clearly impact people and businesses. In her report, Volzer advised Minnesota lawmakers to expand the state’s groundwater protection law to let the DNR intervene when water appropriations are “likely” to impact surface or groundwater reserves.
State legislators passed a series of water protection laws earlier this decade after a Lakeville-based rail company proposed shipping 500 million gallons of Dakota County groundwater each year to the U.S. Southwest, said state Rep. Rick Hansen, DFL-South St. Paul. (The DNR shot down that proposal.)
Proactive measures will help states like Minnesota get ahead of a fast-growing IT industry whose environmental impacts remain unclear, Volzer said. 
In her report, Volzer advised states to fund studies of expected water demand and groundwater resources, while expanding water use reporting requirements. That could give state and local authorities more insight into where large IT facilities could be located without unduly stressing aquifers, she told the Reformer.
The ag industry’s political sway could complicate further legislation to manage Minnesota’s groundwater, Hansen said.
“Big Ag makes water law changes hard because some legislators are susceptible to ‘cropaganda,’” he said.
Thirsty data centers have already caused political backlash in Georgia, where residents on private wells near Atlanta say a new Meta facility has rendered their water “undrinkable.” 
Meta is spending $800 million to build another data center in Rosemount, southeast of the Twin Cities. The city says that facility could draw 100,000 gallons of groundwater per day at peak capacity, or one Olympic swimming pool every six days, the Star Tribune reported in April. 
Data centers proposed for Chaska and Farmington could use 15 and 24 times more than Meta’s Rosemount hub, the Strib reported, though Chaska’s water manager assured the paper that the city can handle the added demand.
“We don’t have a good sense of the water footprint of a data center right now,” Volzer said. That’s due to the fact that data center developers require city officials to sign nondisclosure agreements before moving forward, she said, and because data center designs vary widely and continue to evolve. 
Newer designs favor closed-loop or waterless liquid cooling systems that are more economical than evaporative water cooling. The catch, Volzer said, is that those systems may require more electricity to run pumps, fans and heat exchangers, increasing demand on nearby thermal power plants fueled by coal, gas or uranium.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-20 19:08:27+00:00,CT Mirror,ICE arrests 65 people in CT in four-day operation,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/20/ice-arrests-65-people-in-ct/,The announcement comes after people in Western Connecticut cities warned about increased federal immigration enforcement activity last week.,"Officials from Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s New England Office announced Wednesday that they had arrested 65 immigrants in Connecticut in a four-day operation dubbed “Operation Broken Trust.” 
The announcement comes after advocates in multiple cities in Western Connecticut alerted residents and organized protests about increased federal immigration enforcement activity last week. 
Last Thursday, immigration advocates held a rally in Stamford to protest recent ICE activity in the city. Two men were reportedly arrested at the Stamford Superior Courthouse on Aug. 11. According to reporting by CT Public, the two men were there for a follow-up appointment after being the victims of an armed robbery. 
The group Greater Danbury Unites for Immigrants said in a Thursday release that federal agents have been seen at the courthouse on a regular basis. The group says that on Aug. 12, six people were arrested on their way to work, and an additional four were arrested on Aug. 13. On Aug. 14, two people were allegedly arrested at Danbury Superior Court. 
Videos posted on social media show confrontations between advocacy groups and ICE agents in the parking lot of Danbury Superior Court, as the officials arrest a man and a woman. The videos show a group of officers dressed in tactical gear, some of whom wore masks. 
According to ICE, 29 of the 65 people arrested had been either charged with or convicted of “serious crimes.” Of the 13 people named in the release, five were arrested in Stamford, two in Norwalk, and six in Danbury. Some of the 13 people identified in the release had been convicted of crimes, including drug possession, sexual assault, DUI and larceny, according to ICE. Others were facing charges, including assault, breach of peace, and carrying a dangerous weapon. 
It isn’t clear from the release how many of the 65 people arrested had been convicted of crimes.
In Norwalk, ICE officers sat in the parking lot of the police department on Thursday and Friday. Mayor Harry Rilling and Police Chief James Walsh put out a statement on Friday saying that ICE had not been authorized to sit in the parking lot and that they were asked to leave on both days. Rilling said during a press conference on Friday that the police department was not working with ICE. 
Walsh said that he and Rilling had a long conversation with federal authorities to “voice their displeasure” about ICE officers’ using the parking lot. Walsh told The Connecticut Mirror on Wednesday that he did not know of any additional ICE activity this week.
Police in Danbury, Norwalk and Stamford all told CT Mirror that they were not aware of “Operation Broken Trust” and that they did not know the number of people who were arrested or detained by ICE. 
A video posted to social media showed two brothers, Ricardo and Leonard Chavez, tased and arrested by ICE agents in Norwalk in the middle of the street. Walsh said at the press conference that police had removed a vehicle with smashed windows from Main Street. 
ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations Boston acting Field Office Director Patricia H. Hyde criticized Connecticut’s Trust Act, which prohibits local and state law enforcement from cooperating with ICE, unless the person has been convicted of certain serious crimes, is on the federal terrorist list or is the subject of a judicial warrant.
“Sanctuary legislation like Connecticut’s Trust Act only endangers the communities it claims to protect. Such laws only force law enforcement professionals to release criminal alien offenders back into the very communities they have already victimized,” Hyde told Fox News.
This year, the Trust Act was modified to allow individuals to sue over alleged violations of the law but also expanded the situations in which officials can comply with federal immigration detainers — and not be subject to such litigation. Sexual assault, injury or risk of injury to a child, strangulation, burglary with a firearm, possessing child sexual abuse material, enticing or sexually exploiting a minor and violating a protective order are now crimes that allow Connecticut law enforcement to hand someone over to ICE. 
On Aug. 13, U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi sent a letter to Gov. Ned Lamont in which she said that Connecticut had been placed on a list of jurisdictions that “engages in sanctuary policies and practices that thwart federal immigration enforcement to the detriment of the interests of the United States.” 
She asked Lamont to confirm “your commitment to complying with federal law and identif[y] the immediate initiatives you are taking to eliminate laws, policies, and practices that impede federal immigration enforcement.”
Lamont wrote back that Connecticut law does not stop federal immigration enforcement from carrying out operations. He also criticized the federal government for practices like arresting people at courthouses, which he said make it more difficult for law enforcement officers to do their jobs. 
“We all agree that violent criminals should be arrested, prosecuted, and, when appropriate, deported, which is why Connecticut law facilitates law enforcement working with federal officers in those instances. Unfortunately, DHS’s current deportation tactics undermine legitimate law enforcement by instilling fear among residents and interfering in the orderly functioning of our state courts,” the letter reads. 
In a statement to CT Mirror, Rob Blanchard, a spokesperson for Lamont, underscored that Connecticut is not a “sanctuary” state — a term that he said has no legal definition. 
“As [Operation Broken Trust] proves, nothing in Connecticut law prevented immigration officials from conducting these enforcement efforts, contrary to their own agency’s assertions,” Blanchard said. 
Sen. Rob Harding, R-Brookfield, and Sen. Rob Sampson, R-Wolcott, called the ICE operation “excellent news.” 
“Connecticut’s streets are now safer. Violent offenders are now in custody. The federal government clearly has taken note of Connecticut’s super-sanctuary policies, even though Gov. Lamont and Democrats really, really don’t want the term ‘sanctuary state’ applied to our state,” they said in a statement. 
Rep. Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford, the House Minority Leader, also praised ICE for its “successful operation targeting and removing criminals from our communities” while criticizing Connecticut’s policies, which he said “provide sanctuary for individuals with extensive criminal histories, including members of transnational gangs.”
“Connecticut residents want and deserve leadership that puts their safety first by working cooperatively with federal authorities to ensure that those who pose threats to our communities are captured and removed,” he said in a statement.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025_0820_SR_FairfieldCourthouse_008-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-20 15:57:08.315343

Thompson Federal Courthouse in Nashville. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout) NASHVILLE — Lawyers for Kilmar Abrego Garcia are asking a federal judge in Tennessee to dismiss human smuggling charges against him, calling the case a clear example of “selective and vindictive prosecution” by the Trump administration.
In a motion filed late Tuesday, just days ahead of Abrego’s expected pretrial release, the attorneys conceded their argument to dismiss the case is “infrequently made and rarely succeeds.”
“But if there has ever been a case for dismissal on those grounds, this is that case,” they wrote. “The government is attempting to use this case — and this Court — to punish Mr. Abrego for successfully fighting his unlawful removal. That is a constitutional violation of the most basic sort.”
The government has not yet filed a legal response. “The United States’ position is set forth in Mr. McGuire’s statements in court and our pleadings,” a spokesperson for Acting U.S. Attorney Robert McGuire said in an email Wednesday.
The 35-page petition seeking to dismiss all charges narrates a chain of events that began with Abrego’s detention by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in March, while driving with his son in Maryland, through his deportation days later to a Salvadoran prison. Abrego remained for months in the notorious maximum security CECOT prison, despite the admission by a government attorney he had been sent there in error. 
Abrego has subsequently claimed he was tortured while in CECOT. 
‘A wide-ranging and unprecedented retribution campaign’ 
Attorneys for Abrego challenged his removal to El Salvador for lack of due process in a separate lawsuit filed in federal court in Maryland, where the 29-year-old sheet metal apprentice had been living with his wife and children.
“The government did not take steps to fix its mistake,” his Tennessee lawyers wrote Tuesday. “Instead, in response to his lawsuit — and to the substantial publicity it received — the government undertook a wide-ranging and unprecedented retribution campaign against Mr. Abrego.” 
The human smuggling charges brought against Abrego in Tennessee are part of that campaign, his lawyers argued.

A Tennessee grand jury in June returned the indictments for “conspiracy to unlawfully transport illegal aliens for financial gain” and “unlawful transportation of illegal aliens for financial gain.” Prosecutors contend Abrego participated in a national scheme to move immigrants who entered the United States illegally to points around the country. Abrego, as his attorneys refer to him in legal filings, has pleaded not guilty.
The charges are tied to a 2022 traffic stop in Putnam County, Tenn., where Abrego was pulled over for speeding with nine passengers in the back of his car. Abrego was neither ticketed nor arrested in the stop.
A Department of Homeland Security special agent later testified he was not tasked with investigating the Tennessee traffic stop until April 28 of this year. By then, a Maryland federal judge had ordered the government to facilitate Abrego’s return to the U.S.nited States and the Supreme Court had upheld the decision. 
The government returned Abrego to Tennessee to face charges on June 6. 
Case draws national scrutiny
The case generated widespread public scrutiny of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown tactics during his initial months in office, which were criticized for undermining due process rights guaranteed to both citizens and noncitizens. 
Abrego, a Salvadoran national who entered the United States illegally as a teenager, is subject to a 2019 immigration court order that prohibits the government from deporting him to El Salvador, where he says he faces threats of gang violence.

After his wrongful deportation, administration officials, including President Donald Trump, singled out Abrego in their public comments, calling him a “gangbanger,” “monster,” “illegal predator,” “illegal alien terrorist,” “wife beater,” and “human trafficker.” 
Abrego’s attorneys accused the administration of a public smear campaign intended to paper over its embarrassment over his wrongful deportation and retaliate against his legal efforts to assert his due process rights. Abrego has denied gang affiliation. 
The administration’s public statements, Abrego’s attorneys argued, bolster their claims that the prosecution against him is retaliatory.
“The unprecedented public pronouncements attacking Mr. Abrego for his successful exercise of constitutional rights by senior cabinet members, leaders of the DOJ, and even the President of the United States, make this the rare case where actual vindictiveness is clear from the record,” they wrote.
Lawyers seek to curb Trump administration comments about the case
Earlier this month, Abrego’s attorneys sought, for a second time, a court order restricting government officials’ remarks about the case as prejudicial and contrary to standard court rules.
In response, U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw, who presides over the Tennessee criminal case, directed all “counsel and those working with counsel” to note in their public communications that Abrego is presumed innocent. 
“Our Constitution requires that Abrego is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt by a jury,” Crenshaw wrote in his July 31 order.
Separately, in response to Abrego’s attorney’s waiver of the right to a speedy trial, the court set a trial date of Jan. 27.

Abrego remains in the custody of the U.S. Marshalls, who have jurisdiction over pre-trial detainees in federal cases.
Abrego has already been cleared for release pending trial by a Tennessee magistrate, an order placed on hold at the request of his attorneys amid uncertainty over whether federal immigration officials intend to detain or deport him to a “third country.”
Abrego’s attorneys on Tuesday requested the magistrate move forward with releasing him Friday, the day the hold expires. 
The attorneys noted a Maryland federal judge has barred the government from taking Abrego into immigration custody and required immigration officials to provide 72-hours written notice before removing him to a third country. 
His Tennessee lawyers, Sean Hecker and Rascoe Dean, also wrote they are “retaining a private security firm that has experience providing court-approved pre-trial transportation and security services in criminal cases to transport Mr. Abrego from Tennessee to Maryland upon release.”  
The lawyers requested details about the security arrangements be kept under seal “in order to protect Mr. Abrego’s safety.”
A federal magistrate on Wednesday set a tentative hearing for Friday if prosecutors oppose any of the conditions of Abrego’s release sought by his attorneys.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)TAMPA — Polls from the 2024 election showed that Democrats were on the wrong side of public opinion when it came to their immigration policies.
But could a perception that the GOP has overreached to achieve President Donald Trump’s goal of mass deportations bring a correction next year? That’s apparently the philosophy several Florida Democrats are pushing, as demonstrated by their comments in Tampa on Tuesday night.
“Republican leaders are fighting communities, not crime,” said Democratic gubernatorial candidate David Jolly, speaking during an immigration forum hosted by the Hillsborough County Democratic Hispanic at the Cuban Club in Ybor City.
Jolly maintains that the GOP has gone down the wrong path by conflating undocumented immigration with crime.
“This is a contrast of values and, fundamentally, the American people understand, regardless of party registration, cruelty and broken promises,” he said. “And we’re living through an era of cruelty and broken promises. It’s not new. We’ve seen it in years past, and it has taken people to speak up and say, ‘Enough.’”
When speaking about immigrants lacking legal status, Gov. Ron DeSantis often focuses on those who have committed criminal acts, such as the immigrant accused of killing three people while trying to make an illegal U-turn in a tractor-trailer on the Florida Turnpike in Fort Pierce last week.
The Associated Press reported last month that ICE statistics showed that, as of June 29, 57,861 people had been detained by ICE, of whom 41,495 — 71.7% — had no criminal convictions. That included 14,318 people with pending criminal charges and 27,177 who are subject to immigration enforcement but have no known criminal convictions or pending charges.
The governor also boasts about how no state has done more to fulfill the president’s agenda. Those actions include legislation requiring many local and state law enforcement agencies to collaborate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in detaining and potentially deporting individuals.
It also includes building the state’s own immigration camp to hold detainees (“Alligator Alcatraz”), and the governor announced last week that a second facility will soon open in North Florida.
‘Political theatre’
Former Miami-Dade County state Sen. José Javier Rodríguez, a candidate for attorney general next year, denounced the Everglades detention center.
“If I was attorney general, what I would be focused on is going after the insurance companies,” he said. “Going after the utilities that are screwing people and taking advantage of us and getting away with anything with whatever they want in Tallahassee, right?
“Instead, we have this political theater where the only purpose is for the current attorney general and the governor to get a pat on the head by the president, and that’s what they got, right? But meanwhile, we are the ones who are left with the costs of this thing.”
Tampa Bay area Democratic U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor said U.S. immigration laws are broken and repeated a talking point made by Democrats last year blaming Trump for killing a proposed bipartisan bill dealing with immigration.
That proposal would have raised the bar for migrants to claim asylum, created a temporary procedure to shut down the border at particularly active times, and ended the practice of allowing migrants to live in the United States while waiting for their cases to be heard by an immigration judge, among other policies.
“He was the one who blocked a bipartisan immigration reform effort where we would ensure those pathways to work in citizenship exist while strengthening border security and investing in the immigration courts, to make sure things moved smoothly,” Castor said.
“So instead, right now, playing on the fears and prejudices and abusing his powers, because I think that everyone agrees that If you are not here legally and you violate the law, you’re subject to deportation. But what they’re doing now goes far beyond that.”
She added that the bulk of her work in her congressional office is dealing with “egregious case after egregious case” of people who she said were following the law but have now been detained and subject to deportation.
Joining the professional politicians on the stage were two Tampa immigration lawyers who, along with Javier Rodríguez, occasionally responded in both Spanish and English to the audience.
Expedited removal
Attorney Danielle Hernandez previously served as assistant chief counsel for the Department of Homeland Security in both the Obama and (the first) Trump administrations. She said that among the changes that the current Trump regime has enacted is expanding what is known as expedited removal.
Previously, ICE and Customs Border Patrol only used expedited removal against people within 100 miles of the border and within two weeks of their arrival in the U.S., Hernandez said. However, an executive order signed by the president in January changed that.
“They expanded that criminality and said, ‘Hey, if you came in illegally, you’re a criminal.’ Which is not true,” she said. “Coming in through the border is a civil infraction, it’s not actually a criminal action unless you re-enter through the border, then it becomes a federal crime, right? So that’s one thing that people don’t know.”
Hernandez explained that now anyone who entered the country after April 2023 is “fair game to absolutely any arrest.”
“They can go into any court, terminate your asylum proceedings, and arrest you outside. So that’s what you see on the news,” she added.
Combined with the discussion of illegal immigration on Tuesday night was talk about how Democrats have lost their share of the Latino vote in recent elections — a trend that started in Florida years ago.
“We definitely have a war against Hispanics going on in the country,” said La Gaceta editor and publisher Patrick Manteiga.
“The real problem is many of them agree with the Trump administration and helped put them into place today. I think they thought that it was some other Hispanic that was going to get picked up rather than themselves, and they were happy to close the door right behind them, and that’s a real shameful part of this whole thing.”
Jolly said that Democrats need to talk to Latino voters about something other than immigration all the time.

“The way we get them back is we speak to their true concerns that will inform their votes,” he said.
“What the other side got right in the last few cycles was they understood the anger and anxiety and they spoke to that. And it wasn’t necessarily around immigration, and we make a mistake by thinking that if I walk into a room of Black pastors, that somehow I have to speak about Black pastor issues, when their issue of getting their kid to school on time that was the same as mine. That’s where I think we have an opportunity to make up ground.”

Changing sentiments?
Polls show political sentiment may be changing, however.
A Suffolk University/WSVN-TV 7 News survey of 500 residents of Miami taken last month — 52% of whom identified as Hispanic or Latino — showed that 61% said recent ICE enforcement raids had gone too far, and 52% of respondents said recent deportations of Venezuelans, Cubans, and Argentinians living in Miami made them less likely to support President Trump going forward.
And a YouGov survey of 2,156 U.S. adult citizens published Wednesday found that 53% of Americans (and 56% of independent voters) say Trump’s approach on immigration is too harsh, with 36% saying it is “just right.” Two-thirds of those polled believe the Trump administration has wrongfully detained U.S. citizens in immigration detention centers.

Towards the end of the two-hour forum, a group of people began shouting suggestions to the panel about what do to reverse the situation.

Nearly all of the speakers on stage said, “vote.”
“What about now?” came one response.
The lack of an immediate call to action frustrated another member of the public, who said later that “we feed those communities. What do you do?”
“We cannot wait until November of next year,” cried another voice.

And he won.
Looney, who owns Bad Boy Bail Bonds in Gallatin County, took two Bozeman municipal judges to court, alleging that they had unfairly and illegally discriminated against his business.
This week, the City of Bozeman has settled with him for $100,000.
Looney’s case was notable for several reasons: First, it saw him forced to take two municipal judges to federal court, after sitting Gallatin County state judges as well as the Montana Supreme Court appeared not to find a judge willing to take the case.
The case is also notable because it marks one of the few times in the state’s history where judges haven’t been protected by judicial immunity — a far-reaching legal doctrine in which judges cannot be sued for decisions related to administering justice as judge. However, U.S. District Court Judge Donald Molloy ruled that judicial immunity didn’t necessarily allow the judges to blacklist Looney’s business.
The case is also notable because the 2025 Legislature considered it in light of a slate of judicial reform bills that Republicans had championed, but mostly fizzled out by the session’s end. The case drew broad attention, leading the national bail bonding association to call on Montana leaders and courts to remedy what it believed was a miscarriage of justice.
Meanwhile, the state’s Judicial Standards Committee also dismissed the challenge. The state’s judicial standards committee is comprised of attorneys as well as citizens who receive and evaluate complaints against sitting judges, and when appropriate, mete out disciplinary sanctions.
The challenge happened because Looney purchased the name of a former bail bond company, Bad Boy Bail Bonds, but didn’t purchase the business itself. However, several bonds issued under the name had been forfeited, and the two municipal judges — Colleen Herrington and Karolina Tierney, ordered Looney to pay the amount, $1,585, which he originally refused.
When Looney attempted to explain that the had purchased just the name and not the company or its book of business, the judges ordered that Bozeman municipal court  not accept bail bonds from Bad Boy Bail Bonds, leading him to allege that he was losing tens of thousands of dollars. At one point, other counties began to follow suit. Even after Looney paid one of the bonds under protest, the judges continued to refuse bonds, at one point asking the state’s insurance commission to revoke Looney’s bonding authority.
Herrington is running unopposed for re-election to her municipal judge position. It’s a four-year term.
Attorney Matthew Monforton, who represented Looney and his business, said that the settlement will be paid by the city’s insurance carrier.
“Mr. Looney got justice, but only by fighting a long and costly battle against two of the state’s most vindictive and unfit judges,” Monforton said to the Daily Montanan. “Mr. Looney had to wage this battle on his own because the Legislature and the JSC refused to act against this egregious judicial abuse.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/John-Looney-Bail-Bonds-1024x578.jpg,,,2025-08-20 15:57:08.315343

The transfer is made possible by the Utah State Parks Adjustment Act, a 2024 law sponsored by Utah GOP Rep. Celeste Maloy, which targeted several isolated tracks of federal land to be handed over to the state and absorbed by existing state parks. 
“Having federal lands interspersed throughout these parks has made effective management more challenging,” Maloy said after the bill passed the House last December.

(Screenshot of SCETV legislative livestream)COLUMBIA — South Carolina’s state-owned hospital system plans to take a controlling stake in a struggling Grand Strand hospital operator.
A legislative oversight committee gave the initial nod Tuesday for the Medical University of South Carolina’s hospital system to purchase a more than 50% share in Tidelands Health.
Legislators revealed, during a meeting of the Joint Bond Review Committee, that Tidelands is operating at a $50 million deficit. The private hospital company has asked MUSC to step in and help.
Neither MUSC nor Tidelands disclosed how much the deal would cost. According to the two hospital systems, negotiations are ongoing.
SC-owned hospital system set to double debt with 2 new hospitals

Tidelands employs more than 2,500 people in coastal Georgetown, Horry, and Williamsburg counties, according to its website.
“From Georgetown to Murrell’s Inlet, they’re really the only game in town,” state Sen. Stephen Goldfinch told the SC Daily Gazette. “We need it. We can’t let it fold up.”
The Murrell’s Inlet Republican said he supports the deal with MUSC.
Tidelands owns a pair of hospitals in Georgetown and Murrell’s Inlet with a total of 170 beds. It also owns a pair of medical rehab centers. And it has regulatory approval to build a small, 36-bed hospital that could treat patients in the fast-growing retirement communities surrounding Myrtle Beach.
“There are things we can do to strengthen them financially and turn them around,” MUSC Health CEO Dr. Patrick Cawley told legislators.
For example, he said MUSC has buying power and can get equipment and expensive medical records software at a reduced price.
“Our health systems have worked together to improve health care for more than a quarter century,” according to a statement from Tidelands. “A closer alignment would allow us to build on that important work and continue meeting the needs of the people and communities we serve. Patients would benefit as we recruit additional physicians, purchase leading technology and expand clinical research — delivering increased value while controlling costs.”
For nearly 200 years, MUSC had stayed largely contained to its Charleston base.
But beginning in 2019, the hospital system went on an expansion spree. It purchased four rural community hospitals in Florence, Marion, Chester and Lancaster counties.
Two years later, MUSC again expanded with the purchase of three hospitals and a standalone emergency room in the Midlands. Those hospitals, previously owned by Providence Health, had a $70 million deficit.
And in 2023, it took over operations of Orangeburg’s hospital, where there was a $30 million deficit.
MUSC was able to return Orangeburg to fiscal health within two years, Cawley said. And the Midlands hospitals are expected to be back in the black by next year — a five-year turnaround.
Cawley pointed to that track record when making his pitch to legislators.
Democratic Rep. Gilda Cobb-Hunter, whose district covers Orangeburg, praised MUSC for major improvements in the health care available to that community since the organization stepped in, including oncology, orthopedics and new treatments for sickle cell disease.
“Y’all must be doing something right,” Senate Finance Chairman Harvey Peeler, of Gaffney, chimed in.
MUSC already has a 30% stake in Tidelands and controls six seats on Tidelands’ governing board, according to documents provided to the Joint Bond Review Committee. This deal would up its buy-in at the small hospital system.
Goldfinch said Tidelands, with its roughly $540 million in annual operating revenue, never really recovered from the financial hardships caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, when hospital systems had to cancel surgeries that earn income and focus solely on treating those infected with the virus.
MUSC Health, on the other hand, is a $4.7 billion operation with the support of state funding and larger cash reserves that helped it weather the pandemic challenges.
“Health care is hard when you’re the small guy,” Goldfinch said.
Tidelands has about two years’ worth of cash reserves, so that’s how long MUSC has to make improvements, Cawley said. If the effort ultimately fails, the state-owned hospital system would be financially liable.
By 2043, SC hospitals could receive $2.4B less to treat Medicaid patients

The deal comes as hospitals gear up for other looming financial changes.
In 2028, South Carolina also will start losing its ability to pay hospitals for treating Medicaid patients at similar rates as private insurance following changes included in Republicans’ “big beautiful” spending package.
The law signed July 4 phases out the so-called state directed payment program that South Carolina has used since 2023 to hike Medicaid payments to hospitals by a whopping 70% on average.
For the 60 general care hospitals in the Palmetto State, that collectively means a looming loss of roughly $150 million annually over 15 years, according to the state’s hospital industry group.
Instead of hospitals getting reimbursed with rates that align with private insurance — as they have for the last two years — payments will sink back to near Medicare levels. The higher rates came from the state taxing hospitals to draw down even more federal Medicaid dollars ultimately funneled back to the hospitals.
For the fiscal year that ended June 30, Tidelands received $40 million from these payment boosts, according to data provided by the state Medicaid agency.
South Carolina is among 10 states that never expanded Medicaid coverage to all adults up to 138% of the federal poverty level, as intended under the 2010 law commonly known as Obamacare. For that reason, most other Medicaid changes in the spending package don’t apply to the Palmetto State.
But the state also has a higher percentage of uninsured residents, giving hospitals much less wiggle room to absorb the impact of payment reductions.
In Georgetown County, 21% of the population (adults and children) relies on Medicaid for health insurance, which mirrors the state average. Horry County’s rate is 18.8%, according to US Census Data.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-19-at-4.33.57 PM.png,,,2025-08-20 15:57:08.315343

At the end of the 2023-2024 school year John Russell Elementary in Moscow closed, but now it has a new purpose.
Over the summer, members of the Palouse River Ward of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the Unitarian Universalist Church of the Palouse have been working together to turn one room of John Russell Elementary into a Book Nook.
 Book Nook opens to give children free books

The nook, which opened Aug. 15, is open to any child who comes to The Family Resource Hub and houses a variety of books for them to take home. Ricki Martin, a literacy aid at A.B. McDonald Elementary in Moscow, said they wanted to make a room that could get books into the hands of kids.
Martin, a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, said her ward had worked with the Unitarian Church before for programs like Family Promise or the Food Bank.
“We really wanted members of both congregations to work together,” Martin said.
 Volunteers transform a classroom into a reading haven

Nancy Nelson, a member of the Unitarian Universalist church, was in charge of setting up the SignUpGenius for the volunteers. She said both congregations were encouraged to work together to turn a small room into a library for children of all ages to use. The months of planning meant they spent a few weeks in the room to transform it.
Here’s how Idaho’s educators can strive to create supportive environments that cultivate literacy

Volunteers worked together to tape off certain areas and then to paint the walls a light blue and green. They would also build floating shelves and hang them. They discussed having a chalkboard but decided on a white board for children to draw on or leave notes.
“A lot of times — families, when they can’t get basic needs, it can be hard to get books into the house,” Martin said. “This is getting books into a kid’s hands.”
There are board books and picture books as well as chapter books for older children. Books line the walls and are organized by reading level. Martin said all this could change as the space evolves.
Martin also said she had already seen some use since she set it up Aug. 15. She received some books as donations and others from her fellow teachers at McDonald who were taking them out of their classrooms.
 Supporting families beyond books

The Book Nook joins another room in the former elementary school: The Hub. The Hub is a space for families in need to come and find seasonally appropriate clothing, school supplies, sports gear and now books.
“It’s been great to see the small regrowth of Russell after we closed it,” Shawn Tiegs, the superintendent of the Moscow School District said. “The vibrancy, the life is coming back into it.”

Tiegs said The Hub started last year, and the goal was to be able to support families in the school district. He said it had moved into the school about a year ago, and he hopes to see the building continue to help the community.
“The idea is that this is not a dead or dormant building but that it is helping our community,” Tiegs said.
Brian Smith, principal at Paradise Creek Regional High School, oversees The Hub and said it served close to 180 families in the 2024-25 school year. Smith said in the few days it had been open, 40 students have visited the Book Nook and been able to take home books.
“The idea for a ‘Book Nook’ came from Ricki, whose daily work with students developing their reading skills highlighted the need for such a space. I also wanted a welcoming area where students could wait comfortably while parents shopped for clothing, supplies or other essentials,” Smith said.
The Book Nook, Tiegs said, is also an example of the community coming together to help a need they found. The new room also gives children a place to go while parents may be helping another child as well as expanding the books in their home libraries.
“We’ve found in Moscow that there’s a lot of organizations that want to help,” Tiegs said. “The project is a great example of connecting groups.”
Smith said families in need of assistance with clothing, school supplies or other items can reach out to their school counselors or to him at bsmith@msd281.org to schedule a time to shop at The Hub.

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)The Indiana Commission for Higher Education will hold a special meeting Friday to approve Secretary of Education Katie Jenner as the state’s next commissioner for higher education. 
If successful, she would begin the role Oct. 11 — leading both the Indiana Department of Education and the higher education commission.
Jenner has served as Indiana’s top K-12 education official since 2021. She was tapped by former Gov. Eric Holcomb and remained in the role after Gov. Mike Braun’s inauguration earlier this year.
Indiana’s Higher Education Commissioner Chris Lowery to step down in October

“Immediately upon taking office, my administration launched a new vertical structure across state government to streamline operations, increase accountability and transparency, and improve customer service,” Braun said in a news release. “As we continue to identify ways to better serve Hoosier taxpayers, having a proven, consistent leader directly overseeing both K-12 and higher education is the logical next step and will ensure that the best interest of our students remains top of mind every step of their educational journey.”
Chris Lowery, who has led the commission since 2022, announced in July he would step down in October. 
It’s not clear if — or how much — Jenner’s pay could increase if confirmed by the 14-member CHE board. 
She currently earns $275,00 per year as education secretary, according to the Indiana Transparency Portal. Lowery earns just shy of $238,000 per year.
The education secretary’s salary is determined by the governor, per state law. The General Assembly approved a specific appropriation for CHE in each state budget. The agency received $7.3 million per year in the biennial budget that took effect in July.
Jenner’s new duties
In the new dual role, Jenner’s priorities would include affordability, educational attainment, aligning degrees with industry needs, and supporting the state’s new high school diploma requirements, according to the commission.

Lowery said he plans to work with Jenner and commission leadership in the coming weeks to transition.
“Secretary Jenner is a strong advocate for increasing educational attainment for all Hoosier students from kindergarten through college,” Lowery said in a statement. “The logical next step of Secretary Jenner assuming the role of Commissioner will offer clarity and consistency for the Commission, while continuing to drive our mission and deliver better results for Indiana students, employers, and our state.”
Jenner holds a doctorate in education from the University of Kentucky and an MBA from Indiana State University. 
She previously served as Holcomb’s senior education adviser, vice president of K-12 initiatives for Ivy Tech Community College, and a school administrator and teacher in Madison.
Friday’s vote is scheduled for 1 p.m. in Indianapolis.
The commission’s next regularly scheduled meeting is Sept. 18 at Vincennes University in Jasper.

(Photo by Leah Romero / Source NM)Election officials turned over at the highest rate in at least a quarter century during the last presidential election, according to new research from the Bipartisan Policy Center.
An analysis of shifts in election officials published Tuesday found nearly 41% of election officials administering the 2024 election were different than those in 2020. Turnover has accelerated over the past two decades, rising from about 28% in 2004 to 40.9% last year.
The growing percentage of departing election officials comes after years of challenges. They navigated the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, as well as harassment and false conspiracy theories surrounding stolen elections that persist today.
The analysis released by the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington, D.C.-based group that seeks to foster policy cooperation across party lines, represents an updated version of a report that previously examined turnover from 2004 to 2022. The new research, which extends the data through 2024, shows the turnover rate continued to climb.

The change means that, over time, election officials have less experience. The research found that the share of chief local election officials with six or more years in their role has dropped from 60% in 2006 to 47% in 2024.
But last year, 60% of election officials had previously overseen the administration of a presidential election in their jurisdiction.
“Despite increasing turnover and loss of experience, the majority of chief election officials still have experience running at least one presidential election cycle,” the analysis said. “This is important because presidential elections typically see the highest turnout and are the most visible elections administered.”
The analysis found that over the long term, election official turnover rates have been rising gradually in small jurisdictions, defined as areas with fewer than 100,000 voting-age residents. But large jurisdictions have experienced a more sudden jump in turnover.
Small jurisdictions had a 27% turnover rate in 2004 that had risen to 40% in 2024. But large jurisdictions enjoyed a turnover rate as low as 31% in 2018 before climbing rapidly to nearly 46% last year.

(Photo by Grace Deng/Washington State Standard)Washington state should be allowed to enforce health and safety standards at the embattled immigrant detention center in Tacoma, a federal appeals court ruled Tuesday.
The decision overturns a lower court order blocking a 2023 state law that sought to provide greater oversight of conditions at the facility, including through unannounced state inspections. The detention center is run by the Florida-based GEO Group under a contract with the federal government.
With the state law, Democratic lawmakers looked to impose numerous new regulations on the facility, known as the Northwest ICE Processing Center. Among other requirements, the law mandated the detention center provide fresh fruits and vegetables, air conditioning and heat, free telecommunication services, weekly mental health evaluations and rooms with windows. 
Failure to comply could result in fines of up to $10,000 per violation. GEO says these standards go beyond requirements the company must follow under its contract.
The law also required the state departments of Health and Labor and Industries to conduct routine, unannounced inspections of the for-profit detention center, which holds immigrant detainees before deportation or release back into the United States. Labor and Industries inspected the site last summer with authority under a separate state law, and found no violations.
The policy followed an earlier effort to ban private detention facilities entirely statewide, but that statute was deemed unenforceable. So lawmakers turned to increasing oversight. 
The 1,575-bed facility has a history of allegations of mistreatment, abuse and neglect of detainees. Seven potential cases of tuberculosis were recently reported there, according to state health officials. Access to medical care has long been a concern inside the facility. 
It has come under renewed scrutiny as more detainees have been sent there with President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown. The state and GEO, one of the biggest private detention center companies in the nation, have been enmeshed for years in various legal battles over the facility. 
GEO’s 2015 contract with the federal government awarded the company at least $700 million to operate the facility over the following decade.
The state Department of Health celebrated the ruling from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, saying it allows the agency to investigate complaints of mistreatment and “work toward safer, healthier conditions for everyone in these facilities.”
“We applaud the Ninth Circuit’s decision affirming the Washington State Department of Health’s authority to uphold basic health and safety standards in private detention facilities like the Northwest ICE Processing Center,” spokesperson Kara Kostanich said in an email. 
Kostanich didn’t say if the agency now has imminent plans to inspect the facility.
GEO and its attorney didn’t respond to a request for comment.
Legal lingo
The case served as a test of state versus federal power. The legal doctrine of “intergovernmental immunity” holds that state laws can’t unduly regulate federal activities. 
One of the major controversies in whether the state had overstepped was determining the correct comparison for the Tacoma facility, the only private, for-profit detention center in Washington. 
GEO said prisons are an apt comparison. U.S. District Court Judge Benjamin Settle agreed, finding the law imposed an economic burden on GEO through standards the state doesn’t apply to its own Department of Corrections.
The state countered that involuntary treatment facilities are a better parallel, as they also hold people in civil, not criminal, proceedings.
The three-judge appeals court panel sided with the state. The requirements Washington seeks to impose on GEO and these civil facilities are “almost identical,” the judges found. But the judges will leave the comparison of mandated standards to the lower court.
Washington has also run into legal roadblocks because the law only applied to the Tacoma facility. Lawmakers sought to address this problem this year by expanding the definition of private detention centers to include ones run by nonprofits. So state law now also covers the Martin Hall Juvenile Detention Facility, near Spokane.
GEO moved to get the appeal dismissed in light of the new law, which took effect in May. The judges declined that request.
The appeals court judges note states can treat contractors more stringently than if facilities are run by the federal government.
“A state has greater ability to regulate a contractor of the federal government than to regulate the government itself,” Judge William Fletcher wrote in the opinion.
All three of the judges making Tuesday’s decision were appointed by Democratic presidents, two by Bill Clinton and one by Barack Obama. 
The Department of Justice, which has sided with GEO under both former President Joe Biden and Trump, declined to comment on the ruling.
The ruling is the second loss in as many weeks for GEO at the 9th Circuit. 
Last week, the court declined to reconsider an earlier decision affirming that the company needed to pay more than $23 million for violating Washington’s minimum wage law. GEO plans to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to weigh in on that case.

Connecticut holds the distinction of being the first state in the United States to pass a motor vehicle speed limit law. 
On May 21, 1901, the state enacted “An Act Regulating the Speed of Motor Vehicles,” setting limits of 12 mph in cities and 15 mph on country roads. Drivers were also required to slow down or even stop if they encountered horse-drawn carriages. Those who ignored the law faced fines of up to $200, a steep penalty for the era.
The law was introduced by legislator Robert J. Woodruff, who had initially proposed even stricter limits. While local jurisdictions elsewhere – like New York City – had experimented with auto speed rules, Connecticut’s statute was the first to apply statewide, making it a national pioneer in traffic regulation. Today, every state sets its own speed limits, but Connecticut led the way.

Free.,'Alligator Alcatraz' probed by Dems as ICE detention centers multiply in states,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/alligator-alcatraz-probed-dems-ice-detention-centers-multiply-states,,"WASHINGTON — As the Trump administration moves to expand immigrant detention centers across the country through state partnerships, more than 60 Democratic lawmakers Wednesday pressed top immigration officials for details regarding a quickly constructed facility in the Florida Everglades, dubbed by Republicans as “Alligator Alcatraz.”“Brushing aside concerns from human rights watchdogs, environmentalist groups, and Tribal nations, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has greenlit the construction of this expansive detention facility that may violate detained individuals’ human rights, jeopardize public and environmental health, and violate federal law,” according to the letter signed by 65 Democratic members of Congress.The letter comes after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Tuesday announced a partnership with the state of Nebraska to open a 300-bed federal immigration detention center for its version of “Alligator Alcatraz,” dubbed the “Cornhusker Clink.”Another facility in Bunker Hill, Indiana, nicknamed the “Speedway Slammer,” is being constructed to hold 1,000 immigrants.Democrats addressed the letter to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, DHS Office of Inspector General Joseph V.

This comes after at least 20 families were forced to vacate their south Jackson apartment, where JXN Water had disconnected services due to the owner’s nonpayment of the property’s water bill. 
At the city’s request in recent weeks, a federal judge twice ordered the utility to restore the water. But Horhn said during a housing task force meeting Monday that Jackson would not ask for another extension, leaving the Wednesday shutoff in effect.
“The first question is: Do we want to look at approaching the Legislature about any sort of criminal charges that can be put together, that the Legislature would have to approve, to let folks know that we’re really serious about this?” Horhn said.
Jackson’s Housing Task Force was created this month in response to the ongoing battle over water services at Blossom Apartments and resident abandonment at Chapel Ridge Apartments in south Jackson. Its aim is to examine and improve policies and strengthen compliance to ensure safe conditions for renters.
It’s a tall order, considering the more than 7,000 registered rental properties and nearly 26,000 individual units across the city.

On Monday, nine of the 11 task force members discussed absent landlords and the millions in unpaid bills that complexes have accrued with JXN Water. The utility has publicized the names of 15 properties with the largest delinquencies. Many of the landlords in question live out of state.
“ It’s really hard to get to these people,” task force member Emma Redding said. “Most of them live in New York or California. The only thing they want is to get their rent money dropped in the bank every month, and they don’t care about the upkeep or anything.”
Jennifer Welch, whose Jackson-based company owns and manages properties in Jackson, Meridian and Hattiesburg, said that since the discontinuation of pandemic-era rental assistance, it’s been tougher for landlords to secure rent payments from tenants.
“If you don’t collect the rent, you’re not going to make the bank note and you’re not going to make the water payment,” Welch said. “I think we’re seeing some trickle down effects of that phenomenon, which was just a cause of COVID.”
This is exacerbated by JXN Water issuing larger water bills. Welch said she’s seen her charges double.
 ”I’ve got a bill that goes from $7,000 to $15,000, which is shocking. What do you do in that situation?” Welch said. “You owe a $15,000 bill and you cannot find the source of why your bills have doubled. I have found myself in that situation before.”
Earnest Ward, president of the Association of South Jackson neighborhoods, said he couldn’t understand how the water bills of various apartment complexes could reach over six figures.
“How did you all allow the water bill to get to $100,000, $200,000, $700,000?” Ward said. “We didn’t know. The only way we found out was when our associates brought the attention to the media.” 
Carla Dazet, a billing executive for JXN Water, was also in attendance, though not as the company’s designee to the task force. She said the private water utility is only concerned with water usage dating back to December 2022. Landlords and apartment owners have been difficult to reach, she said, causing JXN Water to disconnect services.
“We do everything we can prior to disconnections. I reach out. I do research. We call the offices. These property managers flip quickly,” Dazet said. “We don’t want to turn people off, but we don’t get a response until the water goes off. They don’t even respond to final notice letters.”
One of two attorneys present, Robert Ireland, said bad actors need to be held accountable for placing their tenants in a difficult situation. 
“We don’t have the power to control the resolution while the system is under a federal receiver, but there are folks that are not doing the right thing and are pocketing tenants’ money and not paying bills,” Ireland said. 
U.S. District Judge Henry Wingate first ordered the water at Blossom Apartments to be restored on Aug. 8, calling it a “temporary humanitarian measure.”
“I think that the court has been very indulgent to us,” Horhn said. “They’ve gone above and beyond the call of duty in the 12 days that have been extended to the tenants.”
Water was set to be disconnected again at Blossom Apartments on Wednesday once the second order expires, and residents have until then to move out of the apartments. Earlier this month, Mississippi Home Corp. declared the complex to be unsafe, and residents have said they’ve dealt with poor living conditions, including mold, water leaks and dysfunctional appliances. 
Many rely on housing vouchers to cover a portion of their rent, meaning they don’t have the disposable income required to move on such a short notice. Stewpot Community Services is using a federal emergency housing grant to help residents with relocation costs. 
“We’ve got about $100,000 right now to assist the Blossom tenants,” Horhn said. “If they haven’t found a place to live within a few days, then we’re going to put them up in hotels … but we’re going to run out of that money if we don’t come up with a solution real soon.”
Another solution presented: creation of a rapid response team for when JXN Water terminates service at another housing complex. Region 6 Housing Authority stepped in to provide housing vouchers for residents at Blossom, many of whom are lower-income. Stewpot Community Services held a relocation assistance meeting Aug. 12, but Horhn said a majority of the 20 families who remain were still searching for housing.

Election officials turned over at the highest rate in at least a quarter century during the last presidential election, according to new research from the Bipartisan Policy Center.
An analysis of shifts in election officials published Tuesday found nearly 41% of election officials administering the 2024 election were different than those in 2020. Turnover has accelerated over the past two decades, rising from about 28% in 2004 to 40.9% last year.
The growing percentage of departing election officials comes after years of challenges. They navigated the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, as well as harassment and false conspiracy theories surrounding stolen elections that persist today.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The analysis released by the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington, D.C.-based group that seeks to foster policy cooperation across party lines, represents an updated version of a report that previously examined turnover from 2004 to 2022. The new research, which extends the data through 2024, shows the turnover rate continued to climb.
The change means that, over time, election officials have less experience. The research found that the share of chief local election officials with six or more years in their role has dropped from 60% in 2006 to 47% in 2024.
But last year, 60% of election officials had previously overseen the administration of a presidential election in their jurisdiction.
“Despite increasing turnover and loss of experience, the majority of chief election officials still have experience running at least one presidential election cycle,” the analysis said. “This is important because presidential elections typically see the highest turnout and are the most visible elections administered.”
The analysis found that over the long term, election official turnover rates have been rising gradually in small jurisdictions, defined as areas with fewer than 100,000 voting-age residents. But large jurisdictions have experienced a more sudden jump in turnover.
Small jurisdictions had a 27% turnover rate in 2004 that had risen to 40% in 2024. But large jurisdictions enjoyed a turnover rate as low as 31% in 2018 before climbing rapidly to nearly 46% last year.

DemasMany Michigan localities expect to see harm from the loss of public funding, though few are preparing for cuts according to a recent survey from the University of Michigan Center for Local, State and Urban Policy. 
Released earlier this month, the survey examines city and county governments’ plans as funding from several major streams enacted during the administration of former President Joe Biden, including the American Rescue Plan Act, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, come to an end, with federal cuts to housing and transportation championed by President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans also on the table. 
The survey included county, city, township and village officials from 1,328 jurisdictions across the state, with a 72% response rate. In their responses, 40% of local government officials said the loss or pause of one type of federal or state funding would pose problems.
Of that 40%,  72% of cities, 68% of counties, 46% of villages, and 30% of townships voiced concerns with the loss of funding.
Concerns were greater in communities facing high fiscal stress, with 6% of jurisdictions with high fiscal stress reporting that the loss of American Rescue Plan Act Funding would pose a significant problem, compared to 2% of communities with low fiscal stress. 
MPPS Federal Funding Infographic Spring 2025
Through the American Rescue Plan Act, Michigan’s counties received a collective $1.93 billion in federal funds, while 49 townships received $1.8 billion and a group of smaller cities, villages and townships received $664 million. Although governments were required to commit the funds to specific purposes by December 2024, and have until December 2026 to spend them, the Michigan Public Policy Survey has previously noted administrative challenges tied to procuring the funding and navigating bureaucracy. 
Despite these concerns, 60% of governments had not begun preparing for a loss of state or federal funding as of spring 2025. According to the survey, this includes 31% of counties, 42% of cities, 59% of villages and 66% of townships. 
“Both uncertainty as well as other internal local governmental capacity challenges are hindering some local governments from girding themselves for the coming drop in revenues that will impact their budgets and their service provision,” Debra Horner, the survey’s senior program manager, said in a statement. 
For local governments who are preparing for a loss in funding, 12% of jurisdictions focused on water and sewer infrastructure, with 14% focusing on other capital improvements, with both categories among the most commonly reported uses of ARPA funds. 
Eleven percent of jurisdictions were preparing for a loss of funding for public safety and economic development while 5% were preparing for a loss of funding on energy programs and infrastructure.

Brit McKenzie (center), R-Rogers, as he's sworn into his second term in the Arkansas House of Representatives on Jan. 13, 2025. (Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders named six new members to the State Library Board on Wednesday, in compliance with a law mandating an overhaul of the board.
In April, Sanders signed Act 903 of 2025, the culmination of Republican lawmakers’ attempts to exert control over the Arkansas State Library. The agency is under the umbrella of the state Department of Education but operates independently.
Act 903 gave Sanders up to 30 days after Aug. 5 to replace the entire seven-member board. Since taking office in 2023, Sanders had appointed three new board members as previous members’ staggered terms expired.
Sydney McKenzie of Rogers, wife of Republican Rep. Brit McKenzie, became the library board’s newest member earlier this year and was the only member Sanders reappointed Wednesday.
The other five appointees are Annette Bailey of Mountain Home, Clay Goff of Beebe, Jack Fortner of Yellville, Lynlee McMillan of Benton and Emmaline Pilkington of Knoxville.
Challenges to public library funding throughout Arkansas meet frustration, some resistance

A spokesperson for Sanders’ office said they would provide the Advocate a response when asked how soon a seventh appointment is expected. The response was not yet available by publication time.
The overhaul is part of the Republican legislative supermajority’s ongoing efforts to regulate public library leadership, funding and content. There have been similar conservative-led local efforts throughout the state in the past few years, including in Yellville and Benton.
McMillan is Sanders’ director of constituent services. Fortner is a former Republican state representative who served four terms before declining to run for reelection in 2024.
Like McKenzie, Pilkington is married to a sitting lawmaker, Knoxville GOP Rep. Aaron Pilkington. Bailey and her husband are the co-founders of Mountain Home’s Twin Lakes Baptist Church.
Goff is president of the Beebe School Board and a former chairman of the White County Regional Library System’s governing board. Beebe’s Goff Public Library is named after his father, Leroy Goff, a real estate agent who provided the labor to build the library, which opened in 2014 during his son’s tenure as library board chairman.
The Senate is required to confirm gubernatorial appointments. The new board is required by law to be in place by Sept. 3 and is expected to meet between then and Nov. 14, its next scheduled quarterly meeting.
Act 903 requires the seven new board members to draw lots determining how their terms will be staggered, ending between one and seven years from now. Subsequent appointees would serve seven-year terms, the usual length of time library board members serve.
The previous board members’ terms ended Oct. 18 each year. Now-former member Jo Ann Campbell of Fort Smith would have reached the end of her term two months from now and cleared the way for a 4-3 majority of Sanders appointees.
The other board members replaced by Act 903 were Pam Meridith of Cherokee Village, Lupe Peña de Martinez of Mabelvale and Board Chairwoman Deborah Knox of Mountain Home.

Arkansas Senate approves State Library Board overhaul after dissolution bill fails


 The buildup to Act 903

Shari Bales of Hot Springs, one of Sanders’ other two appointees on the previous board, told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette earlier this month that she hoped to be reappointed.
Bales was among the previous board’s majority that consistently voted down efforts from Sanders’ third appointee, former Republican state Sen. Jason Rapert, to withhold state funds from libraries where children can access certain content. The board’s primary responsibility is to disburse state funds to local public libraries.
Rapert repeatedly called for the abolition of the board for rejecting his efforts to “protect children.” Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Jonesboro, sponsored a bill with this purpose during the 2025 legislative session.
In March, Sullivan asked the board to pass two motions to ensure its survival: to create nonbinding policies to protect children from “sexually explicit” content in libraries and to separate the State Library from the American Library Association. Conservatives frequently mention LGBTQ+ topics and sex education when decrying “sexually explicit” material, and they also claim the American Library Association has a left-wing agenda.
All three Sanders appointees supported the motions, but the other four members voted them down. By the same split vote, the board passed a separate motion aimed at protecting children in libraries while honoring the First Amendment and library material selection standards.

House panel rejects proposal to dissolve Arkansas State Library and Board

 

Sullivan responded by filing a bill that would have abolished the State Library as a whole and directed its responsibilities to the Department of Education. The bill passed the Senate but failed in a House committee. Act 903 was filed hours later and hit no roadblocks during the legislative process.
In 2023, Sullivan sponsored a law that would have given local elected officials the final say over whether to relocate challenged library materials some consider “obscene” and made librarians legally liable for disseminating such materials. A federal judge blocked portions of the law on First Amendment grounds, and the state is appealing the ruling.
Rapert asked his fellow State Library Board members this year and last year to withhold funding from the libraries that are plaintiffs in the ongoing litigation; the rest of the board repeatedly declined.
Rapert did not attend the previous board’s final meeting after Act 903 became law.

(Photo by Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images)This week, the Trump administration’s Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) announced an effort to check the immigration status of people who get their health insurance through Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program.
Medicaid is the public health insurance program for people with low incomes that’s jointly funded by states and the federal government. For families that earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to afford private insurance, CHIP is a public program that provides low-cost health coverage for their children.
The feds will begin sending Pennsylvania and other states monthly enrollment reports that identify people with Medicaid or CHIP whose immigration or citizenship status can’t be confirmed through federal databases. States are then responsible for verifying the citizenship or immigration status of individuals in those reports. States are expected to take “appropriate actions when necessary, including adjusting coverage or enforcing non-citizen eligibility rules,” according to a CMS press release.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“We are tightening oversight of enrollment to safeguard taxpayer dollars and guarantee that these vital programs serve only those who are truly eligible under the law,” Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who oversees CMS as secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said in a press release announcing the new program.
As of April, roughly 71 million adults and children nationwide have Medicaid coverage, while another 7 million children have insurance through CHIP. Immigrants under age 65 are less likely to be covered by Medicaid than U.S.-born citizens, according to an analysis from health research organization KFF.
States scramble to shield hospitals from GOP Medicaid cuts

Immigrants who are in the country illegally aren’t eligible for federally funded Medicaid and CHIP. Only citizens and certain lawfully present immigrants — green card holders and refugees, for example — can qualify.
But some states have chosen to expand Medicaid coverage for immigrants with their own funds. Pennsylvania and 22 other states offer pregnancy-related care regardless of citizenship or immigration status, according to KFF. Fourteen states provide coverage for children in low-income families regardless of immigration status, while seven states offer coverage to some adults regardless of status.
The tax and spending package President Donald Trump last month cuts federal spending on Medicaid by more than $1 trillion, leaving states to either make up the difference with their own funds or reduce coverage. But the new law also includes restrictions on coverage for certain immigrants, including stripping eligibility from refugees and asylum-seekers.

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)As historic drought conditions on the Western Slope fuel another dangerous wildfire season, a new paper from researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder warns that human-caused climate change is playing a major role in making those conditions worse.
Previously published climatological research has found that the Colorado River Basin’s current “megadrought” is the worst dry spell the region has experienced in at least 1,200 years. But a new study, published last week in the journal Nature, concludes that those persistently dry conditions are being driven by human activity “more intensely — and more directly — than previously understood,” its authors say.
Jeremy Klavans and Pedro DiNezio of CU Boulder’s Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences worked with other scientists from around the country to model how global climate patterns affect rainfall across the U.S. southwest.



Their findings concern a climate pattern known as the Pacific decadal oscillation. Related to the better-known El Niño-La Niña cycle to the south, the PDO is a natural fluctuation that brings warm water to the northeastern Pacific Ocean near the U.S. West Coast during its “positive” phase, leading to more storms and higher-than-average rainfall. During its “negative” phase, however, cooler water and air temperatures result in less precipitation in Western states.
Despite typically reversing itself every one or two decades, the PDO has been “stuck” in the negative, dry phase since the 1990s. By analyzing more than 500 climate model simulations developed by climatologists around the world, the study’s authors were able to paint the clearest picture yet of the influence of human activity on the PDO, and the resulting Southwestern megadrought.
“All of them had this common signal when we averaged them together,” DiNezio said in an interview. “By having so many simulations, we could be absolutely sure that this was not an artifact of a single model, or of a subset of simulations.”
Severe drought conditions have persisted in the Colorado River Basin since 2000, putting increased stress on the water supplies relied on by about 40 million people in Colorado and six other Western states. Water levels in two key reservoirs, Lake Mead and Lake Powell, have fallen to record lows in recent years.












What's important here is that we're showing that rainfall has also been influenced by humans, in addition to just evaporation ... Both contribute to drought.


– Pedro DiNezio, researcher with CU Boulder's Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences




Rising levels of greenhouse gases, mostly the result of fossil-fuel combustion, have caused much of western Colorado and neighboring states in the Colorado River’s Upper Basin to warm by an average of more than 4 degrees Fahrenheit above pre-industrial levels, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration data.
Prior research has attributed about 40% of the post-2000 megadrought to higher temperatures alone, as hotter weather leads to greater evaporation of moisture from water surfaces and soils. Modeling global warming’s precise impacts on rainfall patterns has proved more elusive, but DiNezio said the new research “add(s) more human influence to that previous number.”
“What’s important here is that we’re showing that rainfall has also been influenced by humans, in addition to just evaporation,” he said. “Both contribute to drought.”
Colorado and other states that are parties to the 103-year-old Colorado River Compact have negotiated for years over how to distribute the cuts to water use made necessary by the basin’s ongoing drought. The federal Bureau of Reclamation on Friday announced another year of reduced water allocations for the Lower Basin states of Arizona and Nevada.
Not long ago, the possibility that the Pacific decadal oscillation would eventually reverse itself offered hope that the long-term drought outlook for the U.S. Southwest wasn’t as bad as it seemed. Instead, evidence now suggests the last two decades are the region’s “new normal.”
“I was a Ph.D. student in 2012, and there was a consensus that eventually (the PDO) was going to flip,” DiNezio. “We had a big El Niño in 2015, and there was this idea that El Niño will flip the PDO back to the opposite, rainfall-producing phase. And we had that big El Niño event, and the PDO remained stuck. We just had an El Niño event in 2023 … and (it) also didn’t flip the PDO.”
“That’s the most important implication of  our findings,” he added. “That this drought is here to stay, unless we we do something about rising temperatures and global warming.”

The National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program to build out the capacity for charging electric vehicles has been restarted after being suspended by the Trump administration early this year. (Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images)A suspended federally funded program to expand the nation’s electric vehicle charging capacity has been jolted back to life.
Prospective developers seeking to build stations in Wisconsin and share in the state’s federal grant have until Sept. 5 to submit their proposals, according to the Wisconsin Department of Transportation.
Wisconsin was one of the first states to take part in the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) project, part of the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law.
“Our state DOT was incredibly proactive” in participating in the program, Amy Barilleaux, communications director for Clean Wisconsin, told the Wisconsin Examiner.
The state’s allotment was $78 million and 53 projects were awarded with the funds in May 2024, a state DOT spokesperson said. The department signed 39 agreements accounting for $16 million before the program was frozen earlier this year; eight projects have been completed and five are under construction.
Countermanding the push to reduce reliance on fossil fuels that have been associated with worsening climate change, President Donald Trump issued executive orders promoting fossil fuels and attempting to block measures to promote renewable energy that were enacted during former President Joe Biden’s administration.
One of Trump’s first such orders, on the day he took office, froze NEVI funding that had not been committed to projects by then.
“It should have never been paused in the first place,” Barrilleaux said. “This was money that was allocated by Congress that was ours to spend under this program.”
Wisconsin along with more than a dozen other states and the District of Columbia sued to restore the NEVI grants. A federal judge in June blocked the Trump administration from freezing the grants or withholding the money from the 14 states and D.C. that joined the lawsuit.
Barrilleaux noted that by joining the lawsuit, Wisconsin was able to benefit from the ruling that released the money.
U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy issued new guidance for the grants Aug. 11. The new guidance eliminates various provisions in the original federal program, including specifications that emphasized using renewable energy, required consumer protections and required engagement with rural, underserved and disadvantaged communities.
“While I don’t agree with subsidizing green energy, we will respect Congress’ will and make sure this program uses federal resources efficiently,” Duffy wrote in a statement.
“It’s good that we’re getting back to building out this infrastructure,” said Ben Behlke, clean technology programs manager for Renew Wisconsin. “This is a great opportunity for us to solve ‘the chicken or the egg’ issue as it relates to making charging available as adoption of electric vehicles becomes more prevalent. Beyond making this technology more accessible, electrifying our transportation is a necessary part of our effort to create a clean energy economy.”

A 2024 report from the National Association of Realtors ranked Montana’s housing as the least affordable in the entire country. As of August, the Economic Research Institute puts Bozeman’s cost of living at 17% higher than the average Montana city, and the Bozeman Real Estate Group currently lists the average price of a single-family home in Bozeman at $911,150. 
Mobile home parks remain one of the few options for affordable housing in Bozeman, but that option is quickly dwindling, with only 15 current listings on MHBO.com. The 338 sites in King Arthur and Mountain Meadows parks make up about one-third of the valley’s mobile home park supply. 
“Purchasing my home here was literally the only way I could afford to stay in this valley, and maybe the state, because the entire state is expensive,” Driscoll told the Daily Montanan. “And at this point, I cannot move my home. It’s a double-wide trailer with an addition, and it’s from like 1978 or something. There’s nowhere that house is going. It would be an enormous financial loss. Having to uproot my children and move them somewhere else because I can’t afford to be here would be devastating.” 
While Oakland did not respond to Daily Montanan’s requests for comment, he told the Bozeman Chronicle “This is a good-sized business, and any organization that is going to pay good money for it is going to want to grow it and make it better and make improvements.” 
However, as Montanans have sometimes seen, the purchase of these parks by private equity firms often results in the opposite, such as a severe degradation of services and drastically increased lot rents, at times up to 138%. 
“We’ve seen private equity purchase mobile home parks like mine, drive up the prices, displace residents, leaving infrastructure crumbling and long-time residents to lose the equity they have managed to build,” said resident Sara Folger, one of the elected bargaining team members for the Mountain Meadows Tenant Union. “We are here today to ask Gary Oakland to sell to us as a collective to create a Resident Owned Community.”

A Resident Owned Community is a model where residents jointly own the land and infrastructure instead of relying on a single landlord or corporate owner. Montana currently has 22 Resident Owned Communities. The nearest ROC to Bozeman is Stan’s Garden, formerly Belgrade Village, which officially became an resident-owned community in February 2024. 
“Working people struggle to pay rent, to buy groceries, to care for kids and healthcare all while doing the physically difficult jobs with long hours, while being exploited every step of the way,” continued Folger. “Either the struggle will get worse for the residents of these parks or this can be a moment where we get a chance to create a future of ownership, equity, and peace of mind.” 
  Organizing The Community 

When King Arthur Park resident Cindy Smith found out about the sale of the park on July 16, she contacted Bozeman Tenant’s Union Organizer Emily LaShelle, who is now Organizing Director and Lead Organizer of the King Arthur Park and Mountain Meadows. Smith had previously tried to organize King Arthur Park into a Resident Owned Community roughly a year ago, said LaShelle, but it hadn’t gotten traction at the time, so Smith had been organizing with the citywide tenant union and was a leader on the strategy team.

“She is a phenomenal leader,” said LaShelle. “So when she called and told me that her park was up for sale and that she wanted to unionize it, I knew she was serious.” 
LaShelle, Smith and a few others met on July 21 to make a plan. They created a petition, which has now garnered 150 community supporters, including all three Gallatin County Commissioners, all five Bozeman city commissioners, and 11 bipartisan legislators. Residents spoke with NeighborWorks about the possibility of making a bid, and by July 26 they had a four-hour training session with 15 people about how to have organizing conversations with neighbors. 
“Then we just went out and started talking to neighbors and saying, ‘Is this something that people want?’” said LaShelle. “The response was overwhelmingly in favor.” 
On July 29, residents met at Town and Country, an employee-owned grocery story . 
“We thought there’d be like 30 people who would show up. There was 75. We were way too big for the space,” LaShelle said. “There were people shoulder to shoulder, we had to really apologize to Town and Country. Shout out to Town and Country staff.” 
The union card drive began that night, as well as elections for the bargaining team, with positions such as presidents, secretaries and treasurers. Smith was elected as a member of the King Arthur Tenant Union Bargaining team. 
Just 12 days later, residents had gathered the requisite 51% of signatures required to unionize, and beat the deadline for a bid. 
“I’m in awe,” said Driscoll. “I’m in awe of the effort and the dedication and the kindness. That took a lot of work. People were stretched thin, and they were continuously kind and warm and encouraging. For me, it’s just been deeply inspiring. I wish we had done this earlier. We’re in good hands with each other.” 
That has led to a direct ask of the owner, Gary Oakland. 
“We own our mobile homes; we only rent the land underneath. We have grown flowers, gardens, decorative landscaping, raspberry bushes and our families here,” said Smith. “We are asking you, Mr. Oakland, to leave our community with us. Sell this land to us, the people who love and care for it.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/JennaMartin-0122-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-20 13:57:18.553607

(Photo courtesy NMED) The New Mexico Environment Department’s installation of new pre-treatment equipment for the City of Las Vegas’ drinking water supply should offer at least some reassurance to residents the next time they see storm clouds gather on the horizon, a department official told Source New Mexico this week.
The Environment Department recently took over almost all the Northern New Mexico town’s work to replace its water treatment facility, a necessity after the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire in summer 2022. 
During the fire, sediment turned the Gallinas River black as it flowed through town, and the city and other areas in and around the burn scar have seen repeated floods ever since the fire. 
Because the United States Forest Service started the blaze, Congress approved more than $5 billion to compensate fire victims, and specifically included $140 million to the city for a brand new water treatment system. A year ago, the city received $98 million of that.
But repeated flood events last summer and earlier this year, as well as a complete water shutoff in the city this winter, prompted the city to enter into a “joint governmental agreement” with three state agencies in hopes of fast-tracking the new system. 
Legislative Recap Feb. 21: Why Las Vegas isn’t celebrating Las Vegas Day at the Roundhouse

The agreement, which all the parties signed off on early last month, empowers the state’s finance, disaster response and environmental departments to “plan, design, procure, construct, test, deliver, and close out a temporary water treatment facility and a permanent water treatment facility” in the city, according to a copy of the agreement. 
The city keeps control of the $98 million it received, along with other federal and state grants and loans it has received as part of the replacement project. Its main job is to pay for all the work the state does, according to the agreement.
On Tuesday, state environment officials announced that they’d successfully completed a half-dozen projects that aim to improve the city’s water filtration system and ensure the public is kept in the loop on what they’re drinking. 
One of the most important improvements is the installation of temporary “pre-treatment” equipment at the city’s water treatment plant, said Jonas Armstrong, director of NMED’s Water Protection Division, in an interview Tuesday afternoon with Source. The city procured the equipment, which removes extra sediment and debris in high-turbidity or runoff events, last year. 
“[The city was] having some issues earlier this year with getting it connected and making sure it was operating correctly,” Armstrong said. “We’ve worked through that with them in the last couple months, and it’s connected now and ready to go. So that’s a big improvement.”

The state has also begun upgrades to filters at the existing facility; replaced a vacuum system that removes scum and floating debris from the Gallinas River; and built a sediment pond near a reservoir to reduce flooding and contamination risks, according to a news release Tuesday. 
Armstrong deferred questions about the costs of the improvements to the city, including how much of the $98 million the city received last year has been spent. A spokesperson for the city did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday. 
While the state does not expect to begin construction on the new facility until next year at the earliest, Armstrong said the changes should offer a measure of comfort to Las Vegas residents who’ve seen their drinking water supply repeatedly compromised due to floods and equipment failures.
“I think the pre-treatment system being brought online and ready to go at the flip of a switch is a big advancement, and an assurance that the shutdowns and the restrictions that have happened in the last couple of years should not happen again,” Armstrong said.
Armstrong said the joint agreement has been “really collaborative so far,” with the state drawing on local knowledge about how best to tailor the project to the city’s needs. When it’s finally built, the new water treatment system will be a “generational asset,” given the adequate funding and the state’s technical expertise, he said. 
“This existing facility is 50-plus years old and needs to be replaced, and having the federal funds and the state funds to do it is a huge opportunity for the city and the people of Las Vegas,” he said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/New-Pretreatment-System-—-Courtesy-City-of-Las-Vegas-1-1024x461.jpg,,,2025-08-20 13:57:18.553607

Research from the Bipartisan Policy Center shows turnover among election workers reached a new high in 2024. (Photo by Spenser Heaps/Utah News Dispatch) Election officials turned over at the highest rate in at least a quarter century during the last presidential election, according to new research from the Bipartisan Policy Center.
An analysis of shifts in election officials published Tuesday found nearly 41% of election officials administering the 2024 election were different than those in 2020. Turnover has accelerated over the past two decades, rising from about 28% in 2004 to 40.9% last year.
The growing percentage of departing election officials comes after years of challenges. They navigated the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, as well as harassment and false conspiracy theories surrounding stolen elections that persist today.
The analysis released by the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington, D.C.-based group that seeks to foster policy cooperation across party lines, represents an updated version of a report that previously examined turnover from 2004 to 2022. The new research, which extends the data through 2024, shows the turnover rate continued to climb.
Wanted: Poll workers. Must love democracy.

The change means that, over time, election officials have less experience. The research found that the share of chief local election officials with six or more years in their role has dropped from 60% in 2006 to 47% in 2024.
But last year, 60% of election officials had previously overseen the administration of a presidential election in their jurisdiction.
“Despite increasing turnover and loss of experience, the majority of chief election officials still have experience running at least one presidential election cycle,” the analysis said. “This is important because presidential elections typically see the highest turnout and are the most visible elections administered.”
The analysis found that over the long term, election official turnover rates have been rising gradually in small jurisdictions, defined as areas with fewer than 100,000 voting-age residents. But large jurisdictions have experienced a more sudden jump in turnover.
Small jurisdictions had a 27% turnover rate in 2004 that had risen to 40% in 2024. But large jurisdictions enjoyed a turnover rate as low as 31% in 2018 before climbing rapidly to nearly 46% last year.

A Morrisville man has been arrested and charged with murder in the death of a Hardwick woman two months ago in Vermont.
Michael A. Williams, 60, was taken into custody Tuesday afternoon, according to Vermont State Police. Williams is facing charges of aggravated domestic assault and second-degree murder in the killing of Tina Daigle, 38, who authorities said was strangled to death, according to police.
Williams is set to appear Wednesday afternoon in Caledonia County Superior criminal court in St. Johnsbury to be arraigned on the charges. He was held overnight in custody without bail pending his arraignment. 
Daigle was killed in Caledonia County on June 19, according to state police. Her body was left and then discovered on the side of Route 14 in Woodbury. 
Police have released few details about the investigation leading to Williams arrest Tuesday. More information is expected to be made public Wednesday following his arraignment, when an affidavit of probable cause in support of the charges against him becomes public.

The resolution, which was approved by a unanimous vote, requires CTECS to provide the Connecticut State Department of Education with quarterly updates about the school’s admissions, student withdrawals, and other changes to student enrollment related to special education students.
The resolution follows a report by Michael McKeon, the lawyer for the education department, which confirmed that the admissions process at CTECS, which denied admission to nearly 160 students in the 2024-25 school year, was a “clear violation of federal and state law.”
Former leadership at CTECS used what they called “safety review panels” in the admissions process, which gauged whether potential students posed a safety risk. A department investigation found the panels denied admission to students who received disciplinary infractions at their previous schools — including for things like vaping — and disproportionately kept students with disabilities out of the CTECS system.
At Wednesday’s meeting, McKeon said that he was also concerned by his findings that a large number of students withdrew from the schools for no clear reason. While some students left because they felt the program wasn’t a good fit for them, and some left when their family moved out of the area, others simply left without explanation.
“One has to wonder if students were routinely counseled out,” McKeon said. Of the students who withdrew without explanation McKeon said a third had disabilities. That’s “a troubling percentage,” he said, “and seems to underscore idea that they were being targeted and essentially exited from CTECS system.”
McKeon said that many of the students who were denied tried to appeal the decision. 
“Sixty seven of the 158 appealed, because there was an appeal process. Everyone was denied. This was a process that seemed to have offered no real opportunity,” for students who were appealing the decision, he said.
“This was, needless to say, a problematic and illegal process,” McKeon said. 
At Wednesday’s meeting, the system’s new executive director Alice Pritchard spoke to the board, saying that CTECS has since implemented a truly blind lottery for its spots. McKeon thanked Pritchard for her help with providing needed documentation to review what exactly had happened at the school under previous leadership.
Pritchard said, “It’s never pleasant to be called out for bad behavior, but we do appreciate it, because we know that students deserve better than that.”
She pledged to continue updating the board on progress, as required by Wednesday’s resolution.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/thumbnail_IMG_6580-1024x767.jpg,,,2025-08-20 13:57:18.553607

Fueled by hot summer weather and persistent drought conditions across the western half of the state, wildfires as of Aug. 20 had burned more than 200,000 acres in Colorado in 2025.
It’s Colorado’s worst fire year since 2020, when multiple historic blazes burned a record-setting 625,357 acres, according to National Interagency Fire Center data.
Drought conditions classified as “severe” or “extreme” extend nearly all of the Western Slope, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. A large area covering most of Garfield and Rio Blanco counties is now considered to be in “exceptional” drought, the monitor’s most severe classification. A critical fire weather advisory for western Colorado and several neighboring states has been issued by the Rocky Mountain Area Coordination Center, a Denver-based branch of the NIFC, and will remain in place through at least Aug. 27.

“After a dry winter with minimal snowpack fuel moistures are well below normal, and much of the region is under severe to extreme drought,” the agency warns. “Extreme fire behavior marked by rapid spread, torching, and resistance to control is being driven by critically dry … fuels, and drought-stressed brush and trees. As heat intensifies and fuel moistures decline further, fire potential will remain elevated across the area.”
Here is a look at three 2025 Colorado fires:

The Lee Fire, west of the town of Meeker in Rio Blanco County, has burned an estimated 137,755 acres with 68% containment as of Aug. 20. It was caused by lightning on Aug. 2.
The nearby Elk Fire, southeast of Meeker, was also caused by lightning on Aug. 2. It burned an estimated 14,518 acres and is 100% contained.
The Turner Gulch Fire, east of Gateway near the Colorado-Utah border in Mesa County, is 79% contained and has burned an estimated 31,698 acres since it was started by lightning on July 12.

Gov. Jared Polis has issued a broad emergency declaration covering fires burning in multiple counties and the risk of new fires as the state faces “continued high temperatures, high winds, severe to extreme drought conditions, and near record level fire indices.”
Due to climate change, much of Colorado has grown hotter and drier in recent decades, increasing wildfire risk. The three largest wildfires in Colorado history all occurred in 2020, and the state’s 20 biggest fires on record have all occurred in the past 20 years. Rising levels of greenhouse gases, mostly the result of fossil-fuel combustion, have caused much of the Western Slope to warm by an average of more than 4 degrees Fahrenheit above pre-industrial levels, and the region’s current “megadrought” is its worst dry spell in at least 1,200 years.
Most wildfires are caused by human activity. To minimize the risk of sparking a fire, authorities urge visitors to national forests and other public lands to follow local fire restrictions, ensure that vehicles are properly maintained and trailer chains are secured, and avoid driving or parking on dry grass.
In 2017, the State Forest Service reported that more than 2.9 million Coloradans lived in the “wildland-urban interface” — areas at risk of being impacted by wildfires. Fire safety experts urge residents of such zones to familiarize themselves with the “Ready, Set, Go” system of precautions.

Mandatory evacuations have been ordered after a new wildfire grew rapidly in a remote area of northwestern Eagle County on Tuesday.
The Derby Fire was estimated at 839 acres as of 11:30 p.m. Tuesday, having more than tripled in size over the previous 24 hours, and continued to grow overnight, officials said. It was first reported on Sunday near Sweetwater Lake, about 15 miles northwest of Gypsum, and is believed to have been caused by lightning.
The Eagle County Sheriff’s Office has ordered residents in several zones along the Colorado River to the east of the fire to evacuate by midday Wednesday. Other areas nearby have been placed on pre-evacuation notices. Up-to-date evacuation information is available on Eagle County’s emergency information website.
U.S. Forest Service officials have closed the area of the White River National Forest where the Derby Fire is burning until further notice.
About 80 personnel were assigned to the Derby Fire as of Wednesday, and a federal incident command team assumed control of firefighting efforts as of 6 a.m.  No containment has yet been achieved on the fire, whose “remote location makes access very difficult,” officials said.
“We’re currently cooperating with the local agencies that have initially attacked this fire,” Philip Knaub, operations section chief for the team assigned to the fire, said. “We started yesterday afternoon with our own personnel, gathering intelligence and checking out the roads, checking out all the houses, looking at the structures and what might be needed in order to protect them.”
“As far as the fire goes, we do have a slew of aircraft — we’ll have helicopters and we’ll have air tankers working on that fire today, applying retardant and water where it’s most beneficial,” he added.

Human emissions driving Colorado River ‘megadrought,’ CU Boulder research finds


By: Chase Woodruff - Monday August 18, 2025 4:00 am





As historic drought conditions on the Western Slope fuel another dangerous wildfire season, a new paper from researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder warns that human-caused climate change is playing a major role in making those conditions worse.
Previously published climatological research has found that the Colorado River Basin’s current “megadrought” is the worst dry spell the region has experienced in at least 1,200 years. But a new study, published last week in the journal Nature,  concludes that those persistently dry conditions are being driven by human activity “more intensely — and more directly — than previously understood,” its authors say.
A 2022 study attributed about 40% of the megadrought to higher temperatures alone, as hotter weather leads to greater evaporation of moisture from water surfaces and soils. Modeling global warming’s precise impacts on rainfall patterns has proved more elusive, but Pedro DiNezio, an associate professor at CU Boulder’s Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, said the new paper “add(s) more human influence to that previous number.”
“What’s important here is that we’re showing that rainfall has also been influenced by humans, in addition to just evaporation,” said DiNezio. “Both contribute to drought.”

Polis declares emergency over ‘near record level’ Colorado fire danger


By: Chase Woodruff - Friday August 15, 2025 9:23 am





Colorado Gov. Jared Polis on Thursday issued a broad emergency declaration covering multiple wildfires currently burning on the Western Slope and the risk of new fires as dangerous weather conditions persist in the coming weeks.
More than 2,000 local, state and federal personnel are currently battling nine large fires in Colorado, including the Lee Fire in Rio Blanco County, which as of Friday ranked as the fifth-largest fire in state history at an estimated size of 133,602 acres. Polis said in a press release that Thursday’s executive order declaring an emergency would “bolster our ability to jump on fires early” as elevated fire risk continues.
“Continuing throughout July and into August, and as part of the same prolonged weather pattern, parts of Colorado have experienced continued high temperatures, high winds, severe to extreme drought conditions, and near record level fire indices,” the order says. “Elevated fire weather and fire risk is forecast for the coming weeks.”

Containment of the Lee Fire west of Meeker has dropped slightly to 6%, compared to its 7% containment Monday. A Tuesday morning map of the fire, which is the fifth-largest in state history, showed 116,859 acres burned. That’s more than 3,000 new acres burned since Monday.
The Lee Fire started in Rio Blanco County and has spread toward Rifle in Garfield County, pushed by strong winds and dry conditions.
During a community meeting at Colorado Mountain College on Monday night, incident meteorologist Rose Schoenfeld said smoke conditions are expected to improve in Rifle throughout Tuesday as winds change. But fire crews still face challenges ahead, especially moving into Wednesday, Schoenfeld added.
“Wednesday is really the day to watch with regards to fire weather,” Schoenfeld said. “Wednesday is going to be warmer, and it’s going to be more of an unstable atmosphere.”
“In the past 30 days, we have gotten 5% of the normal precipitation, putting the area in extreme drought,” she added.

The fire, which began Aug. 2 in Rio Blanco County and has pushed south toward Garfield County and the Interstate 70 corridor, stood at about 107,000 acres Sunday, putting it in the No. 7 position among the state’s biggest fires. It was 6% contained.
The fire was believed to have been caused by lightning.

Inmates evacuated from facility in Rifle


By: Quentin Young -  4:04 pm





The Lee Fire in Rio Blanco County prompted the evacuation Saturday of all 179 people incarcerated in the Rifle Correctional Center, according to the Colorado Department of Corrections.
Evacuees from the minimum security prison at about 10:30 p.m. were relocated to the state prison in Buena Vista. No injuries were reported.
Staff members remained on site in Rifle working with emergency management personnel to “safeguard the facility and property,” according to a press release from the Department of Corrections.
The fire as of midday Sunday had grown to about 107,000 acres.









Western Slope wildfires already add up to Colorado’s worst fire year since 2020


By: Chase Woodruff - Wednesday August 6, 2025 2:23 pm





High winds and extreme drought conditions in northwest Colorado have fueled the rapid growth of two wildfires this week near Meeker in Rio Blanco County, where firefighting crews say they’re prioritizing structure protection with “limited resources” on hand.
The Lee Fire, west of Meeker, nearly doubled in size Tuesday and has now burned 22,497 acres, predominantly on Bureau of Land Management land south of Colorado Highway 13. About 20 miles to the east, the Elk Fire is estimated at 8,304 acres in size. Both fires are believed to have been started by lightning strikes on Aug. 2.
With the latest growth, the estimated area burned in Colorado by 11 major wildfires in 2025 now stands at 64,196 acres, according to federal data. That doesn’t include smaller fires suppressed by state and local first responders, but it already makes for the state’s worst fire year since 2020.

Turner Gulch wildfire nears 14K acres in western Colorado


By: Sara Wilson - Wednesday July 16, 2025 3:27 pm





The Turner Gulch wildfire near Unaweep Canyon northeast of Gateway is burning about 14,000 acres as of Wednesday afternoon.
“This fire remains active and continues to make significant advances to the east as winds become aligned with the terrain. Fire officials are developing a strategy to protect values while providing for safety of firefighters and the public,” said a Wednesday afternoon update from the Rocky Mountain Complex Incident Management Team 1.
The fire was caused by lightning on July 10. Winds have stoked the blaze in recent days.

Alabas Farhat (D-Dearborn). July 24, 2025 | Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceA key Republican legislator announced Tuesday that the Michigan House of Representatives’ full budget plan could land as soon as next week, but hours later, Republican House Speaker Matt Hall gave that pronouncement a swift kick to the knees, publicly contradicting his own appropriations chair.
In a news conference hosted Wednesday by Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids), the leader and her Democratic colleagues called Hall’s continued antics on the budget “unprecedented chaos.”
The already tense and befuddling budget fight hit a new point of confusion when Republican House Appropriations Chair Rep. Ann Bollin of Brighton announced Tuesday morning that the chamber was nearing atmospheric reentry on its long-awaited budget proposal to fund the whole of state government.
Bollin estimated that the plan could land soon, possibly next week, giving the politically fractured Michigan Legislature a chance to get schools the money they need by Labor Day and to possibly avoid a government shutdown. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Bollin’s apparent optimism was dashed just hours later when Hall, on the House floor, told reporters that he too thought Bollin was optimistic, at best. Gongwer News Service, a Lansing-based legislative intelligence service and newsletter, reported that Hall was eyeing a Sept. 30 delivery date, which is the constitutional deadline to have a budget passed. The speaker told reporters that the longer time table was necessary because archconservative state Rep. Matt Maddock of Milford, who is the vice chair of the House Appropriations Committee, supposedly identified additional “waste, fraud and abuse” that needed to be addressed.
A message seeking comment from Bollin’s office was not returned at the time of publication.
In a regularly scheduled news conference held Wednesday by Brinks, which was planned to discuss the budget holdup, the Senate’s leader said Hall’s back and forth with his own appropriations chair was “truly unbelievable.” 
“Imagine my incredulity when I read a press release from the House appropriations chair saying they are preparing to announce a budget plan and then her own speaker undercut her shortly thereafter and said he’ll need even more time,” Brinks said. “I will reiterate that the stakes could not be higher. While the new school year is already underway for many districts all over the state, schools still do not have the security of state funding to responsibly determine their own budgets.”
If uncertainty was the goal, Brinks said House Republicans were working to make that a reality for every school in Michigan.
Joining Brinks were other Senate Democrats including Sen. Jeremy Moss of Southfield, Sen. Sam Singh of East Lansing and Sen. Kevin Hertel of St. Clair Shores.
In a quip most timely, Moss said that even fans of Taylor Swift had more clarity on her latest release than those watching the budget process in Michigan.
“It’s been three or four months of them telling all of you that they’re dropping their budget next week,” Moss said. “Even Taylor Swift, when she says the album is dropping at 12:12 a.m., the album drops at 12:12 a.m. House Republicans don’t believe in the same philosophy.”
Communication breakdown: No end to budget impasse in sight as leaders spend day throwing jabs

Moss went on to detail the various Senate bills the chamber has sent over to the House this session, aside from the pending budget. Hall has refused to act on many of them, saying the bills were either unready or needed more work. Moss bristled at that assertion, and used his long-sought Freedom of Information Act reform legislation as an example.
The Legislature and the governor’s office are currently shielded from Michigan’s FOIA, and Moss and colleagues from across the aisle have endeavored to change that, multiple times. The legislation has yet to cross the finish line despite those attempts. The recurring work on the bills shows Moss that the FOIA legislation, in particular, was not unripe for the picking.
“I can tell you who benefits without this being in the law, officials who have something to hide,” Moss said. “These are perfectly written bills. They don’t even need to be fixed.”
Moss then read the names of all the Republicans who previously voted for FOIA reform, including Hall.
The bills were reintroduced this session and passed out of the Senate earlier this year nearly unanimously. They are now collecting dust in the House.
“Where the hell are these people?” Moss said. “So, you want bills passed? You want budgets passed? Half of this building is doing its damn job. It’s time for the House to come to the table and join us to work on behalf of the people of Michigan.”
Brinks’ solution to breaking the impasse was to remain engaged in the whole budget process and to continue putting the onus on Hall’s caucus to do their jobs.
“Our plan is to bring the best resources of our caucus and of the Senate as a whole to the table and to expect that, at some point, he has to reciprocate and join us there,” Brinks said. “We will continue to raise the pressure on him to do that, because the stakes are so high, particularly with this budget.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/DSC_0159-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-20 13:57:18.553607
,Mississippi Today,2025-08-20 17:20:51+00:00,Mississippi Today,"Mississippi unemployment holds steady, ‘no hire, no fire’",Katherine Lin,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/08/20/mississippi-unemployment-steady-labor-force-participation/,Mississippi's state economist believes that the rise in real wages and decrease in inflation at the end of 2023 may have motivated people who were not working or looking for work to rejoin the labor force.,"Mississippi’s July unemployment rate held steady for a fourth straight month. 
And while Mississippi saw the largest increase in unemployment in the country year over year at 0.9%, that’s not necessarily bad news.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics on Tuesday published updated state employment numbers that showed Mississippi’s unemployment rate at 4.0% from May through July. The national unemployment rate was 4.2% in July. 

“What we’re seeing is kind of a continuation of what we’ve seen for the past few months. In Mississippi as well as across the country, it seems to be kind of a no-hire, no-fire labor market,” said Corey Miller, Mississippi’s state economist. 
The increase in unemployment is likely due to a 1% increase in the labor force. Miller believes that the rise in real wages and decrease in inflation at the end of 2023 may have motivated people who were not working or looking for work to rejoin the labor force.
Mary Willoughby, Mississippi Department of Employment Security chief economist, said that Mississippi’s unemployment rate has historically been above the national number but for the past few years it has been below. For Willoughby this is an encouraging sign.
“Mississippi’s labor market is in good shape. It’s very stable and doing a good job,” said Willoughby.  
Labor force participation, those 16 and older either employed or actively seeking employment, has been a major concern for the state. Mississippi goes back and forth with West Virginia for lowest participation rate in the nation. Over the past year it has gone from 54.5% to around 56% for the past few months, a positive sign that more people are in the labor market. 
 ”It’s increasing, which means that more people think that they have the opportunity and there are opportunities within the state to get,” said Willoughby.
However, there is some concern that the market is slowing.
Nationwide, payroll employment, the number of positions companies have on their payroll, has not changed significantly since April 2025. This is a  trend that is also seen in Mississippi where payroll employment has remained around 1.2 million since January.
“I think employers are reluctant to let any employees go right now, because they had to work really hard to get people back into the labor force,” said Miller. “At the same time, they’re a little apprehensive about trying to hire people because of just a lot of uncertainty in the economy with different policy changes.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/06181219/AP_21150599687344-scaled.jpg,,,2025-08-20 13:57:18.553607

Susan Collins.  Most of the candidates running against Collins so far are political newcomers like Graham, but his splashy campaign launch in the The New York […]","Sullivan resident Graham Platner, a veteran and oysterman, announced his bid for the Democratic nomination to challenge U.S. Sen. Susan Collins on Aug. 19, 2026. (Photo courtesy of Graham for Senate)A largely unknown oysterman and military veteran, Graham Platner garnered widespread attention this week when he launched a U.S. Senate campaign to try to unseat long-time Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins. 
Most of the candidates running against Collins so far are political newcomers like Graham, but his splashy campaign launch in the The New York Times and team of progressive strategists with records of successfully running against establishment Democrats has set him apart. 
While running on progressive ideas — universal healthcare, raising the minimum wage,  strengthening unions — Platner is clearly trying to appeal to Maine’s independent thinking, rejecting the label of liberal while embracing a working man’s pitch to appeal to supporters of President Donald Trump.  
It’s also unclear what his candidacy now means for national Democrats’ efforts to convince Gov. Janet Mills to run. 
The governor, who is termed out next year, gained a national profile after she told Trump in February “see you in court” over Maine’s law that allows transgender athletes to compete on girls’ sports teams. Now, some are hoping she’ll run for federal office, but she hasn’t decided yet. 
Earlier this month, Mills, known locally as a moderate Democrat, said she was “assessing everything” and “would think seriously about it.” According to CNN, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York has personally spoken with Mills about the race. 
Without an explicit answer, some other potential Democratic candidates for U.S. Senate are holding out on entering the race, including Speaker of the Maine House Ryan Fecteau and the owner of Maine Brewing Company, Dan Kleban.
Not all Democrats are waiting. Six lesser-known names filed to run before Platner — including Jordan Wood, a progressive former congressional aide, and David Costello, who unsuccessfully tried to unseat Maine’s other U.S. senator, independent Angus King, in 2024. 
“All of the other higher profile Democrats have, at least so far, decided, ‘Well, we’re going to run for the open governor’s [seat],’” said Mark Brewer, chair of the political science department at the University of Maine. The 2026 gubernatorial race has received far greater action with 18 official candidates already and others contemplating bids.   
“Part of that is Mills freezing the field, so to speak,” Brewer said. “But it’s not just that.”
Democrats thought they had Collins last time, Brewer pointed out. Her Democratic opponent, Sara Gideon, then-Speaker of the Maine House, far outspent Collins and polls had Gideon leading. Then Collins won by almost 9%. Brewer said he thinks the fact that prominent Maine Democrats opted for gubernatorial bids rather than Collins’ seat “speaks to the fact that she’s going to be tough to take down.” 
Eyeing a sixth term, Collins is facing pressure from both sides

Collins told Maine Morning Star in the spring she intends to run for reelection in 2026. Although she has yet to officially launch a campaign, she raised $2.4 million to close the quarter with more than $5 million on hand. 
When asked in the spring why she thinks she remains the best person to represent the state, Collins highlighted her record of delivering for Maine, primarily financially. That ability has been increasingly tested and upended during Trump’s second term. 
As for a primary challenge, Maine Republicans and Trump have rejected the idea, though someone familiar with the conversation told Politico recently that the president would love to see a “better option.” Brewer said, in his view, “it’s hard to envision another Republican winning statewide in a two-person race besides Collins.” 
So far, two little-known Republicans are running. One independent candidate has also thrown his hat in the ring. 
The candidate field 
With 15 months until the election, Democrats in the running for Collins’ seat include Platner, Wood, Costello, Tucker Favreau, Andrea LaFlamme, Natasha Alcala and Daira Rodriguez, according to Federal Election Commission filings.  
Platner was born in Blue Hill and raised in Ellsworth and Sullivan, where he launched his campaign on Tuesday. He enlisted in the Marine Corps after high school and served three deployments to Iraq. After attending George Washington University on the G.I. Bill, he then enrolled in the Army National Guard and served in Afghanistan. 
Following his service, he started working on an oyster farm on Frenchman Bay, which he now runs. He is also chair of the planning board and harbormaster in Sullivan.  
Platner wasted no time critiquing Collins during his campaign launch. In his video announcement, which was produced by Morris Katz, a top admaker for New York City Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani, he said, “I’m not afraid to name an enemy. And the enemy is the oligarchy. It’s the billionaires who pay for it and the politicians who sell us out. And yeah, that means politicians like Susan Collins.” 
Other candidates have also made similar pitches about Collins, including Wood, who said the senator “hasn’t fixed the system — she’s become part of it,” in a statement last month in which he announced his fundraising totals so far. Aside from Collins, he’s raised the most — $1.6 million as of June 30. He’s had the most public campaign presence so far, hosting town halls across the state. 
Wood, a Bristol resident, previously told Maine Morning Star his top priorities will be anti-corruption reform and getting big money out of politics. 
Wood spent about a decade working in politics in Washington, D.C, including as chief of staff to former Democratic U.S. Rep. Katie Porter of California. He helped lead democracyFIRST, an organization aimed to combat threats to free and fair elections, and End Citizens United, a political action committee working to reverse the U.S. Supreme Court decision that enabled corporations and other outside groups to spend unlimited money on elections.

The sole independent candidate, Rench of Waterboro, has raised the next most, just over $54,000.
Rench owns Ossipee Hill Farm and Observatory. He was a former senior engineer at Elon Musk’s SpaceX, though he told Maine Morning Star he now has no association with Musk or the company aside from stocks he was awarded as an employee. He returned to Maine in 2020 to raise his children and build a produce farm. He also sat on the board for the Maine Space Corporation from June 2023 until June 2025. 
Other candidates have raised little to no funds so far, in part because their recent announcements fell close to the end of the quarter.  
Costello, who announced his bid in June and has no contributions filed with the FEC so far, is a familiar face in past U.S. Senate candidate pools. 
He unsuccessfully ran for independent Sen Angus King’s seat in 2024. He was active in state and federal government campaigns before spending several years working for the U.S. government abroad through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which Trump dismantled earlier this year.
Favreau, who also filed to run in June, has raised $4,724 in contributions so far. Born in Brunswick, Favreau enlisted in the U.S. Army in 2009 after high school and eventually commissioned as an officer in the recently established cyber branch. Since moving back to Maine following the end of his service in 2021, he has continued to work in cybersecurity at Cisco Talos. 
LaFlamme of Bangor is the chapter president for adjunct faculty of Maine’s Community Colleges with the Maine Service Employees Association, Local 1989 of the Service Employees International Union, and an adjunct professor at the University of Maine, teaching courses in Women’s Studies, particularly Women’s Health and the Environment and Reproductive Health. 
Alcala of Madawaska is a fashion designer who moved to Maine from California about four years ago. She has degrees in international relations and criminal justice and is a U.S. Navy veteran. Alcala previously filed to run against U.S. Sen. Angus King in 2024 but withdrew before the primary. 
Little is known about Rodriguez, who just filed with the FEC on Aug. 15 and lists an address of a Washington, D.C. PO Box. 
LaFlamme, Alcala and Rodriguez all have zero contributions filed with the FEC so far. That’s also the case for the two Republicans who have filed to run.  
Calabrese of Kennebunkport moved to Maine five years ago from Florida and is a driver for Walmart and former small business owner. Smeriglio of Frenchville runs the rightwing Voice of the People USA radio and activist group. He is a U.S. Army veteran and former police officer, according to his website.

McCuskey on Wednesday filed emergency motions to transfer and consolidate the two cases: Joshua Hess and Marisa Jackson vs. the state Department of Health and Miranda Guzman vs. the state and the Raleigh County Board of Education.  
Hess and Jackson, two parents of immunocompromised students, are suing in Kanawha County Circuit Court over the health department’s issuance of religious exemptions to the state’s vaccination law. They’re represented by the ACLU of West Virginia and Mountain State Justice. The organizations refiled the complaint Friday after Circuit Judge Kenneth Ballard dismissed the first complaint in July for procedural reasons. 
Guzman and two other families of students issued a religious exemption to the state’s vaccination law are suing the boards of education for defying Morrisey’s executive order. The state board has said it would continue to instruct county boards to accept only medical exemptions to the state vaccination law. 
In the motion, filed Tuesday, McCuskey writes that the two cases are “at a crossroads between state mandated public health measures and individual religious liberty.”
“A single, organized judicial response is mandatory,” he wrote. “Identical issues, facts, and legal arguments will be presented throughout both cases, and consolidation is necessary to promote judicial efficiency, avoid duplicative litigation, and ensure orderly disposition of all issues. 
“In contrast, separate yet simultaneous proceedings challenging religious exemptions to West Virginia’s vaccination law risks statewide confusion and inconsistency for school districts, families, and health officials,” he wrote. 
The two cases were filed by parties on different sides of a battle over the state’s vaccination law and an executive order from Morrisey. 
West Virginia has had one of the strongest school vaccination policies in the country. All states require that students be vaccinated for a number of infectious diseases like chicken pox, polio and measles. West Virginia is one of only five states that have not allowed religious or philosophical exemptions for the shots. Earlier this year, Morrisey issued an executive order requiring the state to allow religious exemptions.
The executive order has not been rescinded even though the state Legislature this year voted down a bill that would have inscribed religious exemptions into state code. Morrisey argues that the state’s school vaccination law should be considered along with the state’s Equal Protection for Religion Act of 2023 to mean that religious exemptions should be allowed. 
In the Raleigh County case, Circuit Judge Michael Froble last month granted a preliminary injunction in favor of three families who sued the state board of education after it said it would defy Morrisey’s executive order and instruct county boards to allow only medical exemptions to the school vaccination requirements. The court’s decision applies only to three plaintiffs in the case. 
Froble has scheduled a two day permanent injunction hearing in the case Sept. 10 and 11 to decide a number of issues including what authority the executive order has and whether the court’s ruling should apply statewide. 
Meanwhile, the state board of education filed notice Friday with the state Supreme Court of Appeals that it plans to appeal Froble’s decision.
In the notice, attorneys for the board argue that Raleigh County Circuit Court erred in its ruling in a few ways, including by “grafting an extratextual religious exemption onto the vaccine law,” and when it determined that the vaccine law “substantially burdens” respondents’ exercise of religion.
“The right to free exercise of religion is a vital right, but it is not a boundless right,” the attorney wrote. “The Supreme Court of the United States has long recognized that the right to free exercise of religion does not give a person ‘freedom from compulsory vaccination’ because the ‘right to practice religion freely’ does not include liberty to expose the community or the child to communicable disease or the latter to ill health or death.’’
The board of education has also filed a motion asking the Supreme Court for a “swift review” of the case. 
During the board of education’s regular meeting last week, Board President Paul Hardesty said the board would continue to follow advice of its counsel and not accept religious exemptions. The board’s conflict with the governor’s office should be left to the courts to decide, he said. 
“There’s a checks and balances system in our government,” Hardesty said. “There’s three branches of government. They perform three different functions. I hate it for the people of West Virginia that this issue is not decided before school started. I wish it was, but I don’t control the schedule or the time frame of the judiciary. It takes time. This issue will be decided in the proper venue by the proper people, and we’ll get a decision one way or the other, up or down, and we will comply with that decision.”
In a social media post last week Morrisey promised families seeking religious exemptions that they would ultimately win in court or through legislative action. He again hinted at taking steps to limit the board of education’s power. 
“Religious freedom is a cornerstone of our constitutional system and required under state law — we will eventually defeat this politically unaccountable board,” he wrote. “Nine year board terms are too long and need to be reconsidered.”

Free.,Grants to boost local emergency alert systems in question as public media agency closes,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/grants-boost-local-emergency-alert-systems-question-public-media-agency-closes,,"WASHINGTON — The Corporation for Public Broadcasting will no longer administer a grant program that has so far provided millions of dollars to local television and radio stations to upgrade the equipment they use to send out emergency alerts.The change comes after Republican lawmakers voted last month to defund the corporation, following a request from President Donald Trump to zero out more than $1.1 billion in previously approved spending for the organization.Congress originally formed the Next Generation Warning System grant program in fiscal 2022 and provided the Federal Emergency Management Agency about $40 million during its first year.FEMA then gave that money to CPB to reimburse stations for infrastructure and other improvements meant to get emergency alerts sent through the Integrated Public Alert and Warning System to more Americans.That appears on track to change in the months ahead.FEMA officials wrote in a notice of funding opportunity for the current fiscal year that the grants will now go directly to state and tribal governments that can then award funding to public broadcasting stations that make improvements to their emergency alert systems.Democrats and some Republicans have raised concerns that without funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, local stations wouldn’t be able to raise enough funding to remain in operation, potentially leading to holes in the country’s emergency alert system.‘Rescission consequences’ for local public mediaCPB, which plans to cease operations later this year, announced this week that it would no longer be able to administer the grant funding Congress approved during fiscal 2023 and 2024. The corporation had yet to determine which applicants would receive the funding lawmakers provided for those two years.“CPB has been fully invested in the NGWS program and its mission to protect the American public,” CPB President and CEO Patricia Harrison wrote in a statement. “This is one more example of rescission consequences impacting local public media stations and the communities they serve—in this case, weakening the capacity of local public media stations to support the safety and preparedness of their communities.”That could potentially leave nearly $100 million in grant funding from fiscal 2023 and 2024 that had been working its way through the award process at the Corporation for Public Broadcasting in limbo.The White House, Office of Management and Budget and FEMA did not immediately respond to requests for comment from States Newsroom on Wednesday about the grant program.Projects funded so far include:Mid-South Public Communications Foundation in Cordova, Tennessee, which received $1.657 million to “replace a transmitter and two emergency generators to ensure the rural agricultural communities in Tennessee, Mississippi, and eastern Arkansas receive timely emergency communications.”Blue Ridge PBS in Roanoke, Virginia, which received $1.122 million to “replace critical broadcast infrastructure that will strengthen their signal in the mountainous region to reach more rural communities with targeted emergency alerts.”Louisiana Public Broadcasting, which received nearly $2 million to “install transmitters and antennas for KLTL-TV in Lake Charles and KLTM-TV in Monroe and update alerting equipment to enable statewide delivery of alerts and warning messages.”Congress votes to end public media fundsKate Riley, president and CEO of America’s Public Television Stations, released a written statement this week calling CPB’s inability to administer the grant program for FEMA “yet another devastating result of the rescission of public media funding.”She also called on FEMA “to establish a new process for delivering this funding to public broadcasters” and urged “Congress to restore essential direct funding to local stations throughout this country whose communities depend on them for lifesaving public safety services, proven educational resources and essential community connections.”Trump sent Congress a rescissions request in early June, proposing lawmakers eliminate previously approved funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and several foreign aid accounts.The House voted mostly along party lines to approve the full $9.4 billion proposal later that month. GOP senators, except Maine’s Susan Collins and Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski, approved a similar bill in July after removing spending cuts to the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR. The House voted to clear the revised legislation a few days later, sending the bill to Trump for his signature.",,,,2025-08-20 13:57:18.553607

Facing growing pressure from advocacy groups, lawsuits and climate projections that show hotter days ahead, some state prison systems are moving to install air conditioning and expand cooling measures — though many facilities remain years away from significant upgrades.
But in other states, such efforts have stalled or failed. That may lead to more lawsuits in the future, experts say, even as judges may raise the bar for such cases.

An emphasis on being “tough on crime” and prioritizing other public safety measures may have contributed to less attention on prison conditions in some states. In others, slowing revenue growth and pressure to rein in corrections spending could be making new investments a harder sell.
At least two states this year, Virginia and Texas, considered legislation addressing excessive heat in prisons but neither measure became law. The Texas bill would have required the state Department of Criminal Justice to purchase and install climate control systems in all of its facilities by the end of 2032. About two-thirds of the state’s correctional facilities have only partial or no air conditioning.
The measure passed the House but did not advance in the Senate before the legislature adjourned in June.
In Virginia, lawmakers approved a bill that would have required the state corrections department to install heat and air conditioning in its prisons and to ensure cell temperatures not exceed 80 degrees. Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed it, citing the cost of installation and operational burdens. Youngkin also wrote that existing state corrections data “does not substantiate the claims of extreme temperatures or health risks.”
But in Delaware, the fiscal year 2026 capital budget approved last month includes $2 million in funding to install air conditioning at the James T. Vaughn Correctional Center.
These changes mark the latest actions in a long-running debate over how correctional systems respond to rising summer temperatures — an issue that affects both incarcerated people and staff. Some of the policy debates and facility updates this year follow years of advocacy and litigation over the health, safety and operational challenges posed by heat in correctional settings.

The problem of excessive heat in prisons has persisted for decades and has unfolded alongside other challenges, including chronic understaffing and overcrowding. In some cases, these problems have led to extended facility lockdowns, even during the summer months.
“There are people working in prisons and they have the right to work in climates that are comfortable,” said Nancy La Vigne, a criminal justice researcher and dean of the School of Criminal Justice at Rutgers University. “When they’re not, there’s retention issues, and it’s hard to replace staff. And when you don’t replace staff, then you have challenges in maintaining the safety and security of the facility.”
In New York, for example, correctional officers staged a three-week strike earlier this year and many didn’t return to work. Some facilities now are operating with 30%-60% fewer guards than needed, resulting in some incarcerated people getting only an hour or two outside of their cells each day.
A 2023 study published in the peer-reviewed PLOS One journal found that mortality in state and private prisons rose during periods of extreme heat, with deaths increasing 3.5% on extreme heat days and up to 7.4% during three-day heat waves. Between 2001 and 2019, nearly 13,000 people died in prison during the summer months, almost half of them in the South, though the study did not determine how many of those deaths were directly attributable to heat.
Climate change is fueling longer, more intense periods of extreme heat. Exposure to extreme heat can worsen conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and asthma, and has also been linked to worsening mental health and higher suicide rates among incarcerated people.
“Average temperatures are rising, and you’re going to have more and more states around the country where incarcerated people are held in conditions that are not livable because they’re too hot,” said Sharon Dolovich, a law professor and director of the Prison Law and Policy Program at the University of California, Los Angeles.

Some upgrades

At least 44 states lack universal air conditioning within their prison facilities, even in regions known for sweltering summer temperatures, according to a 2022 USA Today analysis. A recent Reuters investigation also found that nearly half of state prisons across 29 states have partial or no air conditioning in housing units.
But some states are investing millions to update their prison facilities.
In North Carolina, corrections officials are working toward their goal of installing air conditioning in all 54 state prisons by 2026. To date, 33 facilities are fully air-conditioned, 17 are partially air-conditioned, and four have no air conditioning, according to its dashboard.
In California, the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, which operates 31 adult prisons, has spent $246 million in the past five years on cooling improvements at five prisons, according to a department spokesperson.
Lawmakers this year also approved funding for the Air Cooling Pilot Program at three facilities, with $17.6 million allocated for fiscal years 2025-26 and $20 million for fiscal years 2026-27. It will evaluate the effectiveness of two alternatives prior to a statewide plan to address high indoor temperatures across the California prison system.

The Texas Department of Criminal Justice, as of Aug. 1, is building 12,827 “cool beds,” or prison cells in air-conditioned units, and is in the process of procuring an additional 7,162, according to its dashboard.
Texas is one of the states most closely associated with heat-related deaths in prison. A 2022 study estimated that, on average, 14 deaths per year in Texas prisons are associated with heat. And a Texas Tribune analysis found that at least 41 incarcerated people died during a record-breaking heat wave in 2023.
In March, a federal judge ruled the extreme heat in Texas prisons is “plainly unconstitutional,” but declined to order immediate air conditioning, saying the work could not be completed within the court order’s 90-day window and temporary systems might delay a permanent fix.

‘More miserable’

Sweltering summer heat can turn prisons into pressure cookers. People inside already may have health conditions, limited access to cooling, or take medications that make it harder for their bodies to handle the heat. And research suggests that high temperatures can heighten irritability and aggression, sometimes fueling more conflicts between incarcerated people or with staff.
“It makes you more miserable. … If you to the point of even thinking about suicide, that’s just going to add to it,” said Ronald McKeithen, who spent 37 years incarcerated in Alabama prisons and is now the director of second chances at the Alabama Appleseed Center for Law and Justice. McKeithen recalls feeling “on edge” due to tension among other incarcerated people on hot days.
At the Oshkosh Correctional Institution in Wisconsin, Devin Skrzypchak said the heat worsens his bladder condition, and he often can’t get the incontinence briefs he needs. The heat forces him to drink more water, and on days when ice isn’t available, he’s left drenched in sweat.
“At times, it’s a living hell. … It can be very excruciating,” Skrzypchak wrote in a message to Stateline through the facility’s messaging platform.










At times, it’s a living hell. … It can be very excruciating.

D’Angelo Lee Komanekin — who has spent about 25 years in and out of different Wisconsin corrections facilities — said prison architecture plays a major role in why temperatures inside climb so high.
“The planet is getting hotter and hotter,” said Komanekin, who relies on a small plastic fan to stay cool. Komanekin also is incarcerated at the Oshkosh Correctional Institution. “They’re doing nothing about the architecture. Some institutions’ windows open, some don’t, but most of the doors have steel doors with trap doors.”
Older prison designs that rely heavily on steel and concrete building materials often trap heat, making it difficult to keep temperatures down in the summer. Aging facilities also are less likely to be equipped for the installation of central air conditioning.
Some state prison systems, including Alabama’s and Wisconsin’s, are adding air-conditioning or air-tempering systems to new prison construction and major renovation projects.

Future legal battles

Legal experts say the issue of excessive heat in prisons is likely to become more pressing as climate change drives longer and hotter summers.
Extreme heat in correctional facilities has already been the subject of litigation in dozens of states, with plaintiffs arguing that high temperatures constitute cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. Court rulings in these cases have varied, but some experts say even more lawsuits are likely if facilities do not adapt.
“The conditions are going to worsen. [Incarcerated people are] going to be looking for every possible avenue for assistance they can,” Dolovich, the UCLA law professor, told Stateline.

One of the latest cases comes from Missouri, where the nonprofit law firm MacArthur Justice Center filed a class-action lawsuit in May on behalf of six incarcerated people at Algoa Correctional Center.
The lawsuit alleges that the conditions violate their constitutional rights under the Eighth Amendment. It seeks to require the Missouri Department of Corrections to work with experts to develop a heat mitigation plan that keeps housing unit temperatures between 65 and 85 degrees. If the department cannot meet that standard, the plaintiffs are asking for the release of three of the incarcerated people who have less than a year remaining on their sentences.
Lawsuits such as the Missouri case often focus on claims that extreme heat worsens existing medical problems. To proceed, they must meet two legal requirements: proving the heat poses a serious health or safety risk, and showing prison officials knew about the danger but failed to address it, according to Dolovich, whose work has focused on the Eighth Amendment and prison conditions.
Courts may also raise the bar for proving such claims if judges echo decisions in cases with similar Eight Amendment arguments related to the death penalty and homelessness, Dolovich said. Judges have shifted, she said, toward a “superadding terror, pain and disgrace” standard under the Eighth Amendment — a higher threshold requiring proof that conditions were created with the intent to cause unnecessary suffering.
Dolovich added that some recent court decisions have provided only narrow remedies, such as ordering ice and fans instead of installing air conditioning.
“Prison officials have a moral and a constitutional responsibility to respond to changing conditions. In this case, it means air conditioning. … Anything less than that, to me, is indefensible.” she said.

Erin McCanlies was listening to the radio one morning in April when she heard Robert F. Kennedy Jr. promising to find the cause of autism by September. The secretary of Health and Human Services said he believed an environmental toxin was responsible for the dramatic increase in the condition and vowed to gather “the most credible scientists from all over the world” to solve the mystery.
Nothing like that has ever been done before, he told an interviewer.
McCanlies was stunned. The work had been done.
“That’s exactly what I’ve been doing!” she said to her husband, Fred.
As an epidemiologist at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which Kennedy oversees, McCanlies had spent much of the past two decades studying how parents’ exposure to workplace chemicals affects the chance that they will have a child with autism.

This report was originally published by ProPublica.

Just three weeks earlier, she’d been finalizing her fourth major paper on the topic when Kennedy eliminated her entire division. Kennedy has also overseen tens of millions of dollars in cuts to federal funding for research on autism, including its environmental causes.
For 20 years, Kennedy has espoused the debunked theory that autism is caused by vaccines, dismissing evidence to the contrary by arguing that vaccine manufacturers, researchers and regulators all have an interest in obscuring their harms.
He remains skeptical of the scientists who have been funded by his own agency to study the neurodevelopmental condition. “We need to stop trusting the experts,” he told right-wing host Tucker Carlson in a June interview, going on to suggest that previous studies that found no relationship between vaccines and autism were marred by “trickery” and researchers’ self-interest.
In contrast, Kennedy told Carlson that under his leadership, and with a new, federally funded $50 million autism research initiative, “We’re going to get real studies done for the first time.”
Some autism researchers fear that the effort will manipulate data to blame the condition on vaccines.
“Kennedy has never expressed an open mind, an open attitude towards what are the fundamental causes of autism,” said Helen Tager-Flusberg, a Boston University psychologist who founded a coalition of scientists concerned about his approach to autism. In a June statement, the group said the initiative lacks transparency and that Kennedy “casually ignores decades of high quality research that preceded his oversight.”

As Kennedy promotes his new initiative, ProPublica has found that he has also taken aim at the traditional scientific approach to autism, shutting down McCanlies’ lab and stripping funding from more than 50 autism-related studies. Meanwhile, he has stood by as the Trump administration encourages the departure of hundreds of federal employees with experience studying the harm caused by environmental threats and rolls back protections from pollution and chemicals, including some linked to autism.
Kennedy did not respond to requests for an interview, and an HHS spokesperson did not answer specific questions from ProPublica, including those related to the concerns of the coalition of autism scientists.
“Under the leadership of Secretary Kennedy, HHS is taking action on autism as the public health emergency it is,” the spokesperson wrote. “NIH is fully committed to leaving no stone unturned in confronting this catastrophic epidemic — employing only gold-standard, evidence-based science. The Department will follow the science, wherever it leads.”
Genetic factors account for a significant portion of autism cases. Research like the kind McCanlies and other government-funded scientists have conducted over the past two decades has established that environmental factors have a role, too, and can combine with genetics. Multiple factors can even converge within the same individual. Some of those environmental risks could be reduced by the very measures the Trump administration is rolling back.
Kennedy would have been well positioned to advocate for researchers looking into the environmental causes of autism while sitting on President Donald Trump’s cabinet.
The nephew of President John F. Kennedy and son of his former attorney general, Bobby, Kennedy spent decades as an attorney battling some of the world’s most notorious corporate polluters. Once heralded by Time Magazine as one of the “heroes for the planet,” he railed against actions by the first Trump administration, complaining in his 2017 introduction to the book “Climate in Crisis” that 33 years’ worth of his work was “reduced to ruins as the president mounted his assault on science and environmental protection.”
But recently he has remained publicly silent as the Environmental Protection Agency halts research and weakens regulations on air pollution and chemicals, including some McCanlies and her colleagues have identified as possible factors in the development of autism.
“I don’t think he’s aware of my work,” McCanlies said, “or most of the literature that’s been published on what the causes of autism are.”

McCanlies was studying how a toxic chemical, beryllium, causes chronic lung inflammation in workers when she began to think seriously about autism.
It was 2005, and her college-age stepson had a job shadowing children with autism. As he described helping them navigate playground dynamics, reminding them to return a wave or a greeting, McCanlies wondered whether their behaviors might be tied to chemicals their parents had encountered on the job. Could the exposures have altered genes their parents passed down? Could they have infiltrated the kids’ developing brains through the womb or through breast milk?
The questions remained abstract until McCanlies met another researcher named Irva Hertz-Picciotto, who had a unique data set. She had collected detailed information on the occupations of two large groups of parents: those who had children with autism and those whose kids developed neurotypically. Comparing the groups’ chemical exposures before their children were born could help illuminate causes of the condition, McCanlies realized.
Hertz-Picciotto, an environmental epidemiologist based at the University of California, Davis, was a pioneer in the search for the causes of autism. In 2009, she published a much-cited paper highlighting a sevenfold increase in diagnoses in California. While others had asserted the rise was due to increased awareness and broadened diagnostic criteria, Hertz-Picciotto found those factors could only partially explain it. She and others went on to document additional contributors to autism risk, including parental age at the time of birth, a mother’s fever during pregnancy and more traditional environmental considerations, such as chemical exposures.
McCanlies hadn’t studied autism. But she offered Hertz-Picciotto her experience in genetics and epidemiology as well as the considerable resources of her agency. NIOSH was established in 1970 to investigate the dangers of the workplace, and its statisticians and industrial hygienists were among the world’s experts on the health impacts of chemical exposures.
Their first collaboration, published in 2012, used Hertz-Picciotto’s data to see if parents of children with autism were more likely to have been exposed to chemicals already thought to be dangerous to the developing brain. The work was technical and time-consuming, but the analysis showed a clear relationship: Mothers and fathers of children with autism were more likely than the parents of unaffected children to have been exposed to solvents such as lacquer, varnish and xylene on the job. These solvents evaporate quickly and can be easily inhaled or absorbed through the skin. Chemical plant workers, painters, electricians, plumbers, construction workers, cleaners and medical personnel are among those who may be exposed to these solvents.
The sample size was small — just 174 families. But the results lined up with recent findings showing possible links between autism and exposure to metals and certain solvents during pregnancy or early childhood, including a solvent called methylene chloride. They also tracked with studies linking the chemicals to miscarriage, reproductive problems, birth defects and developmental problems other than autism.
McCanlies and Hertz-Picciotto followed up with a 2019 study that looked at more than 950 families. It showed that women exposed to solvents at work during pregnancy and the three months leading up to it were 1.5 times more likely to have a child with autism than women not exposed to the chemicals. (The study did not find a link for chemically exposed men.)
Their third study, published in 2023, took the link between solvent exposure and autism as a starting point. Using blood samples to examine the genetic makeup of the parents of children with autism, McCanlies and Hertz-Picciotto found that when exposed to solvents on the job, people with specific variants of 31 genes had an especially elevated risk of having a child with autism.
Their genetic makeup appeared to increase the risk that solvents by themselves posed. Some of those 31 genes help cells connect with one another; others play a role in helping cells migrate to different areas so they can grow into the various parts of the brain; still others ensure that cells clear away toxic substances.

Researchers were also making strides under the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, a division of Health and Human Services, which has financed investigations into dozens of environmental contaminants. Several have been linked to autism, including air pollution, certainpesticides, a plastic additive known as BPA and diesel exhaust, which causes “autism-like behavioral changes” in mice.
In 2021, Hertz-Picciotto co-published a study linking “forever chemicals” called PFOA and PFNA with the condition (In 2023, a second paper also found an association with PFNA). Other government-funded research has established a link between autism and another solvent, trichloroethylene, also known as TCE, which has been used for dry cleaning, manufacturing and degreasing machines.
Together, the results have shown that many exposures can increase the likelihood of autism, and that there can be multiple causes for any one person.
At least one exposure can have the opposite effect: A study by a researcher named Rebecca Schmidt — and funded by the NIEHS and NIH — found that a B vitamin called folic acid was associated with a significant decrease in the chances of an autism diagnosis. More than a dozen studies have since confirmed the association.
One problem hung over much of autism research. The sweeping diagnosis includes everyone from people who treasure their neurological differences to those with debilitating symptoms, including repetitive behaviors, excruciating sensitivity to touch and sounds, and difficulty responding to social situations. McCanlies and Hertz–Picciotto wondered whether certain chemicals were linked to the most severe cases or to specific symptoms.
In 2023, they set about finding out.
They were preparing to submit their study for publication when newly inaugurated Trump put Kennedy in charge of America’s health.
Despite having made chronic health conditions the focus of his agenda, Kennedy has quietly abided environmental policies that will exacerbate these problems, including autism.
The Environmental Protection Agency, under Administrator Lee Zeldin, is rolling back rules and regulations that will result in an increase in air pollution, which multiplestudies have linked toautism. The agency is in the process of reversing bans on several chemicals, including TCE, one of the solvents associated with the disorder, and has told a federal court it won’t legally defend certain aspects of a ban on methylene chloride, another of the solvents linked to autism.
It also began dismantling its Office of Research and Development, which has funded research into the environmental conditionscontributing to autism. According to an EPA spokesperson, more than 2,300 workers have so far elected to leave the agency through Trump administration programs encouraging early retirement and resignation.
The EPA also began canceling grants, including one it had given to Schmidt, the researcher who studied the protective effect of folic acid. Schmidt had been awarded $1.3 million to determine whether air pollution from wildfires might increase the risk of various neurological conditions.
Schmidt and her colleagues had just done preliminary analysis and found that there was a significant association between wildfire pollution exposure and autism when she received a letter saying that the grant was terminated because the project was “no longer consistent with EPA funding priorities.”
After a judge ruled in a class-action lawsuit on behalf of University of California researchers alleging their funding was unlawfully terminated, her grant was reinstated last month. But the EPA has appealed the judge’s ruling, leaving Schmidt unsure about the fate of the project.

Schmidt said there is an urgent need to finish the study and warn people about how to avoid the dangers from wildfire smoke by staying indoors and using air filters and N95 masks. “Millions of pregnant women are getting exposed as we speak,” she said.
Meanwhile, Kennedy has presided over his own gutting of research. Known for sharing videos of his bare-chested workouts, he likened his agency’s cuts to getting rid of “unhealthy fat,” but his plan to reduce the staff of HHS by 20,000 amounts to slashing the workforce by roughly a quarter, including veteran scientists.
Among the divisions Kennedy eliminated was one that studied air quality and collected data on chemicals found in human blood. Some workers in the division were subsequently reinstated. After a lawsuit and pressure from Congress, HHS has also rehired some NIOSH workers, though none at the division where McCanlies worked. Those whose jobs have not been reinstated remain on administrative leave.
The reorganization plan for HHS involves consolidating the remnants of these parts of the agency, along with several others, into a new division called the Administration for a Healthy America. Asked about the transition, an HHS spokesperson told ProPublica in an email that the reorganization would save taxpayers $1.8 billion a year and that “critical programs will continue.”
Meanwhile, a ProPublica review of federal data found that more than $40 million in grants awarded by the National Institutes of Health for dozens of autism-related research projects were canceled under Kennedy’s watch. Some had been awarded to universities the administration is now targeting, while others ran afoul of Trump’s “anti-woke” priorities by mentioning gender and other verboten terms.
Among them was a grant to Harvard University to use data on nearly half a million Israeli children to evaluate whether men’s exposure to air pollution affects the risk of having a child with autism (A small number of grants have been recently reinstated). A survey of researchers conducted by the Autism Science Foundation, which tallied cuts to training grants and the anticipated cuts to future grants over the next few years, estimated that the total loss of funding could be tens of millions more.
“We’re talking about probably decades of delays and setbacks,” said Alycia Halladay, chief science officer at the Autism Science Foundation. “To take money away from all these areas of need to focus on a question that the HHS director considers high priority seems not scientific and not the way that science is done.”
Trump excludes 12 Louisiana chemical facilities from new EPA pollution rule

Housed under the National Institutes of Health, Kennedy’s new $50-million Autism Data Science Initiative is looking to fund two- to three-year research projects that plumb large public and private datasets to find “possible contributors to the causes of autism” as well as conduct research on existing treatments.
With the deadline for his promised discovery fast approaching, Kennedy recently acknowledged that his initial six-month timeline was overly optimistic. He told Carlson he should have “some initial indicator answers” about the causes of autism by September, his original deadline, and promised unqualified answers within another six months.
While the NIH typically releases the names of the scientists on the committees that review grant applications and the criteria they use to review them, it has not done so in this case. Nor has the agency clarified what role NIH staff will have in awarding the grants, who will make the final selection, or what terms and conditions researchers must agree to if they receive funds.
HHS did not respond to ProPublica’s questions about who will make the final grant selection and why the agency has not yet made this information public, but a video NIH created for applicants of the funding acknowledges that reviews of the proposals “do not follow the traditional NIH review process.” According to the video, the process was “designed to ensure integrity, fairness and transparency.”
Hertz-Picciotto, who laments the fact that Kennedy is “shutting down good studies,” is among the researchers in her field who have decided to apply for the funding. “Some of his agenda is really ridiculous and very counterproductive,” she said. “But if something good can be done with this money, I’d like to be part of that.”
If her project is approved, she plans to hire McCanlies to consult on it.
McCanlies said she agreed to work on the project because she has complete confidence in her longtime colleague, if not the health secretary. “I don’t trust him at all,” she said.
McCanlies had never paid much attention to Kennedy — or to politics. Throughout the seven presidential administrations that governed while she had been at NIOSH, her work had been utterly uncontroversial. But weeks after his confirmation, she knew her job was in peril. She had deleted the first email she received from Trump’s Office of Personnel Management. The tone was so strange and disrespectful, hinting that she might be punished if she didn’t respond by confirming her email address, that she assumed it was a phishing attempt. By the time she received a second, suggesting that she find a “higher productivity” job in the private sector, firings and budget cuts were rolling across federal agencies.
The 58-year-old, who has short, greying hair, hazel eyes and three graduate degrees, hadn’t been ready to leave NIOSH’s Health Effects Lab in Morgantown, West Virginia, a place where she had mentored young colleagues, taught a lunchtime meditation class and helped conduct several yearslong research projects. The lab is also where she met Fred, her husband, another Ph.D. scientist who studied workplace chemical hazards. She reluctantly put in for early retirement just days before the entire lab was dissolved.
McCanlies spent her final days at NIOSH finishing her last paper, which explores the association between workplace chemicals and the severity of autism. Normally, she would have her supervisor sign off on her submission to a journal, but he had already lost his job. The rest of her colleagues were gone, too, and the lab’s hallways were empty as she gave the manuscript a final edit.
She felt proud of the study, which answered some of the questions she and Hertz-Picciotto had posed years ago. There were indeed links between exposures and the severity of autism. Parents’ exposure to plastics was “consistently and significantly associated” with lower cognitive scores in their children who had autism, increases in “aberrant behaviors” and deficits in basic life skills, the study found. The exposure was also linked to particular symptoms of autism, including social withdrawal, hyperactivity and repetitive behaviors such as hand flapping and body rocking. Higher autism severity scores and weaker daily living skills were also linked with ethylene oxide. Last year, the EPA imposed stricter limits on the chemical, which is used as a sterilizer. But the agency is now reconsidering those restrictions, and, in July, Trump exempted some of the biggest polluters from them.
The paper, which is now available as a preprint, recommended that regulatory agencies “consider increasing awareness of these hazards and make clear recommendations for implementing protective measures at the worksite.”
Having just watched so many occupational health experts forced to leave their jobs, McCanlies suspected their advice was unlikely to be heeded anytime soon.

(Photo by Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images)This week, the Trump administration’s Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) announced an effort to check the immigration status of people who get their health insurance through Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program.
Medicaid is the public health insurance program for people with low incomes that’s jointly funded by states and the federal government. For families that earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to afford private insurance, CHIP is a public program that provides low-cost health coverage for their children.
The feds will begin sending states monthly enrollment reports that identify people with Medicaid or CHIP whose immigration or citizenship status can’t be confirmed through federal databases. States are then responsible for verifying the citizenship or immigration status of individuals in those reports. States are expected to take “appropriate actions when necessary, including adjusting coverage or enforcing non-citizen eligibility rules,” according to a CMS press release.
States scramble to shield hospitals from GOP Medicaid cuts

“We are tightening oversight of enrollment to safeguard taxpayer dollars and guarantee that these vital programs serve only those who are truly eligible under the law,” Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who oversees CMS as secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said in a press release announcing the new program.
As of April, roughly 71 million adults and children nationwide have Medicaid coverage, while another 7 million children have insurance through CHIP. Immigrants under age 65 are less likely to be covered by Medicaid than U.S.-born citizens, according to an analysis from health research organization KFF.
Immigrants who are in the country illegally aren’t eligible for federally funded Medicaid and CHIP. Only citizens and certain lawfully present immigrants — green card holders and refugees, for example — can qualify.
But some states have chosen to expand Medicaid coverage for immigrants with their own funds. Twenty-three states offer pregnancy-related care regardless of citizenship or immigration status, according to KFF. Fourteen states provide coverage for children in low-income families regardless of immigration status, while seven states offer coverage to some adults regardless of status.
The tax and spending package President Donald Trump last month cuts federal spending on Medicaid by more than $1 trillion, leaving states to either make up the difference with their own funds or reduce coverage. But the new law also includes restrictions on coverage for certain immigrants, including stripping eligibility from refugees and asylum-seekers.

Severe heat, abnormally dry weather, and wildfire smoke have assailed Vermont and much of the U.S. throughout this summer, a testament to the growing menace of climate change. Despite this  — and adding to a long list of assaults on public health — President Trump is now using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to aim its sledgehammer at the endangerment finding, the rule which gives the EPA the authority to regulate air-polluting, climate-warming gases.
If President Trump succeeds, Vermonters will be sicker and poorer for generations to come. Now is the time to use our voices to protect this critically important rule.
The endangerment finding
The endangerment finding was issued by the EPA in 2009 to protect the public by regulating six planet-warming gases. The rule rests on a 2007 U.S. Supreme Court decision finding that greenhouse gases are pollutants, leading the EPA to make a science-based determination that they endanger public health under the Clean Air Act. The endangerment finding underpins long standing safeguards, including critical vehicle and power plant emissions standards.
Seemingly unaware of the EPA’s mission to protect public health and the environment, President Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office directing the EPA to review the endangerment finding, arguing that regulating planet-warming fossil fuel emissions is too expensive for the industries causing the pollution. On July 29, the EPA fulfilled the President’s order, and the rule is now under review.
Vermonters should be alarmed by this reckless proposal to place industry profits above the interests of our communities, loved ones and future generations.
The costs of ignoring climate science
The consequences of fossil fuel-driven air pollution and climate change are not theoretical. Air pollution from burning fossil fuels causes between 5–10 million deaths per year globally. Recent floods in Vermont and other states have devastated whole communities. Smoke from climate change-driven wildfires has become a regular feature of Vermont summers, carrying toxic particulate matter linked to premature births, exacerbations of lung and heart diseases, increased risk of dementia and some cancers and premature mortality. Heat-related deaths are expected to increase as extremely hot days become more common. Warmer, more humid weather in our state is creating a vast utopia for dangerous, vector-borne illnesses while also lengthening and intensifying the allergy season. 
Poorer mental health is at the nexus of all these climate impacts.
According to the EPA itself, the consequences of climate change and air pollution are disproportionately borne by children, pregnant women, older adults, people with disabilities, low-income communities, people of color and indigenous populations.
Health threats aside, economic facts pour cold water on the Trump Administration’s claim that regulating planet-warming gases is too expensive. The inflation-adjusted economic costs of climate-related events are staggering, totaling $462 billion in the U.S. from 2022-2024.      
The American Lung Association estimates that by switching away from fossil fuels to cleaner energy, the U.S. would generate $1.2 trillion in health benefits, while averting 13 million lost workdays, 110,000 premature deaths, and 3 million asthma attacks by 2050. According to the US Department of Energy, moving away from fossil fuels to renewable energy would spur job growth and could position the U.S. as a global leader in designing, manufacturing and deploying renewable energy technologies.
The public wants stronger protections
President Trump’s proposal to gut the EPA’s pollution-regulating authority is wildly out of step with public opinion. People know they sit in the crosshairs of weak public policy on climate change. Polling consistently shows that about two-thirds of Americans believe the government is not doing enough to protect us from climate change. Three-quarters want stricter limits on air pollution. Meanwhile, “climate denialists” are dwindling in number, representing only about 15% of Americans. Vermonters are among the most concerned about climate change in the country.
Despite accelerating climate impacts, broad-based public support for regulating health-damaging climate-warming gases and air pollution, and the rapidly mounting costs of climate-related disasters, the Trump Administration is boldly proceeding with its attack on the endangerment finding and attempting to undo decades of scientific consensus.
Fortunately, there is time to act. The EPA public comment period is open through September 15, 2025. Anyone can comment, no matter what your background. Authentic personal stories about how climate change is affecting you are the most powerful.      
For those who want to provide oral testimony, a virtual public hearing will occur from August 19 to August 22, 2025, recently lengthened due to a very high number of registrants. Anyone can sign up to provide oral testimony; oral comments are limited to three minutes or approximately 450 words.
Every written and oral testimonial must be considered in the EPA’s decision. And, if the EPA rescinds the endangerment finding, testimony will serve as evidence in legal challenges to the EPA’s decision.
Please use your voice to protect this vitally important rule, which stands as a bulwark between public health and dangerous, unregulated fossil fuel pollution.

Energy efficiency is a proven, practical and immediate way to make energy more affordable. Facing economic uncertainty and climate challenges, it’s the solution we can’t afford to ignore.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Peter Walke: Efficiency is our first, best tool for lower energy bills.","This commentary is by Peter Walke, of Montpelier. He is the managing director of Efficiency Vermont.


Vermonters feel it every time we get an energy bill or fill up at the pump: Costs are high and unpredictable. 
Global markets swing wildly. Storms knock out power. Heating our homes in the winter takes a bigger bite out of our paychecks than it used to. 
We cannot control global fuel prices, but we can control how much energy we use. That’s why energy efficiency is the single most powerful, affordable tool we have to keep costs down.  
Efficiency Vermont is now planning our next three years of programs to help Vermonters save energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It’s a moment to reflect on the importance of efficiency in our state. It’s also an opportunity for Vermonters to take our survey and share your feedback on our programs and services. 
When a business replaces outdated lighting or upgrades to efficient equipment, it lowers its bills and strengthens its bottom line. When a home is weatherized, insulated and air-sealed, it uses less fuel to keep us warm in January and less electricity to keep us cool in July. These are not just small savings. They add up. Over the past two decades, Vermonters have saved more than $3.3 billion thanks to efficiency improvements. 
Efficiency is also our cheapest energy resource. It costs far less to save a unit of energy than to produce one. Every kilowatt-hour of electricity we don’t need is one we don’t have to generate, transmit across expensive power lines and pay for. This means lower costs for utilities, more manageable peaks when demand surges and, over time, more affordable bills for ratepayers. 
It’s also a homegrown solution. When we cut our energy use, we reduce our reliance on imported fossil fuels and keep more money circulating in Vermont’s economy. That’s energy independence in action — something that benefits every household and business in the state. 
The benefits don’t stop at the wallet. Efficient appliances and heating systems improve indoor air quality. A well-weatherized home is more comfortable, quieter and healthier. And every bit of energy we save means fewer greenhouse gas emissions, helping us meet Vermont’s climate commitments while protecting communities from the devastating impacts of a warming world. 
Some may think of energy efficiency as a “someday” solution — something to get to after tackling other home projects or business priorities. But it really should be the first step. Vermont can build new renewable energy sources, modernize our grid, and electrify our vehicles and heating systems. But if we don’t streamline how we use energy in the first place, we’ll need to spend more on generation and infrastructure, driving up costs. Efficiency makes all those other investments work better and cost less. 
The bottom line: Energy efficiency isn’t just about using less — it’s about living better for less. It’s a proven, practical and immediate way to make energy more affordable for all Vermonters. In a time of economic uncertainty and climate challenges, it’s the common-sense solution we can’t afford to ignore. 
When it comes to energy, so much happens in a global market that’s beyond our control. But we can control how we use energy and we can choose to use energy wisely. When we do, Vermont becomes stronger, more resilient and more affordable for everyone. 
As Efficiency Vermont looks ahead, we want your help in improving the work we do together to make Vermont’s energy more affordable. Please join the thousands of Vermonters who have taken 10 minutes to fill out our survey by calling 888-921-5990 or visiting our website.

RJ May, R-West Columbia, appeared in federal court Wednesday, Aug. 20, so that a judge could push back his trial date. (Photo by Mary Ann Chastain/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Former Rep. RJ May’s trial on accusations of distributing videos and images of children being sexually abused should begin in October, a federal judge decided Wednesday.
May, a West Columbia Republican and founding member of the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus, resigned his House seat earlier this month. He has pleaded not guilty to the 10 counts he faces of distributing child sexual abuse material, commonly referred to as child pornography, following his June arrest.
Jury selection is scheduled to take place Oct. 8, with opening arguments beginning the following day.
The trial was initially set to begin with jury selection Sept. 10, but public defender Jenny Smith asked for a delay because of the “tremendous amount of data to go through,” she told a judge.
Prosecutors expect to spend six days building their case, in which they will accuse 38-year-old May of sending photos and videos of children being sexually abused over the course of five days in April 2024.
May wore an orange-and-white striped jumpsuit during Wednesday’s hearing. He was shackled at the wrists and ankles. He spoke only to say he had agreed to the new trial dates.
According to investigators, they were alerted by messaging app Kik that an account named “joebidennnn69” had sent videos of child sexual abuse.
Investigators tracked the account to May’s home internet and personal cellphone, a special agent for the Department of Homeland Security said during May’s detention hearing.
The account sent more than 1,100 messages, mostly explicit in nature, during the five days it was in use, and had saved 220 different videos and images depicting child sexual abuse, an investigator testified.
A previous defense attorney, who no longer represents May, suggested in a hearing soon after his arrest that a political enemy may have accessed his home internet using a password in the background of a photo May’s wife posted on Facebook.
Smith is also fighting to have the search warrant thrown out that investigators used to seize 35 electronics from May’s home last August, she said Wednesday.
Smith did not give a reason for the motion, but U.S. District Judge Cameron McGowan Currie will hear arguments on the issue next month, she said.
If convicted, May could face between five and 20 years in prison for each of the 10 charges he faces, Currie said.
Convictions on all 10 counts could mean a minimum prison sentence of 50 years and a maximum of 200 years. If released, May could spend between five years and the rest of his life under supervision, Currie said.
May could also have to pay thousands of dollars in fines if a jury finds him guilty. Each count could come with a penalty of up to $250,000, as well as additional fines of $5,000 and up to $35,000 for each count on which he is found guilty, Currie said.
A judge could waive any additional fines if May is convicted, depending on his income and ability to pay. Whether May would be able to pay additional fines is unclear.
A public attorney was assigned to represent him after he told a federal magistrate his wife owned their home and his only asset was a pickup truck.
Regardless, May would have to pay something if found guilty, since a penalty of at least $3,000 is required in all cases involving child sexual abuse material, Currie said.
“There are significant financial issues here in these cases,” Currie said.
May remains in the Edgefield County Detention Center, where he is being held without bond.
The election to fill May’s seat will take place Dec. 23. Filing will open Aug. 29, and a primary election will take place Oct. 21, if necessary, according to the state Election Commission.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_0994-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-20 12:57:47.440786

A Kansas City man riding his bike along the Trolley Track Trail felt his initial fear confirmed when a Waldo area construction site came into view.
He saw handcuffed laborers, men he assumed to be Latino, being questioned by other men in tactical gear.

“My full intent was to stop and let them know that someone was watching,” said the man, who didn’t want to be publicly identified.
He wasn’t the only one who saw what many assumed was an immigration raid in the heart of Waldo in mid-July.
Others shared their outrage on social media. And the man riding his bike took photos and a video that showed some of the men wore tactical gear marked U.S. Marshals Service.
But was it an immigration raid?

The construction workers were released when a small crowd of bystanders gathered, some drawn from businesses along Wornall Road. Tensions quickly escalated as bystanders began yelling and cursing. At least one agent who identified himself as a U.S. marshal cursed back, said the man who took photos.
The incident is now part of a growing list being documented by local advocates for immigrant rights. They’re tracking dozens of possible immigration actions, watching for patterns and trying to tamp down unsubstantiated rumors before they spread.
The Waldo incident has not been confirmed as an immigration raid.
So far, only about a dozen incidents in the Kansas City area have been verified as immigration enforcement actions since President Donald Trump took office in late January, according to Advocates for Immigrant Rights and Reconciliation, or AIRR.
Many more reported incidents could not be verified, or simply turned out to be someone receiving a ticket for a traffic violation, with no issues involving immigration.
 The value of the ‘silent observer’

Amid the Trump administration’s mass deportation campaign, civil rights advocates nationally and locally are emphasizing training for bystanders and a heightened attention to nonviolent protests.
Janet Murguía understands that Latinos and other allies are angry about reports of federal officials arresting people at workplaces, in their homes and even when they go, as directed, to immigration court.
“But that outrage needs to be targeted in the right ways,” said Murguía, the president and CEO of UnidosUS. “It cannot give more fuel to this administration to … bring in more law enforcement.”
UnidosUS is the nation’s largest Latino civil rights and advocacy organization. The group held its annual convention in Kansas City Aug. 4-7.
Training in nonviolence while advocating for immigrant rights was a recurring theme during the conference.
The actions of even one rambunctious protester can quickly escalate and incite others. Often unsubstantiated rumors spread quickly via social media.
The Department of Homeland Security reports escalating numbers of attacks on federal immigration agents and other federal partners, which can include the U.S. Marshals Service.
A June DHS release following the outbreak of protests in Los Angeles said there had been a 413% increase in assaults against federal agents from the same time last year. It also said that agents and their families had been doxed, which has been a reason that the government has given to defend the use of face masks.
The fact that a bystander had a child present during the July arrests of 11 workers at two area El Toro Loco restaurants was also called out in a Homeland Security statement.
“ICE was carrying out a criminal federal search warrant to rescue victims of human trafficking. Extremists and activists, one with their child in tow, tried to interfere with law enforcement by storming the restaurant, calling law enforcement Nazis, and attempting to keep officers from leaving the scene,” said DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin.
“Unfortunately, these types of smears and obstruction to law enforcement operations are becoming more and more common. Our brave ICE law enforcement are facing an 830% increase in assaults against them as they carry out operations.”
Statements by Homeland Security consistently highlight the administration’s goal of targeting violent criminals.
But the government’s own data shows that less than half of people arrested from late January through late June had been convicted of a crime, according to information gathered by the Deportation Data Project through Freedom of Information Act requests and analysis by news organizations like Stateline.
And among those who do have criminal convictions, for many it was for a less serious issue, like a traffic conviction.
Only 7% had been convicted of a violent crime, according to Stateline.
A person’s immigration status is a civil matter.
In training sessions, Kansas City area organizers seek to redirect those who might become agitated when interacting with federal immigration agents or other law enforcement.
If a volunteer demonstrates a fervent desire to fight fascism, or to accuse people of being Nazis, they probably need to reassess before becoming involved.
There’s more at stake with local organizing than what some people who want to lend support as an ally might realize, said immigrant rights advocates and immigration attorneys.
For example, videos taken by bystanders could be useful in legal cases challenging the constitutionality of the tactics being used by federal agents during arrests.
But videos with people screaming slurs at federal agents can be less useful.
Such actions can also undercut the philosophy of nonviolence.
Civil rights struggles require a consistent, long-term strategy to succeed, said Trinidad Raj Molina, an organizer with Advocates for Immigrant Rights and Reconciliation.
Dramatic actions might feel good in the moment, Molina said, but aren’t a part of strategies designed to bring significant social change.
“Being a silent observer is important,” said Molina.
 Lessons on nonviolence

Murguía is leaning into her friendship with the late civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis for guidance.
Through the years, she heard the Georgia congressman speak about nonviolence to groups large and small, often emphasizing lessons he learned over a lifetime fighting for voting rights, desegregation and so much more.
“I remember repeatedly hearing him say that civil disobedience requires courage,” she said. “And that the part of courage that people don’t understand is being brave enough not to respond with violence, and how critically important it is to understand the role of nonviolent civil disobedience and peaceful protests.”
UnidosUS is partnering with other national organizations like the National Urban League to call for more immigrant rights training sessions around such disciplines and to learn from the civil rights legacy of the African American community.
Martin Luther King Jr. taught that nonviolence is not passive. It focuses on injustice, rather than individuals. It’s a way of life, not a tactic.
People today might not realize how much training was involved in some of the most famous civil rights actions of the 1950s, Murguía said.
Murguía is especially aware that protesters today might be goaded to react, which can then be used as a pretext for a more militarized response by government officials.
Congress recently authorized more than $170 billion for increased immigration enforcement, which is more than the combined budgets of all other federal law enforcement agencies, Murguía said.
That point was also underscored by labor rights leader David Huerta, who said it is imperative that people who protest are disciplined and committed to nonviolence and understand how to deescalate situations.
Huerta spoke on a panel during the UnidosUS conference in Kansas City.
“When you do see violence, you have to deescalate it,” he said. “Because it can escalate so quickly.”
Huerta is president of the Service Employees International Union of California and first came to prominence through the Justice for Janitors campaign.
Huerta was recently arrested during immigrant rights protests in Los Angeles, spending three days in jail before being released on bond and charged with conspiracy to impede an officer.
He said it is too easy for government officials to “flip the narrative” on people who protest immigration arrests.
“We can’t let this sense of intimidation keep us from doing what we have to do,” Huerta said. “But we definitely have to be intelligent and smart about it, and we have to be really disciplined and always engaged in nonviolence.”
AIRR doesn’t want to dissuade people from getting involved as allies. It strives to empower immigrants, in particular.
All reported information is helpful, advocates said. For instance, AIRR has noted that more foreign cars are now being used in enforcement actions.
There are also instances of federal agents being seen driving around apartment complexes in Olathe in the early morning hours, and in neighborhoods in the Northeast section of Kansas City.
The assumption is that they might be searching for people to arrest on their way to work.
More than 2,400 people have been trained regionally in know-your-rights sessions. There are also guidelines on what to do if you believe you are witnessing a raid, including how to document it, while staying safe.
Local training sessions are similar to those made available by UnidosUS and other national organizations.
In the case of the Waldo worksite, a wrought iron fence separated the half-dozen people who tried to confront the U.S. Marshals Service.
One woman, who had come from a nearby gym, was very angry, said the man who photographed the incident.
He doesn’t regret his role. But he did worry that he might end up getting arrested as the tensions escalated.
Still, he felt an obligation to speak up as an African American, knowing that his community also had to fight for basic civil rights.
“I just felt like it’s happening right in front of my face now,” he said. “We might have kept those people from getting kidnapped.”

(Photo via Getty Images)The announced merger of companies that own local TV stations will have a huge impact around the country, but especially in Des Moines where the combined company would own three local stations, including two of the top three.
Nexstar already owns the largest number of local television stations in the country, more than 200. It owns WHO-TV Channel 13 in Des Moines. It announced plans Tuesday to buy Tegna, which owns 64 stations, including WOI-TV Channel 5 and KCWI-TV Channel 23 in Des Moines.
(For context, Tegna, is a 2015 spin-off from Gannett, which owns the Des Moines Register. Back then, newspaper profits had slumped so badly they were dragging down the value of Gannett’s profitable TV holdings, prompting the company to split its print and broadcast divisions.)
If regulators approve, Nexstar would grow to a huge portfolio of about 265 stations. It would also blow right past ownership limits that the FCC has placed on stations for decades.
Existing rules prohibit any station owner from reaching more than 39% of U.S households. The rules also prohibit any company from owning two of the top four rated stations in any market. A super-sized Nexstar will need federal approval to own both WHO and WOI, the second- and third-rated stations in Des Moines.
The TV business has changed
Station owners have been demanding an end to the limits for years. They argue tech giants like Meta and Google have sucked up so many advertising dollars that it’s unfair to artificially limit TV station consolidation.
Ted Stephens, retired general manager at KDSM-TV in Des Moines, told me television streaming has siphoned off many viewers. “The broadcast business model has completely deteriorated over the last few years,” Stephens said. “Station mergers like Nextstar/Tegna are inevitable in order for the majority of lower-rated stations to survive.”
But media consolidation critics say these mergers come at a real cost to local communities, where fewer independent stations mean fewer unique voices, especially when it comes to local news.
President Donald Trump’s Federal Communications Commission chair Brendan Carr has been advocating removing or at least loosening these so-called ownership caps. Now he has the chance to do it.
Possible outcomes
Here are three possible outcomes if Nexstar is allowed to keep WHO, WOI, and KCWI:
1. The FCC says no: Regulators could decide that’s simply too much, and require Nexstar to sell off one of the stations to a different company.
2. Business as usual. Nexstar could continue to operate all three stations independently, maintaining separate staff, programming, and newsrooms.
3. Consolidation: Nexstar could find ways to combine station operations in some ways and trim expenses. It could decide to end WOI’s newscasts and simply simulcast WHO’s news on WOI. It could also do something short of that, like keep separate anchor teams and studios, but have reporters in the field produce stories for both stations’ newscasts.
Why that matters to you


That last scenario would impact news consumers the most. Although WOI’s newscasts have historically garnered much lower ratings than KCCI or WHO, it’s still an independent voice in the community. If you, your company or your organization have a story to tell, and KCCI or WHO decline, there’s a chance WOI might do the story. Under scenario #3, that would disappear.


A single owner of WHO, WOI and KCWI could also work in tandem to increase advertising rates in the market, which your local car dealer or grocery store would not be happy about.
And let’s not forget the dreaded blackouts. When cable or streaming companies (like YouTube TV) can’t reach a deal with station owners, stations go dark — sometimes for weeks or months. WOI was off Mediacom for a full year over a retransmission dispute.
With all three stations under one roof, Nexstar would have even more leverage in these negotiations. If those negotiations go south, viewers could lose not just one channel — but three.
To be clear, none of this is guaranteed. Multiple regulators will need to approve the Nexstar-Tegna deal. But the pressure is mounting — from broadcasters who want to consolidate, from regulators debating old rules in a digital age, and from viewers and businesses who may be caught in the crossfire.
This likely is only the first of what could be a significant wave of deals. The media landscape in Des Moines — and across the country — could soon look very different.

Bowman was booked at the Charleston County jail at 6:22 a.m.
He could not be immediately reached through his lawyer.
The video surfaced as part of another investigation, The Post and Courier reported.
It was released with the victim’s consent, according to Mace.
“This video is hard to watch. It’s gut wrenching,” the 1st District congresswoman wrote Monday.
Mace posted his arrest on social media Wednesday.
“May he be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” she wrote.
For most of the nine-minute video circulated on social media, the room is dark. An unseen man and woman can be heard arguing followed by a slapping sound.
“Ow! Oh my God!” the woman is heard saying. “What the f*** is wrong with you?”
A second slapping sound is heard followed by the woman saying the man, who she calls Eric, had kicked her in the face for putting a blanket on him. The two continue arguing and the man yells at the woman to leave the room.
The woman is heard coughing and crying as the man keeps telling her to leave.
The lights come on and the two appear nude. The man takes the woman’s phone. She tries to get it back and stop him from leaving the room. The man appears to grab her by the hair and push her to the floor. He then walks out. When he returns, he tells her that her phone is in the middle of the street.
Later in the video, she says he kicked her, punched her, choked her, hit her in the face and threw her into the wall.
“Why did you do this?” she asks.
“I didn’t do s***,” he responds.
1 of the 4 men accused by Mace in floor speech arrested on other charges. He denies them.

Bowman already faces a harassment charge following his April arrest in a case involving his estranged wife.
In that case, he is accused of placing a tracking device on his wife’s car, the SC Daily Gazette previously reported. A separate charge of stalking in that incident was dismissed at an Aug. 18 preliminary hearing.
Bowman, who lives on Sullivan’s Island, has denied those allegations.
Mace filed a defamation lawsuit against Bowman in May, accusing him of “repeatedly and maliciously” damaging her reputation following her hour-long speech in February. She is separately being sued for defamation by another man she named.

The months ahead could feature court battles, a hefty signature-gathering effort and a bruising campaign to sway voters. 
The post Rent control measure triggers ballot eligibility debate appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","STATE HOUSE, BOSTON, AUG. 19, 2025…..The months ahead could feature court battles, a hefty signature-gathering effort and a bruising campaign to sway voters. And with all of that still on the horizon, supporters and opponents of reviving rent control are already waging an opening battle over ballot eligibility.
A constellation of think tanks and real estate industry groups wrote to the attorney general’s office last week, urging officials to block a proposed initiative petition that would bring back caps on rent increases.
At the same time, the measure’s backers laid out a case for why the ballot question should be allowed to advance to the next milestone along the lengthy road to the 2026 ballot.
If organizers can clear the numerous and steep hurdles ahead, the measure seeking to impose a limit on rent increases statewide could represent one of the most intense political fights in recent years.
Opponents are fighting the proposal by seeking to have it tossed at the first juncture, lodging arguments that question backers dubbed “erroneous.”
On behalf of a trio of powerful real estate organizations, legal firm CEK Boston wrote to Campbell’s office last week arguing that the measure should not be certified because it would “deprive individuals of their right to receive compensation for their private property” and would touch on religion.
The section of the state Constitution outlining the initiative petition process prohibits any measure “that relates to religion, religious practices or religious institutions.” CEK Boston, which is led by former First Assistant Attorney General Tom Kiley, noted in its memo that the proposal would exclude “dwelling units in facilities operated solely for educational, religious, or non-profit purposes” from rent control.
“On its face, therefore, Petition 25-21 relates to religion, religious practices or religious institutions,” said the memo prepared on behalf of NAIOP, the Massachusetts Association of Realtors and the Greater Boston Real Estate Board.
The Pioneer New England Legal Foundation and the Fiscal Alliance Foundation filed their own letters with Campbell’s office on Friday urging officials not to certify the measure as ballot eligible. They similarly argued that the introduction of a statewide cap on rent increases would deny landlords or mortgage bondholders of their right to return on property investment.
The Fiscal Alliance Foundation pointed to a 1998 Supreme Judicial Court decision invalidating a ballot question that would have scrapped Massachusetts Turnpike tolls, in which justices concluded that it would have improperly eliminated part of bondholders’ security interest backed by toll revenues.
PNELF also argued that the question improperly combines disparate topics — a frequent line of attack for ballot question opponents — by simultaneously proposing a limit on rent hikes as well as a system of penalties for violations of the proposed law.
“The Initiative Provision yokes a limitation on rent increases with Chapter 93A punishment, a law permitting treble damages and attorneys fees with no clear standards for whether a minor or unintentional violation will result in the imposition of such monetary punishment,” the organization wrote.
It’s not uncommon for both opponents and proponents to make their cases directly to the attorney general’s team before certification decisions are issued. The office encourages feedback, and memoranda of law were due by Friday, though it’s unclear exactly how many comments officials received on other proposals this cycle.
While officials wade through the arguments for spiking the rent control measure, they also have in hand a case for certifying it as meeting constitutional requirements.
Proponents in their own memo to the AG’s office contend that “a plain reading” of the measure “makes clear that it does not cover any excluded topic,” such as religion, judges or courts, or appropriating state dollars.
They also rebutted the argument opponents raised about infringing upon the right to receive “compensation for private property appropriated to public use.”
“Though the language of the petition makes plain there is no ‘appropriation of property for public use,’ some opponents have suggested that any attempt to regulate rent increases amounts to a regulatory taking and therefore violates this principle,” wrote the Mass. Law Reform Institute’s Andrea Park and Mark Martinez and Joel Feldman of the firm Heisler, Feldman & Ordorica. “This assertion is erroneous as well as misleading, as courts have consistently determined that regulations on rent increases do not constitute regulatory takings. Indeed, Massachusetts has had, and continues to have, numerous rent regulations that have survived judicial scrutiny, including challenges to prior rent control schemes as well as current manufactured housing rent control laws.”
The question being pushed by the advocacy group Homes for All would limit annual rent increases for most units to either the annual Consumer Price Index increase or 5%, whichever is lower.
Backers say skyrocketing housing costs are putting excess strain on many Bay State tenants, preventing younger residents from saving enough to purchase a home or displacing older adults on fixed incomes.
Voters in 1994 narrowly approved a ballot question prohibiting rent control across the state.
Two years ago, the attorney general’s office certified a rent control question as eligible to advance. That measure would have revived the practice as a local option rather than a blanket policy statewide, and its sponsors pulled the plug before the deadline to file voter signatures.
The attorney general’s review, which is set to be complete by Sept. 3, is the first hurdle for the 47 proposed laws and constitutional amendments filed this cycle. Once a question is deemed eligible, its backers will need to collect signatures from nearly 75,000 registered voters and file those with local elections officials by Nov. 19, a tall task that typically whittles the field down.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Gov. Dan McKee’s campaign manager has left the job less than three months after he was hired.
“The McKee campaign and Rob Silverstein have mutually agreed to part ways,” Mike Trainor, a spokesperson for the campaign, said in a statement shared via text message Tuesday. “Both sides wish each other well. The governor remains focused on serving the people of Rhode Island and continuing to run a strong reelection campaign to keep delivering results for working families.”
Trainor did not provide additional details on the reason for the split.
Silverstein also declined to comment when reached by phone Wednesday except to confirm that he was no longer working for McKee.
Silverstein was unveiled as McKee’s new campaign manager in early June alongside a campaign finance director, both of whom McKee lauded for their experience. A New York native, Silverstein came to Rhode Island from a policy director post with New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, whose 2022 campaign also featured Silverstein. At the time of Silverstein’s hiring for McKee’s campaign, Hochul called Silverstein a “key” and “trusted” member of her team and critical to helping the Democratic Party in New York.
McKee was already grappling with poor polling numbers when Silverstein was hired. Criticism was further cemented by a pair of new polls in July which put the governor’s approval rating at 25%.
McKee remains the only declared candidate for the 2026 gubernatorial race, though his 2022 primary rival, Helena Buonanno Foulkes, is widely expected to mount a comeback challenge next year. Other names floated, but unconfirmed, for the race include House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and 2022 Republican candidate Ashley Kalus.
Both Foulkes and Shekarchi continue to trounce McKee in fundraising, based on second-quarter campaign finance reports submitted to the Board of Elections on July 31. Shekarchi ended the quarter with $3.8 million cash on hand — the largest balance of any state elected official — while Foulkes finished with a $2.1 million balance. McKee ended the same quarter with $879,000 cash on hand.

(Getty Images)New Jersey could save hundreds of millions of dollars each year by slimming generous public worker health plans or by increasing members’ share of costs, but no other proposals would alone save enough to achieve a $200 million cut called for by language in the state budget, the state’s actuary said.
Proposals pitched by the Murphy administration to reduce costs could generate verifiable savings, said Aon, the state’s actuary, but the same could not be said of nearly every competing cost-saving proposal submitted by unions. The few labor proposals that would generate verifiable cost savings fell far short of the reduction levels called for by the budget, Aon said.
New Jersey’s public worker health plans are in distress, their premiums driven up by inflation, growing utilization, and municipal departures in its local government part that increase risk and push premiums yet higher.
Aon said a recent administration proposal to eliminate all existing public plans and replace them with ones that carry lower actuarial values — the share of medical spending paid for by a health plan, rather than workers — could save the state between $135 million and $304 million a year across active and retired populations, depending on which new plans were chosen.
“We appreciate the plan actuary’s analysis of both the State and Labor’s savings proposals and look forward to continuing our work with all parties to reach an agreement,” said Tyler Jones, a spokesperson for Gov. Phil Murphy.
Existing New Jersey health plans carry actuarial values between 93% and 98%, though most members are enrolled in plans at the higher end of that range, according to a Treasury report released in May. The state’s proposed plans would carry actuarial values between 88% and 94.5%.
The plans supported by the Murphy administration typically feature higher deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums and in many cases would set copays at a higher level than under existing public worker health plans.
A 2023 plan comparison conducted by Aon found comparable large public employee health plans in the mid-Atlantic region had actuarial values between 93.6% and 96.9%.
Language in this year’s state budget requires labor and administration officials to submit proposals that would reduce costs by at least $100 million in the first six months of 2026, annualized to $200 million a year. The budget calls for savings to be identified only in the state worker part of the State Health Benefits Program, not in the part of the program that covers local public employees.
An administration proposal that would raise members’ in- and out-of-network copays by $1,000 could also achieve significant savings, actuaries said. That change alone would save the state $213 million each year, according to Aon.
For a range of reasons, Aon said it could not weigh the cost savings of nearly every proposal submitted by unions, a fact union officials said should anger New Jersey taxpayers.
“It’s no surprise that the actuary hand-picked by the State would sign off on their own recommendations, ignoring or outright attempting to discredit good-faith proposals we’ve made to put a stop to this,” said Billy Gallagher, assistant to the vice president at CWA District 1 (the CWA is the largest union of state workers).
The actuary identified cost savings for only two union proposals: one that would encourage members to move to lower-cost, high-deductible plans by offering lower contribution rates, and another that would raise copays for anti-obesity GLP-1 drugs like Wegovy to $35 or $50.
Aon said moving 10% of enrollees to higher deductible plans would save between $4 and $7 million annually, though they warned the incentives needed to encourage that movement would denude any budget benefits.
“These additional costs could significantly offset the projected savings,” the actuary wrote.
Raising copays for GLP-1 drugs would save $4 million or $20 million a year, depending on whether copays moved to $35 or $50, Aon said.
For every other solution raised by unions, the actuary said a lack of information, the limited time it was given to review proposals, existing contractual obligations, or the uncertainty of future circumstances left it unable to accurately predict savings.
Aon said the unions’ proposal for reference-based pricing — a policy long-sought by labor that would set health care prices to 200% of Medicare rates — could generate savings if properly implemented, but warned many health care providers were not contractually obligated to accept those rates and could seek higher payments.
Other administration proposals would reduce costs by smaller amounts that, by themselves, would not be enough to reach the required level of cuts, Aon said.
Increasing prescription drug co-pays and requiring members to use generic drugs could save $47 million a year, while excluding coverage for GLP-1 drugs in almost all cases would reduce plan costs for active members by $48 million annually.
“Every idea that shifts costs to workers while propping up the insane price increases charged by the carriers and (pharmacy benefit managers) — those ideas were scored favorably,” Gallagher said.
Requiring public worker spouses to pay $50 to enroll in the State Health Benefits Program could save $26 million, and a proposal to eliminate all but a handful of existing public plans would achieve the same savings, according to Aon.
An administration proposal to limit annual physical therapy and chiropractic visits would save just $6 million a year, Aon said.
The committee tasked with designing State Health Benefits Program plans is due to meet to vote on the proposals next week, but that body’s membership is equally split between administration and union members, and the panel is likely to deadlock. If it doesn’t reach an agreement by Sept. 30, the decision falls to state lawmakers.
But if legislators pass no bill addressing health benefit costs by Dec. 1, a single representative from the unions and administration would be tasked with cost savings. The nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services must select a tiebreaker if no agreement is reached by Dec. 15.

(Courtesy of Nebraska Department of Correctional Services)LINCOLN, Nebraska — This state’s version of the so-called “Alligator Alcatraz” federal immigration detention center is being created in the roughly 7,500-resident city of McCook, Gov. Jim Pillen confirmed.
His announcement Tuesday was part of a multi-pronged push to support the Trump administration and U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s ramped-up approach to deportation.
“We want President Trump to know that Nebraska is supportive and grateful for his ongoing, critical work with Secretary Noem to arrest and deport” migrants who commit crimes, Pillen said in a statement.
 Sparks criticism

He said the assistance Nebraska offered to the Trump administration from the state and its law enforcement agencies was about “keeping Nebraskans and Americans across our country safe.”
Others, including some Nebraska lawmakers, criticized the state’s participation.
State Sen. Margo Juarez of Omaha, whose district includes the food plant where a high-profile immigration raid on June 10 arrested 76 undocumented workers, said she was furious at the prospect of Nebraska becoming a home to a facility modeled after Alligator Alcatraz, the name given by Florida Republicans to an Everglades detention center.
She pledged protests all over the state, adding: “I don’t feel that’s an appropriate way for the immigrants to be treated. I’m pissed.”
State Sen. Dunixi Guereca of Omaha said the Governor’s Office had not shared details with him, including the type of funds or labor force numbers involved. Guereca said he saw better uses for the funds, wherever they might originate.
“We need to focus on building a stronger Nebraska for all,” he said. “Instead we’re ripping families apart and wreaking terror and havoc on a hard-working community that just wants to provide a better life for the next generation of Nebraskans.”
 No state expense

State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood, chair of the Legislature’s Appropriations Committee, said he was privy to a quick briefing on the state’s immigration enforcement efforts. He said he learned the federal government will fully reimburse Nebraska for costs, with reimbursement rates anticipated to exceed the daily costs.
Costs wouldn’t be passed on to Nebraskans, he said, adding that it’s still too early to quantify any potential savings through reduced state spending.
“I’m supportive of the president enforcing the law,” Clements said.
He said he was told the facility was to be used for low- to medium-security risk detainees.
“I was pleased that the McCook people wouldn’t be exposed to a higher level of security than what they currently have,” Clements added.
State Sen. Dave Murman of Glenvil, who represents the McCook area, told the Examiner he was informed about the ICE plans “as soon as the governor knew.”
Murman said the people in his district are “generally in support of what the president is doing,” but said he figures some people “have some concerns.”
“President Trump does move quickly on everything he does. … He’s moving quickly to get his policies in place,” Murman said. “And that includes what he’s doing out here with the facility in McCook.”
A Homeland Security news release labeled the facility the “Cornhusker Clink” and said it would house criminal ICE detainees — “the worst of the worst.”
“This agreement was made possible by the One Big Beautiful Bill,” the statement said. “This law fully funded the 287(g) program and provided funding to secure 80,000 new beds for ICE to utilize when detaining and deporting the worst of the worst.”
It went on to say: “Thanks to Governor Pillen for his partnership …. If you are in America illegally … Avoid arrest and self deport now using the CBP Home App.”
 Midwestern hub for ICE

Nebraska’s Correctional Services Director Rob Jeffreys, in a news conference at the Capitol, said the facility won’t house the “worst of the worst” but would be used for detainees at the “low level and medium.”
Jeffreys said the facility would be the Midwestern hub for ICE. He added that the nearby McCook Ben Nelson Airport could be used for deportations, but the logistics are still being worked out.
A handful of protesters gathered outside of the press conference that included Jeffreys, Nebraska State Patrol Superintendent Bryan Waugh, and Nebraska National Guard Maj. Gen. Craig Strong.
“It’s incredibly frustrating that no matter how much it looks like people are saying, ‘Stop’ — no one actually in power is doing what needs to be done and stopping it,” said Jaci Vetro, a Lincoln resident.
Nebraska U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., said he views the move as a way to support the local community and keep jobs in McCook. “I support President Trump’s actions to protect our communities and Gov. Pillen’s work to bring DHS investment to Nebraska,” Ricketts said in a statement.
The Homeland Security statement said that the Nebraska facility marks the third state partnership to expand ICE detention space “following Alligator Alcatraz and Speedway Slammer.”
Speedway Slammer is their nickname for ICE’s new facility in Bunker Hill, Indiana, referencing the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, which is about 75 miles away.
 More partnerships

In addition to the McCook center, Pillen announced two other state-federal partnerships with Homeland Security.
For one, the Nebraska National Guard will provide about 20 soldiers to help Nebraska-based ICE agents carry out their duties. Training is to begin within the next week.
Also at Pillen’s direction, the Nebraska State Patrol announced it would sign a 287(g) agreement that empowers state troopers to help ICE arrest migrants in the country without authorization who break the law.
So named for its section of immigration law, the often-controversial program delegates state and local law enforcement officers authority to perform immigration officer functions under the federal agency’s direction and oversight.
Pillen turned to an arrest earlier this summer in Omaha when Nebraska law enforcement agents worked with ICE to arrest a person ICE described as a “drug-trafficking kingpin and murderer.”
“This stuff hits close to home — and hits every corner of this state and country,” he said. “Government’s most important job is to keep us safe, and that’s why the State of Nebraska, under my leadership, is partnering with President Trump.”
Three Nebraska county sheriff’s offices are authorized for the 287(g) program — Brown, Dakota and Wheeler.
 280 beds

The Homeland Security and Pillen confirmations of the Nebraska ICE facility revealed that the existing Work Ethic Camp in McCook would be converted and provide capacity for 300 migrants. It was built to house up to 200 people in a medium-security facility operated by the Nebraska state prison system.
Pillen, who also held a press conference in McCook, and was greeted by a group of anti-ICE protesters, said that about 85 workers employed by the Corrections Department at the Work Ethic Camp would remain under the contract arrangement that pays the state.
He said migrants held at the facility would likely be there five to 50 days and that there would be “a lot of activity” at the nearby airport removing people from the United States.
Gene Weedin, a McCook City Council member, said he was still learning details and forming an opinion about the center coming to his city. Nebraska owns nearly 45 acres at the McCook site.
Weedin said Pillen was in McCook with Corrections Director Jeffreys over the weekend talking to various local officials. Weedin’s understanding is that the state prison facility would stop operating in its current form, start functioning as the federal immigration detention facility, and that those now in the facility would be transferred to other places.
He said the people housed at the center have contributed to the community by picking up trash, putting up annual Christmas decorations, and doing other public service.
“There are just a lot of questions,” said Weedin.
 Staffing shortage

Nebraska has historically struggled to hire enough staff to use the McCook center as it was originally intended, to reform younger men who’ve committed crimes by assigning them jobs and tasks. The camp focuses its counseling and other efforts on encouraging behavior changes to reduce recidivism.
It is the least crowded of Nebraska’s overcrowded adult prison facilities, running a daily census of about 184 in Fiscal Year 2025. But it is also one of the prison facilities with the greatest need for additional staffing. The department’s census says it was staffed to house an average of about 125 people in FY 2025.
State Sen. Terrell McKinney of North Omaha said on social media that Nebraska “prisons are already overcrowded and inhumane. “
“And our state faces a budget crisis. We cannot afford this,” he said.
Cristine Schwartz, the public information officer at the McCook Work Ethic Camp, referred calls to a state Correctional Services spokeswoman, who did not immediately return calls.
State Sen. Teresa Ibach of Sumner, who represents part of west-central Nebraska outside of McCook, said she only just learned about the ICE effort and was “still gathering more information.”
The state has been working around the Douglas County Jail in Omaha no longer actively participating in ICE detentions. Detainees from eastern Nebraska have been sent to Council Bluffs, Iowa, and as far away as the Lincoln County Jail in North Platte — where the 76 workers arrested in the high-profile immigration raid at Omaha’s Glenn Valley plant were transported. Many are still there.
 Other ICE contracts

ICE also plans to contract with jails in eastern Nebraska’s Sarpy and Cass counties for 30 beds each and the Washington County Jail for 15, according to ICE documents the Washington Post obtained.
Pillen’s announcement is apparently Nebraska’s contribution to a plan that the federal documents showed would open or expand 125 immigration detention facilities this year.
In its detention expansion strategy, the Trump administration has revived other dormant prisons, repurposed military bases and secured partnerships with private prison contractors, local sheriffs and Republican governors to house its record number of detainees, the Post reported.
By January, the documents indicate, ICE would have capacity to hold more than 107,000 people, up from close to 50,000 now. The documents, last updated July 30, reflected ICE intentions to rely increasingly on makeshift “soft-sided” structures that could be built in a few weeks and taken down as easily. The government also plans to make more room for detaining parents and children.
The American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska is among critics of the Pillen plan, calling it “a new low point and way out of step with where most Nebraskans are on this issue.”
“Imagine hearing about the cruel rights violations happening in other states’ ICE detention sites and thinking that we need our own heartland horror,” said Mindy Rush Chipman, executive director of ACLU Nebraska.
Nebraska Democratic Party officials described creation of the detention facility in McCook as a “bend the knee” moment by top Republicans in Nebraska, and the governor’s participation as disgusting.
“They promised to go after criminals and instead have locked up hardworking moms and dads who contribute their skills to our agricultural economy,” said Jane Kleeb, state party chair. “Creating fear and division … does not have to be the Cornhusker way.”
Nebraska Appleseed called the governor’s cooperation part of a “harmful, dangerous and rapid expansion” of detainment camps that “repeat a deeply ugly pattern of history.”
Darcy Tromanhauser, the advocacy agency’s immigrants and communities program director, urged officials instead to update immigration laws.
“Nebraskans want policy change, not punishment,” she said.
Earlier this month, Noem revealed in an interview with CBS News that Nebraska was being considered as a home to one of the state-run, federally funded migrant detention centers that the Trump administration hoped to launch across the country in the likeness of the one dubbed Alligator Alcatraz.
Noem said she had already appealed to governors and state leaders. Strimple acknowledged the possibility at the time, saying the governor would “make details public at the appropriate time.”

The new state law prohibits the per-mile deduction from exceeding $1 per mile and requires DFA’s secretary to set the per-mile amount as close to the per-mile deduction most recently set by the IRS “as is fiscally responsible without causing an undue hardship on taxpayers.” 
The law also requires the secretary to issue a proclamation no later than 30 days after the IRS deduction is changed. DFA issued its proclamation on Aug. 14, according to the release.

Josh Stein warned coastal residents of North Carolina to “take action now before it’s too late” Wednesday to prepare for the arrival of Hurricane Erin, and to follow any evacuation orders.
Stein declared a statewide state of emergency on Tuesday in anticipation of the storm, currently a Category 2 hurricane, and local states of emergency are in effect in Dare, Hyde, and Currituck counties. In addition, residents of Ocracoke and Hatteras islands are subject to mandatory evacuation orders.
“If you are under an evacuation order, take action now before it’s too late,” Stein said Wednesday morning. “You can find shelter at the state-operated disaster shelter located at 113 Wilcox Street in Warrenton, North Carolina. Pets are allowed at the shelter.”
While the center of the hurricane is forecast to remain over the Atlantic, the National Hurricane Center projects that tropical storm-force winds will hit the North Carolina coast as soon as 2 p.m., but likely closer to 8 p.m. Much of the coast is subject to a Tropical Storm Warning, with winds of up to 35 to 45 mph forecast and wind gusts of 50 to 55 mph possible.
The hurricane can also generate tornadoes, and produced a minor EF0 tornado on the beach in Brunswick County on Monday. The most severe of the storm’s impacts to North Carolina are predicted to come Wednesday evening and Thursday morning, Stein said.

Emergency Management director Will Ray warned residents not to attempt to cross flooded roadways, as it is not possible to judge the speed or depth of floodwaters, which can easily be powerful enough to sweep cars off the road.
“Hurricane Erin is already creating extremely dangerous and life-threatening rip currents for all of the North Carolina coast that will linger throughout the week,” Ray said. “We’ve seen a high number of rescues along the coast, and you should avoid swimming anywhere on the North Carolina coast right now.”
Stein echoed his warning: “No one should be in the ocean,” he said.
Ray said “extremely large, dangerous waves” around 20 feet high are anticipated to hit the coast as well as a storm surge of 2 to 4 feet on top of the surf. Coastal roadways in particular will likely be inundated and made impassable, especially N.C. Highway 12 and along the Outer Banks. Beaches could also see significant erosion, the officials said.
Residents can monitor the status of roads and highways on drivenc.gov, but should avoid driving through any flooding even if not reflected on the website. For information on storm conditions, evacuations, and related weather events, information is available at readync.gov/Erin.
The state has mobilized 200 members of the North Carolina National Guard and has positioned three swift water rescue teams, trained to render aid in flood conditions. The state has also received Chinook heavy-lift helicopters from Georgia if it becomes necessary to fly food and water in to stranded residents, Stein said.
Even with the resources in place, Stein urged residents to prepare disaster kits with enough food and water for three to five days for all members of the household as well as batteries, flashlights, and a battery-powered radio. He also advised residents to be wary of potential misinformation on social media, and to only follow official sources. “Please be sure to have multiple ways to receive weather alerts, especially during the overnight hours,” Ray said.
In addition, Stein said residents on the coast should have “go-bags” ready with cash, prescriptions, phone chargers, and any important personal and financial documents, in case a sudden evacuation is required. “Take photos of whatever you own that is valuable in case it gets destroyed,” he said.
Erin is the fifth named storm of this Atlantic hurricane season.

Bryant ruled last week that the cases in front of him should await an appellate court decision. (Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — CoreCivic and the city of Leavenworth will continue their fight over development regulations in front of a Kansas appellate court after a Leavenworth district judge decided to wait for a decision in that case.  
Judge John Bryant on Friday said the primary issues being argued in his court would be significantly affected by the case that’s being appealed. 
“The court believes that due to the pending appellate review and ongoing federal case, the court has no choice but to stay certain decisions pending the outcomes of those matters,” Bryant wrote in his decision. “The legal issues in those matters overlap the issues pending before this court to such a degree as to make them unable to be parsed.”
CoreCivic and Leavenworth city officials are arguing about the reopening of the CoreCivic prison facility, which closed in 2021. CoreCivic signed a contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to open the vacant facility to house immigration detainees. 
However, Leavenworth told CoreCivic that it needed to go through the city’s updated development process and apply for a special use permit, which would require multiple steps and include public hearings. CoreCivic contends the permit is not needed.  
Bryant also said that if the city is successful in the federal case, it would make “any decisions in this matter moot.” 
However, Bryant did dismiss one of the four counts in the case, in which Leavenworth says the CoreCivic operation creates a public nuisance. While Leavenworth “goes to great lengths to paint Defendant CoreCivic in a negative light,” Bryant said he finds those arguments are based on past complaints about the prison’s operation. 
“There can be no question that as Defendant CoreCivic’s facility currently sits, it is not a nuisance and Plaintiff pleads no facts that would portray it as such,” Bryant wrote.
Leavenworth and CoreCivic continue to stand firm in their opposing views that led them to court. 
The city believes the case is important because it needs to ensure development processes are followed, said city manager Scott Peterson. 
“That is the core argument of the City Commission,” he said. “They want to ensure that the city of Leavenworth has the right to govern development within its city limits, and that anyone looking to open a business in Leavenworth follows the process as outlined in the adopted city ordinances.”
The city doesn’t have the financial resources of CoreCivic, Peterson said. 
“However, the City Commission has made it clear that ensuring Leavenworth’s ability to govern development and hold companies like CoreCivic accountable to the City’s development regulations is money well spent,” he said. 
CoreCivic could “save all of us a lot of money” by applying for the special use permit, he added. 
The national private prison company, through spokesman Ryan Gustin, said only that it is pursuing all avenues to successfully end the legal matters so it can fulfill the ICE contract. 
“CoreCivic respects the entire judicial process, both at the state and federal level, and we welcome the opportunity to present our position to the courts,” Gustin said. 
Hearings in the appellate court case, filed by CoreCivic, have not been set. The case names the city of Leavenworth, the mayor, the mayor pro tem and three members of the city council, and it will be heard by District Judge Toby Krause. 
In its complaint, CoreCivic alleges the city is violating the supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution. That clause sets federal laws as supreme over state laws.
By denying the company the ability to fulfill its ICE contract, Leavenworth is interfering with the operations of the federal government, CoreCivic’s initial filing said. 
The complaint also alleges that CoreCivic, as a contractor for the United States, is “clothed in the Federal Government’s intergovernmental immunity under the Supremacy Clause.”
Such immunity, the complaint said, stops states from regulating or discriminating against the federal government or “those with whom it deals.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Judge-John-Bryant-20250806_101143-1024x597.jpg,,,2025-08-20 11:58:40.105005

Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox.



Erin McCanlies was listening to the radio one morning in April when she heard Robert F. Kennedy Jr. promising to find the cause of autism by September. The secretary of Health and Human Services said he believed an environmental toxin was responsible for the dramatic increase in the condition and vowed to gather “the most credible scientists from all over the world” to solve the mystery.
Nothing like that has ever been done before, he told an interviewer.
McCanlies was stunned. The work had been done.
“That’s exactly what I’ve been doing!” she said to her husband, Fred.
As an epidemiologist at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which Kennedy oversees, McCanlies had spent much of the past two decades studying how parents’ exposure to workplace chemicals affects the chance that they will have a child with autism. Just three weeks earlier, she’d been finalizing her fourth major paper on the topic when Kennedy eliminated her entire division. Kennedy has also overseen tens of millions of dollars in cuts to federal funding for research on autism, including its environmental causes.
For 20 years, Kennedy has espoused the debunked theory that autism is caused by vaccines, dismissing evidence to the contrary by arguing that vaccine manufacturers, researchers and regulators all have an interest in obscuring their harms.
[RELATED: After RFK Jr. autism claims, CT families respond — one with a poem]
He remains skeptical of the scientists who have been funded by his own agency to study the neurodevelopmental condition. “We need to stop trusting the experts,” he told right-wing host Tucker Carlson in a June interview, going on to suggest that previous studies that found no relationship between vaccines and autism were marred by “trickery” and researchers’ self-interest.
In contrast, Kennedy told Carlson that under his leadership, and with a new, federally funded $50 million autism research initiative, “We’re going to get real studies done for the first time.”
Some autism researchers fear that the effort will manipulate data to blame the condition on vaccines. “Kennedy has never expressed an open mind, an open attitude towards what are the fundamental causes of autism,” said Helen Tager-Flusberg, a Boston University psychologist who founded a coalition of scientists concerned about his approach to autism. In a June statement, the group said the initiative lacks transparency and that Kennedy “casually ignores decades of high quality research that preceded his oversight.”
As Kennedy promotes his new initiative, ProPublica has found that he has also taken aim at the traditional scientific approach to autism, shutting down McCanlies’ lab and stripping funding from more than 50 autism-related studies. Meanwhile, he has stood by as the Trump administration encourages the departure of hundreds of federal employees with experience studying the harm caused by environmental threats and rolls back protections from pollution and chemicals, including some linked to autism.
Kennedy did not respond to requests for an interview, and an HHS spokesperson did not answer specific questions from ProPublica, including those related to the concerns of the coalition of autism scientists. “Under the leadership of Secretary Kennedy, HHS is taking action on autism as the public health emergency it is,” the spokesperson wrote. “NIH is fully committed to leaving no stone unturned in confronting this catastrophic epidemic — employing only gold-standard, evidence-based science. The Department will follow the science, wherever it leads.”
Genetic factors account for a significant portion of autism cases. Research like the kind McCanlies and other government-funded scientists have conducted over the past two decades has established that environmental factors have a role, too, and can combine with genetics. Multiple factors can even converge within the same individual. Some of those environmental risks could be reduced by the very measures the Trump administration is rolling back.
Kennedy would have been well positioned to advocate for researchers looking into the environmental causes of autism while sitting on President Donald Trump’s cabinet.
The nephew of President John F. Kennedy and son of his former attorney general, Bobby, Kennedy spent decades as an attorney battling some of the world’s most notorious corporate polluters. Once heralded by Time Magazine as one of the “heroes for the planet,” he railed against actions by the first Trump administration, complaining in his 2017 introduction to the book “Climate in Crisis” that 33 years’ worth of his work was “reduced to ruins as the president mounted his assault on science and environmental protection.”
But recently he has remained publicly silent as the Environmental Protection Agency halts research and weakens regulations on air pollution and chemicals, including some McCanlies and her colleagues have identified as possible factors in the development of autism.
“I don’t think he’s aware of my work,” McCanlies said, “or most of the literature that’s been published on what the causes of autism are.”

McCanlies was studying how a toxic chemical, beryllium, causes chronic lung inflammation in workers when she began to think seriously about autism.
It was 2005, and her college-age stepson had a job shadowing children with autism. As he described helping them navigate playground dynamics, reminding them to return a wave or a greeting, McCanlies wondered whether their behaviors might be tied to chemicals their parents had encountered on the job. Could the exposures have altered genes their parents passed down? Could they have infiltrated the kids’ developing brains through the womb or through breast milk?
The questions remained abstract until McCanlies met another researcher named Irva Hertz-Picciotto, who had a unique data set. She had collected detailed information on the occupations of two large groups of parents: those who had children with autism and those whose kids developed neurotypically. Comparing the groups’ chemical exposures before their children were born could help illuminate causes of the condition, McCanlies realized.
Hertz-Picciotto, an environmental epidemiologist based at the University of California, Davis, was a pioneer in the search for the causes of autism. In 2009, she published a much-cited paper highlighting a sevenfold increase in diagnoses in California. While others had asserted the rise was due to increased awareness and broadened diagnostic criteria, Hertz-Picciotto found those factors could only partially explain it. She and others went on to document additional contributors to autism risk, including parental age at the time of birth, a mother’s fever during pregnancy and more traditional environmental considerations, such as chemical exposures.
McCanlies hadn’t studied autism. But she offered Hertz-Picciotto her experience in genetics and epidemiology as well as the considerable resources of her agency. NIOSH was established in 1970 to investigate the dangers of the workplace, and its statisticians and industrial hygienists were among the world’s experts on the health impacts of chemical exposures.
Their first collaboration, published in 2012, used Hertz-Picciotto’s data to see if parents of children with autism were more likely to have been exposed to chemicals already thought to be dangerous to the developing brain. The work was technical and time-consuming, but the analysis showed a clear relationship: Mothers and fathers of children with autism were more likely than the parents of unaffected children to have been exposed to solvents such as lacquer, varnish and xylene on the job. These solvents evaporate quickly and can be easily inhaled or absorbed through the skin. Chemical plant workers, painters, electricians, plumbers, construction workers, cleaners and medical personnel are among those who may be exposed to these solvents.
The sample size was small — just 174 families. But the results lined up with recent findings showing possible links between autism and exposure to metals and certain solvents during pregnancy or early childhood, including a solvent called methylene chloride. They also tracked with studies linking the chemicals to miscarriage, reproductive problems, birth defects and developmental problems other than autism.
McCanlies and Hertz-Picciotto followed up with a 2019 study that looked at more than 950 families. It showed that women exposed to solvents at work during pregnancy and the three months leading up to it were 1.5 times more likely to have a child with autism than women not exposed to the chemicals. (The study did not find a link for chemically exposed men.)
Their third study, published in 2023, took the link between solvent exposure and autism as a starting point. Using blood samples to examine the genetic makeup of the parents of children with autism, McCanlies and Hertz-Picciotto found that when exposed to solvents on the job, people with specific variants of 31 genes had an especially elevated risk of having a child with autism. Their genetic makeup appeared to increase the risk that solvents by themselves posed. Some of those 31 genes help cells connect with one another; others play a role in helping cells migrate to different areas so they can grow into the various parts of the brain; still others ensure that cells clear away toxic substances.
Researchers were also making strides under the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, a division of Health and Human Services, which has financed investigations into dozens of environmental contaminants. Several have been linked to autism, including air pollution, certain pesticides, a plastic additive known as BPA and diesel exhaust, which causes “autism-like behavioral changes” in mice. In 2021, Hertz-Picciotto co-published a study linking “forever chemicals” called PFOA and PFNA with the condition. (In 2023, a second paper also found an association with PFNA.) Other government-funded research has established a link between autism and another solvent, trichloroethylene, also known as TCE, which has been used for dry cleaning, manufacturing and degreasing machines.
Together, the results have shown that many exposures can increase the likelihood of autism, and that there can be multiple causes for any one person.
At least one exposure can have the opposite effect: A study by a researcher named Rebecca Schmidt — and funded by the NIEHS and NIH — found that a B vitamin called folic acid was associated with a significant decrease in the chances of an autism diagnosis. More than a dozen studies have since confirmed the association.
One problem hung over much of autism research. The sweeping diagnosis includes everyone from people who treasure their neurological differences to those with debilitating symptoms, including repetitive behaviors, excruciating sensitivity to touch and sounds, and difficulty responding to social situations. McCanlies and Hertz–Picciotto wondered whether certain chemicals were linked to the most severe cases or to specific symptoms.
In 2023, they set about finding out.
They were preparing to submit their study for publication when newly inaugurated Trump put Kennedy in charge of America’s health.

Despite having made chronic health conditions the focus of his agenda, Kennedy has quietly abided environmental policies that will exacerbate these problems, including autism.
The Environmental Protection Agency, under Administrator Lee Zeldin, is rolling back rules and regulations that will result in an increase in air pollution, which multiple studies have linked to autism. The agency is in the process of reversing bans on several chemicals, including TCE, one of the solvents associated with the disorder, and has told a federal court it won’t legally defend certain aspects of a ban on methylene chloride, another of the solvents linked to autism. It also began dismantling its Office of Research and Development, which has funded research into the environmental conditions contributing to autism. According to an EPA spokesperson, more than 2,300 workers have so far elected to leave the agency through Trump administration programs encouraging early retirement and resignation.
The EPA also began canceling grants, including one it had given to Schmidt, the researcher who studied the protective effect of folic acid. Schmidt had been awarded $1.3 million to determine whether air pollution from wildfires might increase the risk of various neurological conditions. Schmidt and her colleagues had just done preliminary analysis and found that there was a significant association between wildfire pollution exposure and autism when she received a letter saying that the grant was terminated because the project was “no longer consistent with EPA funding priorities.” After a judge ruled in a class-action lawsuit on behalf of University of California researchers alleging their funding was unlawfully terminated, her grant was reinstated last month. But the EPA has appealed the judge’s ruling, leaving Schmidt unsure about the fate of the project.
Schmidt said there is an urgent need to finish the study and warn people about how to avoid the dangers from wildfire smoke by staying indoors and using air filters and N95 masks. “Millions of pregnant women are getting exposed as we speak,” she said.
Meanwhile, Kennedy has presided over his own gutting of research. Known for sharing videos of his bare-chested workouts, he likened his agency’s cuts to getting rid of “unhealthy fat,” but his plan to reduce the staff of HHS by 20,000 amounts to slashing the workforce by roughly a quarter, including veteran scientists. Among the divisions Kennedy eliminated was one that studied air quality and collected data on chemicals found in human blood. Some workers in the division were subsequently reinstated. After a lawsuit and pressure from Congress, HHS has also rehired some NIOSH workers, though none at the division where McCanlies worked. Those whose jobs have not been reinstated remain on administrative leave.
The reorganization plan for HHS involves consolidating the remnants of these parts of the agency, along with several others, into a new division called the Administration for a Healthy America. Asked about the transition, an HHS spokesperson told ProPublica in an email that the reorganization would save taxpayers $1.8 billion a year and that “critical programs will continue.”
Meanwhile, a ProPublica review of federal data found that more than $40 million in grants awarded by the National Institutes of Health for dozens of autism-related research projects were canceled under Kennedy’s watch. Some had been awarded to universities the administration is now targeting, while others ran afoul of Trump’s “anti-woke” priorities by mentioning gender and other verboten terms. Among them was a grant to Harvard University to use data on nearly half a million Israeli children to evaluate whether men’s exposure to air pollution affects the risk of having a child with autism. (A small number of grants have been recently reinstated.) A survey of researchers conducted by the Autism Science Foundation, which tallied cuts to training grants and the anticipated cuts to future grants over the next few years, estimated that the total loss of funding could be tens of millions more.
“We’re talking about probably decades of delays and setbacks,” said Alycia Halladay, chief science officer at the Autism Science Foundation. “To take money away from all these areas of need to focus on a question that the HHS director considers high priority seems not scientific and not the way that science is done.”

Housed under the National Institutes of Health, Kennedy’s new $50-million Autism Data Science Initiative is looking to fund two- to three-year research projects that plumb large public and private datasets to find “possible contributors to the causes of autism” as well as conduct research on existing treatments.
With the deadline for his promised discovery fast approaching, Kennedy recently acknowledged that his initial six-month timeline was overly optimistic. He told Carlson he should have “some initial indicator answers” about the causes of autism by September, his original deadline, and promised unqualified answers within another six months.
While the NIH typically releases the names of the scientists on the committees that review grant applications and the criteria they use to review them, it has not done so in this case. Nor has the agency clarified what role NIH staff will have in awarding the grants, who will make the final selection, or what terms and conditions researchers must agree to if they receive funds. HHS did not respond to ProPublica’s questions about who will make the final grant selection and why the agency has not yet made this information public, but a video NIH created for applicants of the funding acknowledges that reviews of the proposals “do not follow the traditional NIH review process.” According to the video, the process was “designed to ensure integrity, fairness and transparency.”
Hertz-Picciotto, who laments the fact that Kennedy is “shutting down good studies,” is among the researchers in her field who have decided to apply for the funding. “Some of his agenda is really ridiculous and very counterproductive,” she said. “But if something good can be done with this money, I’d like to be part of that.”
If her project is approved, she plans to hire McCanlies to consult on it.
McCanlies said she agreed to work on the project because she has complete confidence in her longtime colleague, if not the health secretary. “I don’t trust him at all,” she said.
McCanlies had never paid much attention to Kennedy — or to politics. Throughout the seven presidential administrations that governed while she had been at NIOSH, her work had been utterly uncontroversial. But weeks after his confirmation, she knew her job was in peril. She had deleted the first email she received from Trump’s Office of Personnel Management. The tone was so strange and disrespectful, hinting that she might be punished if she didn’t respond by confirming her email address, that she assumed it was a phishing attempt. By the time she received a second, suggesting that she find a “higher productivity” job in the private sector, firings and budget cuts were rolling across federal agencies.
The 58-year-old, who has short, greying hair, hazel eyes and three graduate degrees, hadn’t been ready to leave NIOSH’s Health Effects Lab in Morgantown, West Virginia, a place where she had mentored young colleagues, taught a lunchtime meditation class and helped conduct several yearslong research projects. The lab is also where she met Fred, her husband, another Ph.D. scientist who studied workplace chemical hazards. She reluctantly put in for early retirement just days before the entire lab was dissolved.
McCanlies spent her final days at NIOSH finishing her last paper, which explores the association between workplace chemicals and the severity of autism. Normally, she would have her supervisor sign off on her submission to a journal, but he had already lost his job. The rest of her colleagues were gone, too, and the lab’s hallways were empty as she gave the manuscript a final edit.
She felt proud of the study, which answered some of the questions she and Hertz-Picciotto had posed years ago. There were indeed links between exposures and the severity of autism. Parents’ exposure to plastics was “consistently and significantly associated” with lower cognitive scores in their children who had autism, increases in “aberrant behaviors” and deficits in basic life skills, the study found. The exposure was also linked to particular symptoms of autism, including social withdrawal, hyperactivity and repetitive behaviors such as hand flapping and body rocking. Higher autism severity scores and weaker daily living skills were also linked with ethylene oxide. Last year, the EPA imposed stricter limits on the chemical, which is used as a sterilizer. But the agency is now reconsidering those restrictions, and, in July, Trump exempted some of the biggest polluters from them.
The paper, which is now available as a preprint, recommended that regulatory agencies “consider increasing awareness of these hazards and make clear recommendations for implementing protective measures at the worksite.”
Having just watched so many occupational health experts forced to leave their jobs, McCanlies suspected their advice was unlikely to be heeded anytime soon.

Rep. Chris Murphy submitted his “irrevocable resignation” to House Speaker Murrell Smith, with an effective date of Jan. 5. That’s one week before the 2026 session starts.
“While this decision is bittersweet, my retirement will allow me to spend more time with my loved ones and to focus on my work outside of public office,” reads his letter, dated Tuesday.
The 57-year-old attorney, first elected in 2010, was absent for much of the 2025 session.
Before his election to the Statehouse, Murphy spent eight years on the Dorchester County Council, including one year as chairman.
In the House, he spent two years as chairman of the Judiciary Committee. Following his re-election in 2022, which came shortly after a six-week stint in rehab for alcoholism, he was reassigned to the Ways and Means Committee.
The former prosecutor is the fourth legislator in two weeks to resign.
Three legislators resigned under vastly different circumstances Aug. 11.
That’s the date Smith’s office received Rep. RJ May’s resignation letter, though it was dated four days earlier. The West Columbia Republican remains in jail, where he’s been since his arrest in June on accusations of distributing videos and images of children being sexually abuse.
He has pleaded not guilty. He appeared in federal court Wednesday for a hearing to set dates on his upcoming trial.
Sen. Roger Nutt, a Spartanburg County Republican, resigned following an Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis, he wrote in his letter. Rep. Bobby Cox, a Greer Republican, then announced he will run for Nutt’s seat. He resigned from the House the same day, he said, to spare the cost of multiple special elections.

But in other states, such efforts have stalled or failed. That may lead to more lawsuits in the future, experts say, even as judges may raise the bar for such cases.
An emphasis on being “tough on crime” and prioritizing other public safety measures may have contributed to less attention on prison conditions in some states. In others, slowing revenue growth and pressure to rein in corrections spending could be making new investments a harder sell.
At least two states this year, Virginia and Texas, considered legislation addressing excessive heat in prisons but neither measure became law. The Texas bill would have required the state Department of Criminal Justice to purchase and install climate control systems in all of its facilities by the end of 2032. About two-thirds of the state’s correctional facilities have only partial or no air conditioning.
The measure passed the House but did not advance in the Senate before the legislature adjourned in June.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In Virginia, lawmakers approved a bill that would have required the state corrections department to install heat and air conditioning in its prisons and to ensure cell temperatures not exceed 80 degrees. Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed it, citing the cost of installation and operational burdens. Youngkin also wrote that existing state corrections data “does not substantiate the claims of extreme temperatures or health risks.”
But in Delaware, the fiscal year 2026 capital budget approved last month includes $2 million in funding to install air conditioning at the James T. Vaughn Correctional Center.
These changes mark the latest actions in a long-running debate over how correctional systems respond to rising summer temperatures — an issue that affects both incarcerated people and staff. Some of the policy debates and facility updates this year follow years of advocacy and litigation over the health, safety and operational challenges posed by heat in correctional settings.
Stifling prison heat used to be just a Southern problem. Not anymore.

The problem of excessive heat in prisons has persisted for decades and has unfolded alongside other challenges, including chronic understaffing and overcrowding. In some cases, these problems have led to extended facility lockdowns, even during the summer months.
“There are people working in prisons and they have the right to work in climates that are comfortable,” said Nancy La Vigne, a criminal justice researcher and dean of the School of Criminal Justice at Rutgers University. “When they’re not, there’s retention issues, and it’s hard to replace staff. And when you don’t replace staff, then you have challenges in maintaining the safety and security of the facility.”
In New York, for example, correctional officers staged a three-week strike earlier this year and many didn’t return to work. Some facilities now are operating with 30%-60% fewer guards than needed, resulting in some incarcerated people getting only an hour or two outside of their cells each day.
A 2023 study published in the peer-reviewed PLOS One journal found that mortality in state and private prisons rose during periods of extreme heat, with deaths increasing 3.5% on extreme heat days and up to 7.4% during three-day heat waves. Between 2001 and 2019, nearly 13,000 people died in prison during the summer months, almost half of them in the South, though the study did not determine how many of those deaths were directly attributable to heat.
Climate change is fueling longer, more intense periods of extreme heat. Exposure to extreme heat can worsen conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and asthma, and has also been linked to worsening mental health and higher suicide rates among incarcerated people.
“Average temperatures are rising, and you’re going to have more and more states around the country where incarcerated people are held in conditions that are not livable because they’re too hot,” said Sharon Dolovich, a law professor and director of the Prison Law and Policy Program at the University of California, Los Angeles.










At times, it’s a living hell. … It can be very excruciating.

Some upgrades
At least 44 states lack universal air conditioning within their prison facilities, even in regions known for sweltering summer temperatures, according to a 2022 USA Today analysis. A recent Reuters investigation also found that nearly half of state prisons across 29 states have partial or no air conditioning in housing units.
But some states are investing millions to update their prison facilities.
In North Carolina, corrections officials are working toward their goal of installing air conditioning in all 54 state prisons by 2026. To date, 33 facilities are fully air-conditioned, 17 are partially air-conditioned, and four have no air conditioning, according to its dashboard.
In California, the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, which operates 31 adult prisons, has spent $246 million in the past five years on cooling improvements at five prisons, according to a department spokesperson.
Lawmakers this year also approved funding for the Air Cooling Pilot Program at three facilities, with $17.6 million allocated for fiscal years 2025-26 and $20 million for fiscal years 2026-27. It will evaluate the effectiveness of two alternatives prior to a statewide plan to address high indoor temperatures across the California prison system.
State prisons turn to extended lockdowns amid staffing shortages, overcrowding

The Texas Department of Criminal Justice, as of Aug. 1, is building 12,827 “cool beds,” or prison cells in air-conditioned units, and is in the process of procuring an additional 7,162, according to its dashboard.
Texas is one of the states most closely associated with heat-related deaths in prison. A 2022 study estimated that, on average, 14 deaths per year in Texas prisons are associated with heat. And a Texas Tribune analysis found that at least 41 incarcerated people died during a record-breaking heat wave in 2023.
In March, a federal judge ruled the extreme heat in Texas prisons is “plainly unconstitutional,” but declined to order immediate air conditioning, saying the work could not be completed within the court order’s 90-day window and temporary systems might delay a permanent fix.
‘More miserable’
Sweltering summer heat can turn prisons into pressure cookers. People inside already may have health conditions, limited access to cooling, or take medications that make it harder for their bodies to handle the heat. And research suggests that high temperatures can heighten irritability and aggression, sometimes fueling more conflicts between incarcerated people or with staff.
“It makes you more miserable. … If you to the point of even thinking about suicide, that’s just going to add to it,” said Ronald McKeithen, who spent 37 years incarcerated in Alabama prisons and is now the director of second chances at the Alabama Appleseed Center for Law and Justice. McKeithen recalls feeling “on edge” due to tension among other incarcerated people on hot days.
At the Oshkosh Correctional Institution in Wisconsin, Devin Skrzypchak said the heat worsens his bladder condition, and he often can’t get the incontinence briefs he needs. The heat forces him to drink more water, and on days when ice isn’t available, he’s left drenched in sweat.
“At times, it’s a living hell. … It can be very excruciating,” Skrzypchak wrote in a message to Stateline through the facility’s messaging platform.

D’Angelo Lee Komanekin — who has spent about 25 years in and out of different Wisconsin corrections facilities — said prison architecture plays a major role in why temperatures inside climb so high.
“The planet is getting hotter and hotter,” said Komanekin, who relies on a small plastic fan to stay cool. Komanekin also is incarcerated at the Oshkosh Correctional Institution. “They’re doing nothing about the architecture. Some institutions’ windows open, some don’t, but most of the doors have steel doors with trap doors.”
Older prison designs that rely heavily on steel and concrete building materials often trap heat, making it difficult to keep temperatures down in the summer. Aging facilities also are less likely to be equipped for the installation of central air conditioning.
Some state prison systems, including Alabama’s and Wisconsin’s, are adding air-conditioning or air-tempering systems to new prison construction and major renovation projects.
Future legal battles
Legal experts say the issue of excessive heat in prisons is likely to become more pressing as climate change drives longer and hotter summers.
Extreme heat in correctional facilities has already been the subject of litigation in dozens of states, with plaintiffs arguing that high temperatures constitute cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. Court rulings in these cases have varied, but some experts say even more lawsuits are likely if facilities do not adapt.
“The conditions are going to worsen. [Incarcerated people are] going to be looking for every possible avenue for assistance they can,” Dolovich, the UCLA law professor, told Stateline.
Prison abuse, deaths and escapes prompt calls for more oversight

One of the latest cases comes from Missouri, where the nonprofit law firm MacArthur Justice Center filed a class-action lawsuit in May on behalf of six incarcerated people at Algoa Correctional Center.
The lawsuit alleges that the conditions violate their constitutional rights under the Eighth Amendment. It seeks to require the Missouri Department of Corrections to work with experts to develop a heat mitigation plan that keeps housing unit temperatures between 65 and 85 degrees. If the department cannot meet that standard, the plaintiffs are asking for the release of three of the incarcerated people who have less than a year remaining on their sentences.
Lawsuits such as the Missouri case often focus on claims that extreme heat worsens existing medical problems. To proceed, they must meet two legal requirements: proving the heat poses a serious health or safety risk, and showing prison officials knew about the danger but failed to address it, according to Dolovich, whose work has focused on the Eighth Amendment and prison conditions.
Courts may also raise the bar for proving such claims if judges echo decisions in cases with similar Eight Amendment arguments related to the death penalty and homelessness, Dolovich said. Judges have shifted, she said, toward a “superadding terror, pain and disgrace” standard under the Eighth Amendment — a higher threshold requiring proof that conditions were created with the intent to cause unnecessary suffering.
Dolovich added that some recent court decisions have provided only narrow remedies, such as ordering ice and fans instead of installing air conditioning.
“Prison officials have a moral and a constitutional responsibility to respond to changing conditions. In this case, it means air conditioning. … Anything less than that, to me, is indefensible.” she said.

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)If you’ve ever attempted to observe your own thoughts, even for a moment, maybe you noticed how easily the mind can move between grace and grievance. Natural restlessness is the universal engine of that movement, and the way restive energy is released determines its short- and long-term social value. 
When aligned with grace, restlessness not only emerges as kindness but can also help drive human advancement — in science, medicine, equality, and all manner of exploration, for example. But aligned with grievance, that innate quality of general unease typically manifests as a dark contagion — of selfishness and isolation, cruelty and oppression. Sometimes worse.
The great lesson of politics is that one end of the spectrum is an easier place to harvest votes, and unfortunately for all of humanity it’s not the field of grace.
Here’s how that plays out in modern American politics: The core, unchanging position of the Republican Party — unwavering fealty to large corporations and top earners — is not on its own a winning strategy. That shouldn’t be surprising, unless you are one of those people still standing with palms to heaven awaiting Ronald Reagan’s promised trickle. But there’s data, too: A Pew Research Center poll from the spring, for example, found that 63% of Americans (including 43% of Republicans) believe taxes should be raised, not lowered, for large businesses and people who earn more than $400,000 a year. 
Most voters are wise to the fact that the corporate tax breaks never make it to the workers, despite conservatives’ promises. The Congressional Research Service, in the aftermath of President Donald Trump’s original 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that reduced the tax on corporate profits from 35% to 21%, found that by the end of 2018 $1 trillion of corporations’ increased funds due to the cut had gone to record-breaking stock buybacks, further financially distancing executives from the workforces they lead. Meanwhile, about 2% of the corporate rate cut made its way down to the workers — about $28 per American employee.
Do you remember what you spent your windfall on?
Eight years later, Trump promised more of the same if elected, this time through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, and a plurality of American voters obliged. New Hampshire Republicans have consistently drifted to State House victory riding the same dubious current, swearing that the best way to reduce the burden on regular Granite Staters is to leave as much money as possible with corporations and the wealthy. The highest price — in reduced services, new fees, and more restrictive eligibility for support programs — is always paid by those with the least. 
The question in all of this is why. Why, if more than 6 in 10 Americans favor tax increases for large corporations and the wealthy, do they keep electing candidates who above all support the policies driving extreme wealth inequality?
The answer is grievance. Cultivated grievance.
Restlessness realized as grace pushes a person toward empathy. It leads to questions like: In a nation as rich as our own, why are 43% of all families unable to meet their basic needs, and why is that percentage even higher among Black (59%) and Hispanic (66%) families? And why, in New Hampshire’s Coös County, in the northern part of one of the richest states in one of the richest nations, are nearly 12% of children living in extreme poverty?
But restlessness realized as grievance pushes them toward the boundless nowhere of retributive politics. What is left of 21st-century American Republicanism when you subtract political, social, cultural, and (un)scientific grievances? One thing, mainly: A sales pitch, discredited by countless studies and decades of math, that everyone benefits when those with the most are given even more.
In one breath the conservative candidate proclaims love for New Hampshire, for America, for all people. In the next, and with each breath after, they identify all who are unworthy of that love and then draft policies, bills, and orders to codify those exclusions. Grievance is how power is won and held by the right, even as its representatives reliably pass one deeply unpopular economic policy after another. 
It’s a strategy not without risk. If the history of human civilization, and vast inequality, has taught us anything, it’s this: Nothing churns societal restlessness so violently as the flight from grace.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/domestatuefoot-1024x686.jpg,,,2025-08-20 11:58:40.105005

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota’s medical cannabis industry voiced its support for sting operations targeting sellers of hemp products that create a marijuana-like high.
The comments from Jeremiah Murphy, a lobbyist for the Cannabis Industry Association of South Dakota, came during Tuesday’s meeting of the state’s Medical Marijuana Oversight Committee.
Murphy’s association represents the state’s 116 licensed medical cannabis cultivators, manufacturers and dispensaries.
The industry “commends the Pennington County Sheriff’s Office” for its sting operation targeting hemp-based THC products at eight Rapid City-area smoke shops and convenience stores, Murphy said.
Rapid City policing agencies target ‘diet weed’ with compliance checks

Law enforcement bought samples of gummies, THC drinks and other products with “hemp-derived” ingredients. Strains of THC is a family of high-inducing molecules found in large concentrations in the cannabis plant.
The hemp plant is a cousin to cannabis that contains tiny quantities of THC. Hemp-derived intoxicants often get their THC from chemically modified or distilled CBD. CBD is a different, nonintoxicating molecule found in cannabis and hemp.
Hemp is legal to cultivate under the 2018 farm bill, and hemp-derived products are legal under federal law. Since mid-2024, however, South Dakota has barred the sale – but not the possession – of products made with chemically synthesized versions of THC.
The Rapid City compliance check followed a July 10 letter from Pennington County State’s Attorney Lara Roetzel to businesses suspected of unlawful hemp sales.
Katy Urban, spokeswoman for Roetzel’s office, says the agencies are waiting for testing results to determine if any laws were broken. 
Sioux Falls Police Department spokesman Aaron Benson said the SFPD has performed one compliance check, and is waiting on results from a lab test to determine how to proceed with one case. Benson declined to say how many businesses were visited, citing the open investigation.
Committee hears support for compliance
At Tuesday’s medical marijuana committee meeting, Murphy repeated an assertion he’s used for nearly two years now:  The availability of hemp-derived alternatives to medical cannabis puts the state’s highly regulated medical marijuana industry at a disadvantage. 
“Why do I go to a doctor and pay him, and why go pay the state to pay even more money, when I can go to the vape shop, or I can go to the hemp store and they’re selling exactly what I need?” Murphy said.
The number of medical marijuana cards issued in the state stands at around 14,000, but changes slightly every day, Whitney Brunner of the Department of Health told the medical marijuana committee Tuesday. 
“Any data point presented on patient cards is representative of a snapshot in time,” Brunner said.
Cards issuance has picked up slightly since voters rejected a ballot measure to legalize recreational cannabis last fall, but remained at about 14,000 as of this week. A little more than 70% of the cards have been issued to people for the management of chronic pain, Brunner told the committee. 
Medical cannabis purveyors supported the law banning the sale of synthetically altered hemp products, but the law hasn’t led to a crush of cases against sellers. Around 100 charges had been filed as of last month, between juvenile and adult cases, according to the Unified Judicial System. Several of those charges were attached to individual defendants.
Hemp industry sees future beyond consumables
New processing centers raise hopes for South Dakota hemp, tempered by challenges

John Peterson, president of the South Dakota Industrial Hemp Association, said his organization doesn’t have a problem with the rules on consumables.
“They passed the rules, and we want to have only the good players in the game,” said Peterson, whose Dakota Hemp is one of two companies in South Dakota building hemp processing facilities.
South Dakota leads the nation in hemp production. Legally, hemp plants need to be tested and have less than .3% THC. In a typical pre-rolled, smokable cannabis joint, Peterson said, “you’re looking at a 30% THC level.”
“You’re going to want your money back if it’s not that high,” he said.
Peterson said consumable products, with or without intoxicating properties, were among the first to catch on. CBD products, including products like lotions, are often marketed to humans and their pets for their purported health benefits. 
Hemp-derived THC products, made “when somebody will take it and process it down to make an unnatural compound,” took off just a few years ago. 
“That has been the industry that has financially led the way, but as the industry is taking off, we see the grain, fiber and textile areas as leading products into the future,” Peterson said.
Speaking from a booth at Dakotafest in Mitchell, Peterson listed off a dozen products from a hemp association brochure, including building materials like hempcrete and decking material.
As far as consumables, Peterson said, “we’re not going to scream and holler and say, ‘you’ve got to let us have those back.” 
He said he hopes the consumable concerns don’t hamstring the rest of the industry.
“As long as they’re not going out of their way to discriminate against the hemp industry, I’ve got no issues with it.”

Kristin Robbins, who has announced a campaign for governor, on the House Floor Feb. 24, 2025. (Photo by Michele Jokinen/House Information Services)State Rep. Kristin Robbins, R-Maple Grove, a traditional suburban Republican who has raised her profile in recent months by publicizing fraud in public programs, announced Wednesday she’s running for governor.
“Over the last 8 years, (Gov.) Tim Walz has hurt families, businesses, and Minnesotan’s most vulnerable citizens. Under his mismanagement and leadership failures, our state has been heading in the wrong direction,” Robbins said in a statement.
Walz is expected to announce in the coming weeks whether he’ll seek a third term. Also in the race: 2022 GOP gubernatorial nominee and former state Sen. Scott Jensen, and former GOP congressional and gubernatorial candidate Kendall Qualls.
Robbins was first elected to the House in 2018, representing west metro cities like Maple Plain, Maple Grove and Medina. She is chair of the Fraud Prevention and State Agency Oversight Committee, where she’s used the gavel to highlight a wave of fraud that’s beset public programs in recent years, including a pandemic-era food aid program and Medicaid.
A campaign video shows her talking about the good life in the western suburbs, “cheering on soccer, softball and choir, and teaching Sunday school,” before pivoting to the state’s taxes, fraud in safety net programs, sanctuary laws protecting undocumented immigrants, and transgender girls in sports.
Earlier this year, Heartland Signal noted Robbins scrubbed her social media of her support for 2024 presidential candidate Nikki Haley, for whom Robbins served as state chair.
Given the importance of the endorsement of President Donald Trump — and Trump’s long memory when it comes to his vanquished opponents like Haley — Robbins’ biggest challenge will be to persuade Trump and Republican voters that she’s sufficiently obeisant to the president and his agenda.
Republican primary voters tend to follow the party’s convention endorsement, wherein mere hundreds of hardcore activists — often the most ideologically dogmatic — decide the candidates’ fate.
But a campaign too focused on the Trumpiest GOP activists could spell trouble in a general election, where Minnesotans have thrice rejected Trump — and every statewide Republican candidate for nearly two decades.
Indeed, Alliance for a Better Minnesota, a well-funded outside group aligned with Democrats, was ready with a release about Robbins late Tuesday, tying her to Trump: “Robbins is an anti-choice extremist whose record shows she’ll side with Trump and conservatives’ harmful agenda over looking out for Minnesota families every time,” said Marissa Luna, the group’s executive director, in a statement.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/022425-PHOTO-light-rail-floor-01-MJ-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-08-20 10:56:46.104871

“The planet is getting hotter and hotter,” said Komanekin, who relies on a small plastic fan to stay cool. Komanekin also is incarcerated at the Oshkosh Correctional Institution. “They’re doing nothing about the architecture. Some institutions’ windows open, some don’t, but most of the doors have steel doors with trap doors.”
Older prison designs that rely heavily on steel and concrete building materials often trap heat, making it difficult to keep temperatures down in the summer. Aging facilities also are less likely to be equipped for the installation of central air conditioning.
Some state prison systems, including Alabama’s and Wisconsin’s, are adding air-conditioning or air-tempering systems to new prison construction and major renovation projects.
Future legal battles
Legal experts say the issue of excessive heat in prisons is likely to become more pressing as climate change drives longer and hotter summers.
Extreme heat in correctional facilities has already been the subject of litigation in dozens of states, with plaintiffs arguing that high temperatures constitute cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. Court rulings in these cases have varied, but some experts say even more lawsuits are likely if facilities do not adapt.
“The conditions are going to worsen. [Incarcerated people are] going to be looking for every possible avenue for assistance they can,” Dolovich, the UCLA law professor, told Stateline.
One of the latest cases comes from Missouri, where the nonprofit law firm MacArthur Justice Center filed a class-action lawsuit in May on behalf of six incarcerated people at Algoa Correctional Center.
The lawsuit alleges that the conditions violate their constitutional rights under the Eighth Amendment. It seeks to require the Missouri Department of Corrections to work with experts to develop a heat mitigation plan that keeps housing unit temperatures between 65 and 85 degrees. If the department cannot meet that standard, the plaintiffs are asking for the release of three of the incarcerated people who have less than a year remaining on their sentences.
Lawsuits such as the Missouri case often focus on claims that extreme heat worsens existing medical problems. To proceed, they must meet two legal requirements: proving the heat poses a serious health or safety risk, and showing prison officials knew about the danger but failed to address it, according to Dolovich, whose work has focused on the Eighth Amendment and prison conditions.
Courts may also raise the bar for proving such claims if judges echo decisions in cases with similar Eight Amendment arguments related to the death penalty and homelessness, Dolovich said. Judges have shifted, she said, toward a “superadding terror, pain and disgrace” standard under the Eighth Amendment — a higher threshold requiring proof that conditions were created with the intent to cause unnecessary suffering.
Dolovich added that some recent court decisions have provided only narrow remedies, such as ordering ice and fans instead of installing air conditioning.
“Prison officials have a moral and a constitutional responsibility to respond to changing conditions. In this case, it means air conditioning. … Anything less than that, to me, is indefensible.” she said.

,California,2025-08-20 14:34:09+00:00,CalMatters,Why many California Democrats are feeling angst over Newsom’s redistricting,Jeanne Kuang,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/08/democrat-redistricting-moral-dilemma/,California voters backed independent redistricting for congressional seats and giving it up to counter President Trump creates a moral conflict even for Democrats.,"In summary
California voters backed independent redistricting for congressional seats and giving it up to counter President Trump creates a moral conflict even for Democrats.


As Republicans lambasted California lawmakers for rushing through their effort to gerrymander the state’s congressional map, Democrats are facing a quieter angst in their own party.
To counter what they call President Donald Trump’s undemocratic power grab for Republican seats in Texas, they’re asking voters to temporarily ditch California’s nonpartisan map-drawing process — touted as a national gold standard for fair elections and good governance — in favor of a politico-drawn map to tilt seats in Democrats’ favor.
At the polls, they’ll have to overcome not just Republican opponents but also some Democrats and independent voters who say California shouldn’t respond to partisan gerrymandering in Texas with the same frowned-upon tactics at home. 
“This is the kind of moral conflict that, if this goes to the ballot, that every California voter is going to be faced with,” said Sara Sadhawani, a political science professor, Democrat and former member of the state’s independent redistricting commission, at a hearing over the measures Tuesday.
Sadhawani helped draw the state’s existing congressional map when she sat on the commission alongside fellow Democrats, Republicans and independents after the 2020 Census. Now she’s one of Gov. Gavin Newsom’s partisan redistricting effort’s most vocal supporters. 
Testifying in favor of the plan on Tuesday, she said lawmakers must respond to the “extreme attacks on our core democratic principles” in Texas and other red states that are considering redrawing their own maps.
“It brings me no joy to see the maps that we passed fairly by the Commission to be tossed aside,” she said. “I do believe this is a necessary step in a much bigger battle to shore up free and fair elections in our nation.”
But even as state- and congressional-level Democrats embrace the plan as their answer to voters clamoring for the party to put up a resistance to Trump, there are misgivings among Democrats statewide.
On the other side of the issue in the hearing rooms weren’t the Republicans who have vowed to fight Newsom through lawsuits and at the ballot box. Instead, opponents presented members of prior nonpartisan redistricting commissions: Jeanne Raya and Cynthia Dai, who are Democrats, and Connie Archbold Robinson, an independent, to testify against the measures. 
“Our citizens in other parts of the country, who are being held hostage by politicians who do not represent their interests, have been looking to California as the alternative, as the model,” Robinson said. “If we gut the great work that we have been doing there, then not only do we lose our credibility, those efforts actually get stalled and get reversed.”
Voters backed independent redistricting
Voters added the nonpartisan process for redrawing California’s political maps to the state constitution by a slim margin in 2008. In 2010 they approved using that same independent system to draw new congressional maps just as Republicans nationally campaigned to flip state legislatures for the purpose of drawing more GOP House seats in states like Wisconsin, North Carolina and Michigan.
Three other states use a similar process as California to draw congressional maps, but just over half of all states give that power directly to their legislatures, meaning the party in power can tilt seats to their advantage.
The current California congressional map gave Democrats a slight advantage. But while Trump and Vice President J.D. Vance have called the map unfair to the GOP,  Republicans in California have been, for the most part, satisfied with it. It maintained competitive districts that the GOP has been able to win or put up significant fights for — districts that will be eliminated under the partisan map voters will likely weigh in on this fall. 
Statewide, Democratic voters outnumber Republicans nearly 2-to-1. Recent polling shows voters favor independent redistricting by about the same margin. 
California vs. Texas
To sell the redistricting measure to the public, Democrats have leaned heavily on framing it as a fight against Trump — and, ironically, in favor of fairer elections nationwide. In the state Senate elections committee, Democrats grilled the former map-drawers on whether it would ever be acceptable for them to draw new districts for political reasons and whether California ought to retaliate to discourage Texas’ efforts. 
“Texas is actively reducing their own competitive seat count,” Sen. Sabrina Cervantes, a Riverside Democrat, said. “So then do you expect our communities to remain silent while their voices are being stripped away from Washington?”
Raya stressed she, too, opposed both the Trump administration and the Republican gerrymandering effort in Texas, which she called “reprehensible.”
“We’re living with … the despair that people have about the current political climate,” she said. “For me, this is not about declaring an emergency, and now, what do we do? This is, every day, we need to be doing something to make the system work and today what we need to do is protect the independent, nonpartisanship of drawing lines.”
But her fellow party members in the Senate said it’s not the time to go high.
“I will speak for myself, the conditions have been met for us to take action,” incoming Senate President Pro Tem Monique Limón, a Santa Barbara Democrat, said to the former commissioners. “I have utmost respect and recognition for the work that all of you do to protect our democracy.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/081925_Redistricting-Hearing_FG_CM_04.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-20 10:56:46.104871

Will Carpenter, R-El Dorado, says he doubts the state can ever build the nursing staff needed to operate state psychiatric hospitals in Larned and Osawatomie. (Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The state of Kansas invests more than $60 million annually to hire contract nursing staff to work at state psychiatric hospitals in Larned and Osawatomie, but the financial boost hasn’t closed job vacancy gaps exceeding 33% at both facilities.
On Tuesday, Kansas legislators on a special committee exploring contract nursing shared disappointment with results of years of stopgap appropriations to hire temporary nurses provided by private companies. The state also has devoted resources to raising salaries and providing bonuses to encourage state-employed nurses to remain at the hospitals.
Lawmakers expressed skepticism Kansas would ever have enough people to fill vacancies at state hospitals serving involuntarily committed or criminally charged individuals with mental health issues, as well as sexually violent offenders detained at Larned after serving prison sentences.
“In my experience, we’re not going to build this staff to take care of the number of people that are out there right now,” said Rep. Will Carpenter, an El Dorado Republican who chairs the Legislature’s interim health committee. “Prove me wrong, because I want to be wrong.”
Carpenter suggested consideration be given to transferring about 100 patients from Larned to other locations so staffing levels could be sustained without contract nurses. In 2027, Kansas is scheduled to open a new 104-bed state psychiatric hospital in Sedgwick County.
Expenditures at Larned State Hospital for nursing contract labor increased from $5.9 million in 2019 to $8.6 million in 2021, $43.1 million in 2023 and $46 million in 2025. At Osawatomie State Hospital, contract costs surged from $233,000 in 2019 to $3.2 million in 2021, $16 million in 2023 and $15.4 million in 2025. The job vacancy rate at Osawatomie stood at 35.5%, while the rate at Larned was 33.5%.
“I’ve been incredibly disappointed on how that’s worked,” Carpenter said.
 Contract labor not answer

Scott Brunner, deputy secretary of the Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services, said the agency used state tax dollars to bring in dozens of registered nurses and licensed practice nurses to care for patients who generally had complex medical needs. Some require one-on-one care.
“To keep our bed count open at the levels that they are,” he said, “we have to have enough staff to make sure patients are safe.”
He said the starting salary for a registered nurse at the state hospitals was about $40 per hour. The state paid companies providing contract registered nurses $90 to $100 per hour to take on the same responsibilities, with the nurse receiving approximately two-thirds of the total.
“We certainly don’t think contract labor is a solution,” Brunner said. “It’s a way of addressing the need to keep beds open and keep patients moving through the system.”
He recommended the Legislature pass House Bill 2237, which is hung up in the Senate, to place in state law the ability of state agencies to award employee bonuses in amounts up to $10,000 per year. He urged lawmakers to keep funding cost-of-living and market-rate adjustments to salaries so state hospitals could compete with the private sector for labor. The existing budget for contract nurses needs to be sustained, he said.
In addition, Brunner suggested the state expand college scholarships for nurses, consider providing nursing students with financial support in exchange for post-graduation employment agreements and provide training opportunities for experienced nurses to advance their careers.
 ‘Increase the salaries’

Ashley Byram, superintendent of the Osawatomie hospital, said only half of the facility’s RNs, LPNs and mental health technicians were state employees. Here’s the split between state employee and agency contract workers at Osawatomie: RNs, 16 state and 16 private; LPNs, three state and 13 private; and mental health techs, 39 state and 33 private.
She said Osawatomie contract nurses were asked what it would take for them to accept state employment. The nurses weren’t interested in signing bonuses or housing allowances, she said, but were keen to earn salaries of at least $50 per hour. The average RN at Osawatomie has been paid $44 per hour, or $59 per hour when benefits were included.
“I would increase the salaries,” Byram said. “It’s the current wage gap between agency and state positions that is our primary obstacle.”
If the Legislature prohibited payment of contract nurses to staff the Osawatomie hospital, she said, the facility had enough nurses to make use of 43 beds. She said 116 beds at Osawatomie would be closed if contract nurses were removed and replacements weren’t hired.
Lindsey Topps, superintendent at Larned, said the hospital averaged 400 patients with more than half the total in a sexual predator treatment program.
“We have, I say, no fat on campus,” Topps said. “We’ve maximized the amount of residents or patients to the RNs and LPNs in order to provide safe and good patient care as well as follow the regulations.”
Here is the breakdown between state employees and contract laborers at Larned: Registered nurses, 17 state and 38 private; LPNs, nine state and 27 private; mental health workers or CNAs, 194 state and 179 private.
Topps said debate by the Legislature about reducing contract nursing labor should take into consideration the aggressive, disruptive, suicidal and homicidal conduct of people at Larned. She said most community-based health facilities didn’t have the staff or facilities to deal with individuals who ended up at the state hospital.
“We have some of the most severe mentally ill individuals in the state of Kansas,” Topps said.
 ‘It’s not translating’

During the 2025 legislative session, the House and Senate didn’t approve financing for new spending on contract nursing at the two state hospitals.
“Sometimes we set aside money because that feels good and we think that’s going to to do something,” said Sen. Beverly Gossage, a Republican from Eudora.
Sen. Renee Erickson, R-Wichita, said the state had a handful of initiatives designed to develop a Kansas pipeline of nurses who could fill jobs at state hospitals. She said the state spent millions of dollars so 2,700 high school students could take courses required to become a certified nursing assistant. She said only one-third of those students became CNAs.
“We’re paying to fill that pipeline, but it’s not translating,” she said. “It doesn’t appear like (it’s) actually reducing the demand and getting to the root of the problem. It doesn’t seem to be making the impact it should or we would hope it should.”

A recent National Association of Realtors report found affordability increased slightly from last year, but the typical family is still priced out in the West and Northeast. (Photo by Madison McVan/Minnesota Reformer)Housing became more affordable this June, as higher incomes and slightly lower interest rates overcame higher prices, according to a National Association of Realtors report.
However, the South and the Midwest are the only regions where a family with typical or median income can afford a median-priced house, according to the report. The group considers a mortgage to be affordable if the monthly payment (principal and interest) is 25% or less of the family’s income.

The affordability gap is highest in the West, where the typical family income is $113,783, just over two-thirds of the $164,832 that would be needed to purchase a median-priced home.
The Northeast, where the typical family makes $114,559, is also unaffordable by this measure, as a median-priced home requires an income of $141,264.
In the Midwest, the median family income is $102,419, more than the $86,256 needed to buy a median-priced home. The same is true in the South, where the median income is $97,812, slightly more than the $96,720 required to buy a typical home.
Nationally, affordability increased slightly compared with June of 2024, with the typical family making $105,431, about 94% of the $111,648 it would need to buy the median-priced home. That’s up from about 92% in June 2024.
In a video posted Aug. 15, Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors, said he expects lower interest rates to increase affordability in the months ahead.
“We know that mortgage rates will be coming down and that will bring additional buyers into the market. We just need to make sure we have more supply, more supply to meet that demand,” Yun said.

(Photo by EJ Rodriquez/Getty Images)A Texas House Democrat was confined in the Capitol overnight after she refused a police escort that Republican leaders imposed on lawmakers who participated in a two-week walkout over a GOP mid-decade redistricting plan.
Rep. Nicole Collier, D-Fort Worth, declined on Monday afternoon to sign a slip giving her permission from Speaker Dustin Burrows, R-Lubbock, to leave the House floor with a state law enforcement officer shadowing her.
“I refuse to sign away my dignity as a duly elected representative just so Republicans can control my movements and monitor me with police escorts,” Collier said in a statement Monday. “When I press that button to vote, I know these maps will harm my constituents — I won’t just go along quietly with their intimidation or their discrimination.”
At least four more Democratic lawmakers — Reps. Rhetta Bowers, Cassandra Garcia Hernandez, Penny Morales Shaw and Mihaela Plesa — joined the protest Tuesday, tearing up their permission slips in front of a crowd of supporters chanting, “Don’t mess with Texas women,” and, “Let them out,” as the lawmakers prepared to spend the night on the House floor with Collier. Rep. Senfronia Thompson of Houston joined the demonstration but did not appear to rip up her permission slip.
“Why would we be considered a flight risk if we walked in of our own volition?” Bowers said. “This is a blatant violation of our freedoms as Texans, as Americans and as duly elected officials.”
At around 6:30 p.m. Tueday while Collier and others were on the House floor, the Texas Department of Public Safety evacuated the public from the Capitol after an unidentified individual posted a threat on social media, according to a DPS spokesperson. DPS said the message called on people to go to the Capitol and shoot “those who will not allow lawmakers to leave.”
The Capitol was closed to the public for the rest of the evening, according to DPS. Authorities have not yet identified the individual who posted the threat.
Collier and Rep. Gene Wu of Houston, chair of the House Democratic Caucus, later issued a statement on the situation and thanked DPS troopers for their “swift and professional response to today’s security threat.”
“Violence and threats have no place in our democratic process, and we unequivocally condemn any threats against public servants or law enforcement, regardless of political differences,” the statement read.
Just over two dozen Democratic lawmakers, including Collier, on Monday ended their walkout over a congressional redistricting plan — demanded by President Donald Trump just four years after Republicans last redrew Texas’ map — that is designed to pad the GOP’s slim U.S. House majority in next year’s midterm election.
After the lawmakers returned to the Texas House, Burrows announced they would each be subject to an around-the-clock police escort to ensure their attendance when the chamber reconvenes on Wednesday morning to vote out the map. He added that Democratic lawmakers would be responsible for any state costs incurred in ensuring their attendance.
Most Democrats signed the permission slip required to leave the Capitol with a police officer in tow, even while objecting to the mandatory surveillance and emphasizing that they would not have returned to Austin on Monday if they planned to skip the vote on Wednesday.
Collier filed a lawsuit Monday challenging the chamber’s authority to put members under police surveillance.
“They exercised control, and they tell us we can’t leave unless we do exactly what they say,” she said in a video Monday. “We’ve had enough. We’ve had enough of them taking all of our rights away, and so I’ve taken a stand. I’m pushing back.”
Collier slept at her desk on the House floor Monday night and remained there Tuesday, over 24 hours and counting after first arriving, though she said she’d received permission to go to her office in the Capitol. Wu and Rep. Vince Perez, D-El Paso, stayed with her overnight, with other Democratic lawmakers and staffers coming by to provide moral support, food, clothes, pillows and other necessities.
All of it was captured on a livestream the House Democratic Caucus set up on the House floor, with up to 50,000 viewers tuning in at one point. On Tuesday, Plesa said that former Vice President Kamala Harris was among those who called Collier to express support for her protest.
“Rep. Collier’s choice to stay and not sign the permission slip is well within her rights under the House Rules,” Burrows said in a statement. “I am choosing to spend my time focused on moving the important legislation on the [governor’s special session] call to overhaul camp safety, provide property tax reform and eliminate the STAAR test — the results Texans care about.”
A handful of supporters outside the House chamber were arrested Monday night for “trespassing when the Capitol is closed.” They each received a criminal trespass warning barring them from returning to the building for a year, according to a video of the incident.
The order requiring Democratic lawmakers to keep a police escort is set to expire when the House grants final passage to the congressional map, House Bill 4, later this week.

Service providers say an executive order by President Donald Trump could jeopardize their efforts to help those who are experiencing homelessness. (Lily O'Shea Becker/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Christine English-Baird spends at least one day a week distributing basic supplies to homeless people in Wichita, home to one of Kansas’ largest homeless populations.
“I do that because I can’t even fathom anybody else going through what I did,” English-Baird said. “Feeling invisible. Feeling alone.”
But English-Baird, who was homeless in Colorado and housing insecure in Kansas, says the services that once helped her could be jeopardized by President Donald Trump’s July 24 executive order, which encourages involuntary institutionalization for people in mental health crises and increased criminal pressure on people experiencing homelessness across the United States.
The order makes hefty promises of “fighting vagrancy,” “ending support for ‘housing first’ policies” and “encouraging civil commitment.” Trump followed the July order with another that deployed National Guard troops to police District of Columbia streets, targeting “drugged-out maniacs and homeless people,” he said in an Aug. 11 news conference.
The Trump administration’s approach to homelessness has sparked concern among social service providers, experts and advocates, who say the July order is unspooling decades of progress.
They are skeptical that the order’s provisions will be within reach, especially as cuts to Medicaid and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development are imminent. Plus, institutionalization and criminalization are some of the most expensive and ineffective ways to address homelessness, said Steve Berg, chief policy officer with the National Alliance to End Homelessness.
The threat of being taken into custody “sets people against each other,” Berg said.
“I know one thing really is true about places that have made progress on homelessness is that people are working together,” he said. “And if people are at each other’s throats over things like this, then there’s going to be more homelessness.”
Kansas Senate President Ty Masterson, an Andover Republican who is seeking his party’s nomination for governor, said Trump followed through “on his promise to restore law and order in our Kansas communities.”
“State legislation should focus on mental health and addiction treatment, reducing encampments, and keeping Kansans safe,” he said in a statement. “I’m committed to working with the White House in any way I can to deliver on the President’s agenda.”

Moving backward
English-Baird’s life was a series of revolving doors, beginning with fleeing a violent partner in Denver. She slept in a domestic violence shelter, a transitional shelter, an apartment paid for by her ex, then a rental, a bus stop, sometimes a jail cell and then the streets for three-and-a-half years. At times, she nearly died, she said.
She lost a lot along the way: apartments, her son, sometimes hope.
But English-Baird connected with a friend in Kansas who put her up so she could recover from substance use, build savings and regain hope.
With a lifetime restraining order against her ex and a new life with her husband and son, she now works to influence policies and practices for how homeless people are treated in Kansas through her role on a statewide board.
“Nobody wants to see anybody homeless, regardless of what that means,” English-Baird said.
To her, it means providing people safe, affordable housing, support, a sense of belonging and purpose.
To the Trump administration, it means something else entirely.
During the first Trump administration, there wasn’t much attention on homelessness, Berg said, until the end of Trump’s term, when elected officials began promoting the idea of putting homeless people in camps.
Since then, Berg said, “there’s been a desire to lock people up, I think. There’s no polite way of saying it.”
The executive order takes a four-pronged approach with the stated goal of “protecting public safety.” It cites the most recent national data that estimates how many people were experiencing homelessness on a given night last year in the U.S. — nearly 771,500 people, 274,000 of whom were unsheltered. In Kansas, almost 2,800 people experienced homelessness, which is one of the lowest state totals in the country but is also considered by service providers to be an undercount.
The order directs the U.S. Attorney General to broaden the criteria that governments use to involuntarily commit people, which currently is based on whether someone poses an imminent risk to themself or others. It also asks federal agencies to give funding preference to governments that “enforce prohibitions on open illicit drug use, urban camping and loitering, and urban squatting, and track the location of sex offenders.”
It directs funding to be allocated to “ensure individuals camping on streets and causing public disorder and that are suffering from serious mental illness or addiction are moved into treatment centers, assisted outpatient treatment, or other facilities.” It also deprioritizes Housing First programs, which get people into safe, affordable housing, often in tandem with supportive services.
Donald Whitehead Jr., executive director of the National Coalition for the Homeless, said in a July 24 statement that the executive orders take a punitive approach, which “has consistently failed to resolve homelessness” while exacerbating the challenges faced by people experiencing homelessness, substance use disorders or mental health issues.
“Everyone deserves a safe place to live,” Whitehead said. “These executive orders ignore decades of evidence-based housing and support services in practice.”

Where will people go?
The salient question, according to Randy Callstrom, the CEO of Wyandot Behavioral Health Network in Kansas City, Kansas, is where will people go?
In Kansas, he said, there is no place for people to turn.
“Even if you move people from one part of a community, they will go somewhere else,” he said.
He added: “Unless those individuals are moving into housing, they’re still going to be living in the community unhoused.”
Much depends on how the executive order is actually carried out, he said. Regardless, he said, the order significantly modifies people’s civil liberties.
And he predicts homelessness will get worse. The order moves “things back 35-40 years or longer,” Callstrom said, “and that’s concerning.”
He worries that if the order is enforced, mental health will be stigmatized and local governments, service organizations, hospitals, jails and law enforcement will be strained.
The order misses the mark when it comes to effectively serving people experiencing homelessness, Callstrom said.
“(A) longtime misperception around people who are homeless is that it is a moral failure,” he said, “that these are individuals who are less than, that we just want to push them out of line of sight and wish the problem will go away, when the reality is, you know, in many, many cases, the people who end up living unhoused have experienced many traumas in their life.”
He leads a community mental health center, which he said doesn’t have enough resources to fulfill the order’s demands. At the only public psychiatric hospital in eastern Kansas, Osawatomie State Hospital, a waitlist of 30-50 people has remained constant for the past decade, he said. A publicly available report indicated the waitlist was at 37 people in early August.
Kansas must build new facilities or convince current facilities to take on more people, Callstrom said.
Kansas has budgeted for roughly 710 beds in public psychiatric facilities, said Cara Sloan-Ramos, a spokeswoman for the Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services. More than 660 of them are occupied, according to data from the department. More than 2,500 adults and more than 1,500 children use services at private psychiatric institutions.
According to a publicly available database containing regular updates of bed availability at public and private psychiatric facilities across the region, no beds were available at state hospitals.

‘Failed programs’ earn trust
In the order, the White House argues federal and state governments “have spent tens of billions of dollars on failed programs that address homelessness but not its root causes, leaving other citizens vulnerable to public safety threats.”
Agencies at all levels of government across the United States have implemented Housing First policies. Once housed, supportive services address people’s mental health, substance use, employment, familial connections and other reintegration efforts.
The order mimics the anti-Housing First efforts of the Cicero Institute, a Texas-based conservative think tank, which has pushed states for years to ban homelessness. Kansas Republicans in 2023 entertained the group’s proposal at a legislative hearing, where a Cicero Institute fellow was the only proponent.
English-Baird said she is “a firm believer” in Housing First. She has seen it work on both sides — as someone in need of housing and as someone offering aid and crafting policy on a board for the Kansas Statewide Homeless Coalition. When implemented correctly, she said, the approach gains people’s trust.
“Without a stable environment, you can’t address mental health. You can’t address addiction,” she said.
Eliminating funding for organizations, especially rural ones, “literally takes away all the progress we’re making,” English-Baird said. Forcing people to be institutionalized, as the order encourages, “doesn’t do anything to get people housed,” she said.
Institutional beds are scarce, anyway, she added.
The order also bars grant funding from being used for harm reduction efforts, such as safe injection sites.
Harm reduction focuses on reducing the adverse outcomes of drug use, which can include distributing naloxone, sterile syringes and fentanyl test kits, along with first aid, treatment resources and educational materials on overdose prevention.
Harm reduction offers people supplies to stay alive and as disease-free as possible, said English-Baird, who experienced substance use and addiction. She now offers mutual aid to people experiencing homelessness in the Wichita area. Harm reduction is key, she said, to expanding treatment options and connecting people to needed mental health services.
“But we can’t do that if they’re dead,” she said.
In Kansas, illicit drug possession and distribution carry criminal penalties, as does use or possession of drug paraphernalia. Cities across the state have passed ordinances to restrict unauthorized camping on public or private land, including Lawrence, Leavenworth, Topeka and Wichita. Some also regulate panhandling and loitering.
Berg, with the National Alliance to End Homelessness, said he also thinks the order will result in more people experiencing homelessness.
If “the states that want to do the cost-effective solutions to homelessness can’t get the money to do it because they’re not punitive enough, then that’s going to mean more homelessness,” he said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/man-and-bikee-1024x641.jpeg,,,2025-08-20 09:57:47.798993

State regulators are asking Newport residents to weigh in at a 6 p.m. meeting Wednesday night at Innovate Newport. The event kicks off an exploratory review over the abstract prospect of banning new gas hookups on the Island.
Energy regulators have spent years wrestling with this hypothetical, prompted by Rhode Island Energy’s plan to expand an existing liquefied natural gas (LNG) storage and equipment facility on Old Mill Lane in Portsmouth. 
The $33.5 million expansion project on the Portsmouth-Middletown line aims to prevent future gas outages on Aquidneck Island, which relies on a single, six-inch gas pipe to funnel the state’s main gas supply to Island customers.
Rhode Island Energy Facility Siting Board agreed to the utility company’s plan, granting a conditional license in August 2024. 
Construction to accommodate extra storage space and equipment began in April, and is expected to be completed in November. The 70,000 gallons of LNG the company plans to store at a permanent facility is projected to be enough to provide gas to the Island for 37 continuous hours, or three days of up to six hours per day when considering capacity constraints. 
But the quest for alternative solutions continues. Energy regulators made clear in their authorization for the project that the prospect of a natural gas moratorium was still on the table.
There is no set timeline for a decision, nor a guarantee that one will happen at all. Next steps will be determined after the public comment hearings, Patricia Lucarelli, administrator for the state Public Utilities Commission, which issued an advisory opinion on the LNG proposal, said in an email. The utility panel is in the midst of a separate deep dive into how the state should plan for, and spend on, natural gas expansion given its mandate to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.
Environmental groups like the Conservation Law Foundation and the Rhode Island Attorney General’s office pointed to this parallel review of the future of state dependency on natural gas as a potential contradiction to Rhode Island Energy’s LNG expansion plan. Others suggested a moratorium on new gas hookups as a better way to address the island’s gap between gas supply and demand.
Rhode Island Energy railed against any guardrails on new gas customers, warning that it would spike heating bills for area residents. Company attorneys also said state regulators lack legal authority to limit new connections.
Neighbors and municipal leaders featured prominently in the debate too, with objections focused on the noise and traffic from expanding the storage site. As the people most directly affected by a potential kibosh on new gas connections, state regulators insist their feedback is critical.
“The Board has not made any decision regarding a moratorium, nor has any party made a specific proposal, but the issue remains ripe for consideration, including weighing the benefits of a moratorium against the impact on residents and businesses who may wish to have the option to seek new gas connections in the future and the economy on the island,” the meeting notice states.
A handful of local residents submitted written comments to regulators already. Several noted the string of hotels that have opened in Newport in recent years, increasing the strain on the limited supply of natural gas. 
Benjamin Riggs, a retired Navy captain, suggested banning new hookups for hotel and large commercial projects exclusively, noting that the widening gap between supply and demand caused by these projects has already resulted in rising usage rates shouldered by residents.
Connie and Rick Bischoff, of Newport, recalled the 2019 emergency outage that left 7,000 Aquidneck Islanders without heat for a frigid week in January. But, the couple also pointed out that electric heat “costs a lot.”
“We simply need this issue to be looked at more carefully,” they wrote.
A new wrinkle highlighted by William Horan of Middletown in his written comments: the change in Washington D.C., where an anti-renewable energy administration has pulled back crucial incentives needed to help states, including Rhode Island, achieve their dependence on fossil fuels.
The public meeting in Newport will not be streamed, although comments made will be transcribed, Lucarelli said. Portsmouth residents can provide in-person feedback at a second meeting on Aug. 27 at Portsmouth Middle School.

Kennedy Jr. is targeting the government’s Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, without which manufacturers might cease producing shots. (Eric Harkleroad/KFF Health News)Dining under palm trees on a patio at Mar-a-Lago in December, President-elect Donald Trump reassured chief executives at pharmaceutical giants Eli Lilly and Pfizer that anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. wouldn’t be a radical choice to head the Department of Health and Human Services.
“I think he’s going to be much less radical than you would think,” Trump said later that month during a news conference at his Palm Beach, Florida, resort.
Eight months have passed, and Kennedy is intensifying his attacks on the vaccine system.
High on his list of targets: a federal vaccine compensation program that settles injury claims. His strategy could bankrupt or diminish the fund, some legal scholars and public health leaders say, saddling pharmaceutical companies with liability risks and costs that would compel them to stop making vaccines altogether.
“It’s a radical agenda,” said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada. “He’s using a bunch of different mechanisms and there really are no guardrails. People are going to catch on but it’s not going to be enough to stop the waves of deaths, and deaths of children.”
Kennedy has said changes to the U.S. vaccine system are needed because, he asserts without evidence, immunizations are linked to autism, neurotoxicity, allergies, and death. He is a leader of the “Make America Healthy Again” movement, an informal campaign that eschews traditional medicine and espouses “medical freedom.” Many adherents oppose vaccines and believe they are unsafe despite scientific evidence to the contrary.
Kennedy has acknowledged he wants to reform the vaccine fund, known as the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, writing July 28 on the social platform X that “the VICP is broken, and I intend to fix it.” HHS is working with the Department of Justice to revamp the program, which shields drugmakers from most liability over injuries.
HHS didn’t respond to a request to speak with Kennedy, but agency officials said he isn’t opposed to immunizations.
“Secretary Kennedy is not anti-vaccine — he is pro-safety, pro-transparency, and pro-accountability,” HHS spokesperson Vianca Rodriguez Feliciano said in an email.
Yet behind the scenes, Kennedy has been laying the groundwork to restrict the availability of widely used immunizations, according to people familiar with internal discussions who asked not to be identified because they’re not authorized to speak on the topic.
A Multipronged Strategy
The strategy began taking shape in the spring. The first step: Raise unfounded questions about the safety of vaccines. At a Cabinet meeting in April, Kennedy told Trump that HHS was undertaking a massive study that would identify the cause of rising autism diagnoses by September.
Kennedy tasked David Geier, a researcher who’s repeated the debunked claim that vaccines cause autism, to oversee the work, according to media reports.
Kennedy then doubled down by questioning the use of aluminum, which is added to many vaccines to help boost the immune response. He linked it to allergies at a July meeting of governors, even though a recent study in the Annals of Internal Medicine found no connection. He’s widely expected to ask a federal vaccine advisory committee to conduct a review.
The autism research and concerns about aluminum were early salvos in the push to go after the compensation fund, according to two of the people.
That fund provides money to people for injuries from vaccines and has paid out more than $5 billion since it was established in 1988, according to the Health Resources and Services Administration.
Before filing a lawsuit in court, injured individuals bring their claims to the program’s nonjury vaccine court, which reviews evidence. The fund provides compensation from a small excise tax on vaccines.
Compensation is determined in part by a table maintained by HRSA and overseen by the HHS secretary. It lists each vaccine and associated injuries and encompasses routine vaccinations recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that are subject to the excise tax. The injuries include anaphylaxis and encephalitis. People who experience such injuries within a certain time after getting a specific vaccine can get money.
Kennedy wants to get autism or allergies added to that document, according to two people familiar with internal discussions and concerns raised publicly by some vaccine developers and former regulators. He could accomplish the goal if HHS-led research blames vaccines for autism, for example, or if a federal vaccine advisory panel recommends against aluminum in vaccines, according to some legal scholars.
“Given the rate of autism, if a lot of cases are brought, that could bankrupt the program,” said Dorit Reiss, a professor at University of California Law San Francisco.
If that were to happen, pharmaceutical companies could stop producing the immunizations, which don’t tend to be very profitable, rather than get entangled in drawn-out, expensive lawsuits from claimants who can’t get money because the federal vaccine injury fund has run dry, some legal experts and vaccine developers said.
“The compensation fund, if it’s gone, would impact decisions to proceed or not to proceed,” said David Dodd, president and CEO of GeoVax Labs, a biotechnology company developing vaccines and immunotherapies.
A federal vaccine advisory panel could also recommend against aluminum in shots, forcing drugmakers to make costly reformulations or exit the market.
Kennedy has placed people around him to execute the strategy. He’s pushed to get vaccine skeptics in decision-making positions at the CDC, which recommends vaccines, and the Food and Drug Administration, which approves them.
He also tapped leaders in the anti-vaccine movement to vet candidates for him.
The outcome has been regulatory and policy decisions that have winnowed vaccine access and development.
HHS this month said it was halting $500 million in grants and contracts for the development of mRNA vaccines, including an improved, more durable covid mRNA vaccine.
The federal government stopped recommending covid shots for healthy pregnant women and children, bypassing input from a vaccine advisory committee that traditionally would have weighed in.
And Kennedy reconstituted that committee with his own handpicked members, including vaccine skeptics, and removed the American Medical Association, American Nurses Association, and other industry groups that served as committee liaisons. The modified panel recommended against flu vaccines containing a preservative erroneously linked to autism.
The White House Calls
Kennedy’s determination to keep vaccine skeptics in oversight positions played out in a deal he recently made with Trump and his staff, according to two people familiar with the situation. The arrangement came together on a Sunday night in July when Kennedy got a call from the White House.
The subject was Vinay Prasad, a top vaccine regulator at the FDA. He had recently touched off a wave of industry criticism for playing a role in the agency’s decision to ask biotech company Sarepta Therapeutics to halt shipments of a gene therapy over safety concerns.
Social media posts and conservative commentators whipped up a furor. Laura Loomer, a far-right provocateur, said July 21 on X that Prasad should be fired and called him “a self-proclaimed progressive liberal and Bernie Sanders fanboy,” referring to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Congressional lawmakers began peppering the White House with questions.
The furor reached Trump, who wanted Prasad out, according to the people. But Kennedy was concerned about losing Prasad. He felt he needed a critic of immunizations overseeing vaccines at the agency.
So Kennedy struck a deal. Prasad would be asked to resign as head of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, which regulates vaccine products and biologics such as gene therapies. And the center would be divided into two operations, with Kennedy empowered to select the person overseeing vaccines.
Some public health leaders publicly shared details of the arrangement and raised concerns about its potential impact. Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in an Aug. 1 interview on CNBC that he thought it “would be very destructive to the agency.”
After leaving the agency in July, Prasad is now returning, though it is unclear if his role has changed.
Recently, Kennedy was sued by Ray Flores, senior outside counsel for Children’s Health Defense. An anti-vaccine group founded by Kennedy, Children’s Health Defense is funding the suit, which claims Kennedy failed to launch a task force to study vaccine safety that it says is required to report findings to Congress. But Kennedy and his allies view the lawsuit as friendly, according to one person familiar with the matter, because it is seeking an outcome that he wants.
HHS on Aug. 14 announced it was reviving a federal panel, disbanded in 1998, to provide oversight of pediatric vaccines.
Kennedy’s work against vaccines has triggered unfriendly lawsuits too, including one brought by the American Academy of Pediatrics and other public health groups. His recent decision to halt funds for mRNA vaccine development yielded a swell of social media criticism.
“This is reckless. This is dangerous. This will cost lives. We must fight back,” Sen. Edward Markey (D-Mass.) said Aug. 5 on X.
“I’ve tried to be objective & non-alarmist in response to current HHS actions – but quite frankly this move is going to cost lives,” Jerome Adams, who was U.S. surgeon general during the previous Trump administration, said Aug. 5 on the same platform.
Kennedy and his backers remain undeterred. In a counterpunch, his supporters are launching an unprecedented public relations campaign to promote the HHS secretary, spurring speculation that he may be mulling a 2028 presidential run.
The nonprofit MAHA Action held a call in July to energize Kennedy supporters and initiated a six-figure ad campaign extolling Kennedy and Trump administration health initiatives.
“Make no mistake, this is a revolution that will change the face of public health policy,” Tony Lyons, president of MAHA Action, said in a statement. “Americans are demanding radical transparency and gold standard science.”

The company that now operates Badami, Cook Inlet Energy, improperly flared natural gas over a six-month period, state regulators say. (Map provided by Alaska Division of Oil and Gas/Alaska Department of Natural Resources)A small energy company operating a North Slope oil field has been ordered to pay a $357,905 fine for illegally flaring natural gas over a six-month period.
The Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission assessed the fine against Cook Inlet Energy in an order issued on Aug. 14.
Cook Inlet Energy flared over 51 million cubic feet of natural gas at the Badami field between last October and March, according to the commission.
The fine’s dollar amount is equal to twice the market value of the gas lost to flaring, as specified by state law, the AOGCC said in its order.
Cook Inlet Energy could reduce the fine amount if it upgrades or replaces the vapor recovery unit that had been inoperable at the time the gas was flared, the AOGCC order said.
The commission initially proposed the fine in May. The company disputed the commission’s initial findings of violations, arguing that the flaring was necessary for safety because the Badami vapor recovery unit was unexpectedly inoperable, that there was no backup system and that a power outage compounded the problem, according to the order.
Cook Inlet Energy pointed out that it had duly reported the gas flaring, and it argued that the flaring was legal under a rule that allows natural gas to be burned off in that way in emergencies or other special circumstances. The company cited a 2022 AOGCC order that allowed flaring at a well drilled by Great Bear Pantheon LLC.

	However, the AOGCC found that those special circumstances did not apply in this case, according to the order.
Cook Inlet Energy raised other issues in its arguments against the commission’s finding. One company argument cited the lack of a market for North Slope natural gas; because there is no market, the company argued, no royalties were lost to the state through the flaring.
However, the commission said it considers the flaring to be a waste of a state-owned natural resource, nonetheless.
“Resource conservation, including that of reducing or eliminating gas flare volumes, is of utmost importance to the State of Alaska, with lack of a current export path or current unrealized royalties being immaterial,” the AOGCC order said.
A small amount of gas flaring is allowed in Alaska, despite Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s repeated claims that oil producers in the state do not flare any natural gas. However, Cook Inlet Energy’s flaring well exceeded what would be allowable, according to the AOGCC order.
Cook Inlet Energy has a year to pay the fine, and it can credit the costs of a vapor recovery unit upgrade or replacement against the assessed $357,905, according to the order. The company also has the right to appeal the commission’s findings.
Cook Inlet Energy is a subsidiary of Glacier Oil & Gas, a privately held independent company. Until recently, a different Glacier Oil & Gas subsidiary, Savant Alaska, operated the Badami field.
Badami, located on the eastern side of the North Slope, was originally brought into development by BP. Production there started in 1998.  A decade later, BP formed a partnership with Savant that established the latter as Badami’s operator.
Badami’s production has fluctuated. It was about 2,000 barrels a day from April 2024 to March 2025, but in the year prior to that period, it averaged less than 900 barrels a day, according to the Alaska Division of Oil and Gas. The increase in production was largely attributed to a new well.

(Photo courtesy of Iowa State University)Iowa State University is working with a U.S. Defense Department-backed organization to develop facilities that could make the university and its community a national destination for biobased product testing.
BioMADE, a Manufacturing Innovation Institute focused on bioindustrial manufacturing and supported by the U.S. Department of Defense, announced it has partnered with ISU and the ISU Research Park to create and operate a multiuse fermentation facility.
The $40 million project, funded with contributions from the Iowa Economic Development and Finance Authority, BioMADE and Iowa State, will be housed at the university’s BioCentury Research Farm outside of Ames.
Kevin Moore, chief technology officer of the Biobased Products team in the office of the vice president for research, said the announcement brings to fruition work that was started by the state to strengthen biosciences industries in Iowa. He expects the program to be up and running in early 2028, and the new facility will utilize existing infrastructure to operate.
“This is why the state has invested money in this kind of effort, is that so we would have resources that could go after this opportunity,” Moore said. “And that’s what we did, and we’re going forward.”

The Biobased Products team at ISU was created as part of a statewide biosciences initiative, Moore said, with the goal of promoting economic development in related industries. Much of Moore’s job is working with ISU faculty to commercialize ideas or products they’ve developed through startup companies, he said.
Fermentation is best known for its role in the beer-making process, Moore said, but it also has a hand in making enzymes that can be found in detergents and other items, natural products like vitamin C, bioplastics and more.
The university already has fermentation abilities, Moore said, but on a much smaller scale. The ISU Center for Crops Utilization Research houses a fermentation facility with equipment that goes up to 1,000 liters, where companies can test products on a small scale and complete “proof of concept” work, but the new space will scale capabilities up to 10,000 liters.
Moore said the goal behind the new facility is to bring in companies to test their products before they have to decide whether to invest in customized, full-scale facilities of their own to mass-produce it.
“The key purpose of the announced facility is to de-risk investment decisions so that we can diversify the products that are made from corn, and also enable all of the various technologies that are being developed via fermentation, allowing them to come to reality,” Moore said.
As Iowa has plenty of feedstock and the need to diversify how corn is used, Moore said, and this new partnership provides opportunities to address both of these facts.
As the facilities will be managed by BioMADE and aimed at industry development, Moore said it is unlikely much research coming from ISU will be conducted there. Companies based in Iowa like Cargill and Kent Worldwide are expected to make use of the facilities, Moore said, as well as national and international partners of BioMADE.
“We do envision that some faculty members and their startup companies could be users of the facility, but really we view this as a national resource,” Moore said.

President Donald Trump on Monday rehashed his disdain for mail-in voting — a method that Trump has often attacked as part of the reason he lost the presidential election in 2020. 
During a meeting with Ukraine’s president, Trump said that lawyers are working to draft an executive order to end mail-in ballots before the 2026 midterm elections. That same day on social media, Trump said, without evidence, that mail-in ballots and voting machines are a scam and “a complete and total disaster.” 
But in a state where vote-by-mail has been available by default for all Californians since 2021, can Trump really do that? 
Though the U.S. has allowed people to vote by mail since the Civil War, its usage and accessibility ramped up in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Experts say that while voting by mail does increase the risk of fraud compared to in-person voting, mail-in voting fraud is still exceedingly rare.
Voters are more likely to get hit by lightning than to commit mail ballot fraud, said California Secretary of State Shirley Weber, citing one analysis.

Weber: “The president himself has voted by mail in his home state of Florida, so we know he has trusted the system enough to use it himself. He has won elections and lost elections with mail-in votes being counted.”

Though some California Republicans in Congress supported Trump’s unsubstantiated claims of widespread voter fraud, state GOP leaders have embraced mail voting. Of the more than 16 million votes cast by Californians during the 2024 general election, more than 13 million, or nearly 81%, was through vote-by-mail.

State Sen. Sabrina Cervantes, a Riverside Democrat and chairperson of the Senate elections committee: “Mail-in balloting gives voters who may experience challenges, such as health or even distance from voting centers, their right to vote.”

In addition to putting the Republican party and strategists in a bind, Trump’s pledges to eliminate mail-in voting by the end of next year is also unlikely. Congress has the authority to oversee federal elections, and should the president move ahead with his plan, “we will fight to defend our democracy,” said Assemblymember Gail Pellerin, the chairperson of the Assembly elections committee.

Pellerin, a Santa Cruz Democrat: “While I understand that Trump has a difficult time understanding the Constitution and the limits of his power, the truth is that he does not have the authority to do this.”

Speaking of the 2026 elections, a group of Republican legislators said Tuesday that they are suing to stop the state from advancing Gov. Gavin Newsom’s mid-cycle redistricting plan, reports CalMatters’ Maya C. Miller. 
The emergency petition, filed with the California Supreme Court, relates to a three-bill package that Democrats in the Legislature are scrambling to pass that would enable voters to accept or reject redrawn congressional maps during a Nov. 4 special election. 
The GOP lawmakers said that Democrats are violating the state constitution by sidestepping a rule that requires legislation, with some exceptions, to be publicly available for 30 days before lawmakers can vote on it.

Also Tuesday, CalMatters’ Alexei Koseff was at the Capitol speaking to Republican voters who happened to be traveling to Sacramento to protest against an unrelated bill. When word spread that the Legislature was holding hearings to weigh the redistricting proposal, dozens of them mobilized to voice their opposition to that too.

In their first formal response since the Trump administration undercut a handful of California’s climate policies during the past few months, state regulators unveiled guidelines Tuesday that aim to reaffirm California’s clean energy initiatives, write CalMatters’ Alejandro Lazo and Alejandra Reyes-Velarde.
The proposals include recommending more private investment, asking the Legislature to backfill electric vehicle incentives and rewriting clean car rules. Several state agencies developed the recommendations as a joint effort in response to Newsom’s June executive order directing regulators to double down on transitioning away from fossil fuels. 
Though the chairperson of California’s Air Resources Board said “California … will not give up on cleaner air and better public health,” some climate experts said the suggestions weren’t aggressive enough.

Daniel Sperling, a former air board member and current director of UC Davis’ Institute for Transportation Studies: “I’m puzzled, actually, because they had acted like they were really going to do something significant.”

A spokesman for the governor said Newsom would review the proposals.

Fran was a truly wonderful man who had a kind word for everyone he met and genuinely believed it when he would say, “Life is Good”!
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Francis Walter Kazak.","Born Feb. 7, 1942
Springfield, Vermont
Died Aug. 9, 2025


Francis Walter Kazak was born in Springfield Vermont on February 7, 1942.
As the son of Veronica Janowski and Walter Kazak, he grew up in Springfield and Cavendish in the heyday of the machine tool industry where the extended family of Polish Russian heritage were hard working individuals as farmers, manufacturing plant workers, and grocery store owners. His maternal grandfather worked in the mill at night and tended his small farm and cows in Cavendish during the days.
Fran was proud of the Springfield community where he grew up and sang the praises of all the resources that they had for young people. A fond memory he had as a young boy was of walking down the steep hill from his home to the center of town to drop off the bill payments for his parents and pick up 2 loaves of Polish bread from the local bakery. He would carry them back home as fast as he could, so they were still warm for butter. During his high school years, he especially enjoyed the block dances and working as the rope tow attendant at the local ski hill. He was the designated “weeder” in his father’s extensive garden where they would grow vegetables by the basketful, bring them home where he, his sisters, and mother would prepare them for freezing. He also helped his grandfather in Cavendish haying and tending to the cows.
In high school, he attended the co-op program at Springfield High School with several weeks in academic studies followed by a set of weeks in the in the manufacturing plants to learn the skills and tools of all the trades involved. The plan was for him to be prepared to transition into a good job after finishing high school. Fortunately, his high school teachers, along with an observant guidance counselor recognized Fran’s academic ability and told his parents that, “this young man should be going on to college”. Following that advice, Fran went off to Boston and attended Franklin Institute on an ASTME scholarship to finish up requirements in order to apply for college. He attended UVM School of Engineering and when he graduated was immediately recruited by IBM. There he thrived in the demands of his job and the freedom to use his creative mind for new innovations in the chip manufacturing industry.
At IBM, he met Lorraine Elizabeth Hurst, the love of his life, and introduced her to his extensive family of aunts, uncles, and a multitude of cousins. Lori and Fran married on June 20, 1969. Together they built a home in Westford, VT and welcomed their son Christopher Michael in 1979, and then Corey Joseph in 1982. Later they relocated to Essex Junction. As a devoted father, Fran involved the boys in outdoor activities, the cub scouts, took them to the mountains for family skiing, and was there for them as they pursued their passions for playing soccer and running cross country and track. For many summers he and Lori and the boys would join with other family members on the coast of Maine for camping or renting a big beach house for lots of beach time, lobsters, and summer fun. Fran’s large extended family was his social network and support system for his whole life, and he maintained close connections with his cousins.
As the turns of life go, Fran and Lori entered into a 13-year battle when she was diagnosed with cancer. He was with her every step of the way on this marathon trying everything to beat the odds that ended in the summer of 2003 when she passed away. He continued his devotion to Chris and Corey as they journeyed through college, spent time living and working in Boston, establishing their careers and moved on to finding and marrying their wonderful spouses. Fran especially enjoyed traveling to Boston to go to the Red Sox games with them. He was so proud of them and delighted in having daughter in-laws and three wonderful grandchildren.
Fran is survived by his sons Chris and his wife Devon, Lorraine (6) and Nolan (3), and Corey, his wife Natalie and their 4-month-old son, Colton, a sister, Janice and two nieces in NY, a sister, Jean and husband Bob and a niece in North Carolina, and a nephew in Maine and his partner of 20 years, Maura O’Brien.
Fran and Maura, also of Westford, reacquainted in 2006 and soon it became clear that they would become partners for life. Fran often said that he was blessed with the two greatest loves of his life. Fran and Maura recognized the passion in the love each had for their own families and Fran welcomed Maura’s son, Benjamin, and daughter, Anna along with her husband Bill and daughters Elsa (14) and Alice (11), into his circle of love. He delighted in attending the girls jazz band nights, dance performances and the McCloy and OBrien family gatherings. Fran and Maura had a mutual love for the outdoors, jazz music and music of the 50’s 60’s. They relished every opportunity to dance including in the kitchen on Saturday nights to the “My Place” music on VPR. Together, they loved touring the art galleries in Vermont, Cape Cod, Boston, DC and NYC , historical museums, and especially loved musical theater productions. They shared similar reading interests especially in history and often had long discussions on issues related to social justice. They loved cooking together, especially finding great recipes and planning gourmet meals with each other. For many years they gardened together on the ‘lower four’ as Fran called the property where they had garden beds and boxes. Together, they took the ‘trip of the lifetime’ and spent a month in Africa touring Zambia, Zimbabwe, Botswana and Johannesburg, and South Africa. They continued to revisit the trip in the photos and memories they shared.
Fran’s passions and pastimes were reading, music, and Radio Controlled (RC) planes. He was a voracious reader. Every day he consumed several national and local news publications. There were always at least two books on his chair side table; one with a historical focus, and another, an action-packed thriller. In recent years, he discovered enjoyment in reading poetry. As a lover of music, he catalogued and downloaded his favorite music on to all his devices. For many years, he focused on building, fine tuning, and flying RC planes; mostly the fine-tuning and creating adaptations for a better flight. He did everything with scientific precision from creating the right compost for the garden, to designing a new gate for the deck for the grandchildren, experimenting with weights and measures in his passion for making bread, finding the best lens for his many cameras, and researching and practicing restoration and storage of family photos. He loved watching the birds and came up with all sorts of technological improvement to bird feeders to attract them, especially the Baltimore Orioles and hummingbirds this past Spring. Fran was a truly wonderful man who had a kind word for everyone he met and genuinely believed it when he would say, “Life is Good”!
Over time, Fran volunteered for the Burlington Food Shelf and recently he became a proud member of the Essex Rotary Club. Many heartfelt thanks go to the extraordinarily compassionate nurses and doctors at UVM Medical Center Cardiac Care unit. In lieu flowers, please consider a donation the Essex VT Rotary Club.

CalMatters intern Sarah Calixto shares what she learned while working at CalMatters, and what journalism students can take away from her experience.


This summer, I had the incredible opportunity to work as an intern on CalMatters’ audience engagement team. As my time comes to an end and I prepare for my senior year of college, here are the lessons I learned that could help other journalism students or those starting out in their careers. 
1. Readers need to know how big news affects their lives 
Newsrooms need to find ways to break down how “big” news will affect their local audience. During my internship, I saw reporter Kristen Hwang break down how the federal government’s new budget made significant changes to Covered California, which experts and insurers both said would make health insurance cost more for consumers. The spending bill had thousands of repercussions to dissect and discuss, but zeroing in on how it would affect one crucial part of people’s lives helped CalMatters cut through the noise. I then “translated” Kristen’s story into an accessible, easy-to-digest Instagram post in order to reach even more Californians where they are, and focused on highlighting tangible details from the story, like how premiums are expected to increase by 66% or $101 per month starting next year. 
2. Influencers can be an advantage for newsrooms 
For my internship, I worked on the early development of a project to better use social media as a way to build deeper connections with a younger audience. For the project, I spent hours scrolling and researching the profiles of users on TikTok and Instagram. I focused on finding people based in California that had a platform related to the content of a news story, had news centered posts, or the perfect combination of both. From there, I debated whether the influencer would be a good fit within CalMatters and what it stands for, as well as if the influencers themselves would agree and benefit from a partnership. 
As I spent hours on social media platforms, I got a bigger glimpse of how useful social media and influencers today can be to news outlets. For example, I found profiles of young people who built their platforms on discussing news in a more relatable and digestible manner to a younger audience. I also found professionals that used their knowledge to dismantle misinformation on social media and provide the actual facts. Regardless of the actual content, those who had a following in the platform, made themselves a foundation to stand on and made sure to carve out an unique space for themselves within their content bubble. 
3. There’s room in journalism for a sense of humor
During my internship I had the opportunity to create a vertical video post for reporter Lynn La’s story about how California could enact a first-in-the-nation ban on plastic glitter in cosmetics. 

        View this post on Instagram            A post shared by CalMatters (@calmatters)

As someone who watches beauty and style videos on TikTok regularly, I read her story and knew that it could translate really well in several different TikTok “trends.” With that in mind, I recorded and edited three ideas that could work within the TikTok platform: a “Get Ready With Me” video, the “Shock Horror” trending sound, and a simple educational skit. In the end, my editors published the less risky explainer skit (they are elder millennials, after all), but I still felt accomplished in being able to report the news with humor and a glitter face filter. This is something I would absolutely try again in future newsrooms, especially if I’m thinking about reaching and connecting with a younger audience.
Overall, I’ve grown and learned a lot this summer, both as a professional and as a journalist. I’m moving forward with a new comprehension of what journalism means today, and how I can be the best reporter for readers and any newsroom I work for in the future.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/052825_CalMatters-Office-File_MG_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-20 08:56:24.401154
,California,2025-08-20 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,"As heat soars in the Inland Empire, a community group steps up to save lives",Deborah Brennan,,,,,https://calmatters.org/environment/2025/08/inland-empire-heat-weather-program/,GoFundMe.org has teamed with an Inland Empire non-profit to distribute air conditioners and air and water purifiers to those in need just as the temperatures are predicted to rise to near 115 degrees in the desert.,"In summary
GoFundMe.org has teamed with an Inland Empire non-profit to distribute air conditioners and air and water purifiers to those in need just as the temperatures are predicted to rise to near 115 degrees in the desert. 


As the Inland Empire braces for an extreme heat warning this week, a community group is helping residents in the hottest parts of the desert manage scorching weather.
The nonprofit Comité Civico del Valle has distributed air purifiers, air conditioning devices and water purifiers to families living around the Salton Sea, through a weather resilience program that GoFundMe.org launched.
“This program’s about fairness, safety and dignity for our residents,” Luis Olmedo, executive director of Comité Civico del Valle said at a press conference last week. “It’s not just about handing out equipment. It’s about making sure that vulnerable residents, especially seniors, people with health conditions and low-income families are not left behind when extreme heat strikes.”
The National Weather Service is warning of extreme weather conditions in inland desert areas this week, with temperatures forecast at 106 to 115 degrees Fahrenheit. Weather conditions, it stated, will be “dangerously hot” and pose a “major heat risk” of illnesses including heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke.
But triple digit temperatures are the norm in summer for desert communities in eastern Riverside and Imperial County.
And aging homes aren’t equipped to protect against those conditions. Many families live in mobile homes, including old, aluminum trailers without insulation that are “like being inside a can,” said Esther Bejarano, director of health programs for the organization.
“Imagine living inside that trailer where it’s 30, 40 years old, and you have a non-working inside window unit… to cool the house,” she said.
In 2022 Imperial County had more than 100 heat-related emergency room visits per 100,000 residents: the highest rate in the state. Last year the county recorded 196 heat-related medical incidents, including 11 deaths. This year so far it has reported 65 illnesses and no deaths.
Neighboring Riverside County, which also includes parts of the Salton Sea, recorded 1,627 emergency room visits and 65 deaths due to heat-related illness in 2024 and 550 heat-related emergency department visits and two deaths this year. 
GoFundMe.org introduced a pilot program to reduce those risks. It provided half a million dollars to Comité Civico del Valle to provide the devices to people who lacked air filtration or cooling systems, or couldn’t afford to use them. 
“I knew people who lived in manufactured homes, which they called trailers. They had to go to the Circle K, the Arco, or the public library, to get cooled off, because they didn’t have air conditioning,” said Rodrigo Palma, a 72-year-old Brawley resident, who received help through the program.
The goal was to provide 100 families with updated cooling systems. So far the program has installed 72 cooling systems, 389 air purifiers and four reverse osmosis water filters, said Amanda Brown Lehrman, executive director of GoFundMe.org.
“While these interventions do not replace the need for systemic change, they do provide families with tools to protect their health and manage the everyday challenges a little bit more faithfully and a little bit more affordably,” Lehrman said.
The weather resilience program hit some snags, Bejarano said. The cooling systems, called mini-split air conditioning units, are ductless systems designed to cool individual rooms quickly and efficiently, she said.
“They’ve been very popular and sales have skyrocketed, because people cannot afford to turn on the AC if they do have one to cool the entire house,” she said.
But contractors hired to install them found that permits cost as much as $900 per unit, she said.
“We’ve had a lot of hurdles with the very high cost of permits for these homes and families that need it the most,” she said. “That’s something we need to do some policy work on.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/081925-Brawley-Farm-RS-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C592&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-20 08:56:24.401154
,California,2025-08-20 12:15:00+00:00,CalMatters,California has a fallback plan for Trump’s clean car attacks. Does it go far enough?,Alejandro Lazo and Alejandra Reyes-Velarde,,,,,https://calmatters.org/environment/climate-change/2025/08/trump-climate-counter/,"Amid a legal fight over California’s power to regulate car and truck pollution, state agencies are suggesting policies that need stable funding, legislative action, or lengthy rulemaking.","In summary
Amid a legal fight over California’s power to regulate car and truck pollution, state agencies are suggesting policies that need stable funding, legislative action, or lengthy rulemaking.


California regulators, responding to the Trump Administration’s attacks on the state’s climate policy, propose to fight back in part by asking lawmakers to backfill electric vehicle incentives, recommending more private investment, and beginning to write clean car rules — again. 
“Clean air efforts are under siege, putting the health of every American at risk,” said Air Resources Board chairperson Liane Randolph. “California is continuing to fight back and will not give up on cleaner air and better public health. We have a legal and moral obligation.”
Several state agencies jointly made the recommendations in response to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s June executive order calling for California to double down on efforts to transition away from fossil fuels. 
Proposals unveiled Tuesday also include replacing expiring federal EV tax credits — a tough ask in a tight budget year—and restoring carpool lane access, which would require federal approval. One recommendation seeks to expand vehicle charging access by streamlining utility hookups and simplifying permits for new stations. 
The air board is advancing just a few regulatory ideas: one to enact stronger consumer protections for clean car owners, and another to curb diesel pollution from freight hubs such as ports and warehouses. Randolph also said the board would begin work on a new clean cars rule.
A spokesman for the governor said he would review the agencies’ report. 
The recommendations reflect the hard shift the state has experienced from a supportive Biden administration toward a hostile one under President Trump, said Guillermo Ortiz, senior clean vehicles advocate for the Natural Resources Defense Council.
“When you have your federal government using every tool at its disposal to attack its own state …how are you able to see every attack angle, every vector, everything that this administration is willing to do to harm California?” he said. “That’s difficult.” 
Other experts also said they expected more. “Folks familiar with this kind of policy will read it and feel…underwhelmed,” wrote Earthjustice lawyer Adrian Martinez in an analysis of the plan.
“Nothing jumps out at me as being particularly aggressive,” said Daniel Sperling, a former Air Resources Board member who is the director of the Institute for Transportation Studies at UC Davis. “I’m puzzled, actually, because they had acted like they were really going to do something significant.”
Trucking deal collapses
California offered the remedies as a fallback after the Trump Administration announced it would cancel federal waivers issued under the Clean Air Act that have long allowed the state to set more aggressive car and truck standards.
Attacks on the state’s climate policies escalated last week, centered on the Clean Truck Partnership, a voluntary deal between major truck manufacturers and the state that would continue advancing zero emission truck technology even if the waiver programs fell through.
Last week, four manufacturers filed a lawsuit, seeking to dissolve their commitments under the partnership. The Federal Trade Commission, after launching an investigation into California’s program, declared the partnership unenforceable. 
Days later, Trump’s Justice Department intervened in two lawsuits, arguing that the decision whether to ban internal-combustion engines in heavy-duty trucks rests ultimately with the federal government.
California’s climate policies matter most in communities near ports, warehouses and railyards, where diesel pollution chokes the air, said Ortiz of the Natural Resources Defense Council. Truck exhaust is a major source of cancer risk and drives respiratory and heart disease. 
Without authority to make aggressive rules or strong voluntary measures like the Clean Truck Partnership, experts say the transition to less-polluting trucks could slow down.
A call for bolder action 
Experts who called for bolder action said the state has more power than its executive and legislative branches are using. 
Sperling said the state could better disincentivize gas-powered cars with a “feebate program,” which could charge fees on high-polluting vehicles in order to pay for clean-car rebates. 
“If you really want to put your money where your mouth is, I think really supercharging those programs to advance transportation electrification could be a massively successful strategy,” said Martinez, who directs Earthjustice’s campaign toward that goal. 
Martinez said that the state could better structure existing state programs including the Low Carbon Fuel Standard and the state’s Cap and Trade program to pay for electric cars and trucks.
“California shouldn’t blink” as the Trump Administration moves “aggressively,” he added.
Ethan Elkind, who directs the climate program at UC Berkeley’s Center for Law, Energy and the Environment, said a statewide rule tightening controls at warehouses and other pollution magnets could achieve similar aims to the truck mandates. 
Elkind previously has pushed to go further. If the federal government is getting out of the business of regulating tailpipe emissions and making climate policy, he added, California could fill that vacuum in the future. 
“The state could take a pretty aggressive approach here,” he added.
Air Resources Board chair Randolph said that California is not backing down, though she admitted that developing a new clean car rule aimed at phasing out gas-powered cars could take time. 
“Because these rulemakings take two, three, sometimes even four years, we decided that it would be good to start that process now, and have it … be ready, ideally for a more receptive U.S. EPA,” Randolph said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/102924_EV-Trucks_CS_CM_04.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-20 08:56:24.401154

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)President Donald Trump this week vowed to “lead a movement to get rid of” voting by mail ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. 
“WE WILL BEGIN THIS EFFORT, WHICH WILL BE STRONGLY OPPOSED BY THE DEMOCRATS BECAUSE THEY CHEAT AT LEVELS NEVER SEEN BEFORE, by signing an EXECUTIVE ORDER to help bring HONESTY to the 2026 Midterm Elections,” the president said in a post on Truth Social Monday. 
Trump, who has long opposed voting by mail, continued to claim, without evidence, that it’s fraught with fraud. 
Utah has been the only red state among eight that have conducted universal by-mail elections, including six Democratic strongholds and one swing state — a fact that some conservatives here have balked at, while others have defended the state’s by-mail system as a popular, convenient and safe voting method. 
After Trump’s post, Utah’s top election official, Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson, a Republican, issued a short statement on social media without addressing the president directly. 
Utah Legislature approves bill to require voter ID, phase out automatic voting by mail by 2029

“The constitutional right of individual states to choose the manner in which they conduct secure elections is a fundamental strength of our system,” Henderson said. 
The president, however, asserted that states should do what the federal government wants. 
“Remember, the States are merely an ‘agent’ for the Federal Government in counting and tabulating the votes,” Trump said. “They must do what the Federal Government, as represented by the President of the United States, tells them, FOR THE GOOD OF OUR COUNTRY, to do.”
Another high-ranking Republican and member of GOP legislative leadership — Senate Majority Assistant Whip Mike McKell, R-Spanish Fork — disagrees. 
McKell told Utah News Dispatch in an interview Tuesday that, like Henderson said, states have the right to choose how to administer their elections, and that he’d push back on an effort to completely undo voting by mail. 
“In Utah, we’re in a good place. I think there’s strong support for vote by mail. There’s also strong support for security,” McKell said.
He added that’s “the needle we tried to thread” earlier this year when the 2025 Utah Legislature passed a bill that he sponsored to require voter ID and eventually phase out automatic voting by mail in this state by 2026. The aim of that bill, he said, was to preserve voting by mail as an option for Utah voters while also adding a new layer of security. 
Even though local polls have shown a vast majority of Utahns remain confident in their elections, Gallup polling shows trust nationally has decreased especially among a faction of Republican voters since 2006 as elections have become more polarized. After Trump lost the 2020 election, he ramped up rhetoric to cast doubt on election security and voting by mail. 
Asked about Trump’s comments this week, McKell reiterated it’s a matter of states rights.

“It is a federalism issue,” he said. “If it’s not enumerated in the (U.S.) Constitution, it’s reserved for the states. That’s article 10. I think states have the right to dictate how they run their elections.” 
McKell also defended Utah’s track record as a state that has used voting by mail for years, starting with optional pilot programs that counties opted into before moving to universal voting by mail. 
“In the state of Utah, Republicans have done really well with vote by mail. We elect Republicans,” he said, also noting that Trump in 2024 won the red state handily. “There’s generally broad support for vote by mail, especially among rural voters and elderly voters in Utah.” 
He added that “it’s OK if there’s some tension between the federal government and state government,” but he argued the Constitution clearly reserves elections for states to control and administer. 
Pressed on how he’d respond to pressure from the Trump administration to get rid of voting by mail, McKell said, “I would resist a movement that didn’t originate in the state,” adding that he responds to his constituents, not the federal government. 
“If there’s a movement to change vote by mail, it needs to come from — it must come from — the state,” he said. “It’s a state issue. The states need to be in control of their own elections. Right now, I don’t feel like there’s a reason to eliminate vote by mail. I think we do a good job.” 
Utah election audit finds no ‘significant fraud,’ but raises concern over voter roll maintenance

Not all Republicans in Utah embrace voting by mail, however, Earlier this year, McKell’s bill was the result of a compromise between the House and Senate to more drastically restrict the state’s universal vote-by-mail system. 
Asked whether Trump’s comments could further inflame skepticism around the security of voting by mail in Utah, McKell said it’s nothing new. “We saw these comments before, and even going into the last legislative session, there were folks that opposed vote by mail.” 
But McKell said multiple state audits “have shown that our elections are safe and secure,” while legislators have also made efforts to continually improve the system where issues have cropped up, like in voter roll maintenance. 
It remains to be seen whether Trump’s comments could fan some Republican lawmakers’ appetite to go after voting by mail during their next general session in January, but McKell said typically every year there’s a slew of election bills for legislators to sort through. 
Asked whether he plans to make any tweaks to his 2025 bill, McKell said he’s still talking with clerks about any possible changes. 
“I feel like we did strike a really appropriate balance, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t look at ways to make it better,” he said, adding that he doesn’t have any specific proposals yet, “but that could change as we get closer to the legislative session.”

(Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)About a month and a half into Hal Nash’s term as chair of the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles, civil rights and criminal justice reform groups say they’ve seen changes to the board’s operations and decision-making.
Officials of the ACLU of Alabama said at an event in Montgomery on Saturday that since Nash took over in July, members of the board appear to be speaking to each other more and questioning witnesses in parole hearings more closely.
“You all should be very hopeful,” said Nichelle Cunningham, a paralegal with the ACLU of Alabama who is spearheading the organization’s efforts to reform the state’s parole system. “You have a decent board that is going to be fair, that is going to be united, they are not going to be pitted against each other in their decision making. If your loved one is denied, I personally feel there is something that is lacking in that file.”

Gov. Kay Ivey appointed Nash, a former Jackson County corrections deputy, to the position in July, replacing former chair Leigh Gwathney.
Gwathney came on board after the Alabama Legislature passed new laws changing parole after the mistaken release of Jimmy O’Neal Spencer on parole in 2017. Spencer went on to kill three people, including a seven-year-old child, in a series of robberies in Guntersville.
The legislation established the director of the Alabama Bureau of Pardons and Paroles and made it a cabinet-level position. They outlined more strict rules for granting parole for people who committed violent crimes and established guidelines that the parole board may follow when deciding to grant parole.
Members of the parole board had granted parole to more than 50% of the applicants as recently as 2017. However, the parole rate began to decline steadily shortly into Gwathney’s tenure as chair. In 2023, the parole rate decreased to 8%, its lowest point before it increased to about 26% in 2025.
Civil rights groups criticized Gwathney for consistently voting against applicants seeking parole throughout her tenure. Legislators on the Joint Prison Oversight Committee also expressed disapproval after she was unable to answer their questions concerning the parole guidelines at a meeting in October.
The ACLU of Alabama has been sending witnesses to observe the parole board hearings for the past few years after the organization expressed concerns after the rate that the parole board granted parole plummeted.
Since Nash succeeded Gwathney, parole rates have gone up. From the beginning of the year through Gwathney’s departure in early July, the board granted parole almost 18% of the time while Gwathney. In the cases that have come before the board since Nash became chair, the parole rate increased to almost 30%, according to the Alabama Reflector’s calculations using information obtained from the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles.
“I think that he has come in with an open mind,” Cunningham said in an interview on Saturday. “He explains that this is going to be open and fair. ‘We are going into this hearing open-minded.’ It is going to be fair, and he is going to give it all his attention.”
In two successive rounds of parole board hearings on Tuesday, Nash opened the proceedings by telling attendees the board was interested in their testimony.
The parole board denied parole for the applicants in the first round, all with offenses considered violent and whose loved ones presented little evidence of any programs completed while incarcerated.
In the second round, the members granted parole to two applicants. The mother of one of the applicants spoke on his behalf at the hearing and was asked about the living situation should he be released.
“What would your answer be if he were paroled?” Nash asked the applicant’s mother.
The mother said that her son, who is on the autism spectrum, would come to live with her and that she would help ensure he would take his medication and undergo therapy.
Members also granted parole for another applicant whose sister said that the applicant earned his GED, completed an anger management program as well as obtaining his commercial driver’s license. He also drives a van to transport others who are incarcerated.
“They seem to listen, and they seem to want what is actually best for people who were there,” said Veronica Johnson of the Alabama Justice Initiative, who also spoke during the panel. “One person in particular, called the families back up to get some clarification.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_7336-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-20 08:56:24.401154

NV Energy is asking federal regulators for permission to let renewable energy clients out of their transmission agreements without penalty following President Donald Trump’s evisceration of clean energy tax credits for projects on federal land.  
Trump’s policies, according to NV Energy’s July 28 waiver request, “may have created significant challenges for solar and wind developers, especially for projects on land controlled by the Bureau of Land Management.”
“The request suggests that developers may abandon renewable energy projects that are no longer feasible,” Utility Dive reported Tuesday. “Projects with solar or wind components make up nearly 80% of NV Energy’s interconnection queue.”
In a filing Monday with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), two trade groups, Solar Energy Industries Association and the Interwest Energy Alliance, said NV Energy’s requested waiver would “encourage now-uncertain projects to withdraw from the queue or terminate their projects quickly, without penalty and with rapid return of their commercial deposits.” 
NV Energy is seeking a one-time, 60-day window to allow interconnection customers to withdraw without penalty. 
The waiver sought by NV Energy is necessary, the utility and the trade groups argue, because of  Trump policies such as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and an executive order and Department of Interior memo issued in the wake of the bill’s passage. 
The OBBB, billed as a cost-cutting measure for Americans, eliminates or phases out a number of clean energy tax credits enacted by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, and is expected to increase energy prices and reduce investment in renewables.
As a result of Trump’s policy, Nevada’s annual gross domestic product (GDP) is projected to “shrink by $1 billion in 2030 and $1.5 billion in 2035. Between 2025 and 2034 – the Reconciliation budget window – cumulative GDP would shrink by $8 billion in Nevada,” according to a state-by-state analysis from Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan think tank. 
The July 15 DOI memo requires that both the deputy secretary and secretary of the Interior personally review “every decision, action, consultation, and other undertaking” related to solar and wind development on federal land under BLM management, which is most of the state, NV Energy wrote. 
“The purpose of this waiver request is thus both to clear the queue to the extent possible and avoid unneeded disputes, by providing a benefit to those willing to leave the queue,” the utility said in its filing. 
Trump’s phasing out and elimination of clean energy credits could leave a void in NV Energy’s anticipated load for Greenlink, a $4.2 billion transmission line project regulated by FERC. The utility hopes its effort to clear the decks of unworkable projects could pave the path for those that remain viable. 
“The rapid return of commercial deposits may also allow renewable developers to focus their development efforts on their projects that may be able to obtain tax credits, are not solar or wind and sited on federal land, or on their projects that remain viable because they are needed to meet state renewable standards, regardless of the changed economics.” 
NV Energy did not respond to questions about the impact of scrapped energy projects on Greenlink. 
solar projects deep in the project pipeline have been frozen
Earlier this month, Gov. Joe Lombardo wrote to Secretary of the Interior Doug Burghum complaining that “solar projects deep in the project pipeline have been frozen” by the administration’s announcements. The governor mentioned three NV Energy solar projects in the works that would “immediately support our growing economy and electrical grid reliance.” 
Lombardo, who singled out the energy needs of Nevada’s mining and data center industries, told Burghum he’s confident the two can work to “ensure Nevada’s ability to tap into one of its most abundant energy resources – solar energy – while meeting the Trump Administration’s goal of avoiding preferential treatment in federal permitting processes.”

Michigan’s State Board of Education is closer to filling the top education post after choosing Lisa Coons, Glenn Maleyko, and Judy Walton as finalists to be the next state superintendent.
Over two days, the board interviewed seven candidates to find the best applicant to succeed State Superintendent Michael Rice, who announced in April that he is retiring effective Oct. 3. Rice has been in the role since 2019.
The board interviewed four candidates on Monday but ended up selecting as finalists all three of the applicants who interviewed on Tuesday. They are:

Lisa Coons, former state superintendent in Virginia and former chief academic officer for the Tennessee Department of Education.
Glenn Maleyko, superintendent for Dearborn Public Schools
Judy Walton, superintendent and curriculum director for Harrison Community Schools

The three finalists will come back next week for a final interview with the board.
The four semifinalists that didn’t make it to the next round were Paul Salah, superintendent for Huron Valley Schools; John Severson, executive director of the Michigan Association of Intermediate School Administrators; Thomas Ahart, an education consultant and former superintendent of Des Moines Public Schools; and Christopher Timmis, superintendent for Dexter Public Schools.
Some of the board members noted that they had a strong field of semifinalists.
“We’ve heard from an incredible group of educators who are doing amazing work across the state and beyond,” board president Pam Pugh said.
Board member Tom McMillin, a Republican from Oakland Township, advocated for Timmis and was disappointed he wasn’t a finalist.
“He’s a change agent,” McMillin said, citing what Timmis said about moving away from what he described as a system that rewards seat time toward one that rewards student engagement and attainment of knowledge and skills.
“If we don’t get him, someone else will,” McMillin said.
He voted no on the finalists and fellow Republican Nikki Snyder, who is from Goodrich, initially passed on voting but then said, “You’re welcome to put it as a no.” Snyder and McMillin had advocated for including Timmis as a fourth finalist, but the consensus was to go with three candidates. The six Democrats on the board voted in favor of the finalists.
Here’s what they heard from the candidates, as well as their application materials:
 Maleyko: Working together will make it happen

Maleyko, the Dearborn superintendent, said his vision for public education in Michigan is aligned with what the State Board of Education and the Michigan Department of Education, or MDE, have already established as goals toward improving education. Among those eight goals are expanding early childhood education, improving early literacy achievement, increasing graduation rates, increasing the number of certified teachers in areas where there are shortages, and providing adequate and equitable school funding.
“These are all things that we know other states have been successful … at implementing,” Maleyko said.
But academic performance has struggled in Michigan, and other states are showing more improvement on a rigorous national exam.
Maleyko said Michigan needs stronger collaboration between the state and local districts, the business community, students, and other stakeholders to move the state forward.
“We know there’s strengths in Michigan, but there’s also areas where we can improve, and I think together, we can do that, and I’m steadfast in my belief that working together will make that happen,” he said.
Candidates were asked about how their experiences as educators shaped their approach to leadership. Maleyko, in his response, talked about when he was a first-year third-grade teacher at Salina Elementary School in the Dearborn district. A young boy had drawn a picture in his journal of someone being shot. Maleyko, concerned, consulted his principal and the school social worker. The parents, who spoke little English, came in. Through translation, the meaning behind the drawing became clear.
“It turned out that that student saw his uncle get shot … in Iraq after the first Gulf War in the 90s,” Maleyko said. “It was eye-opening, because here’s the thing, I grew up middle class. I didn’t have to deal with what that student had to deal with.
“But the one thing as an educator is that I could work my hardest to make sure that that student will receive the highest possible, best education they could, so that they would be successful in society. That has stood with me throughout my career.” That student’s story has stuck with him for years, and it helps him remember that many other students are dealing with challenges.
 Walton: We must grow the ‘future stories’ of students

The school year that began this week in Harrison Community Schools is the fourth one that has had a “future stories” theme. Superintendent Judy Walton said her vision for public education is to expand that theme across the state.
“We want to grow their future stories,” Walton said. “That has to be our vision, and we can’t do anything along the way that takes options off the table for them. It’s their job to write that story, and it’s also our job to sometimes help them see that future, even when they can’t because of things that are impacting them.”
In order to invest in those future stories, she said, Michigan will need to ensure there is “sustainable, equitable funding that recognizes the uniqueness of districts.” Each district has its own challenges and opportunities, and they vary in size and location, she said. In a small rural district like hers, she said, there is less red tape, but there are also fewer opportunities for competitive grants because of their size.
“Overall, it still matters the ZIP code of a child as to what kind of education you get, and that’s still not okay.”
Walton said there needs to be more of a connection between the MDE and districts, teachers, and students. The state education department, she said, must be the leader in making those connections happen and to build on “the great work that’s been happening.”
“We need to be out in front, making those connections, helping districts network with each other, because great ideas are everywhere in the state. But if we can’t connect people to them, they sit in silos, and a silo will be the death of great education across the state.”
When it comes to students, Walton said the Michigan Merit Curriculum, which outlines what classes students need to take for high school graduation, affected how many opportunities students had in school.
“It really impacted elective choices and things like [career and technical education] and things like work-based learning. … I think it also really dampens some of the creativity and love of learning that our kids have. And so I think we have to provide more choices for them, not let go of rigor, not saying we don’t want you to be able to compete. We’ve got to figure out more ways to help have more of their own voice heard in their path to a diploma.”
 Coons: Improving early literacy is a key priority

Coons spoke extensively about her experiences in Tennessee and Virginia and described herself as passionate about literacy. When she became executive officer of priority schools in Nashville, at a time when a growing number of struggling schools were at risk of a state takeover, it became imperative to “walk through every single classroom to see what was happening.”
As they walked through second grade classrooms, one troubling theme emerged. “No one was teaching reading. In every single second grade classroom I walked through, they were coloring. Not only were these students having a lot of challenges outside of the classroom, they weren’t having the opportunity to learn to read inside the classroom.”
When she sat down with the principal and second grade teaching team, she asked why they weren’t teaching reading. “And they said, ‘Our children can’t sit still. We are not able to teach.”
Thus began an intensive approach to turn around that school.
“We started with teacher training, instructional materials, partnered with a nonprofit to give deep, deep coaching for our teachers on classroom management and how to implement strategies, but also to our school leaders so they could track the data and understand data,” Coons said.
She told the board that the goal to improve early literacy must be the biggest priority and that Michigan needs to ensure that school districts across the state receive the resources and support they need. She said that how MDE partners with districts will be different in different parts of the state.
“It’s an incredibly important space for us to be over the next five years, to make sure that, first and foremost, our students have the opportunity at the end of third grade [to learn to read], because we know that opens doors for their futures.”
Coons said the MDE goal to increase the percentage of students who graduate from high school is also an important part of the state’s vision for improving education.
“As a student walks the stage, if they’re only ending with graduation, we haven’t served their next step. It’s incredibly important for us to think about what are those post-secondary opportunities that they’re having in high school that help them solidify their steps after they graduate?”
Michigan, she said, has a lot of different opportunities for high school students, such as early college programs and workplace readiness programs.
The goal should be that as students graduate, they’re not asking ‘What’s next?’ but are instead thinking, ‘This is where I’m headed.’

,California,2025-08-20 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,California’s finances face a perfect storm. It could eventually lead to another tax hike,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/08/tax-increase-california-budget-storm/,"The structural deficit afflicting California's budget is fueling preliminary cogitating over a tax increase of some kind, which would probably have to be ratified by voters this decade.","A perfect storm of economic, fiscal and political trends is battering California’s already deficit-ridden state budget, leading public employee unions and other interest groups dependent on money from Sacramento to explore hefty tax increases.
The budget has what fiscal authorities call a “structural deficit,” meaning that its revenue system, dominated by personal income taxes, cannot generate enough income to fully finance all services and programs in current law.
Estimates of the chronic shortfall range from $10 billion a year to as much as $30 billion. Last fall, the Legislative Analyst’s Office calculated that state spending was increasing by about 6% a year while revenue was rising by only 4%.
The current budget, enacted in June, had a $12 billion deficit that was closed by tapping into the state’s emergency reserves, borrowing from special funds, postponing some payments and adopting some bookkeeping gimmicks. For instance, the budget eliminates payments to reduce the state’s ever-growing unfunded obligations for retiree health care which reached $91.5 billion, up $6.3 billion from a year earlier, Controller Malia Cohen recently revealed.
The permanence of the deficit is one factor that’s fueling preliminary cogitating over a tax increase of some kind, which probably would have to be ratified by voters.
Another is the reduction of federal aid to states by President Donald Trump and Congress. Federal funds are more than a quarter of California’s $321 billion state budget and the cuts mostly hit health and welfare programs, such as Medi-Cal. Many are looking to Sacramento for money to offset federal reductions.
Finally, a surtax on incomes of California’s wealthiest families, approved by voters in 2012 to deal with an earlier budget deficit, was supposed to last only a few years, but a 2016 ballot measure extended it to 2030. Its backers — public employee unions particularly — are planning to seek either another extension or permanent status.
The Franchise Tax Board says revenue from the surtax spiked to more than $16 billion in 2021 — thanks to the odd economics of the COVID-19 pandemic — but returned to a more normal $9-10 billion a year since.
Californians already bear one of the nation’s highest tax burdens. Wallet Hub has calculated that California’s major state and local taxes are the fourth-highest of any state with an 11% total tax burden. 
So what kind of tax increase might be proposed? There aren’t a lot of options.
Another income tax hike would be unlikely since maintaining the surtax on high-income taxpayers is already virtually certain to be on the ballot, probably in 2028. Increasing the sales tax, already hovering around 10%, would hit low-income families the hardest.
That leaves corporate income taxes as the most likely target — a source that the California Budget & Policy Center, a left-leaning research nonprofit, has been touting for years. Citing federal aid reductions and cuts in federal taxes on corporations and wealthy taxpayers, the organization is trumpeting the closure of what it views as loopholes in the corporate tax system.
“Given the immense harms that will be done as a result of the recently enacted federal budget bill, state leaders must develop plans to significantly raise state revenues … in order to balance the state budget and protect California residents that are vulnerable to serious harms from the federal cuts to health care, food assistance, and other federal policies,” the organization declares in a compilation of federal reductions.
Clearly something has to give. California cannot continue to run up budget deficits as the reduction of federal aid compounds the state’s already precarious finances.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/042924-State-Capitol-Session-MG-CM-33.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-20 08:56:24.401154

MOUNT PLEASANT, S.C. — Tariff uncertainties dented cargo numbers at the Port of Charleston last month, although the drop was in line with State Ports Authority expectations.
And, overall, the maritime agency finished its most recent fiscal year with an increase in containers.
“We’ll see,” Barbara Melvin, the authority’s president and CEO, said when asked about the impact of the Trump administration’s wide-ranging and on-again, off-again tariffs on foreign imports.

“There has certainly been a responsiveness in importers to watch the implementation of tariff deals as well as what might come in the future,” Melvin said. “I think, just as in any economic cycle that we have endured, the port — because of our infrastructure investments — will come out on the strong side of that.”
The port finished fiscal 2025, which ended June 30, handling a little more than 1.4 million containers of all sizes – up 2.3% from the previous 12-month period.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
But in July, the first month of the new fiscal year, the port moved 117,059 cargo containers of all sizes through its terminals. That’s a nearly 6% drop from the same month a year ago.
Containers that arrived at the port loaded with goods declined by 7.5% year-over-year.
How all of that translates into money for South Carolina’s economic driver is unclear. The port’s financial numbers for the fiscal year will come out next month.
“I think that, obviously, there’s a substantial amount of uncertainty that we’re seeing” among shippers, Phil Padgett, the authority’s chief financial officer and vice president of administration, told the agency’s board of directors during a meeting Tuesday.
Depending on how tariffs play out, the port could see cargo levels land somewhere between an 8% loss and a 6% gain by the time the current fiscal year ends next June, according to an analysis by Joey Von Nessen, a research economist at the University of South Carolina.
The authority is projecting containerized cargo will be flat year-over-year.
Melvin said Charleston’s port could see import growth in the coming months as retailers look to stock their shelves with holiday-related merchandise. A 90-day pause in tariff hikes on Chinese goods, announced earlier this month, will likely help those numbers.
“Chinese imports have stayed steady during the first quarter of our fiscal year,” Melvin said.
Another boost could come from two new container line services that will start stopping at Charleston’s port in September.
Mediterranean Shipping Co. will add weekly calls on both its Albatross and Dragon services linking the port with stops in Europe, the Mediterranean and Asia. Ships on those routes can carry up to 15,000 cargo boxes measured in 20-foot equivalents.
The national outlook isn’t as bright. U.S. ports are expected to see a year-over-year 5.6% decline in imported cargo by the end of this year, according to the National Retail Federation and Hackett Associates, a maritime consultant.
“Tariffs are beginning to drive up consumer prices, and fewer imports will eventually mean fewer goods on store shelves,” Jonathan Gold, the federation’s vice president of supply chain and customs policy, said in a written statement. “Small businesses especially are grappling with the ability to stay in business.”
The forecast comes as tariffs on dozens of countries around the world that had been announced, postponed and then finally enacted after months of negotiations and deals began to take effect.
“Friends, allies and foes are all being hit by distortions in trade flows as importers try to second-guess tariff levels by pulling forward imports before the tariffs take effect,” analyst Ben Hackett said in a statement.
Hackett said the result will be “a downturn in trade volumes by late September because inventories for the holiday season will already be in hand.”

This story was originally published by CalMatters.
As Republicans lambasted California lawmakers for rushing through their effort to gerrymander the state’s congressional map, Democrats are facing a quieter angst in their own party.
To counter what they call President Donald Trump’s undemocratic power grab for Republican seats in Texas, they’re asking voters to temporarily ditch California’s nonpartisan map-drawing process — touted as a national gold standard for fair elections and good governance — in favor of a politico-drawn map to tilt seats in Democrats’ favor.
At the polls, they’ll have to overcome not just Republican opponents but also some Democrats and independent voters who say California shouldn’t respond to partisan gerrymandering in Texas with the same frowned-upon tactics at home.
“This is the kind of moral conflict that, if this goes to the ballot, that every California voter is going to be faced with,” said Sara Sadhawani, a political science professor, Democrat and former member of the state’s independent redistricting commission, at a hearing over the measures Tuesday.
Sadhawani helped draw the state’s existing congressional map when she sat on the commission alongside fellow Democrats, Republicans and independents after the 2020 Census. Now she’s one of Gov. Gavin Newsom’s partisan redistricting effort’s most vocal supporters.
Testifying in favor of the plan on Tuesday, she said lawmakers must respond to the “extreme attacks on our core democratic principles” in Texas and other red states that are considering redrawing their own maps.
“It brings me no joy to see the maps that we passed fairly by the Commission to be tossed aside,” she said. “I do believe this is a necessary step in a much bigger battle to shore up free and fair elections in our nation.”
But even as state- and congressional-level Democrats embrace the plan as their answer to voters clamoring for the party to put up a resistance to Trump, there are misgivings among Democrats statewide.
On the other side of the issue in the hearing rooms weren’t the Republicans who have vowed to fight Newsom through lawsuits and at the ballot box. Instead, opponents presented members of prior nonpartisan redistricting commissions: Jeanne Raya and Cynthia Dai, who are Democrats, and Connie Archbold Robinson, an independent, to testify against the measures.
“Our citizens in other parts of the country, who are being held hostage by politicians who do not represent their interests, have been looking to California as the alternative, as the model,” Robinson said. “If we gut the great work that we have been doing there, then not only do we lose our credibility, those efforts actually get stalled and get reversed.”
 Voters backed independent redistricting

Voters added the nonpartisan process for redrawing California’s political maps to the state constitution by a slim margin in 2008. In 2010 they approved using that same independent system to draw new congressional maps just as Republicans nationally campaigned to flip state legislatures for the purpose of drawing more GOP House seats in states like Wisconsin, North Carolina and Michigan.
Three other states use a similar process as California to draw congressional maps, but just over half of all states give that power directly to their legislatures, meaning the party in power can tilt seats to their advantage.
The current California congressional map gave Democrats a slight advantage. But while Trump and Vice President J.D. Vance have called the map unfair to the GOP,  Republicans in California have been, for the most part, satisfied with it. It maintained competitive districts that the GOP has been able to win or put up significant fights for — districts that will be eliminated under the partisan map voters will likely weigh in on this fall.
Statewide, Democratic voters outnumber Republicans nearly 2-to-1. Recent polling shows voters favor independent redistricting by about the same margin.
 California vs. Texas

To sell the redistricting measure to the public, Democrats have leaned heavily on framing it as a fight against Trump — and, ironically, in favor of fairer elections nationwide. In the state Senate elections committee, Democrats grilled the former map-drawers on whether it would ever be acceptable for them to draw new districts for political reasons and whether California ought to retaliate to discourage Texas’ efforts.
“Texas is actively reducing their own competitive seat count,” Sen. Sabrina Cervantes, a Riverside Democrat, said. “So then do you expect our communities to remain silent while their voices are being stripped away from Washington?”
Raya stressed she, too, opposed both the Trump administration and the Republican gerrymandering effort in Texas, which she called “reprehensible.”
“We’re living with … the despair that people have about the current political climate,” she said. “For me, this is not about declaring an emergency, and now, what do we do? This is, every day, we need to be doing something to make the system work and today what we need to do is protect the independent, nonpartisanship of drawing lines.”
But her fellow party members in the Senate said it’s not the time to go high.
“I will speak for myself, the conditions have been met for us to take action,” incoming Senate President Pro Tem Monique Limón, a Santa Barbara Democrat, said to the former commissioners. “I have utmost respect and recognition for the work that all of you do to protect our democracy.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/081925_Redistricting-Hearing_FG_CM_04-1024x682.webp,,,2025-08-20 11:58:40.105005

In the fall of 1925, agronomist Trofim Lysenko arrived on the dusty plains of what is now Azerbaijan, hoping to keep cows from starving to death over the winter. The young scientist, who learned to read as a teenager during the Russian Revolution, dismissed the rapidly advancing field of genetics. He believed nature could be bent to human will.
Lysenko denounced the idea that genes pass traits down as a “degradation of bourgeois culture,” and couldn’t understand why cows bred to produce more milk did so simply because they had “advantaged ancestors.” He attempted to “educate” crops by soaking them in freezing water, thinking that could force them to sprout in winter, and insisted that orange trees would grow in Siberia if exposed to the right stimuli.
Such ideas catapulted Lysenko to the head of Soviet agriculture under Stalin. In the midst of the famine his catastrophic policies helped create, Lysenko banned fertilizers and demanded farmers sow seeds close together, believing that plants of the same species wouldn’t compete.
Lysenko’s pseudoscientific ideas outraged his peers. Nikolai Vavilov, a Russian botanist who founded the world’s first seed bank, openly challenged his rejection of genetics. Lysenko denounced him, and the secret police arrested him in 1940. Vavilov, who had worked to prevent famines, starved to death in jail three years later.
This kind of scientific misinformation and the consequences it can bring now sound eerily familiar to U.S. climate experts like Shaina Sadai. She has been stunned by how quickly politics have overshadowed science since President Trump took office. The most recent government climate report, which the Department of Energy released last month, for instance, so drastically misrepresented the studies it cited that the researchers whose work it drew from publicly decried it. “I’m just really having a hard time with the barrage of apocalypses every day,” she said.
Sadai spent the last several years working international court cases, including a climate case law students from the South Pacific brought to the International Court of Justice. Over 130 countries signed on, and many outlined the existential threats they face from extreme heat, flooding, and other weather phenomena. Some, like Palau — which could see large portions of its land vanish beneath rising seas this century — argued that failing to curb emissions violates human rights under international treaties. Meanwhile, the United States urged the court not to overreach. This galled Sadai, who advised several of the countries supporting Vanuatu’s case, including Sierra Leone and Namibia. “I want so desperately for my country to be on the right side of things,” she said. Instead, Judge Yuji Iwasawa delivered the court’s decision that countries must act on climate change the same day the U.S. moved to weaken one of its primary tools to do just that.
The timing underscored a growing global divide: As the world moves toward greater climate accountability, the United States is pulling back, once again exiting the Paris agreement and undercutting decades of environmental regulations. This retreat comes amid a broader weakening of democratic norms, said Timothy Frye, a professor of post-Soviet politics at Columbia University. When power becomes heavily concentrated, protections begin to fray, something seen with recent revisions to the Endangered Species Act or key provisions of the Clean Water Act. “The U.S. democratic erosion is happening much faster, and along a much wider array of fronts, than a lot of the more recent cases,” like Turkey or Venezuela, he said.
***
One hallmark of this backsliding is how seemingly small changes can accumulate into a system that becomes far more autocratic. The piecemeal approach often borrows the most authoritarian elements from otherwise democratic governments, though each policy may appear initially defensible — a form of governance political scholar Kim Scheppele coined “the Frankenstate.” The Trump administration, for example, has declared an “energy emergency” which allows federal agencies to bypass environmental reviews and fast-track fossil fuel projects. The move is now facing a lawsuit from 15 states, who claim the emergency is fake.
This patchwork strategy makes it easier for politically connected companies to sidestep or shape laws to serve their interests. After soliciting $1 billion in campaign funding from oil and gas companies, for example, Trump has signed $18 billion in tax incentives for the industry and granted at least $6 billion in tax breaks. “The lack of constraints on the executive allow politically connected companies to either get around existing laws or to write laws in such a way that they’re toothless,” Frye said.
Autocratic leaders, he explained, like to build their economies around natural resources because they are easier to control than service or technology industries. Oil and gas firms, for instance, tend to be less transparent and less mobile, making them more susceptible to political pressure. At the same time, Frye noted, the economic clout of natural resource companies often turns into a political advantage.
One of Trump’s biggest donors this year was billionaire Kelcy Warren and his pipeline company Energy Transfer — the firm that sparked mass protests at Standing Rock. In 2025, it contributed $25 million to MAGA Inc., the super-PAC backing Trump. Soon after, the president lifted a pause on liquefied natural gas exports, clearing the way for an Energy Transfer project in Louisiana. The company is also now suing the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, challenging how the agency enforces its rules; a victory could give major Trump donors greater control over how their industries are regulated.
The pattern of placing industry-friendly figures in key roles extends to Lee Zeldin, who leads the Environmental Protection Agency. He also has longstanding ties to the fossil fuel business. Over the years, Zeldin received around $300,000 in campaign contributions from oil and gas companies, and before joining the agency he was a top executive at the America First Policy Institute, a group co-founded and funded by fracking billionaire Tim Dunn. Under Zeldin, the EPA has enacted sweeping changes: In March, it announced its intention to roll back dozens of rules, including limits on power plant emissions, coal ash disposal, and wetland protections, in what Zeldin called “the largest deregulatory announcement in U.S. history.”
Zeldin’s latest target is the EPA’s landmark endangerment finding, a legal basis for regulating greenhouse gases. He claimed repealing it would “end $1 trillion or more in hidden taxes on American businesses and families.” The Clean Air Act clearly says such costs can’t be considered in the process. To do so, the agency would have to reject established climate science and overturn a 2007 Supreme Court case that required the EPA to make decisions based on scientific evidence.
Christine Todd Whitman, a Republican who led the EPA under President George W. Bush, said Zeldin’s approach undermines the agency’s mission. “There’s more leniency for industry now,” she said. “This administration is doing nothing to improve the environment. What they’re doing is improving the bottom line of a lot of corporations.”
This is happening across the federal government, where institutions once trusted to provide objective oversight and data are being reshaped to serve the president’s goals. A nonprofit tracking alterations to environmental regulations on federal websites has recorded 879 revisions, many involving omissions and erasures. The Energy Department, for instance, has taken previous national climate assessments offline and suggested that it would rewrite them. This makes the United States a global outlier: Even in Russia, said political scientist Thane Gustafson, there’s less politicization of climate science, where “the climate change narrative is accepted, all the way from Putin on down.”
***
Much like during Lysenko’s era, when Soviet policies dismissed scientific integrity, political scientists like Frye now worry that American federal institutions are drifting from their foundational principles. There’s a gnawing feeling that the systems meant to protect us are rotting. What once felt stable begins to feel staged. This kind of dissonance has a name: hypernormalization. Coined by anthropologist Alexei Yurchak after studying post-Soviet Russia, it conveys the feeling that governing bodies have been stripped of real power. “That describes the EPA at the moment,” said Whitman.
The old standards of government have been swiftly gutted. Trump officials fired advisory panels that interpret science, overturned longstanding environmental regulations, dispensed with public comment periods, and centralized authority. What’s taking shape now is a shift not just in who holds power, but how that power is wielded.
The White House has a unique authority to manage and share facts. This ability to shape public perception operates largely beyond the reach of the law — as became clear when Trump abruptly fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics just hours after a disappointing jobs report, or when he planned to close the observatory that monitors carbon dioxide levels at Mauna Loa, one of the world’s most important sites for tracking climate change.
Losing belief in government is perilous: It makes disengaging feel like the only choice. “In an ever-changing, incomprehensible world, the masses had reached the point where they would, at the same time, believe everything and nothing, think that everything was possible and that nothing was true,” Hannah Arendt wrote in “The Origins of Totalitarianism.”
As what’s real and what’s purported to be real grows increasingly blurred, controlling the narrative can become more powerful than governing. The White House is taking this principle literally: After Paramount paid President Trump millions to settle his lawsuit against 60 Minutes, the administration approved its merger on the condition CBS install a “truth-arbiter” to monitor its coverage. Anna Gomez, the lone FCC commissioner appointed by a Democrat, objected, saying, “no government — regardless of party — gets to decide what is true, who gets heard, or which voices are silenced.” Similar mechanisms of control are being applied to the flow of federal dollars, with political appointees now deciding which research and science projects move forward.
Perhaps the most eerie part of living through the last six months is how these kinds of disquieting developments continue to unfold beneath a veneer of normalcy. While he’s deeply concerned about the country’s future, Frye said that, on a daily basis, competitive autocracies can look quite normal. Though he’s better placed than most to recognize the warning signs, he still has classes to teach, deadlines to meet. “Life goes on,” he said. Looming threats become banal, both impossible to ignore and somehow routine. “It’s usually not the case that there’s one point in time when you can point and say, ‘Ah, this is when we became an autocracy,’” he said.
Sadai, like many, is finding the discord hard to overcome. She’s unemployed and struggling to find a new academic job, thanks to federal budget cuts. She tries to find refuge in taking breaks to spend time in the New England woods that remind her of what she’s trying to protect. But when she returns, her phone lights up with notifications about people being abducted off the streets by masked government agents, or reports of coal-fired power plants receiving exemptions from air regulations. “It’s become so much harder to put everything aside for a few minutes and not have just a barrage of intrusive thoughts.”
“I just have to sit there, and break down, and then pull myself together,” she said. Though it often feels inadequate, she’s spending her days working through publication reviews and job applications, clinging to the hope that her life’s work might still contribute to climate policy, even as her elected leaders turn away.
Naming the collapse is the first step toward resistance. The question is whether we can see the failure clearly enough to imagine what comes next. “I don’t know what else to do but keep trying,” Sadai said.

Moore is right to protect Maryland’s offshore wind progress,Liz Burdock,,,,,https://marylandmatters.org/2025/08/20/gov-moore-is-right-to-protect-marylands-offshore-wind-progress/,"Despite federal interference and local opposition, plans for offshore wind are already benefiting Maryland in the form or new jobs, writes Liz Burdock, not to mention the long-term benefits of clean, renewable energy.","An Ørsted wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island. (Photo courtesy of Ørsted)When the federal government earlier this month tried to stall Maryland’s progress on offshore wind, the Moore administration refused to back down. Instead, they stood firm, defending the state’s permit for US Wind’s clean energy project and refusing to let bureaucratic interference derail one of Maryland’s most promising tools to address surging energy demand and rising energy costs while driving economic growth.
By rejecting pressure from the Environmental Protection Agency, Moore’s team made clear that Marylanders will not let Washington dictate our path to a clean energy future.
As Maryland families and businesses face higher electricity bills driven by increasing demand and limited supply, developing reliable offshore wind with stable, long-term pricing is more important than ever. US Wind’s project will provide a significant influx of homegrown energy to meet the rising demand while acting as a key driver for a rapidly expanding local supply chain and workforce, including their plans to invest more than $300 million to establish Maryland’s first permanent offshore wind manufacturing facility in Baltimore County — Sparrows Point Steel.
Already, Maryland is seeing significant economic benefits from our offshore wind leadership. To date, the offshore wind supply chain has brought over $815 million in investments to the state, which includes millions of dollars to redevelop Baltimore County’s industrial waterfront for offshore wind steel manufacturing and component staging, a high-voltage cable manufacturing facility in Baltimore City, an additional $25 million in public funding to strengthen the state’s union workforce, and $11 million toward environmental research through the University of Maryland.

These investments are more than just numbers. They mean thousands of jobs and long-term economic resilience across the state. Baltimore is becoming a hub for heavy industry again, with manufacturing sites producing cables, foundations and other steel components for the offshore energy industry.
Ocean City is the natural home to operations and maintenance facilities that will support the industry for decades to come. Tradepoint Atlantic is growing into a key asset in the development and deployment of offshore wind projects across the East Coast. Crystal Steel Fabricators invested in upgrades at their facility and employs skilled machine tool operators, pipe fitters, 6G pipe welders and coating craftsmen to build boat landings and other secondary steel components at its Federalsburg facility.
More than 70 companies with offices, factories, or warehouses in the Old Line State already have contracts in the offshore wind industry, including those supplying fabricated steel, personal protective equipment, customs logistics and consulting services. These companies represent just a fraction of the 543 businesses with Maryland locations, employing hardworking Marylanders, and paying Maryland taxes registered in Oceantic Network’s Supply Chain Connect database that have expressed interest in joining the growing offshore wind supply chain — a supply chain that spans 40 states and supports $25.5 billion in domestic investments.
This pipeline of businesses will only continue to grow as more components of the offshore wind economy take root in Maryland, creating thousands of well-paying, family-supporting jobs in communities across our state.
Moore’s commitment comes at a critical moment. With global supply chains under pressure and clean energy goals looming, states that move decisively will become national leaders.
Maryland is already ahead of the curve, building one of the strongest offshore wind supply chains anywhere in the United States. By holding the line and ensuring progress on offshore wind, Moore is not only fighting for Maryland’s clean-energy future, but also protecting a critical economic engine for our state.
Press headlines have declared offshore wind “officially” dead, but it is not 6 feet under. The bureaucracy is maddening, but it isn’t fatal. We’re simply stuck in a loop of recycled roadblocks dressed up as breaking news.
Yet, while the paperwork shuffles and the fingers steeple, steel keeps hitting the water. Five utility-scale projects – nearly 6 gigawatts – are under construction right now from Virginia to Massachusetts, a build pace that rivals other global markets.
And here in Maryland, offshore wind is on track to supply thousands of jobs, hundreds of millions in investments, and enough clean, homegrown energy to power millions of homes and businesses for decades to come.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Block_Island_five_turbines-1-1024x798.jpeg,,,2025-08-20 07:56:20.330810

The Trump administration has threatened the city over its sanctuary policies. City officials say some officers violated the policy by assisting in the arrests. (Photo courtesy of City of Rochester)The Trump administration is once again pressuring liberal cities and states to cooperate with deportation efforts, despite previous setbacks in court.
Attorney General Pam Bondi sent letters last week telling sanctuary states, cities and counties that “you better be abiding by our federal policies and with our federal law enforcement, because if you aren’t, we’re going to come after you,” she said in a Fox News interview. She demanded the areas answer her by Tuesday.
Cities and states with so-called sanctuary policies generally refuse to assist with immigration raids or accede to requests for local jails to hold prisoners for deportation. Those that responded to Stateline’s questions about the letters said they were not inclined to change their positions about cooperation with immigration authorities.
“It’s the tactic of a bully. And the only way to deal with a bully is to let them know that they’re not going to intimidate you,” Rhode Island Democratic Attorney General Peter Neronha said in a statement.
The Trump administration is attempting to force more cooperation with immigration arrests. But it suffered a serious court reversal on July 25, when a federal judge dismissed a sanctuary policies case against Illinois, Chicago and Cook County.
The state and local policies reflect a “decision to not participate in enforcing civil immigration law — a decision protected by the Tenth Amendment,” Judge Lindsay Jenkins wrote in an order now under appeal.
Bondi’s letters follow the Justice Department’s Aug. 5 release of a list of sanctuary jurisdictions including 12 states, the District of Columbia, four counties and 18 cities. That’s fewer jurisdictions than the 14 states and almost 500 counties and cities that appeared on an earlier list, which the agency withdrew after criticism that it included conservative counties that were fully cooperating with immigration enforcement.
The states on the new list are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington state. The list also includes some counties and cities in those states as well as in Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New Mexico.


It’s the tactic of a bully. And the only way to deal with a bully is to let them know that they’re not going to intimidate you.


– Rhode Island Democratic Attorney General Peter Neronha 


Other federal courts have issued injunctions to at least temporarily stop Trump administration from withholding unrelated federal funding from governments that don’t cooperate on immigration. Cities, counties and states have filed lawsuits challenging Trump’s executive orders targeting sanctuary policies, including a February order that federal payments to states and localities must not “by design or effect, facilitate the subsidization or promotion of illegal immigration, or abet so-called ‘sanctuary’ policies that seek to shield illegal aliens from deportation.”
“The executive orders are directing agencies to basically take a maximalist approach to putting pressure on local governments to cooperate with immigration [enforcement], even though they’re not required to do so by federal law,” said Jonathan Miller, one of the attorneys working on the California case for the Public Rights Project, a California-based group promoting civil rights protections for states and cities.
One city on the administration’s list was Rochester, New York, which disciplined some police officers for helping federal agents make a March arrest in the city. The city already faces a lawsuit brought by the Trump administration that prominently mentions the arrest of three men from Guatemala; one of whom has since pleaded guilty to re-entering the United States after a previous deportation.

A spokesperson for the city, Barbara Pierce, said in a statement to The Guardian that, “Nothing in Attorney General Bondi’s letter is new and none of it has legal merit.”
“The letter reiterates many of the frivolous arguments that the federal government has already made in its pending suit against the city of Rochester,” she added. “These same arguments were levied against the city of Chicago and were dismissed by the federal district court for the eastern district of Illinois nearly a month ago.”
Ally Sullivan, a spokesperson for Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis, said in a statement that Colorado “is not a sanctuary state. The Governor continues to be frustrated by this mistaken and incorrect label.” In a televised interview earlier this year, Polis pointed out that Colorado fully cooperates with federal authorities on criminal matters. Immigration, he said, is a civil matter.
“In Colorado, we are improving public safety, apprehending dangerous criminals, cooperating with federal law enforcement on criminal investigations, and keeping our communities safe,” Sullivan said.
Nevertheless, Colorado faces a federal lawsuit brought by the administration over its alleged sanctuary policies. Polis signed a measure in May that limits local law enforcement’s communication with federal immigration authorities and restricts where federal authorities can operate within schools, child care facilities, hospitals and libraries without a judicial warrant.

Connecticut Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont in a statement said the state’s Trust Act, which the Trump administration has targeted as a sanctuary policy, was passed with bipartisan support and helps ensure local police concentrate on serious crimes. The Trust Act, passed in 2013 and expanded in 2019, limits information sharing and compliance with requests to detain immigrants for federal immigration authorities.
“Nothing about this makes Connecticut a sanctuary in any legal or practical sense — it makes our state one that upholds the Constitution, respects the rule of law, and prioritizes the safety and well-being of our communities,” Lamont said.

Mike Braun took 11 helicopter trips with ISP over the last six months. (Indiana State Police)Sunday, May 26 was a pretty special day for Indiana Gov. Mike Braun. The state’s top executive spent his time at “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing,” punctuated by an appearance on Fox and Friends to recap his first legislative session as governor.
But rather than returning to the Governor’s Residence in Indianapolis, just a 20-minute drive from the track, Braun apparently drove to his Jasper family home two-and-a-half hours away.
And the next day, he took a helicopter ride to get back to the state capital.
The trip was one of 11 flights between March 13 and August 1 chronicled in response to a public records request submitted by the Indiana Capital Chronicle, totaling $23,880. The state said that it would have “incurred” those costs whether or not Braun had used the Indiana State Police helicopter, because those flight hours were necessary “to satisfy (the Federal Aviation Administration’s) mandated hours requirements.”

Though the FAA has established standards for pilots to maintain their licenses, the Indiana State Police has its own requirements for pilots to regularly travel on top of that.

“The Indiana State Police expects 1-3 hours of flight time per week per helicopter pilot,” said Griffin Reid, a spokesperson for Braun’s office. “Transportation decisions are made based on a number of factors.”
Eight of those trips ended at Braun’s southern Indiana home in Jasper, where the state paid $1,745.55 to install a 20-foot-by-20-foot gravel pad earlier this year. The remaining three flights transported the governor from Jasper to Indianapolis.
A member of his security detail accompanied him on every trip while his wife, Maureen, joined on only one trip.
Though Braun never flew on Sundays, he used the transit option at least once on every other day of the week. Each flight hour cost approximately $1,200.  A helicopter flight between Jasper and Indianapolis takes roughly 45 minutes, according to the office.
Braun is the first governor to reside outside of central Indiana as governor in recent history. Former Govs. Eric Holcomb and Mike Pence made the governor’s residence in Indianapolis their primary home — with Pence selling his Columbus home after becoming governor — while former Gov. Mitch Daniels split his time between that building and his home in Carmel.
But where did he go?
Braun first flew from Indianapolis to Jasper on March 13, one day before the Indiana Capital Chronicle publicized the taxpayer-funded helipad at his Jasper home. Two weeks later, also on a Thursday, he again used a helicopter to get from Indianapolis to Jasper.
His April 16 flight to Jasper was preceded by several public appearances the day before, including a press event with U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., signing the state’s effort to reform property taxes into law and the Perry Township Lincoln Day Dinner.
But neither his public releases nor his social media indicates his plans for April 16, the day he flew. The next day, a Thursday, he met with the Borden High School girls’ basketball team, the 2025 state champions, and attended another Lincoln Day Dinner in New Albany.
He flew two more times in April, starting both trips in Jasper and ending in Indianapolis. The first was Monday, April 21 — the day after Easter — while the next, on Tuesday, April 29, occurred one day before he celebrated 100 days in office.
None of Braun’s social media accounts indicated why he went to Angola in northern Indiana on Saturday, May 3. However, Trine University reports that Braun delivered the keynote address during commencement that day at 10 a.m. He opted to fly back to Jasper, bypassing the four-plus hour drive.
Two weeks later, Braun attended the Brickyard Breakfast in Indianapolis with the First Lady before flying back to Jasper on May 17. His next trip, on Monday, May 26, came one day after the Indianapolis 500.

Braun only flew once each of the following three months: Thursday, June 26; Friday, July 11; and Friday, Aug. 1.
Braun posted about his June visit with Israeli Consul General Yinam Cohen “to explore ways we can deepen collaboration and strengthen ties between Indiana and Israel,” flying back to Jasper later that day.
July 11 was one of the rare trips that didn’t originate in either Jasper or Indianapolis, but rather in the township of Culver. The northwestern township is roughly 64 miles, or just under 90 minutes, where he had a ceremonial bill signing earlier that day in Lake County.

(Getty Images)Vice President J.D. Vance recently visited Indiana to meet with Gov. Mike Braun and Republican leaders. They discussed a plan to redraw the state’s congressional districts this year, mid-decade, in order to gain one or both of the seats currently held by Indiana Democrats and rig the 2026 mid-terms so Republicans can preserve their very slim House majority.
We are scholars and teachers of U.S. law and politics. And we are deeply troubled by the Trump administration’s attempt to rewrite the electoral rules mid-stream to maximize its power, and by Indiana Republicans’ failure to immediately reject such a transparently partisan move, which would corrupt the fairness of our elections. Whatever our party affiliation, all Hoosiers should care about fairness. We would never support changing the rules in the middle of a basketball game so that our team would gain unfair advantage. We want winners to win fair and square. In sports, and in politics.
Such corruption is possible because the process whereby Congressional districts are created is localized and susceptible to being rigged by those bent on gaining an unfair partisan advantage.
According to the U.S. Constitution, Congress allocates seats in the House of Representatives to states based on population. A census must be taken within every ten years to determine how population shifts may change the number of Congressional districts allocated to each state — a process called reapportionment. The actual shape of Congressional districts in each state is determined by state legislation.
Indiana’s House GOP congressional contingent lines up behind redistricting effort

In 1964, the Supreme Court ruled that Congressional districts must be of roughly equal population and honor the principle of “one person, one vote.”  Since then, Congressional redistricting has almost always been done on the ten-year cycle, except when federal courts have required certain states to redraw their maps to bring them into compliance with federal election law.
But now Texas Republicans are trying to redraw their Congressional map mid-decade. The reason why: because President Trump has very publicly called upon them to do this, telling CNBC’s Squawk Box: “We have an opportunity in Texas to pick up five seats. We have a really good governor, and we have good people in Texas. And I won Texas . . . and we are entitled to five more seats.”
It should be obvious that Trump’s vote total in the 2024 presidential election confers no GOP entitlement to extra House seats, which are not allocated based on presidential popularity (indeed, while Trump only received 56% of the 2024 Presidential vote, the Texas GOP controls 66% of the state’s House seats). If the party wants five more seats in Texas or two more in Indiana, then the correct way to obtain them is to run strong candidates in districts currently held by Democrats, and win the elections in those districts, fair and square.
The administration’s push for Texas, Indiana, and other “red” states to redistrict now has one very clear purpose: to change the electoral map, midstream, so that Trump and his party can retain control of the entire federal government by giving more power to voters they like while taking electoral power away from voters they don’t like.
And that is simply not fair.
Hoosier citizens, and not statehouse Republicans, should choose who they want to represent them in their congressional districts in 2026 and 2028 and 2030. And they can freely choose only if the elections are fair. Any party that tries to try to change district boundaries in advance of an election just so they have a better chance of winning the election is doing something that has a simple name: cheating.
Basketball coach John Wooden, a legendary Hoosier, famously taught his players to “never lie, never cheat, never steal.”
Indiana Republicans should heed coach Wooden’s famous words, politely refuse to do the bidding of the Trump administration, and stand tall, with their Democratic counterparts, and all patriotic Hoosiers, in defense of the fairness of our elections.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/redandbluewhitehouse-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-20 07:56:20.330810

The law, signed by Gov. Mike Kehoe in July, requires school districts to set a policy barring students from using mobile devices except for in emergencies or when instructed by a teacher. And with most students returning to classrooms this week, districts have been warning parents about the new expectations.
“I don’t know any district that’s fighting this,” Susan Goldammer, policy chief for the Missouri School Boards’ Association, told The Independent. “Most of the folks that I’ve spoken to are secretly quite happy that they have a little bit of additional authority to explain to parents why (devices) are not allowed.”

Goldammer wrote the association’s model policy that many Missouri school boards have personalized and adopted within the last month. Districts have asked about details, like exceptions for students with medical issues requiring access to cell phones, but they are largely ready to start the school year with the new policy.
Some Missouri districts already had bans on cell phones, while others were considering adding restrictions. For them, the law is a welcome addition and helps fight any pushback from parents and students.
“I have been surprised at how easy it was for districts to do this, and I can’t help but think that’s because all of the adults now are realizing it is not good to have the kind of electronic connectivity that kids have all the time,” Goldammer said.
The law is more restrictive than other states by banning cell phone usage throughout the entire school day instead of only during instructional time. But it allows for some nuances, giving districts the ability to choose how to enforce the policy and how devices will be stored.
Most districts have told parents that smartwatches are barred, citing the law’s ban of any “portable device that is used to initiate, receive, store, or view communication, information, images or data electronically.”
The Rockwood School District in Eureka, in a message to parents, indicated that it wasn’t completely banning smartwatches but that it expects students “to only use their smartwatch for the purpose of keeping time and not for communication purposes during school hours.”
The North Kansas City School District, though, will restrict all uses of smartwatches. The district included the question “Can my student wear their smartwatch if they aren’t using it for communication?” on its website, telling parents that smartwatches are barred but fitness trackers without message capabilities are allowed.
Districts also have different expectations on how devices will be stowed, though most are allowing students to have their devices turned off in their backpacks.
St. Louis Public Schools’ board of education approved a policy that allows for each school to choose its phone-collection method. 
“This flexibility acknowledges the diverse operational needs and preferences expressed by elementary and secondary staff and families,” Superintendent Millicent Borishade wrote in her August newsletter.
In its Aug. 12 meeting, the board also approved the purchase of locking phone pouches from Yondr for Gateway STEM High School at a cost of $40,000.
Goldammer anticipates that more districts will be considering purchasing phone-storage systems and evolving their policies before next school year. With a little over a month between the law’s passage and the first day of school, districts had time to set policies, but many were not able to make large purchases that quickly, she said.
But for now, administrators will be working on the best ways to execute the policy.
“There will be a learning curve,” Goldammer said. “There will be kids that break the rules. There always are.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/girls-with-phones-scaled-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-20 07:56:20.330810

(Laurel Demkovich/Washington State Standard)A woman who worked previously for Washington’s Department of Natural Resources is suing the agency and former state lands commissioner Hilary Franz, accusing them of allowing a top attorney at the department to carry out a campaign of harassment, intimidation and abuse against her.
Franz is accused of protecting former Department of Natural Resources General Counsel Daniel Teimouri by failing to intervene after Bailey Boyd, then-deputy director of external affairs, reported that Teimouri was abusing her. Teimouri and Boyd were dating at the time. 
Franz is also accused of retaliating against Boyd by drastically reducing her job responsibilities after she reported the abuse. 
Boyd, represented by HKM Employment Attorneys LLP, filed suit against Franz and the Department of Natural Resources in King County Superior Court on July 24. 
Boyd is seeking unspecified compensation for economic damages and for “pain and suffering, mental anguish, emotional distress, and humiliation” as well as reasonable attorneys fees and costs.
A trial is scheduled for July 27, 2026. 
The Department of Natural Resources declined to comment on ongoing litigation. 
Franz denied the allegations in an emailed statement last week. 
“Anyone who knows me and my work representing survivors of domestic violence knows these claims are untrue. I am confident that the truth will prevail,” Franz said. 
Franz served as Washington’s commissioner of public lands from January 2017 to January 2025. In 2023, she began to run for governor, then dropped out of that race and vied unsuccessfully last year for an open U.S. House seat in the 6th Congressional District.
Teimouri served as general counsel for the Department of Natural Resources from October 2022 to May 2024, when he voluntarily resigned to accept another job, according to the lawsuit. 
Teimouri could not be reached through his attorney for comment, but his attorney has previously stated that the lawsuit “contains a multitude of false allegations.”
Boyd was in a romantic relationship with Teimouri between September 2023 and July 2024, according to the lawsuit. 
Boyd described her relationship with Teimouri as physically, sexually and emotionally abusive, with Teimouri frequently threatening to get Boyd fired from her job if she did not comply with his demands. 
The complaint says Boyd reported the abuse to Franz during a dinner event on Feb. 2, 2024 and showed Franz some of the threatening text messages she had received from Teimouri. 
Franz allegedly responded by telling Boyd that Teimouri engaged in similar behavior with his previous girlfriend, who also worked under Franz at the Department of Natural Resources. 
Boyd said she again reported the ongoing abuse to Franz on March 9, 2024, after Teimouri allegedly hit her multiple times. 
Boyd called Franz instead of the police immediately after the incident out of fear of losing her job, according to the lawsuit. Teimouri allegedly took the phone from Boyd while she was on the phone with Franz and threw Boyd down the stairs in retaliation. 
In addition to taking no steps to intervene, Boyd alleges that Franz reduced her responsibilities at the department. 
Teimouri’s job duties, however, were not changed after Boyd reported the abuse, the lawsuit alleges. 
Even after Teimouri left the Department of Natural Resources, he continued threatening to get Boyd fired through his relationship with Franz’s chief of staff, Boyd’s lawsuit claims. 
Franz denied that Boyd ever reported the abuse to her, calling the allegations “false and completely unsubstantiated.” 
Teimouri was arrested for attempting to suffocate Boyd on July 13, 2024, at which point Boyd said she was able to escape the relationship. 
At the time of Teimouri’s arrest, officers documented a black eye Boyd received when Teimouri allegedly assaulted her on July 3. 
Police records indicate that Boyd told officers she didn’t report the July 3 assault to police because “she was afraid it would ruin Teimouri’s career.” 
Boyd reportedly told officers that Teimouri had a history of aggression and violence towards her, saying his abuse increased around December of 2023, when he reportedly stopped using marijuana. 
Teimouri was reportedly drunk at the time of the July 13 incident, which officers noted “may have been a contributing factor to his behavior.” 
When interviewed by officers, Teimouri reportedly described his relationship with Boyd as “good at times and tumultuous at times.” 
Boyd reported that most executive management employees at the Department of Natural Resources expressed sympathy to her about Teimouri’s abuse following his arrest. But Boyd said Franz never spoke to her about Teimouri after his arrest and continued to retaliate against her by not allowing her to travel or join meetings. 
Franz’s retaliatory behavior continued until her time as lands commissioner ended in January, Boyd claims in the lawsuit. 
Boyd left her position with the Department of Natural Resources around the same time. 
She could not be reached through her attorney for comment on this case.
Teimouri pleaded guilty on April 14, in Olympia Municipal Court to one count of fourth-degree assault, domestic violence. 
He was sentenced to 60 days on electronic home monitoring, with an additional 302 days of jail time suspended for five years. 
He was also ordered to pay a $1,358 fine and complete a domestic violence treatment program. 
A no-contact order preventing Teimouri from having any contact with Boyd for the next five years is in effect.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_6443-scaled-e1698268388674-1024x792.jpeg,,,2025-08-20 07:56:20.330810

Like many Minnesotans, I’ve experienced health challenges in recent years. I was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent chemotherapy and radiation. The complications of my cancer diagnosis and treatment left me with severe pain. I have to take medicine seven times a day just to manage that pain. Without Medicaid, I wouldn’t have been able to survive the treatment. And without SNAP, I wouldn’t have had the strength to fight for my life.
For 14 years, I worked at the Salvation Army in Duluth, helping neighbors get back on their feet. Before that, I was a retail worker, a teacher’s aide for kids with autism, and a librarian. I’ve spent my life taking care of people. Now, after everything, it feels like my country is turning its back on me.
With the passage of the GOP mega-law, President Donald Trump and members of Congress are making huge cuts to the very programs that have kept me going. Medicaid paid for my surgeries, doctor visits, and every prescription during cancer treatment. It still covers my medications and regular checkups to keep me healthy and make sure the cancer doesn’t return. Losing that coverage would mean no access to an oncologist, no pain medication and no way to afford the pills that keep me alive.
SNAP helps me access the food my body needs. Since retiring, I’ve lived on just over $800 a month in Social Security benefits. That barely leaves enough to cover rent, food, clothing, and other necessary bills. I receive $113 in SNAP benefits per month, which is about $3.74 per day. It’s not enough, but it helps. I don’t buy junk food and always shop the sales. Still, I spend another $100 of my own money on groceries every month.
When I got cancer, I applied for SNAP so I could afford fruit, vegetables, dairy and meat. The foods that help keep me healthy aren’t cheap. If my benefits are cut again, I’ll be forced to live on less healthy, microwaveable meals. A healthy diet isn’t optional when you’re recovering from cancer. It’s part of survival.
It’s not just me. In Minnesota, nearly 1.3 million people rely on Medicaid. Another 400,000 count on SNAP to keep food on the table every month. These are seniors like me, kids and people working long hours at jobs that barely cover the bills. No one chooses to struggle like this. We’re doing the best we can with what little we have.
Medicaid and SNAP aren’t luxuries. They are the reason I’m still here. I’m grateful for the support I’ve received, but that doesn’t mean I feel safe. Cuts are coming, and with them, the threat of losing everything I’ve fought so hard to hold onto.
I’m not just scared — I’m angry. And now I’m using my voice to speak out. Because the loss of these programs will diminish the opportunities for millions of Americans like me to live with dignity, health and hope.
While thankfully our senators voted against these cuts, U.S. Rep. Pete Stauber of the 8th District is celebrating kicking people off these life saving programs. Now he’s prancing around Minnesota during the Congressional August recess as if he didn’t just throw millions of us under the bus.

(Danielle Richards for New Jersey Monitor)Hoboken is rejecting a call by the Trump administration to rescind its sanctuary policy for undocumented immigrants, saying the White House’s position on this is “egregious” and “distressing.”
The move comes a week after U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi told states, counties, and towns nationwide that their sanctuary policies “thwart federal immigration enforcement” and threatened officials who support them with criminal charges. The letter came amid a push by President Donald Trump to detain and deport millions of undocumented immigrants.
“As the nation witnesses the tearing apart of families, inhumane treatment of human beings, and unlawful detention of children, Hoboken will not bend its knee in response to the lawlessness of federal immigration authorities,” Hoboken Mayor Ravi Bhalla wrote Tuesday in response to the Aug. 13 letter from Bondi.
The Department of Justice published a list two weeks ago of jurisdictions nationwide that have passed sanctuary laws and threatened to bring litigation against them. Hoboken, Jersey City, Newark, and Paterson are on the list (all four were already being sued in federal court by the Trump administration over these policies).
At least three of them received Bondi’s Aug. 13 letter, which ordered them to end their sanctuary policies and gave them until Tuesday to confirm in writing their “commitment to complying with federal law” and identify any initiatives they are undertaking to eliminate laws and policies that impede immigration enforcement.

“For too long, so-called sanctuary jurisdiction policies have undermined this necessary cooperation and obstructed federal immigration enforcement, giving aliens cover to perpetrate crimes in our communities and evade the immigration consequences that federal law requires,” Bondi wrote. 
The Trump administration has moved to slash federal funds and grants to jurisdictions that refuse to cooperate. On Monday, New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin joined a lawsuit filed by states alleging the administration is improperly blocking federal grants intended for victims and witnesses of crime because of the states’ sanctuary policies.
Since Trump took office in January for his second term and promised to crack down on illegal immigration, immigration arrests have doubled, and the number of people in detention has skyrocketed.
Bhalla, a Democrat who became Hoboken’s mayor in 2018, issued an executive order then that restricts when city officials and police can cooperate with federal immigration agents, an order known as the “fair and welcoming city” designation. Bhalla said the Trump administration’s claims about it are “completely false and without merit.”
“We will not capitulate to your demand that we rescind our policies, and in this case our morals and values,” wrote Bhalla, who is seeking a state Assembly seat in November.
The city will revise the policies if needed, he added, but only to ensure Hoboken residents are not subjected to unlawful immigration enforcement.  
Jersey City, Newark, and Paterson officials did not respond to requests for comment.
Other cities around the country had a similar message for Bondi as Bhalla. Washington Governor Bob Ferguson said his state “will not be bullied” and Boston Mayor Michelle Wu said the city would “never back down.”
The debate over illegal immigration has roiled New Jersey. Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-10) is facing assault charges over accusations that she assaulted officers while they were arresting Newark Mayor Ras Baraka in May. Detainees rioted over poor conditions at Newark’s Delaney Hall, the first immigration detention center to open during Trump’s second term. Acting U.S. Attorney Alina Habba has said she is investigating Gov. Phil Murphy and Platkin over the state’s sanctuary order, called the Immigrant Trust Directive. And the White House has placed the blame for a fatal drunken driving crash in Lakewood last month — authorities say an undocumented immigrant is responsible — on Murphy, who supports the state directive.

The problem? That label is based not on what’s happening in classrooms, but on what’s codified in state regulations.
In other words, Missouri scored low not because we lack quality but because our high standards are voluntary, locally driven, incentive-based, and not mandatory.
Missouri’s approach to early learning reflects our values: local control, strategic investment and a belief that collaboration works better than top-down mandates. And that approach is working.
Missouri is one of just a few states with pre-K funding embedded in its K–12 foundation formula. That means our funding is stable, predictable and less vulnerable to political swings or annual budget battles. We don’t rely solely on grants or pilot programs; we’ve made early learning part of the core school funding system.
We’ve also invested in the Missouri Quality Pre-Kindergarten Grant Program, which supports both school districts and private providers. This program incentivizes quality by providing additional funding tied to strong standards based on state statute. It has allowed rural districts and community partners to launch or expand pre-K programs, even in places where resources were once scarce.
Former Gov. Mike Parson created the Office of Childhood to consolidate programs for early learning, child care and family support under one roof. This action allows the state to move towards delivering better coordinated services. While implementation has had its challenges, the potential for reducing silos and improving outcomes remains strong.
We also use a kindergarten entry assessment to understand how prepared students are when they arrive at school, arguably the best real-world indicator of the effectiveness of early learning experiences. This kind of data tells us what’s working and needs improvement, rather than relying solely on policy checklists.
And with our innovative contracting law, Missouri is one of the only states that allows public schools and private providers to formally partner in delivering pre-K. That flexibility is critical in rural and under-resourced areas, where one-size-fits-all models often fall short.
WalletHub may base its rankings on real data, but it tells only part of the story. NIEER’s benchmarks reward what is required, not what is offered or achieved.
In Missouri, we’ve chosen to build a system that rewards participation and performance rather than compliance. Our programs meet high standards and are expanding every year, but because those standards are not mandatory statewide, we don’t get credit in the rankings.
Missouri’s ranking at the bottom of the WalletHub list reflects a methodology prioritizing mandates over actual program quality. Still, we don’t need mandates to deliver high-quality early learning across the state.

Tammy Baldwin toured La Follette High School in Madison on Tuesday. (Photo by Baylor Spears/ Wisconsin Examiner)Opposition to the Trump administration’s efforts to close the U.S. Department of Education is gaining momentum, Sen. Tammy Baldwin said Tuesday during a visit to La Follette High School in Madison.
Baldwin visited the school, part of the state’s second largest school district, as new educators met for an orientation ahead of the start of the school year on September 3. 
“[New educators are] coming or returning to teaching at a time where we have seen this administration doing devastating things to education and education funding,” Baldwin, a Wisconsin Democrat, told reporters after a tour of the school. “It has proposed the abolition of the Education Department. He wants to dismantle it. He’s called for the end to it, but he also knows that there are some constraints because the Education Department was set up by Congress and it’s funded by Congress.” 
President Donald Trump signed an executive order in March ordering Education Sec. Linda McMahon to “take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Department of Education and return authority over education to the States and local communities while ensuring the effective and uninterrupted delivery of services, programs, and benefits on which Americans rely.” McMahon has said she is “dead serious” about putting herself out of a job.
In June, schools across the country were thrown into uncertainty when the Trump administration withheld over $6 billion in federal funds meant to support English language learners, migrants, low-income children, adult learners, after-school programs and more. The frozen funds included $70 million for Wisconsin. The administration decided to reverse course and release the funds in late July after Republican and Democratic Senators both called on the administration to do so.

Madison Metropolitan School District Superintendent Joe Gothard said that, as of Tuesday, the district had expected $3.4 million and is “still waiting for direct language to ensure that we are going to be reimbursed for the cost that we plan to incur this school year.” 
Without that money, “students would not receive the services they deserve, and that could be by way of reading interventions, it could be some of the outreach we’re able to do with communities, with families,” Gothard said. “$3.4 million out of $6 billion may not seem like a lot, but those are targeted funds at students who need it most.” 
“I’m grateful that we’ve had support for the unfreezing of these funds,” Gothard said, adding that uncertainty of funding “undermines public education and who it’s for.” The lack of certainty is leading the district to rely more heavily on the local community and government for the support the district needs.
“I’ve got a range of students,” Thompson said, adding that the City Center allows for students to “come in and get what they need.”
Baldwin also got to see the school’s music room, library, gymnasium and technical education spaces, including an autoshop. 
“One of my most popular classes is our cooking classes, right, and kids get to learn basic life skills, and then, they actually do cooking for the school,” Thompson said. 
“And nutrition and all that stuff,” Baldwin added. 
“Yeah, you know, everything kids don’t want to hear,” Thompson joked.

The Trump administration’s efforts to close the Education Department comes even as some Republican lawmakers are balking at the idea. Politico  reported that Republican lawmakers looking to fulfill Trump’s agenda are considering breaking the process down into smaller bills given the opposition to shutting down the department, especially from those in school districts that have benefited from funding and those that rely on the agency for guidance. 
When it comes to challenging the ongoing federal uncertainty, Baldwin pointed to a recent bill that came out of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health, and Human Services, and Education and was recently approved by the full committee. 
“We have seen him propose to put some of the career and technical education programs in the Labor Department rather than keeping them in the Education Department,” Baldwin said. “He’s talked about putting the IDEA program” — which serves students with disabilities under the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act — “into the Department of Health and Human Services, where it would not be suited, and he is defunding programs left and right, so we’re fighting back.” 
According to Baldwin’s office, the bill would provide $79 billion in discretionary funding for the Department of Education  and would put measures into place to limit the ability to downsize the department’s role. The bill includes a requirement to make formula grants available on time and maintain the staff necessary to ensure the department carries out its statutory responsibilities and carries out programs and activities funded in the bill in a timely manner. 
Baldwin said the bill is “wildly bipartisan,” noting it passed the committee on a 26-3 vote at the end of July. 
“We have more work to do. It has to go through the whole process and end up on the president’s desk before its law,” Baldwin said. “I feel like we have momentum in standing up against this president’s plans with education, so when we return to session the day after Labor Day, we’re going to continue to press to restore all funding, and fight back against this idea of abolishing the Department of Education.”

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)An interim legislative task force wrestled with the state’s hundreds of boards and commissions Tuesday, struggling to learn more about their finances and meeting schedules. Such groups can include powerful boards who can grant professional licenses, review an inmate’s parole application and approve utility price increases while others were designed to be one-off planning committees or exist in name only.
“I don’t think it’s a controversial statement to say we have too many,” said Adam Battalio, a senior policy advisor for Gov. Mike Braun. Battalio, whose Tuesday presentation was limited to just boards and commissions, counted at least 224 such bodies with a gubernatorial appointment.

Read the prepared report on all 267 selected boards, commissions and advisory councils here.

For years, leaders have sought to tamp down on the state’s various councils and task forces, most recently in a house bill that ultimately didn’t advance in the 2025 legislative session. Last year, a similar committee scrutinized various groups, which itself came from 2023 legislation. But determining which groups merit keeping — and which to phase out or combine with others — has been more difficult.
Such bodies have roughly doubled in the last 25 years, Battalio said, across Republican and Democrat administrations and legislatures.
“It’s not bad intentions that are behind this growth. In fact, it’s probably important for us to recognize good intentions, over time, grow government,” Battalio said. “… Those same good intentions can help address this problem (and) reshape government to be more responsive, more efficient.”
But some lawmakers were perturbed to learn that the state’s Legislative Services Agency has trouble tracking spending and other activities for some boards and commissions. 
“One of the first things that came out is they almost no visibility on some of these boards and commissions. Can’t track them; can’t see them,” said Sen. Chris Garten, R-Charlestown. “… Which is a problem.”
A “low-ball” estimate pinned those cumulative costs at $700,000, but that doesn’t include per diem or travel costs for legislators, coffee or lunch for members or program funding, Battalio said.
“… you will notice on those (legislative services agency) fiscal numbers … There are no aggregated totals. Part of that is because they’re concerned they can’t see everything, so they’re worried about the accuracies or inaccuracies,” Garten added. 
A better-informed total would be forthcoming, he said.
Measuring boards and commissions
Measuring meeting frequency and outcomes proved more difficult, as 56 boards didn’t have any online information at all. While that category would need further scrutiny, Battalio said, the average for other groups was 12 meetings per year in 2024.
Outliers with dozens — or even hundreds — of meetings included the parole board, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission, the Alcohol and Tobacco Commission, and Nursing Board. However, Battalio cautioned against using the data without the full context. 
“Meeting frequently does not make you important; meeting infrequently does not make you unimportant,” Battalio said. 
Battalio also noted that as states reviewed their own groups, including Iowa and Arkansas, some were necessary to draw down federal funds.

The industry's proposals for Wyoming would more than double the state's electrical capabilities, challenging protections for the average ratepayer.
The post Utilities brace for staggering power demands from AI, data centers in Wyoming appeared first on WyoFile .","A tsunami of demand for artificial intelligence and data computation promises to plant stacks of servers in Wyoming. Those servers will require a volume of electricity that will eclipse the state’s power generation capacity and transform the physical and regulatory utility landscape in and outside the state, some familiar with Wyoming’s utility industry say.
For example, a joint venture — Crusoe and Tallgrass — recently announced plans for a computational campus south of Cheyenne requiring 1,800 megawatts of electricity, then “hyperscale” to 10,000 megawatts. That’s equal to Wyoming’s existing generation capacity, and it’s merely the latest in a series of data center proposals targeting the state.
Prometheus Hyperscale is partnering with others to add 1,200 megawatts of electricity for data centers in southwest Wyoming, while Microsoft and Meta are spending hundreds of millions of dollars on power-thirsty data centers around Cheyenne. Local utilities say they field new inquiries weekly.
Opinions vary about whether Wyoming is prepared to meet the demand and how it might impact “legacy” or regular utility customers in the state.

“How chaotic can this get?” Gillette Republican Rep. Christopher Knapp quipped during a recent Corporations, Elections and Political Subdivisions meeting. “Eventually it’s going to affect every region and, overall, the state’s typical legacy way of regulating.”
Staggering demand raises questions about regular ratepayers
Wyoming established rules years ago that empower utilities to demand special contracts with “large load” customers like data centers. The intent was to insulate their regular residential and business ratepayers from the risks that big-load customers might pose. 
For example, Cheyenne Light, Fuel and Power, and its parent company Black Hills Energy, trailblazed the concept with Microsoft back in 2015, leading to a successful series of data center additions that continues today, according to the utility’s Governmental Affairs Manager David Bush. Rather than build new power plants to feed Microsoft’s data centers, the utility acquires electricity on the open market, and its contract provides it can “interrupt” the power delivery when necessary — in the case of a major outage or grid-locking spike in power demand during, say, a severe cold snap.
The utility’s regular ratepayers didn’t have to help shoulder the cost for new power plants, and their service remains a priority when the chips are down.

Regulated utilities, as well as nonprofit co-ops and state regulators, mostly agree Wyoming’s large-load rule goes a long way to accommodate data centers while protecting the average ratepayer. But, the scale of the digital goldrush is staggering, some warn, and threatens to overrun all manner of business-as-usual.
Consider this: Wyoming’s electrical generation capacity stands at about 10,200 megawatts. All of the homes, businesses, mines, refineries and manufacturers in the state combined require only about 40% of that power, according to federal data. The rest is exported.

But that “excess” power generation doesn’t mean Wyoming’s megawatts can simply be redistributed to digital cowboys wanting to set up shop in the state. That’s not how utilities work, and besides, data center developers are making similar demands throughout the nation, scouring for whatever new source of electrical generation can be switched on the fastest — be it natural gas, wind, solar or nuclear. 
After more than a decade of relatively flat electrical demand in the U.S., AI queries, digital streaming, bitcoin mining and other computations — along with systems to cool hard-working servers — increased to account for 4.4% of all U.S. electrical consumption in 2023, according to the Department of Energy’s 2024 Report on U.S. Data Center Energy Use. The report estimates that by 2028, those computations will account for 12%.
The demand, whether it’s 50% or 100% — or more — of current electricity output in Wyoming and the surrounding region, is likely to stress regulatory safeguards and, depending on how the systems are designed, water resources and air quality.
State’s efforts
The Wyoming Energy Authority is leading a stakeholders’ working group to try to find consensus on a wise regulatory approach that takes advantage of the economic opportunities without putting regular electric ratepayers — and their providers — at risk. Most involved agree that the party that places any new cost on the system ought to pay that cost. However, nothing in the realm of utilities and regulation is quite that simple, Wyoming Public Service Commission Deputy Chairman Chris Petrie warned.
Some data developers propose bypassing existing utilities, or only relying on them for backup power, by building their own electric generating facilities, or striking a deal with a “third-party” non-public utility power generator that serves only a handful of data customers. But what happens if those plans go awry?
“One way or the other, it all has to be sorted out so that costs get allocated to the causer, and it’s a super complicated, involved affair when you’re actually doing it,” Petrie testified. “But the concept is that if you cause the cost you pay the cost.”
Wyoming Energy Authority Executive Director Rob Creager said stakeholders in the working group have not yet reached consensus on recommendations to lawmakers for how to potentially tweak Wyoming’s regulatory landscape to deal with the issue. The group plans to bring its recommendations to the Legislature’s Corporations Committee in November. 
Meantime, Creager said, Wyoming must grapple with how wide it wants to open its doors to the data industry — accounting for all its benefits and risks.
“What does the state want?” Creager posed to the panel. “What kind of growth and how do we want to supply that growth? Or do we want to supply that growth?”

If the caucus was a herd, it would be full of gomers, columnist Rod Miller says. Its members make a lot of noise, but can’t get the job done.
The post Gomers in the Wyoming “Freedom” Caucus appeared first on WyoFile .","“Gomer” is cowboy slang for a castrated bull, a steer. Gomers are turned out in a cow herd a week or so before breeding season. They have all the bullish instincts, but they can’t do anything about it. They chase cows around, bellow, throw slobber and snot, paw the dust, dry-mount the cows and bother them with their fake masculinity until the whole herd comes into heat and are ready for the bulls to do the real work.

Opinion

After turning gomers into the cow herd, cowboys often sit astraddle their horses and watch the frenzied ineptitude as the neutered beasts try to do something for which they are uniquely unqualified and unequipped. It’s always good for a laugh. Gomers can’t get the job done, but they raise the excitement level in the herd to unfulfilled heights. 
Just like the “Freedom” Caucus.
The most recent display of gomeristic behavior was presented to us by Rep. Chris Knapp, a card-carrying member of the “Freedom” Caucus from Gillette. Here’s what happened.
Tom Lubnau, former speaker of the Wyoming House, who has 40 years of experience on the subject, was invited to address the Legislature’s Joint Corporations Committee on Aug. 15, as the committee worked on amendments to the Wyoming Public Records Act. Tom was willing to share his thoughts, and try to make the committee’s work better.
Tom is also a fine columnist for Cowboy State Daily.

(Mike Vanata)
Knapp, a Republican co-chair of the committee, pitched a hissy fit over Lubnau’s appearance, whining that Tom had written unkind things about legislators in his column. Knapp worried that things would get “out of hand” and that some politician’s feelings would be hurt, and succeeded in having Lubnau booted from the agenda.
To use another barnyard term, this was a chickenshit move.
Knapp’s childish tantrum affirms that, among the freedoms that the “Freedom’” Caucus pretends to cherish, our First Amendment freedoms of speech and petitioning the government are strangely absent.
It also ignores Plank 22 of the Wyoming Republican Party platform, which states, “Freedom of speech is a fundamental right secured by the United States Constitution and the Constitution of the State of Wyoming. Freedom of speech includes the freedom of the individual to express his or her beliefs, ideas and opinions without fear of retaliation, censorship or legal sanction by government.”
Tell me, with a straight face, that Tom’s treatment was anything other than retaliation.
Knapp and his ilk would rather silence citizens than risk having their feathers ruffled by someone criticizing them. That is a succinct definition of political cowardice.

Rachel Rodriguez-Williams. (WyoFile/Ashton J. Hacke) 
And it’s par for the course, given the “Freedom” Caucus’ record of promising great things while delivering only punch lines for political jokes.
Hints of this political impotence have been evident for quite some time. A couple of years ago, Rep. John Bear (at the time the Exalted Grand Poobah of the “Freedom” Caucus and self-styled champion of grassroots Wyoming) wondered aloud during a legislative debate whether small Wyoming towns should even exist, instead of just drying up and blowing away. In retrospect, that hint was prescient.
Fast forward to today, past the litany of “Freedom” Caucus faux pas and stumbles, and we have Knapp’s boneheaded political face-plant.
At the time Knapp pawed the dust, slung snot bubbles and demanded Lubnau’s 86-ing from the Joint Corporations agenda, his co-chair on the Senate side and fellow Republican, Cale Case, warned (and I paraphrase) “OK, have it your way, buckaroo. But things won’t turn out like you expect. This will have traction.”
Knapp should have heeded Case’s advice, because he has experience and legislative wisdom light-years beyond Knapp’s.
Perhaps Knapp was relying on the “Freedom” Caucus’ oft-employed tactic when one of their own does something stupid. They circle the wagons around their embarrassed colleague, excuse the miscreant’s stupidity and call everyone else RINOs.
It’s really difficult to gin up any respect for politicians like Knapp and Bear when they can’t keep their feet out of their mouths. The closest corollary I can come up with is gomers.
And that presents the rest of Wyoming with the question of what to do about these gomers. The answer, from where I sit on my horse watching their goofiness, is to remove them from the herd. We put ‘em in there, and we can take ‘em out.
If Wyoming citizens are as sick and tired of their toxicity as I am, no “Freedom” Caucus incumbent should enjoy the comfort of an uncontested primary in the next election. Nor should they receive a single vote or dollar from any citizen of the Big Empty who truly loves their state.
It will take money, time and effort on our part to cull the gomers from our herd. But if we can get it done, we’ll have a productive ranch again.

This story was originally reported by Mariel Padilla, Grace Panetta and Mel Leonor Barclay of The 19th. Meet Mariel, Grace and Mel  and read more of their reporting on gender, politics and policy.
“In my ideal society, we would vote as households,” a pastor tells CNN. “And I would ordinarily be the one that would cast the vote, but I would cast the vote having discussed it with my household.”
Another agrees, saying he’d back an end to a woman’s right to vote: “I would support that, and I’d support it on the basis that the atomization that comes with our current system is not good for humans.”
The discussion of 19th Amendment rights was part of a news segment focused on Doug Wilson — a self-proclaimed Christian nationalist pastor based in Idaho — that was reposted to X by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. The secretary is among Wilson’s supporters, and his involvement with Wilson’s denomination highlights how a fringe conservative evangelical Christian belief system that questions women’s right to vote is gaining more traction in the Republican Party.
Kristin Du Mez, a professor of history at Calvin University and author of “Jesus and John Wayne: How White Evangelicals Corrupted a Faith and Fractured a Nation,” said Wilson’s broader vision of Christian nationalism has gotten more attention over the past several years, alongside President Donald Trump’s rise to power.
“He was a fairly fringe figure, but this moment was really his moment,” she said. “And then as part of that, also, I think he signaled and gave permission to others that they didn’t need to hide some of their more controversial views, such as, should women have the vote? And that’s something that you didn’t hear proudly promoted from very many spaces, even just a handful of years ago.”
In the CNN interview, Wilson said he’d like to see the United States become a Christian and patriarchal country. He advocates for a society where sodomy is criminalized and women submit to their husbands and shouldn’t serve in combat roles in the military — a belief Hegseth has also publicly shared in the past though walked back during his confirmation hearings.
Hegseth appeared to support the nearly seven-minute interview with the caption, “All of Christ for All of Life.” Wilson has built an evangelical empire over the past 50 years that is centered in Moscow, Idaho, and now spans more than 150 congregations across four continents — including a new church in Washington, D.C. In July, Hegseth and his family attended the inaugural service at Christ Church, according to CNN.
“The Secretary is a proud member of a church affiliated with the Congregation of Reformed Evangelical Churches (CREC), which was founded by Pastor Doug Wilson,” Sean Parnell, the chief Pentagon spokesperson, said in a statement to The 19th. “The Secretary very much appreciates many of Mr. Wilson’s writings and teachings.”

Du Mez said Wilson built his brand as a vocal critic of mainstream evangelicalism.
“They were too wishy washy,” Du Mez said, referring to Wilson’s view of much of White evangelicalism in the 1990s and early 2000s. “They were too soft. And so he was kind of bringing a harsher biblical truth, and that included things like a much more rigid application of biblical patriarchy. ”
In 2024, only 1 in 10 Americans qualified as Christian nationalism adherents, according to the Public Religion Research Institute.
Ryan Dawkins, an assistant professor of political science at Carleton College, said Christian nationalism hasn’t necessarily gotten more popular in the past 20 years. But there have been   partisan trends.
“While they used to be more evenly divided between the two parties, over the last two decades, Christian nationalists have sorted into the Republican Party at incredibly high rates,” Dawkins said. “Christian nationalism is almost non-existent within the Democratic Party today, at least among White Democrats.”
While it’s still far from a mainstream opinion, several figures within the Republican Party have flirted with the idea of repealing the 19th Amendment.
Paul Ingrassia, who Trump nominated to lead the Office of Special Counsel, suggested approval for the idea in a 2023 podcast. Podcast host Alan Jacoby told Ingrassia that his own wife is the “biggest misogynist this side of the Mississippi, by the way. My wife literally thinks women should not vote.”
Ingrassia responded, “She’s very based,” a term expressing support for a bold opinion.
During the 2020 Republican National Convention, Republicans featured anti-abortion activist Abby Johnson, who has advocated for a new kind of voting system where households, not individuals, would cast votes. Head-of-household voting has historically disenfranchised women and people of color by concentrating power on the male leaders of the home.
In the leadup to the 2016 presidential election, FiveThirtyEight, a political forecasting site, shared data that suggested if women didn’t vote, Trump would win. The hashtag #repealthe19th — a reference to the 19th Amendment, which grants women the right to vote — quickly went viral.
And a former Trump-backed Michigan candidate for the U.S. House who has also held positions in the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development was found to have made statements criticizing women’s suffrage while in college at Stanford University in the early 2000s. John Gibbs, now an assistant secretary at the agency, said that the country had been damaged by the 19th Amendment because women’s suffrage had led to an increase in the size and scope of the government. He added that women making up half of the population wasn’t enough reason for women’s suffrage. Gibbs’ 2022 congressional campaign denied he opposed women’s right to vote.
Kelly Marino, associate teaching professor at Sacred Heart University and author of “Votes for College Women: Alumni, Students and the Woman Suffrage Campaign” said that while conservative religious sects adamantly opposed to women’s suffrage have always existed, now there is renewed momentum.
“If you look at the way things played out in the past, we have this very liberal period followed by a conservative backlash,” Marino said. “And that’s what’s going on now. You have this period of liberalism where people were having a more expansive view of gender ideology, ideas about sexuality and women in politics. We had some pretty prominent female politicians that were making it pretty far in the last couple of years. And now there’s a backlash.”
Marino said the conservative backlash is reminiscent of the 1960s and 70s. There were significant progressive movements for civil rights, women’s rights, LGBTQ+ rights and environmental protections. But at the same time, the early 1970s saw the emergence of the men’s liberation movement, which focused primarily on issues like divorce law and child custody.
“There’s some men who are promoting a sort of return to tradition, a patriarchal vision for society,” Marino said. “It’s always sort of there, but it’s gaining traction within mainstream consciousness again. And now, you have all this stuff about soft girls and tradwives — this gender ideal of women being the domestic homemaker within a traditional family structure. There’s been a big push for this radical Christianity and some of its values — it’s become really popular even among younger people.”
Joseph Slaughter, an assistant professor of history at Wesleyan University, said Wilson is having his moment in the spotlight — but it’s important to remember that he does not speak for the majority.
“He delights in upsetting people or saying transgressive, un-PC things,” Slaughter said. “Ten years ago, when he posted a video talking about man’s biblical duties — people just sort of yawned and dismissed him. Now, he’s saying things and they’re gaining more currency because of some of this other new right-wing masculinity and the online manosphere.”
Slaughter said it’s particularly concerning that Wilson’s teachings have found their support in a man as powerful as Hegseth.
“What does it mean for somebody who’s running an organization which has had its struggles over the years integrating women and trying to understand existential questions about women’s role in combat?” Slaughter said. “Are Hegseth’s views reinforced by his religion now? Does this church reinforce his cultural chauvinism? For somebody in his position, it’s certainly fair game to ask.”

A recent National Association of Realtors report found affordability increased slightly from last year, but the typical family is still priced out in the West and Northeast. (Photo by Madison McVan/Minnesota Reformer)Housing became more affordable this June, as higher incomes and slightly lower interest rates overcame higher prices, according to a National Association of Realtors report.
However, the South and the Midwest are the only regions where a family with typical or median income can afford a median-priced house, according to the report. The group considers a mortgage to be affordable if the monthly payment (principal and interest) is 25% or less of the family’s income.



The affordability gap is highest in the West, where the typical family income is $113,783, just over two-thirds of the $164,832 that would be needed to purchase a median-priced home.
The Northeast, where the typical family makes $114,559, is also unaffordable by this measure, as a median-priced home requires an income of $141,264.
In the Midwest, the median family income is $102,419, more than the $86,256 needed to buy a median-priced home. The same is true in the South, where the median income is $97,812, slightly more than the $96,720 required to buy a typical home.
Nationally, affordability increased slightly compared with June of 2024, with the typical family making $105,431, about 94% of the $111,648 it would need to buy the median-priced home. That’s up from about 92% in June 2024.
In a video posted Aug. 15, Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors, said he expects lower interest rates to increase affordability in the months ahead.
“We know that mortgage rates will be coming down and that will bring additional buyers into the market. We just need to make sure we have more supply, more supply to meet that demand,” Yun said.

Supplemental Security Income, the nation’s monthly cash assistance program for low-income and elderly people with disabilities, currently takes into account the financial role an individual’s parent, spouse or other household member plays in determining whether someone qualifies for the benefit and how much they receive. 
Benefits can be reduced by up to one-third, or about $300, if an individual with disabilities gets “in-kind” help from household members, such as living rent-free with a parent or spouse.
Until now, however, the federal government has made an exception for households that receive public assistance, under the assumption that families poor enough to receive food or other public assistance are not able to also help support a disabled family member. 
The administration’s proposed new rule, submitted July 18, would no longer consider Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP, commonly referred to as food stamps, as a form of public assistance that meets the exception. 
The change would mean that the Social Security Administration would begin to count “in-kind” contributions, such as living rent-free, against  people with disabilities living with family who also receive SNAP and reduce or end disability payments.
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, relying on SNAP and Social Security data, estimates that the rule, if adopted, would end disability benefits entirely for 100,000 people nationwide and slash payments to another 275,000. In Tennessee, 7,500 people with disabilities could lose or see reductions in benefits.

(Photo by Getty Images)A group of West Virginia environmental organizations is asking state officials to speak against the Trump administration’s move to end a Biden-era solar program that last year committed more than $100 million for projects in West Virginia.  
The Environmental Protection Agency terminated the $7 billion Solar for All program earlier this month. The program was intended to help pay for residential solar projects for more than 900,000 lower income U.S. households. 
Twelve organizations — including American Friends Service Committee of West Virginia, Appalachian Voices, Christians for the Mountains, and Citizens’ Climate Lobby of West Virginia — sent a letter Tuesday asking Gov. Patrick Morrisey and Attorney General J.B. McCuskey to speak against the program’s cancellation. 
“We urge you to use every tool at your disposal to push back against this unwarranted action that will harm families and small businesses across West Virginia,” the organizations wrote.
The EPA granted the West Virginia Office of Energy $106 million in Solar for All funding last year. It also awarded money to 59 other entities. 
According to the Office of Energy’s website, the grant was to be used to “deploy residential solar roofs, support home energy efficiency, reduce utility costs for low-income residents, and make West Virginia households more energy resilient.”
The program was scheduled to launch and start construction in 2026, according to a timeline listed on the website. 
In a post on the social media platform X on Aug. 7, EPA administrator Lee Zeldin said the Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law last month, eliminated the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which included Solar For All.
“In some cases, your tax dollars were diluted through up to FOUR pass-through entities, each taking their own cut off the top!” Zeldin wrote. “The bottom line is this: EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive.
“Today, the Trump EPA is announcing that we are ending Solar for All for good, saving US taxpayers ANOTHER $7 BILLION!,” he wrote. 
Zeldin said in a video that while the program was stood up in 2024, very little of the program’s money has been spent. Recipients are in the “building and planning phase,” and not the construction process, he said. 
A spokesperson for the West Virginia Division of Economic Development, which oversees the Office of Energy, did not immediately respond to an email Monday asking how the local program would be affected by the cancellation and whether or not the state’s grant money had been spent. 
In a news release, Quenton King, government affairs specialist for Appalachian Voices, noted that West Virginia officials applied for the funding in 2023, knowing “the value that solar energy brings” to the state. 
“The Office of Energy was actively working out how to set the program up for success and lower electricity prices for West Virginia households, and it would be a waste to throw away that work now,” he wrote. “I hope that Gov. Morrisey and A.G. McCuskey work with the administration and our congressional delegation to restore the appropriated and obligated funding for this program.”
Representatives for Morrisey and McCuskey did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment Tuesday.

Part One described the emergency effort to rescue Washington state’s last population of Snake River spring and summer Chinook salmon, in the Tucannon River.
The Nez Perce Tribe and its collaborators will try to eke out a few more years’ survival for Tucannon River Chinook.  
“But,” Jay Hesse says, “we also had to ask: What about all the other populations? So in 2021, we started modeling quasi-extinction for all the Snake River spring/summer Chinook and steelhead populations listed under the Endangered Species Act. The results are giving us a better picture of real conditions, and a stronger case for the urgency of action.”

Mr. Hesse is the director of Biological Services for the Nez Perce Department of Fisheries Resources Management.
Some years ago, federal scientists at National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries developed the “quasi-extinction threshold,” which the NOAA uses in planning.
For Snake River Chinook salmon and steelhead, the threshold is fewer than 50 adult fish in a population returning from the ocean for four consecutive years. Below that floor, the population’s continued existence can no longer be scientifically assumed or predicted. It is an emergency signal, flashing red and near black.
The Nez Perce Tribe is applying this science to management of populations below or near the extinction threshold, as well as to public education and long-term science.   
Nez Perce Fisheries provided me two maps from its upcoming extinction threshold report for Snake River spring/summer Chinook, and steelhead, updated through 2024 fish returns. These maps show some of the findings, but much else in it will deserve attention. 
  Hesse, J.A. and Kinzer, R.N., 2025. Snake River Anadromous Fish Status: Quasi-Extinction Threshold Analysis. Department of Fisheries Resources Management. Version: 09 June, 2025.
The quasi-extinction threshold results are mapped in four colors:  populations at or below the 50-fish extinction threshold four consecutive years; those at or below the 50-fish threshold in the most recent year; those predicted, on current trend, to be at the 50-fish line within five years; and those predicted to be above that threshold five years from now. 
  Hesse, J.A. and Kinzer, R.N., 2025. Snake River Anadromous Fish Status: Quasi-Extinction Threshold Analysis. Department of Fisheries Resources Management. Version: 09 June, 2025.
Together, the first three categories, all in red-orange shades, are what I call the critical list: populations at dire, perhaps irreversible risk now, and those on their way to that same status within five years at current rates of decline.  
Lump those red-orange shades together as you look at the maps. With a little imagination, you will see the near-term extinction trajectory for Snake River salmon and steelhead in geographic motion.                        
As updated through 2024 fish returns, the report shows six Snake River steelhead populations, 27% of the species’ total number, are on the critical list, below the extinction threshold or heading there soon. Ten Snake River spring/summer Chinook salmon populations, 29% of  that species’ total, are on the critical list. The maps show their locations.   
Salmon extinction in motion in Washington’s and Oregon’s Snake River

Populations colored yellowish are all those predicted to be above the 50 fish threshold in 2029. These are in motion too. Current rates of decline, if continued, will put a next batch on the critical list soon. The data underlying the maps suggests which and where those will be.  
It is not scientific news that Snake River salmon and steelhead are going extinct. These findings further confirm the fact, by newly estimating the current rate and trend of decline at population level.  
What’s new, for me, is how extinction threshold analysis, as mapped and made public yearly, allows fish managers, all stripes of salmon people, interested reporters, and Northwest governors and members of Congress to observe Snake River salmon extinction in motion.    
The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife also conducts an extinction threshold analysis for these same Snake River populations, with some differences in methodology and data.  
“ODFW’s quasi-extinction approach is a little more conservative than the Nez Perce Tribe’s,” says Tucker Jones, the agency’s Columbia River program manager. “Our two results so far are slightly different, but both analyses have arrived at largely the same conclusions and same trend.  When you take different approaches, but come to nearly the same conclusions, that provides more certainty we’re on the right track.” 
The department also plans to update its analysis this year.  
The extinction threshold findings can be annually volatile, as one somewhat better bad return re-sets its stringent clock. Thus the main story is the trends, for individual populations and the aggregate species. 
The 2024 Nez Perce Fisheries’ analysis estimates a 6% per-year decline is occurring across the Snake’s spring-summer Chinook populations, and 11% per-year decline across steelhead populations. The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife’s trend estimates will be known soon.

 Snake River salmon and steelhead extinction is in motion

Two distinctions between this scientific work, and my use of it here, should be made.  
First, extinction in motion is my phrase, not Hesse’s or his Nez Perce Fisheries’ co-author Ryan Kinzer’s.
They are conducting a careful, annually-updated estimate, employing both raw fish counts and modeling, of the rates at which extirpation of individual populations are currently proceeding (or not, should the data show that), and thus extinction of the species continues to approach (or not).  
The focus on rates of decline toward extirpation and extinction is a main value this science has now, as salmon scarcity and Tucannon River-like dilemmas multiply. The same science will track the pace and places of salmon recovery, should the actions necessary to produce recovery be taken.   
My phrase combines two facts.

Snake River salmon and steelhead extinction is in motion because current numbers are very low, current distribution badly amputated, and decline is the steady year after year, decade after decade, trend, with a few blips up that were not sustained. And, the Nez Perce Tribe’s quasi-extinction threshold maps allow us to watch this motion, place by place, across years.
Second, except when quoting, I say extinction threshold, without the word quasi. This will not change the Nez Perce Tribe’s, Oregon’s or the NOAA Fisheries’ use of the full phrase in scientific, management and legal contexts where it is a defined, necessary term.  
But for most of us that word just gets in the way. Good scientists have developed a last gasp check-point – 50 or fewer fish returning, four years in a row – to mark the entry, by a steelhead or salmon population, into an extinction momentum that will be very difficult to escape. 
It is an extinction threshold. For the salmon, rivers, watersheds, communities and salmon people facing it, there is nothing quasi about it.
 Salmon risks multiply when numbers plunge so low 

Please look again at the maps.  
Most of these geographies hold from 50 to 150 miles of identified habitat for one or both fish. Thus, at the official 50 fish extinction threshold, one female or male Chinook, out of 25, must find a partner, also out of 25, in 50 to 150 miles of water. 
“That is just a terribly low number of salmon in so much river,” Jay Hesse says.  
A landslide or flood scour could destroy a few salmon redds (nests) and their overwintering eggs, when a few are all that exist. Some eagles, bears and humans will find some returning fish before the fish find each other to spawn.

Such local events, of little harm to healthy populations, are major risks to those so near extinction. More destructive are recurring large-scale events – poor ocean conditions, low flows through reservoirs and dams, extended hot water during their long, obstructed upstream migration – that do outsized damage to populations already scraped so low. 
The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, and NOAA Fisheries, both make the main scientific point. 
The department: The 50 fish or less threshold “is not a milestone on a linear path to extinction.” It is “a tipping point into accelerated extinction risk,” with a “higher likelihood populations will no longer be able to respond favorably to improved conditions.”  
The NOAA: “Quasi-Extinction Thresholds represent tipping points for population collapse, where the actual extinction potential may not be predictable or, in some cases, avoidable … The result can be an extinction vortex …”
An extinction vortex operates something like your sink’s drain operates on the last remaining water. It’s too late.
 Returning salmon drive the ecology

Hesse always reminds his audiences of the contexts for this extinction analysis. 
“Keep in mind that salmon ecology is based on abundance,” he says. “Numbers of returning salmon are not just about salmon. Salmon drive the whole ecology of that population’s geographic area. Fifty or fewer fish signals a total break in that watershed’s ecology, with effects that go well beyond the fish.”  
Some breakage is visible to us; many fewer bears, eagles and people hunt the rivers and creeks in season. Much is still invisible to most of us, though nutrient loss is being documented. Salmon nutrition for the waters, lands and life of the territories on the maps above has been close to nothing for 60 years.
“And the harvest cycle, the cultural cycle, which is based on abundance, is also broken,” Hesse says. “That is important to all salmon people, but particularly to tribes that cultural connection is absolutely necessary.”
Hesse and Kinzer use another map to add more context: past extirpations.
  Hesse, J.A. and Kinzer, R.N., 2025. Snake River Anadromous Fish Status: Quasi-Extinction Threshold Analysis. Department of Fisheries Resources Management. Version: 09 June, 2025.
The colored area is the maps just described. The gray area, north and especially south, is the vast geography, in Oregon, Idaho and Nevada, from which Chinook salmon have already been extirpated, mainly by dams.  
Of an estimated 70 abundant populations of Snake River spring/summer Chinook prior to invasion and settlement, 30 are now extirpated. Of 40 steelhead populations pre-settlement, 16 are now extirpated.   
The scales of what once was, and what now remains, are so disparate it is hard to put both on one graph or graphic. 
In his presentations to public and agency audiences, Hesse experiments with visual ways to relate that not-so-long-ago abundance with today’s plunge to extinction. (Two to six million salmon and steelhead annually is one pre-Caucasian estimate for the Snake River alone.) His most effective way so far is a 16-ounce Starbucks’ Grande cup – the past salmon abundance when filled, today a couple disconnected damp spots on the  bottom of the cup.  
“We cannot lose sight that salmon abundance is our goal,” Hesse says.   
 Salmon, steelhead and people in northeast Oregon

Eastern Oregon’s tributary watersheds to the Snake River are too varied and distinctive for this stranger to ably summarize, ecologically or humanly.  The mountain, valley and canyon topography does intricate wonders with cold mountain waters that birth the Grande Ronde River, and then steadily refresh it on its long course to the Snake River. (The Grande Ronde has crossed into Washington when it reaches the Snake; 92% of the watershed is in Oregon.)

Human works add to and subtract from each river. When my interviewees said the names – Wallowa, Lostine, Minam, Wenaha, Grande Ronde, Imnaha, Joseph Creek – I heard something of the depth the names carry for people who know these streams.  
Some echoed Kevin March, a retired acupuncturist in La Grande: “One thing here is that many of these rivers and stretches are hard to get to. In canyon country, you can always leave people behind.” 
Or John Milbert, a veteran fisherman, gatherer of foods, and writer: “I like to get high in the little tributaries. I enjoy fishing these tributaries because I get to know them intimately from walking and wading them. You get surprises.”  
The extinction threshold data led me first to the upper Grande Ronde River, and its large tributary Catherine Creek. (The upper Grande Ronde is roughly the river’s watershed above the town of Elgin.)  
In both, significant damage to river function has occurred in headwater areas, from past logging, roading and grazing, and, in both, the salmon nurseries in and passages through the big valleys are now mostly disconnected and ditched.               
In the early 1990s, scientists identified eight populations of Snake River spring and summer Chinook in northeast Oregon. Two are deemed extirpated since then: the Lookingglass and Big Sheep populations, in the lower Grande Ronde and Imnaha respectively. Washington’s Asotin population, upstream of the Tucannon, is also extirpated.  
“Though extirpated for now, the Tribe does not want any of these taken off the Endangered Species list,” Hesse says. “We don’t want them forgotten, and over time we want them back.”
The Upper Grande Ronde and Catherine Creek host two of northeast Oregon’s six remaining Chinook populations.  
Retired lawyer David Baum remembers fishing for salmon long ago, far up the Grande Ronde, at Tony Vey Meadows. And as a boy in the 1950s, he made a spearing platform on a bridge across Catherine Creek at his grandmother’s home. 
“A salmon would come up every few minutes in season,” he said. “I had no success, but I saw a lot of salmon going up Catherine Creek.”   
No longer. I will offer some numbers, which need not be retained. Their scale and trend is what matters.
Upper Grande Ronde Chinook, returning to 144 miles of identified Chinook habitat, had an estimated return, 2016 through 2022, of 43, 19, 39, 7, 57, 24, 98 and 19 fish. (The Nez Perce update should include the 2024 estimate.) At 20 returning fish, a Chinook must find at least one of 10 possible mates in 144 miles of stream habitat to secure a next generation. 
The Nez Perce Fisheries’ map projects that, at current rates of decline, this Chinook population will be at or below the extinction threshold, joining the critical list, by 2029.
In Catherine Creek’s 89 miles of Chinook habitat, the estimated range of adult returns, 2016-2023, is 31 to 190 fish. For now, the Catherine Creek population remains among those not projected at or below 50 fish within five years, but it is uncomfortably close.              
The Upper Grande Ronde and Catherine Creek share one steelhead population, with 808 miles of identified habitat. Its return was last above 1,000 in 2016. The 2017-2023 range is 247 to 874. Northeast Oregon wild steelhead are generally in better shape than its Chinook, but are also in decline. Four digit returns become three digit become … is the trendline.

None of the local fishers I spoke with were surprised.  
“If not extinct in Upper Grande Ronde, Chinook must be perilously close,” says John Milbert. “The last carcass I saw was probably 15 years ago.”  
Kevin March is a steelhead fisherman: “I don’t fish the upper Grande Ronde, because those are wild fish and the stocks are too low. And I don’t fish for salmon anywhere in eastern Oregon. There are too few.”  
John Appleton and his wife Anieta own Alpine Archery and Sport, La Grande’s fishing shop. 
“Wild salmon are very low in the upper Grande Ronde; steelhead are better but not good,” Appleton told me.  
As for fishing, “in all of northeast Oregon, Chinook fishing any more is really minimal,” he continued. “There is some hatchery-based coho fishing in the fall.”  
Fall steelhead fishing, on hatchery stocks, attracts people, though that fishery too can be uncertain.  
Kyle Bratcher is district fish biologist for Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. His district includes the lower Grande Ronde from the Wallowa River down, and the Imnaha River. 
“In my territory, the salmon in most trouble are Wallowa/Lostine spring Chinook, and Imnaha spring Chinook,” Bratcher said. “They’re not as bad as in the Tucannon, but it’s clear we need to do more for them.”  
This Wallowa population was last estimated above 1,000 in 2014, its 2015-20 range is 189 to 750 (the Nez Perce and Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife reports should include more recent data), and it has 137 miles of habitat. 
Bratcher and Hesse confirmed the department and Nez Perce Tribe have begun discussion of interim “safety net” actions for Wallowa/Lostine Chinook. Decisions will not be simple.

“Steelhead are depressed in my territory, far below recovery goals, but they are a bit more stable than salmon,” Bratcher added. “Steelhead can use more of our wilderness and inaccessible habitat.” 
The fishing people I spoke with generally have more hope for steelhead in the Grande Ronde and Imnaha than for salmon.  
“Steelhead range more, they can go up the small streams and creeks, to many more places,” Kevin March said. “I know a farmer who sees them in his little creek.”  
Biologist Rick George, now retired from the Confederated Umatilla Tribes, lives in Troy, Oregon, on the lower Grande Ronde. “The Umatilla Tribes are doing some excellent habitat restoration in the Upper Grande Ronde – the McCoy Creek project, for example,” he said. “But I can’t see much hope for salmon in the Grande Ronde with eight dams on the lower Snake and Columbia. We’ve put billions into increasing salmon over several generations of salmon now. I don’t see even a blip of recovery. The systems are pretty empty of salmon, and, without that ocean nutrient freight train, the rivers are more sterile. We have large rivers that look beautiful, but without salmon that is deceiving.”  
“I’ve been on the Imnaha for 30 years,” Joe McCormack told me.  “Watching the natural processes, what I see over those 30 years is less and less naturally spawning salmon and steelhead.”

(Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)Colorado state lawmakers will convene for a special session Thursday to offset a $1.2 billion revenue shortfall caused by changes in the federal tax code, but they will also consider tweaks to the state’s artificial intelligence law, which is supposed to go into effect in February.
Gov. Jared Polis included the AI issue in his call for the special session earlier this month.
“We want to make sure that this is settled sooner rather than later, and give this Legislature a chance to figure that out. What adjustments need to be made or changes need to be made are up to them,” he said.

Colorado passed a first-in-the-nation sweeping AI regulation in 2024 to set anti-discrimination guardrails for businesses that use the technology in decisions on consequential matters such as loans, employment, insurance policies and school admissions. When Polis signed the law, however, he was clear in his desire for lawmakers to fine tune the policy to ensure it does not hinder technological innovation and development.
An issue task force was supposed to create legislative recommendations for reform that lawmakers could consider during this year’s regular session, but bill backers did not reach a compromise in time.
Now, the Legislature has an opportunity to tweak the AI law with at least four bills on the issue.
Focus on developers
A bill from the Democratic lawmakers who ran the 2024 bill would narrow the law. It would focus on required disclosures for developers of AI systems — the companies that actually create the technology, versus the deployers who use it. Those developers would need to inform deployers about potential misuses of the technology and steps they’ve taken to mitigate those risks.
Deployers would need to let someone know they are using AI to make a decision about them if it is related to educational enrollment, employment, financial loans, health care, housing, insurance, legal services or a government service. In practice, that could look like a bank notifying a loan applicant of the use of AI in its decision making; when in the process it plans to use AI; and the developer, contact information and system name of the AI.
The bill, Senate Bill 25B-17, would assign developers and deployers joint liability if an AI system violates state law, unless the developer can prove that a deployer misused the technology.
“We’re going to address some of the issues that were brought up during the process of the task force — why are we putting the burden on the deployers, and should it be more on the developers? They are the ones that really have the ultimate responsibility for what their AI does,” said Rep. Brianna Titone, an Arvada Democrat.
Titone is sponsoring the bill alongside Senate Majority Leader Robert Rodriguez and House Assistant Majority Leader Jennifer Bacon, both Denver Democrats.
“We want to make sure that the foundation is good and solid, and we think that the proposal we’re putting out there is going to accomplish that and address the concerns that a lot of people have,” Titone said.
Consumer protection
A bipartisan group of lawmakers will run a bill to clarify that existing state statute around civil rights laws and consumer protections would also apply to AI. That bill, House Bill 25B-13, would empower the attorney general to sue a developer or deployer that uses AI in a way that violates the Colorado Consumer Protection Act. It would also allow an individual to file a complaint against an AI developer if the system violates the state’s anti-discrimination law.
Additionally, that bill would require developers and deployers to disclose to consumers when they are interacting with AI versus a human.
The bill will be sponsored by Rep. William Lindstedt, a Broomfield Democrat, Rep. Michael Carter, an Aurora Democrat, Sen. Judy Amabile, a Boulder Democrat, and Sen. Lisa Frizell, a Castle Rock Republican.
Redefine ‘consequential decision’
Another bill from Rep. Ron Weinberg, a Loveland Republican, would narrow the definition of “consequential decision” in the state’s AI law to include only decisions related to employment or public safety. That would get rid of decisions about school enrollment, finances, government services, housing, insurance, health care services and legal services.
That bill, House Bill 25B-4, would also push the effective date of the law to August 2027, exempt businesses with fewer than 250 employees or less than $5 million in annual revenue, and exempt local governments in towns with fewer than 100,000 residents. It doesn’t have a Senate sponsor.
Repeal
Finally, a bill from Republican Sen. Mark Baisley of Woodland Park would completely repeal the 2024 AI law and update the state’s anti-discrimination laws to prohibit discrimination using any technology. There was no House sponsor for the measure, Senate Bill 25B-12, when it was pre-released on the Legislature’s website.
The special session will likely run into early next week.

This story first appeared at The 74, a nonprofit news site covering education.
Across the country, teachers unions have been challenging the constitutionality of their states’ private school voucher programs in court. And in at least two cases, they’ve won.
Since 2022, when the U.S. Supreme Court allowed Maine private schools to receive public funds, at least five lawsuits have been filed by teachers unions, in Wyoming, Utah, Montana, Missouri and South Carolina. Additional legal challenges have been mounted by advocacy groups and parent organizations.
The Supreme Court’s Carson v. Makin ruling, combined with growing interest among parents in alternatives to traditional public schools post-COVID, has fueled the rise of voucher programs and led to a tug-of-war in state courts between public educators and school choice advocates.
Heading into the 2025 legislative session, at least 33 states had some form of private school choice, according to the Georgetown University think tank FutureEd. Most union lawsuits have focused on voucher programs, in which public dollars pay for children to attend private schools —  including religious schools — and cover other education-related expenses such as homeschooling.
In Wyoming and Utah, judges ruled in favor of the unions — at least for now. In South Carolina, the program was retooled after a court declared its previous version unconstitutional.
The Wyoming Education Association, which represents roughly 6,000 public school teachers, landed a win in July after District Court Judge Peter Froelicher granted a preliminary injunction against the state’s universal voucher program. The union and nine parents had sued the state in June on grounds that the Steamboat Legacy Scholarship Act is unconstitutional because it violates a state regulation that it must provide a “uniform system of public instruction.”

Ohio judge rules state’s $700 million voucher program is unconstitutional 




The union decided to sue after lawmakers made the voucher program universal this spring. It was originally created with a family income cap of 250% of the federal poverty level.

“No income guidelines, in essence, means that you could be someone in Jackson who owns an $18 million property, and the state’s giving you money,” said union President Kim Ame. “Our constitution clearly says that we cannot give public money to private entities, so that’s why we challenged that.”
The injunction temporarily stops the distribution of $7,000 scholarships — which are funded from a state appropriation of $30 million — until the court determines the program’s constitutionality. The state has since filed an appeal to the Wyoming Supreme Court.
“I am disheartened at the court’s written order granting the WEA’s injunction. As one of nearly 4,000 Wyoming families, you have had your lives unnecessarily upended through no fault of your own,” Megan Degenfelder, state superintendent of public instruction, wrote in a July statement to parents.
The case is similar to the one in Utah, where a judge ruled a $100 million voucher program unconstitutional in April, following a lawsuit by the state teachers union.

Utah school voucher program ruled unconstitutional in teachers union lawsuit

 




The Utah Education Association sued the state last year, arguing the Utah Fits All Scholarship Program violates the state constitution by diverting tax money to private schools that aren’t free, open to all students and supervised by the state board of education. The Utah Supreme Court is set to consider an appeal later this year.
Lawsuits in other states are still working their way through the courts.
In July, the Montana Federation of Public Employees, which represents the state’s public school teachers, joined a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the statewide voucher program that funds private education expenses for special education students.
“Even voucher programs like [this one] that are targeted to students with disabilities deprive them of crucial legal protections and educational resources,” the plaintiffs said in a legal brief.
In Missouri, the state teachers union is suing over the MOScholars program, which started as a tax credit scholarship in 2021. It currently relies on nonprofits to collect donations that are turned into scholarships. Donors can receive a tax credit amounting to 100% of their contribution, but it can’t exceed more than half of their state tax liability.
This year, Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe dedicated $50 million in taxpayer dollars for the scholarships and $1 million for program marketing, according to the suit. The Missouri National Education Association, which has 28,000 members, sued in June in an effort to block the appropriation.
“The General Assembly has far overstepped its authority and violated five provisions of the Missouri Constitution by using an appropriations bill to construct out of whole cloth a scheme to divert general revenues to what are essentially vouchers for the payment of private school tuition for elementary and secondary school students,” wrote Loretta Haggard, the union’s attorney, in the suit.
On July 30, EdChoice Legal Advocates — part of a national nonprofit that advocates for school choice — filed a motion to join the suit as defendants. Thomas Fisher, litigation director, said in a press release that the program helps Missouri families afford an education that fits their children’s needs.
“The recent expansion of the program is constitutional and will expand education freedom for low-income families and students with learning differences,” he said.
In South Carolina, the state Supreme Court ruled in 2024 that its Education Trust Fund Scholarship Program was unconstitutional following a lawsuit from the state teachers union, parents and the NAACP. The program resumed this year after lawmakers revised it to funnel money from the lottery system instead of the general fund.
Unions have also been involved in school choice lawsuits in Alaska and Wisconsin. In 2023, National Education Association Alaska funded a suit over a state system that sent cash payments to the parents of homeschool students. That same year, Wisconsin’s largest teachers union asked the state Supreme Court to hear its case challenging the constitutionality of the statewide voucher program, but the request was denied.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/teachers_union_lawsuit-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-08-20 06:57:49.355378

States and clinicians are working on getting correct information on vaccines to vulnerable groups amid shifting federal guidance. (Photo illustration by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Heading into the respiratory illness season, states and clinicians are working to encourage pregnant patients to get COVID-19 vaccinations, even though the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services no longer recommends that they should.
Along with being older and having an underlying health condition, pregnancy itself is a risk factor. Pregnant women are more vulnerable to developing severe illness from COVID-19. They’re also at high risk for complications, including preterm labor and stillbirth. The vast majority of medical experts say getting the shot is safe and effective — much safer than having the illness.
But HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced in May that the agency would no longer recommend that pregnant women get the vaccine. Before testifying before Congress in June, Kennedy circulated a document on Capitol Hill claiming higher rates of fetal loss after vaccination. But the authors of those studies told Politico that their work had been misinterpreted.
Experts say the federal shift puts the onus on state health agencies to ramp up vaccine guidance and outreach. Clinicians and public health organizations are trying to dispel misinformation and make sure information reaches low-income people and people of color, who had higher maternal death rates during the pandemic. During the first two years of the pandemic, the virus contributed to a quarter of maternal deaths, according to federal data.
“We are severely disappointed,” said Dr. Neil Silverman, a professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California, Los Angeles David Geffen School of Medicine. He has studied vaccines and pregnancy for the past 15 years and specializes in high-risk pregnancies.
Silverman called the federal shift a “public health tragedy on a grand scale.”
Vaccinations against COVID-19 help prevent severe illness in pregnant people as well as their newborns, who are too young to get vaccinated, Silverman said. In what’s called passive immunity, vaccinated mothers pass on antibodies to their babies through the placenta and through breast milk.
“State public health agencies are probably going to have to implement vaccine guidance that differs from the federal recommendations. And that’s going to be an interesting can of worms,” said OB-GYN Dr. Mark Turrentine, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas.
Turrentine serves on a board of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists that focuses on immunization and infectious diseases. He said his recent pregnant patients who had COVID-19 hadn’t gotten the vaccine.
“The change in guidance on the federal level just really makes a lot of confusion, and it makes it very challenging to try to explain to individuals why all of a sudden the difference,” Turrentine said.
A slew of public health organizations have been making a concerted effort to dispel vaccine myths. They include the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit organization of maternal-fetal experts. At a news briefing the society held this month, clinicians stressed the safety and long-standing science behind COVID-19 vaccines, as well as the shots for RSV and the flu. Cases of RSV and the flu tend to peak in the winter months, while in recent years COVID-19 cases have spiked in the summer and the winter.
Dr. Brenna Hughes, an OB-GYN who chairs the organization’s infectious diseases and emerging threats committee, pointed to survey data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing that less than a third of eligible pregnant patients received COVID-19 shots, and only 38% received RSV shots for the 2023 to 2024 season. Less than half — 47% — received flu shots, and 59% received TDAP (whooping cough) vaccines.
CDC data shows that for last year’s and this year’s season, only between 12% and 14% of pregnant patients got the COVID-19 vaccine.
“The complications from the infection are so much greater than the complications and the very few and typically minor adverse events that might occur from the vaccine,” said microbiologist Sabra Klein, a professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
In June, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and 30 other professional health organizations signed a letter urging insurers to continue covering the COVID-19 shot for pregnant women, and have continued to urge coverage since then.
CVS Caremark, one of the nation’s three major pharmacy benefit managers, told Stateline it will continue covering the vaccine for pregnant women. The Arizona, California and North Carolina state Medicaid agencies also told Stateline they are still currently covering COVID-19 vaccines for pregnant women.
Dr. Kimberly Fortner, president-elect of the Infectious Diseases Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology, said during the maternal-fetal medicine briefing that she hopes medical groups’ joint messaging will bolster insurers.
“Hopefully by us linking arms, that can then help develop consistency so that insurers will continue to pay for the vaccine,” she said.
Exacerbating disparities
Dr. Ayanna Bennett, director of the District of Columbia Department of Health, said the federal government’s new stance has upended “a system that’s been stable for a very long time.”
Bennett said her agency used federal pandemic aid to shore up vaccine outreach efforts to communities of color. Now that flow of money is ending.
The changes in federal guidance and funding will “almost certainly exacerbate” maternal health disparities, said Marie Thoma, a perinatal epidemiologist and an associate professor in the University of Maryland Department of Family Science who researches pregnancy and COVID-19.
Black and Indigenous women died at higher rates. The virus exacerbated existing racial disparities in maternal health — and created new ones: Latina mothers, who generally see low rates of maternal mortality, saw deaths surge to 28 per 100,000 in 2021. Their rate was about 12 per 100,000 in 2018, according to federal data.
“We are going in with some exposure already that we didn’t have during the start of the pandemic. So, there will be some protection, but now that will erode,” said Thoma. “If we’re not getting vaccines, or if people are hesitant to take them, we could see some increase.”
Silverman said the administration’s efforts to strip mentions of race from government policies makes it difficult for institutions to reach populations at greatest risk. He called the dismissal of decades of data “saddening and infuriating.”
“The politicization of the vaccine process, or access to it, is what concerns me the most,” said Dr. Yvette Martas, a Connecticut OB-GYN who chairs the board of directors of the Hispanic Health Council.
Many women “are trying to navigate an economic system that’s not always in their favor in terms of also providing access to the kind of educational material that they need,” she said.
Not just COVID-19
In June, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee, replacing them with some members who are vaccine skeptics.
The change is creating chaos. Some states have vaccine laws, such as mandates for kids and coverage statutes, that are specifically tied to the committee’s decisions.
The Vaccine Integrity Project at the University of Minnesota called on frontline health workers, health officials and professional societies to “counter the spread of inaccurate and confusing vaccine information.”
At a news briefing this month held by the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, representatives from Alabama, Connecticut and Washington, D.C., said they will continue to recommend vaccines.
Alabama’s state health officer, Dr. Scott Harris, said clinicians will be instrumental in getting correct vaccination information to patients.
“We don’t think that we necessarily have the same authoritative voice that we might have had a decade ago in trying to guide people in what to do, but we do believe that people trust their health care providers in most cases and are certainly willing to listen to them,” he said at the briefing.
Bennett said she is hopeful that strong, consistent messaging from respected medical organizations will help combat confusion.
“Having established groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics or the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology make very firm recommendations that keep us essentially not changed from where we have been, I think, should reassure families,” she said.

President Donald Trump’s administration has ordered some retiring coal plants to stay online, even as they have struggled to remain economically viable. (Photo by Liam Niemeyer/Kentucky Lantern)Mandates from President Donald Trump’s administration to retain aging coal plants could cause a massive spike in energy costs, according to an independent analysis commissioned by several environmental groups.
Orders from the U.S. Department of Energy to save coal plants from retirement could cost ratepayers more than $3 billion per year, according to a report from Grid Strategies, a power sector consulting firm. It was carried out on behalf of Earthjustice, Environmental Defense Fund, Natural Resources Defense Council and Sierra Club.
Under Trump, the agency has issued emergency orders to maintain operations at coal plants that were scheduled for retirement. While federal officials say the coal plants need to stay online to avoid blackouts, power plant owners and state regulators planned their closures because they were no longer economically viable or needed for reliability.
“DOE mandates override those well-informed decisions, inflating electric bills for homeowners and businesses and undermining the competitiveness of U.S. factories and data centers,” the Grid Strategies analysis found.
Across the country, coal plants have phased out as they’ve struggled to compete with cheaper renewables and natural gas. A 2023 analysis by Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan think tank, found that 99% of existing U.S. coal plants “are more expensive to run than replacement by local wind, solar, and energy storage resources.”
But Trump, who has pushed to unleash more fossil fuel development and to stymie wind and solar, has ordered a retiring coal plant in Michigan to stay online, along with an oil and gas plant in Pennsylvania.
“Based on the trend to date and indications that DOE has approached the owners of many retiring fossil power plants about potentially mandating their retention, DOE may attempt to mandate the retention of nearly all large fossil power plants slated for retirement between now and the end of 2028,” reads the Grid Strategies report.
The cost of keeping those plants online would be immense. By 2028, if Trump were to mandate the retention of all fossil fuel plants slated for retirement, the annual cost to ratepayers would be more than $3.1 billion, the analysis found.
The report also considers a number of aging plants that are not yet scheduled for retirement. It finds Trump’s actions could create a “perverse incentive,” causing plant owners to claim they’re planning to shut down, inducing the feds to step in and keep them open, with the cost borne by ratepayers.
Accounting for that possibility, the report found that ratepayer costs could reach $5.9 billion per year to keep the entire aging fossil fuel fleet online. California, Texas and Colorado would see the highest increases in electricity bills.

(Photo of Old Knox County Courthouse: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Knox County Property Assessor Phil Ballard faces one count of official misconduct for, in the words of the Tennessee Comptroller of the Treasury, improperly using a “county vehicle approximately 150 times while receiving a $7,600 annual travel allowance and repaid $2,776.95 after the improper use was discovered.” 
Ballard, who has served as assessor since 2008, and I started together as Knox County commissioners in 2006. In fact, we traveled together, along with fellow new Commissioner Greg Lambert, to training sessions in Nashville for newly-elected county officers. 
He’s has been a guest in my reporting class at the University of Tennessee, and I’d like to withhold judgment on these matters, awaiting the actions of the courts. Instead, I’d prefer to write about the importance of all Tennessee counties having good, clear and enforced policies on county vehicles.
As Ballard, Lambert and I joined the commission, there was a sharp power rivalry between Knox County Mayor Mike Ragsdale and County Sheriff Tim Hutchison.  The two even had separate welcoming and orientation sessions for new commissioners.  Sheriff devotee and Commission Chair Scott Moore once brought up a motion to withdraw the mayor’s county vehicle or reduce his travel allotment. The motion had some merit, but ignored substantial vehicle discrepancies on the sheriff side, so I passed on the vote and explained that Moore’s motion was not comprehensive enough. 
  Knox County Property Assessor Phil Ballard (Photo: knoxcounty.org)
My abstention tied the vote; the motion failed.  Moore rewarded/punished me by appointing me as chair of an ad hoc vehicle committee. The other members were Lambert and Commissioner Mike Hammond.  We held public hearings and sought  documents about which vehicles were held by which county departments, who had access to them, and what were the rules for vehicle use. Hammond looked into GPS and whether it could be used to track use and potential misuse.  Lambert explored vehicles assigned to judges.  I visited the local facility where many county vehicles were fueled, maintained, and repaired. 
I also did some research, starting with the County Technical Assistance Service and the Municipal Technical Assistance Service, part of the University of Tennessee’s Institute for Public Service.  I found vehicle policies from other cities and counties.  I even read through a specialized magazine Government Fleet, and used SurveyMonkey to reach out to those who managed county vehicles
The result was something of a “greatest hits” policy, selecting the best from several thorough county policies from around the country.  I presented a draft to the commission, but knew that several changes would be needed to round up the necessary votes to pass.  I had to exempt schools to avoid potential lawsuits about whether county commissioners were stepping on the authority of the school board. I reluctantly exempted the sheriff’s department (otherwise, the whole effort would have died), even though I suspected several unneeded take-home vehicles resided there. The plan passed.  
However, as the Ballard prosecution shows, the county may have slipped back into some bad habits.
Here are some suggestions for counties large and small about county vehicles:

Take home vehicles should be limited only to jobs that require a daily and frequent presence on the road, and response to emergencies overnight. They should not be used as salary supplements or other perks.
One may not “double dip” using both a government vehicle and a travel allowance, excepting distant travel such as conferences where the county vehicle cannot serve to get the person there.
Some current research looks into state and local electric vehicle policies. Counties should explore this for both environmental and cost savings reasons. The key to such savings will be widely available charging stations, and a fee structure that rewards electric vehicle ownership and does not punish it with fees.
Traditional gas refueling at any county pumps, or from private sources, must have precise records to assure that fuel is not being diverted to personal use related to county vehicles.
Smoking must be prohibited in county vehicles. This reduces exposure to second-hand smoke and helps avoid needless decline in resale value.
County vehicles may not be used for personal trips. 
Cell phone use should be avoided while driving. Communication should be kept to essential messages while opting for hands-free devices.
Any and all accidents, moving violations or traffic/parking citations while using a county vehicle must be reported promptly to one’s immediate supervisor — or in the case of department heads, to both the sheriff and the county mayor.

   Other good policies certainly can and should be added to this starter list, but harsh experience has shown us that enforced policies are needed.

(Photo by Kevin Magee)BOGALUSA  — Less than a mile from a century-old mill that sustained generations in this small town north of New Orleans, 19-year-old Tajdryn Forbes was shot to death near his mother’s house.
She found Forbes face down in the street in August 2023, two weeks before he had planned to move away from the empty storefronts, boarded-up houses, and poverty that make this one of the most troubled places in the nation.
Naketra Guy thought about how her son overcame losing his father at age 4 and was the glue of the family. She called him “humble” and “respectful,” a leader in the community and on the football field, where he shined.
Yet he could not outrun the grim statistics of his hometown. Bogalusa posts some of the worst health outcomes and poverty in Louisiana, a state that routinely ranks among the worst nationally in both. And Bogalusa has endured another indicator of poor public health: high levels of gun violence.
Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, gun violence has shattered any sense of peace or progress here. Louisiana suffers the nation’s second-highest firearm death rate — and Bogalusa, a predominantly Black community with 10,000 residents, has seen dozens of shootings and a violent crime rate approaching twice the national average.
A nearby team refused to play football at Bogalusa High School in fall 2022, citing safety concerns.
  A few blocks from a containerboard mill, the main drag in Bogalusa is littered with empty storefronts and boarded buildings. The state announced tax incentives for the mill in 2021, promising “economic prosperity.” (Fred Clasen-Kelly/KFF Health News)
Bogalusa’s mayor, Tyrin Truong, was elected in 2022 at age 23 on his promises to fix entrenched challenges: few youth programs and good jobs, and perpetual crime and blight.
“I ran for mayor because I got sick of seeing our city painted as mini-New Orleans,” he said, “due to the high levels of youth gun violence.”
In January, the Louisiana State Police arrested Truong, accusing him of soliciting a prostitute and participating in a drug trafficking ring that allegedly used illicit proceeds to buy firearms. He has said he is innocent. “I still haven’t been formally arraigned,” he told KFF Health News in late July, “and I haven’t been charged with anything.”
Every year tens of thousands of Americans — one every few minutes — are killed by gun violence on the scale of a public health epidemic.
Many thousands more are left to recover from severe injuries, crushing medical debt, and the mental health toll of losing loved ones.
Most headlines focus on America’s urban centers, but the numbers also reflect the growth of gun violence in places like Bogalusa, a pinprick of a town 75 miles north of New Orleans. In 2020, the gun violence death rate for rural communities was 40% higher than in large metropolitan areas, according to Johns Hopkins University.
Firearms are the No. 1 killer of children in the U.S., and no group suffers more than young Black people. More Black boys and men ages 15 to 24 in 2023 were killed in gun homicides than from the next 15 leading causes of deaths combined. Though overall U.S. homicides dropped sharply after the pandemic ended, adolescent gun deaths climbed even higher in the years after, according to research by Jonathan Jay, an associate professor in the School of Public Health at Boston University.
“It has all the markers of an epidemic. It is a major driver of death and disability,” Jay said. “Gun violence does not get the attention it deserves. It is underrecognized because it disproportionately impacts Black and brown people.”

Rather than bolstering efforts to save lives, federal, state, and local government officials have undermined them. KFF Health News undertook an examination of gun violence since the pandemic, a period when firearm death rates surged. Reporters reviewed government reports and academic research and interviewed dozens of health policy experts, activists, and victims or their relatives. They reviewed corporate earnings reports from gun manufacturers and data on the industry’s donations to politicians.
In polling published in 2023 by KFF, more than half of Americans said they or a family member had been impacted by gun violence such as by seeing a shooting or being threatened, injured, or killed with a gun.
American politicians and regulators have put in place laws and practices that have helped enrich firearm and ammunition manufacturers — which tout $91 billion in economic impact — even as gun violence has terrorized neighborhoods already damaged by white flight, systemic disinvestment, and other forms of racial discrimination.
President Donald Trump championed gun rights on the campaign trail and has received millions from the National Rifle Association, to whose members he promised, “No one will lay a finger on your firearms.” His administration has rolled back efforts under President Joe Biden to address the rise in gun violence.
Emboldened in his second term, Trump is pushing to allow more guns in schools, weaken federal oversight of the gun industry, override state and local gun laws, permit sales without background checks, and cut funding for violence intervention.
Trump ordered the attorney general to review all Biden administration actions that “purport to promote safety but may have impinged on the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens.”
The Biden administration said “a historic spike in homicides” during the pandemic took its greatest toll on racially segregated and high-poverty neighborhoods.
Black youths in four major cities were 100 times as likely as white ones to experience a firearm assault, research showed. Gun suicides reached an all-time high, and for the first time the firearm suicide rate among older Black teens surpassed that of older white teens.
In Bogalusa, the pandemic gun violence spread fear. Among the victims killed were a 15-year-old attending a birthday party and a 24-year-old nationally known musician. Thirteen people were injured at a memorial for a man who himself had been shot. Residents said neighbors stopped sitting in their yards because of stray bullets.
Researchers say communities like Bogalusa endure a collective trauma that shatters their sense of safety. Two years after Forbes’ death, his mother says that when she leaves home her surviving children worry that she, too, might get shot.
Repercussions from the surge will last years, researchers said: Exposure to shootings increases risk for post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, suicide, depression, substance abuse, and poor school performance for survivors and those who live near them.
“We saw gun violence exposure go up for every group of children except white children, in the cities we studied,” Jay said. “Limits on government funding into gun violence research may stop us from ever knowing exactly why.”
Politics of pain
The year before Forbes died in Bogalusa, Biden signed into law the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, considered the most sweeping firearm legislation in decades.
In a matter of months, Trump has systematically dismantled key provisions.
Efforts to regulate guns have long proven ineffective against the power of political and business interests that fill the streets with weapons. In 2020, the number of guns manufactured annually in the U.S. hit 11.3 million, more than double a decade earlier, according to the federal government. In 2022, the United States had nearly 78,000 licensed gun dealers, more than its combined number of McDonald’s, Burger King, Wendy’s, and Subway locations, according to Everytown for Gun Safety, an advocacy group.

The Biden administration announced in 2021 it would attempt to reduce gun violence by adopting a “zero tolerance” policy toward firearm dealers who committed violations such as failing to run a required background check or selling to someone prohibited from buying a gun.
The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, or ATF, which licenses gun dealers, has the authority to enforce laws meant to prevent illegal gun sales. In issuing an executive order, the Trump administration declared that, under Biden, the agency targeted “mom-and-pop shop small businesses who made innocent paperwork errors.”
From October 2010 to February 2022, the agency conducted more than 111,000 inspections, recommending revocation of a dealer’s license only 589 times, about 0.5% of cases, an inspector general’s report said. Even when it cited serious violations, the ATF rarely shut dealers down.
ATF leaders told the inspector general’s office that recommendations for license revocations increased after Biden’s zero-tolerance policy was implemented. In April, the Trump administration repealed it.
Surgeon General Vivek Murthy last year declared firearm violence a public health crisis. Within weeks of Trump’s inauguration, his administration removed the advisory. Of the 15 leading U.S. causes of death, firearm injuries received less research funding from the National Institutes of Health for each person who died than all but poisoning and falls, according to an analysis in 2024 by Brady, an anti-gun violence organization. Trump is trying to cut that funding, too.
Trump’s Department of Justice abruptly cut 373 grants in April for projects worth about $820 million, with a large share from gun violence intervention.
“We are going to lose a generation of community violence prevention folks,” said Volkan Topalli, a gun violence researcher at Georgia State University. “People are going to die, I’m sorry to say, but that is the bleak truth of this.”
Asked about its policies, the White House did not address questions about public health considerations around gun violence.
“Illegal violence of any sort is a crime issue, and President Trump has been clear since Day One that he is committed to Making America Safe Again by empowering law enforcement to uphold law and order,” White House spokesperson Kush Desai said.

Trump administration officials “want safer streets and less violence,” Topalli said. “They are hurting their cause.”
Garen Wintemute, an emergency medicine professor who directs the violence prevention program at the University of California-Davis, was among the first in the nation to consider guns and violence as a public health issue. He said race plays a significant role in perceptions about gun violence.
“People look at the demographic risk for firearm homicide and depending on the demographics of the people in the audience, I can see the transformation in their faces,” Wintemute said. “It’s like they’re saying, ‘Not my people, not my problem.’”
Eroding gun restrictions
Trump’s incursions against public health efforts to contain gun violence are backed by lobbying power.
Firearm industry advocacy groups made millions of dollars in political donations in recent years, mostly to conservative causes and Republican candidates. That includes $1.4 million to Trump, according to OpenSecrets, which tracks campaign finance data.
The assassination of civil rights icon the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. helped lead to the passage of the federal Gun Control Act of 1968, which imposed stricter licensing rules and outlawed the sale of firearms and ammunition to felons.
While it remains the law of the land, over time, federal and state government actions have significantly weakened its protections.
Most states now allow people to carry concealed weapons without a permit or background check, even though research suggests the practice can increase the risk of firearm homicides.
In Louisiana, Democratic former Gov. John Bel Edwards, in office from 2016 to 2024, vetoed a bill that would have allowed people to carry concealed firearms without a permit.
Elected in 2023, Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed a law to allow any person over age 18 to conceal-carry without a permit.
The Trump administration has created a task force to implement his executive order to end most gun regulations and which would allow more people with criminal convictions, including for domestic abuse, to own guns.
Figures vary, but some researchers estimate as many as 500 million guns circulate in the U.S. Sales reached record highs during the pandemic and publicly traded firearm and ammunition companies saw profits jump.
Donald Trump Jr. this summer joined the board of GrabAGun, an online gun retailer that went public in July under the stock ticker PEW. In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the company, which markets guns to people ages 18 to 44, cited “gun violence prevention and legislative advocacy organizations that oppose sales of firearms and ammunition” as threats to its sales growth.

Dave Workman, a gun rights advocate with the Second Amendment Foundation, said firearms are not to blame for the surge in pandemic shootings.
“Bad guys are going to do what bad guys are going to do regardless of the law,” Workman said. “Taking away gun rights is not going to reduce crime.”
David Yamane, a Wake Forest University sociology professor and national authority on guns, said the U.S. firearm debate is complex and the industry is often “painted with too broad a brush.”
Most guns will never be used to kill anyone, he said. Americans tend to buy more guns during times of unrest, Yamane added: “It’s part of the American tradition. Guns are seen as a legitimate tool for defending yourself.”
‘A low level of hope’
Once called “the Magic City,” Bogalusa has become a grim symbol of deindustrialization.
Bogalusa emerged as Black people formed their own communities in the time of Jim Crow racial segregation at the turn of the 20th century.
Racism concentrated Black people in neighborhoods that became epicenters of poor health, reflected in high rates of cancer, asthma, chronic stress, preterm births, pregnancy-related complications — and, over recent decades, firearm violence.
Thousands flocked to Bogalusa after the Great Southern Lumber Company built one of the world’s biggest sawmills, establishing Bogalusa as a company town. Racial tensions soon followed.
Members of the local Deacons for Defense and Justice gained national attention in the 1960s for protecting civil rights organizers from the Ku Klux Klan, a hate group that burned houses and churches, terrorizing and killing Black people.
As the mill changed hands over the decades, Bogalusa’s fortunes slid. In the mid-20th century, the population surpassed 20,000, but it is now about half that.
International Paper, a Fortune 500 company based in Tennessee, runs the mill as a containerboard factory, employing about 650 people. In 2021, the state announced incentives for the company that included a $500,000 tax break, saying the move would help bring “prosperity.”

Businesses remain boarded up along the main drag. Houses still bear damage from Hurricane Katrina, and many streets are eerily quiet.
Nearly 1 in 3 people in Bogalusa live in poverty — 2½ times the national average.
Bogalusa’s violent gun crime rate reached 646.1 per 100,000 people in 2022, higher than Louisiana’s and 1.7 times the national one, according to the nonprofit Equal Justice USA, citing FBI Uniform Crime Reporting data.
In many rural towns across the South, “there is a level of desperation that is more apparent” than in other parts of the U.S., said Luke Shaefer, a University of Michigan professor of social justice and public policy.
“They don’t have the same infrastructure to have robust social services. People are like, ‘What are my life chances?’” Shaefer said. “People feel like there is nothing that can be done. There is a low level of hope.”
Missed opportunities
Mayor Truong lamented the violence in Bogalusa after Forbes was killed, writing on Facebook, “When are we as a community going to come together and decide enough is enough?”
The federal government had offered one path forward.
The Biden administration provided billions of dollars to local governments through the American Rescue Plan Act during the pandemic. Biden urged them to deploy money to community violence intervention programs, shown to reduce homicides by as much as 60%.
A handful of cities seized the opportunity, but most did not. Bogalusa has received $4.25 million in ARPA funds since 2021. None appears to have gone toward violence prevention.

The Louisiana legislative auditor, Michael Waguespack, found that Bogalusa used nearly $500,000 for employee bonuses, which his report said may have violated state law. In some cases, the report says, payments were not tied to work performed.
Bogalusa officials did not respond to a public records request from KFF Health News seeking detailed information about its ARPA money.
Former Mayor Wendy O’Quin-Perrette, who served from 2015 through early 2023, told Waguespack in a June 2024 letter that the city used ARPA money to improve streets and pay the bonuses. “We would not have done it without being sure it was allowed,” she said.
O’Quin-Perrette did not respond to requests for comment.
In a 2023 letter to Waguespack, O’Quin-Perrette’s successor, Truong, wrote that Bogalusa officials didn’t know how the federal money was spent. When he took office, Truong alleged, officials discovered “tens of thousands of dollars of checks and cash” stashed “in various drawers and on desks” in city offices.
Truong defended his stewardship of ARPA funds, saying that about $1 million remained when he assumed office but that the money was needed for more urgent sewer infrastructure repairs. “I wish we could have invested more, invested any money in gun violence prevention efforts,” he said.
In an interview, Truong said the city has been “intentional” about bringing down gun violence, including through a summer jobs program. He pointed to statistics that show homicides decreased from nine in 2022 to two in 2024. “If you keep them busy, they won’t have time to do anything else,” he said.
Asked about his January arrest, Truong said he has political enemies.
“I’m the only Democrat in a very red part of the state, and, you know, I’ve made a lot of changes at City Hall, and that ticks people off,” Truong told KFF Health News. He said that he ended long-standing city contracts with local businesspeople. “When you’re shaking up power structures, you become a target.”
Josie Alexander, a Louisiana-based senior strategist for Equal Justice USA, said city officials missed an opportunity when they didn’t use ARPA funds for gun violence prevention. “The sad thing is people here can now see that money was coming in,” she said. “But it just wasn’t used the way it needed to be.”
‘Too much trouble here’
Truong said the city is still reeling from the pandemic spike in violent crime. He said he was at Bogalusa High School’s homecoming football game in 2022 when one teen shot another. Shots rang out, Truong said, and he grabbed his 3-month-old son and “laid in the bleachers.”
“It’s not a foreign topic to hardly anybody in town, whether you’ve heard the gunshots in the distance, whether you have attended a funeral of somebody who passed due to gun violence,” he said. Many still grapple with trauma.
In December 2022, Khlilia Daniels said, she hosted a birthday party for her teenage niece, praying no one would bring a gun.
The hosts checked guests for weapons, she said.
Yet gunfire erupted, Daniels said. Three teens were shot, including 15-year-old Ronié Taylor, who died, according to police.
“When someone you know is killed, you never forget,” said Daniels, 32, who held Taylor until emergency responders arrived.

Tajdryn Forbes was planning his future when he was killed, likely because of a dispute that started on social media over lyrics in a rap song, Guy said.
In a Facebook post in January, Bogalusa police said they had arrested someone in connection with Forbes’ killing. Authorities had previously announced the arrest of a teen in connection with the homicide.
Forbes had been a high school football standout, like his late father, Charles Forbes Jr., who played semipro. When Forbes scored a touchdown, he would look to the sky to honor his dad.
The school praised Forbes for his senior baseball season in a social media post: “This young man makes a difference on our campus and on the field with his strong character.”
When hopes for a college football scholarship did not pan out, Forbes worked as a deckhand for a marine transportation company. He saved money, looking forward to moving to Slidell, a suburb of New Orleans.
“He would always say, ‘There’s too much trouble here’” in Bogalusa, Guy recalled.
  Tajdryn Forbes was the glue of his family, mother Naketra Guy said. She called him “humble” and “respectful,” a leader in the community and on the football field, where he shined. (Photo courtesy of Kevin Magee)

Santiago/Getty Images)BILOXI, Miss. — The Trump administration is developing a powerful data tool it claims will let states identify noncitizens registered to vote. But Democratic critics and data experts warn it could allow the federal government to vacuum up vast quantities of information on Americans for unclear purposes.
Some Democratic election officials and opponents of the effort fear President Donald Trump wants to build a federal database of voters to target political opponents or cherry-pick rare examples of noncitizen voters to fuel a sense of crisis. Republican election officials allied with the president counter that he’s helping states to maintain accurate voter rolls.
The Trump administration has rolled out changes to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, tool at the same time the U.S. Department of Justice is asking states for copies of their voter rolls. The timing, combined with questions about what happens to voter data uploaded to the program, has alarmed critics.
Trump wants Congress to pass a national proof of citizenship voter registration requirement and in March tried to unilaterally impose one for federal elections through executive order. But with the legislation stalled and the order halted by the courts, the citizenship data tool may offer a backdoor way to accomplish the same goal.
SAVE was originally intended to help state and local officials verify the immigration status of individual noncitizens seeking government benefits. But U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, this spring refashioned it into a platform that can scan states’ voter rolls if election officials upload the data.
The changes to SAVE, rolled out over just a few months and with little public debate, are “tinkering with sort of the bones of democracy,” said John Davisson, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington, D.C.-based research and advocacy group that argues privacy is a fundamental right.
“You’re talking about the voting process and who will be eligible to vote,” Davisson said. “And to take a system that is not designed for use in that process and repurpose it, really on the fly, without a formal comment process, without formal rulemaking, without congressional intervention — that’s pretty anomalous and pretty alarming.”
Previously, SAVE could only search one name at a time. Now it can conduct bulk searches, allowing state officials to potentially feed into it information on millions of registered voters. SAVE checks that information against a series of federal databases and reports back whether it can verify someone’s immigration status.
Since May, it also can draw upon Social Security data, transforming the program into a tool that can confirm citizenship because Social Security records for many, but not all, Americans include the information. NPR reported earlier on changes to SAVE.
“It is incredible what has been done, really since March,” Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray, a Republican who supports proof of citizenship requirements and the SAVE tool, told a gathering of state secretaries of state in Biloxi, Mississippi, last week.
Individuals registering to vote in federal elections must already sign a statement affirming they are citizens under penalty of perjury, and those who cast a ballot face criminal penalties and deportation. One study of the 2016 election placed the prevalence of noncitizen voting at 0.0001% of votes cast.
But as Trump has spread falsehoods about elections, Republicans have made purging noncitizens from voter rolls a central focus.
Democratic concerns were on display last week at the National Association of Secretaries of State conference, held at the Beau Rivage casino-resort in Biloxi. In interviews on the sidelines of the conference, Democratic secretaries of state voiced deep reservations — or outright opposition — about plugging their voter data into SAVE.
Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said Aug. 6 that the federal government appeared to be trying to take over election administration. She formally rejected the Justice Department’s voter roll request two days later.
Bellows said the Department of Homeland Security told her in a recent phone call that it planned to retain SAVE data for 10 years for “audit purposes only.”
“Just like the [Justice Department] is asking us to hand over an electronic file of all the voters in our state, it seems like the Department of Homeland Security is through this backdoor system also asking us to share voter information about every voter in our state,” Bellows said.
At least one state appears to have granted the federal government sweeping authority over any voter data it provides to SAVE.
Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales announced in July he had reached an agreement with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to access the newly expanded system for voter list maintenance. Indiana’s agreement allows the federal agency to use information the state provides for any purpose permitted by law, including criminal prosecutions.
Morales, a Republican, said in a news release that SAVE represented “another step in safeguarding the rights” of eligible voters. His office didn’t respond to Stateline’s questions.










When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances. 


– Minnesota Democratic Secretary of State Steve Simon


The Trump administration has ramped up efforts to encourage state election officials to use the expanded program. The White House hosted a bipartisan “fly in” event for state secretaries of state on July 29. Multiple secretaries of state told Stateline that USCIS Director Joseph Edlow, who was confirmed on July 15, spoke at the event.
“The president is very much keyed in on voter list maintenance,” Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, a Republican, said in an interview — echoing other GOP secretaries of state who released statements praising the Trump administration after the meeting.
Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, a Democrat who attended the meeting, said he questioned how the federal government would handle voter information provided to SAVE. He added that the Justice Department’s request for his state’s voter rolls raised his level of concern about how data would be used.
“When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances,” Simon told Stateline.
The White House referred questions about SAVE and the event to the Department of Homeland Security and USCIS.
In response to questions from Stateline, USCIS didn’t directly answer whether the agency would share voter roll data with other parts of the federal government but confirmed it disposes of records after 10 years.
“The SAVE application is a critical tool for state and local governments to access information to safeguard the integrity of elections across the country. It’s no wonder many states have quickly adopted it, and we continue to promote the tool to other states and counties not using SAVE,” USCIS spokesperson Matthew Tragesser said in a statement.
“We look forward to continued optimization efforts and implementing more updates to SAVE.”
GOP pressure
Some Republican election officials and Trump allies have long wanted the federal government to take an expanded role in searching state voter rolls for noncitizens.
Last summer the Trump-aligned litigation group America First Legal, co-founded by Trump adviser Stephen Miller, encouraged states to submit to the Department of Homeland Security the names of individuals for citizenship or immigration status verification.
Some states did just that. Texas, for example, asked USCIS to verify the citizenship of some voters in September, and Indiana asked the agency to verify 585,774 voters in October. The same month, 16 Republican state attorneys general signed a letter criticizing Homeland Security, then under the Biden administration, for failing to work with states on verification.

After Trump took office, GOP state officials kept up the pressure. Twenty-one Republican secretaries of state urged Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in February to prioritize SAVE improvements.
On April 16, Indiana sued the department in federal court for not responding to its verification request last fall. USCIS announced an overhaul of SAVE less than a week later.
As the agency continues to remake SAVE, the tool will soon allow searches using the last four digits of a Social Security number, multiple state secretaries of state told Stateline. The agency confirmed the feature is under development and will be available soon but didn’t provide an exact date.
The change would mark another significant expansion of the program because most states collect the last four digits when individuals without a driver’s license register to vote.
Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican, said SAVE represents a better way to verify citizenship than a state law requiring voters to produce documents. “I think there’s a real opportunity for us to do a lot of this through just sharing of information and I think that’s what we’re seeing happen,” McGrane said in an interview.
Unreliable data?
But some voting rights advocates and experts on government data caution against an overreliance on Social Security data.
The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, a progressive policy nonprofit, has noted that Social Security only began tracking the citizenship status of all applicants in 1978 — meaning the database doesn’t include comprehensive citizenship information for older Americans. Additionally, Social Security may not always have up-to-date information on the status of naturalized U.S. citizens.
The nonpartisan Institute for Responsive Government also warned in May that since SAVE hasn’t used Social Security numbers to verify citizenship in the past, its accuracy and effectiveness are unknown. The success of the expanded SAVE program may also partially depend on whether it has adequate staff and resources, it said.
A 2017 Government Accountability Office report found that between fiscal years 2012 and 2016, about 16% of the nearly 90 million SAVE searches required additional verification, which the institute says often translates into federal workers manually checking files. Now that SAVE allows bulk searches, the need for manual checking could rise dramatically.
Nick Doctor, director of implementation at the Institute for Responsive Government, said in an interview that a tool confirming the eligibility of registered voters in a way that doesn’t burden individuals can be a good thing. But he emphasized that it depends in large measure on SAVE’s implementation.
“The changes that have been made to SAVE happened very quickly and, to my knowledge, we haven’t seen releases on the level of accuracy of that information,” Doctor said.
During interviews, Republican secretaries of state stressed that voters aren’t kicked off the rolls because SAVE can’t verify their citizenship. Instead, an inability to verify would likely trigger a follow-up process with the voter.
“Just because we get something back from the SAVE database, it’s not a cut and dry, especially on those they’re not sure about,” Hoskins, the Missouri secretary of state, said.
Still, Arizona illustrates why some Democrats worry about any large-scale effort to ask voters — especially longtime, older residents — to prove their citizenship. After the state discovered errors in how it tracked voter citizenship dating back years, election officials are contacting some 200,000 voters seeking proof of citizenship documentation.
Some have been casting ballots for decades without incident and many feel targeted, Arizona Democratic Secretary of State Adrian Fontes said during a presentation at the state secretaries of state conference. “They feel insulted when they get that letter,” Fontes said.
Charles Stewart III, a professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies elections, said Arizona may actually point to the potential usefulness of SAVE. If Arizona runs its voter roll through the program, a list of 200,000 voters needing citizenship verification would perhaps drop into the hundreds, he suggested.
“There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside,” Stewart said.
Connecticut Democratic Secretary of State Stephanie Thomas told Stateline that every secretary wants tools to keep voter lists as clean as possible. But the details are important.
When she hears of something new, Thomas said she asks whether it’s the best option available and whether “the i’s are dotted, the t’s crossed.” She said she’s asked USCIS a series of questions about SAVE and is waiting on some responses.
“When it comes to voter lists,” Thomas said, “I don’t want Connecticut voters to be a guinea pig.”

That’s more than their current total electric load of 760 megawatts. That amount of power would use all of NorthWestern’s existing generation capacity.
You would think that this monopoly business and its top brass would be satisfied with its current situation. In exchange for providing power to its current customer base (that’s us), they receive a virtual guarantee they will not lose their investment for any reason. They also get a guaranteed rate of return on their investments that hovers around 10%. That is for the entire life of the facility regardless of economic conditions or competition.
In exchange for running this sleepy little monopoly, which is headquartered in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, their current CEO, Brian Bird, received $4.8 million in 2024. The 2023 corporate proxy statement lists Board Chairwoman Linda Sullivan receiving an annual retainer of $150,000 plus 3,750 shares of stock. Current price per share is around $55. For comparison, the manager of Flathead Electric Cooperative, the largest public power provider in Montana, receives just under $550,000 per year.
But now NorthWestern wants to take on a lot of risk building new facilities and making investments betting on the latest fashion trend to come down the pike — data centers. And if they miss their bet, we all suffer the consequences. Maybe the business booster crowd needs a history lesson.
In 1971, the Bureau of Reclamation released the North Central Power Study. The plan called for massive coal development on the northern plains. In Montana alone, they envisioned 17 coal plants roughly the size of the Colstrip plants. Of course, the Montana Power Company (NorthWestern Energy’s predecessor) and other corporate interests in Montana were all for it. For them, the environmental degradation and negative impact on existing ag producers and others were worth the cost.
But ranchers, Native tribes, and many others were not convinced. They organized to oppose the massive development being proposed by the coal and utility industries. In the end, only four plants were built and owned by a consortium of utilities. It also spawned two of the most powerful citizen groups in the state — The Montana Environmental Information Center and Northern Plains Resource Council. To this day, they remain actively engaged in protecting Montana’s people and environment from corporate interests seeking a quick dollar.
Fast forward to 1997 and the electric deregulation fiasco. Management of the Montana Power Company became bored with the stodgy old regulated utility business. So they decided to sell off the power plants and power lines they owned. They took all of that money and dumped it into Touch America, a fledgling telecommunications company. In short order, Touch America went bankrupt and all of that money evaporated. Montana suffered through years of economic chaos. We went from some of the lowest customer rates in the country to some of the highest rates in the Northwest. NorthWestern is now proposing significant rate increases on a regular basis, while still trying to acquire worn out, expensive coal plants in the Colstrip complex.
In the emerging world of huge data centers serving everything from artificial intelligence to cryptocurrency ponzi schemes, NorthWestern sees a new shiny object on the horizon: Huge electric loads required by data centers. Unfortunately, this confronts us when the national government is run by delusional ideologues. Here in Montana, billionaire tech moguls and far-right legislators are running state government. The Public Service Commission, which should be protecting us from the greed of corporate CEOs, looks more like the clown show in a three-ring circus.
Strap in and hold onto your wallets, folks. It’s gonna be a wild ride.

(Photo by Chris Dorst | Charleston Gazette-Mail)In 1894, Charleston celebrated a milestone: the dedication of the city’s first synagogue on Virginia Street. It was more than a religious occasion. Gov. William A. MacCorkle attended, alongside the state treasurer and Christian clergy. Rabbi Isaac M. Wise — one of the most influential Jewish leaders in American history — spoke to a sanctuary filled with neighbors of many denominations.
This wasn’t unusual for West Virginia in that era. Across the state, the dedication of a synagogue was a civic moment — a declaration that Jewish life was part of the community’s moral and cultural landscape.
Consider Wheeling just a few years earlier. On June 1, 1891, children from the nearby Clay School played among the foundations of the new Eoff Street Temple before the cornerstone ceremony began. Their names — along with those of the synagogue’s Sunday school students — were placed inside the cornerstone, sealed alongside other mementos marking the occasion.
When the cornerstone was laid, “not nearly all those present were of the Jewish race,” the Wheeling Intelligencer reported. Prominent citizens, including at least one Christian minister, stood shoulder to shoulder with the congregation. Some lingered afterward to offer congratulations on “their good fortune in having gotten so well along on so pretty a house of worship.”
Nearly a year later, when the temple was dedicated, Christians again filled the pews. Representatives came from First Presbyterian, St. John’s German Evangelical and Zane Street Methodist Churches. They gathered not because of crisis or obligation, but in joy — affirming their neighbors’ dignity across lines of faith.
Two decades later, in Martinsburg, that same spirit of public celebration took the form of a street procession. In September 1912, Beth Jacob, the city’s new synagogue on East Pennsylvania Avenue, was dedicated over the course of three days. The highlight came on the afternoon of September 10, when a Torah scroll — handwritten by a scribe over hundreds of hours — was carried from Rabbi Morris Levin’s house on East Liberty Street to the synagogue, which had previously been home to the First United Brethren Church.
A band played at the head of the line. Members of the Jewish community walked alongside friends and onlookers from other traditions. The Evening Journal reported that it was “a sight that aroused much respect along the route of the march.” The Torah itself had traveled from Baltimore, connecting Martinsburg to a wider network of Jewish life even as the city’s own residents made it a local occasion.
These moments from generations ago still teach lessons for today. In an age before interfaith dialogue was a formal concept, West Virginians practiced it in the most tangible way: by showing up. They saw the construction of a synagogue as a shared investment in the city’s future, worth celebrating whether or not they would ever worship there.
It is striking to think that Charleston’s first synagogue dedication drew the state’s top elected officials, that Wheeling’s temple carried the names of public schoolchildren in its cornerstone, and that Martinsburg’s Torah procession wound its way through city streets accompanied by music. These were not quiet, private milestones. They were public affirmations that a house of worship — whatever the tradition — was a gift to the whole community.
Today, we often hear about religious differences as points of division. Yet our own history shows that they can also be points of connection. The stories of Charleston, Wheeling and Martinsburg remind us that faith communities can thrive when they are embraced — not merely tolerated — by the wider public.
For generations, we have known what it means to stand with one another across lines of difference. Over a century ago, West Virginians did it in joy — carrying forward an American tradition that the opening of a new sacred space strengthens the civic fabric for everyone. That belief is worth remembering — and carrying forward.

,Mississippi Today,2025-08-20 09:55:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,"This superintendent took a failing Delta school district to a ‘B’ rating. Now, she’s leaving",Devna Bose,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/08/20/mississippi-delta-superintendent-turns-failing-schools-around/,"Davis, a native of the Mississippi Delta, soon learned she had a particular gift for turning failing schools around.","INDIANOLA — The top of the Jeep was down, and Miskia Davis was behind the wheel, leading a parade through downtown Indianola.
It was 2019, just two years after the now 50-year-old Davis became superintendent of Sunflower County Consolidated School District. Back then, she wasn’t sure this moment would ever come. 
She recalled feeling the first cool breeze of October as she waved at people who lined the street, smiling and celebrating.

But it had — the district’s first “C” rating, its first passing grade, and the community had shown up to a parade to celebrate the achievement. Generations of teachers and Sunflower County graduates stood on the sidewalk, proudly cheering the assembly of cars and students.
“It was … Oh my God,” Davis said. “My children were like, ‘We did something.’”
The work hadn’t been easy, but it had been worth it, Davis thought — the number crunching, the doubt and lukewarm welcome she felt from the community, the tough decisions she’d had to make.
Now, she’s ready to move on.
Daughter of the Delta
From starting kindergarten to subbing for elementary classes, Davis’ childhood and career in Sunflower County and her identity as a daughter of the Delta were her strengths in the classroom, she said.
“I grew up in Drew, poor and with two young parents,” Davis said. “We didn’t have elaborate meals, and when I went home, the lights may have been off. But it made me who I am, and these children were experiencing the same things I experienced as a child.”
So Davis was relatable. But as a young high school teacher at Ruleville Central High School, some of her students looked older than her and many were taller than she was. She was forced to learn how to command respect, too. 
One particular child taught her an invaluable lesson. He was a star football player in her biology class, and he was failing the course by two points. He caused trouble in class and Davis was determined to fail him, despite more experienced teachers prodding her not to, to look past her own ego. 
So Davis gave him another chance. She had him do extra work and spent hours talking to him. She learned why he behaved poorly in class — he was one of seven children to a young, single mother. 
“He was angry at the world, and I just happened to be in the world,” she said. “It taught me the power of relationships. I think that’s the most important catalyst in transforming education.”
It was during that time that her superintendent “saw something” in her and pushed her to become a school leader. That kickstarted her journey in administration.

Davis soon learned she had a particular gift for turning failing schools around. Under her leadership as principal, Ruleville Middle School went from failing to an “A” letter grade in three years. 
Her school improvement strategy began to take shape, similar to her teaching style. Davis was both a disciplinarian and someone to whom teachers and students could relate. She prioritized building strong relationships with teachers who were invested in their students. But she didn’t shy away from making controversial decisions, either. In Ruleville, she fired nearly all of the staff when she arrived. 
But as Davis was gaining her footing as an administrator, Sunflower County School District was struggling. 
After consistent failing grades resulted in the state takeovers of Indianola, Sunflower and Drew school districts, the Legislature decided to consolidate the three systems in 2012. 
District consolidation is a massive undertaking for any community, but especially for Sunflower County — smack dab in the middle of the Delta, an under-resourced region with a shrinking population, high poverty rates and a deep history of racial exploitation.
Davis arrived in 2014 to a school district that had lost hope — a district that she didn’t recognize.
All Sunflower knew was ‘failure’
Davis never wanted to be superintendent. 
She spent three years working under the leader of the consolidated district. But when the superintendent was dismissed in 2017, Davis was appointed to the head role in an interim capacity. She got the job in January of 2018 without ever applying.
So with another state takeover looming, Davis went to work. The biggest challenge? The district and the community seemed resigned to failure. 
“We had been failing so long, that’s all we knew,” she said. “No one was even sad.”
Early on, Davis visited a school to discuss recent test results. She was so struck by teachers’ apathy that she stopped the meeting midway and had them tear off a scrap of paper and write “yes” or “no” to a question: Did the teachers believe their school could ever be successful? 
More than half said no.
“They were teaching my children,” Davis said, tearing up. “And they didn’t think they would ever be successful.”
Davis went to the school board to tell members that she wouldn’t be renewing many of those teachers’ contracts. That’s when she realized she didn’t just need to boost test scores — she needed to change attitudes. 

The hashtag #WINNING, pictured here in a parade in October 2019, was coined by Superintendent Miskia Davis.

The hashtag #WINNING was born.
“We started to celebrate every little accomplishment,” Davis said. “We got T-shirts, shades, whatever. That was our mantra.”
Children received certificates for a week of perfect attendance. When students did well on benchmark assessments, teachers were ushered into the hallway to be celebrated by students and colleagues. Davis created the “Killin’ It” awards, given to students and teachers for meeting their testing benchmarks. 
They were just certificates, at the end of the day. But it led to a changed school culture, a renewed belief that they could succeed. 
As an administrator, Davis leaned on what she knew worked as a teacher, relationship-building and strong discipline (she even sent her nephew to alternative school for fighting), and combined it with a data-driven approach and an eagle-eyed focus on testing. 
She put an academic coach in every building, whose sole responsibility was supporting teachers. 
Davis took teacher Dylan Jones out of the classroom and put him in the central office, where he was tasked with tracking district metrics. 
Jones uncovered which consultants were working and which were uselessly costing the district millions. The district went from contracting with 30 firms to just four. 
Jones also created an accountability system for teachers. With one click, Davis could see how each teacher’s students were performing, and she gave everyone access to the data. If teachers weren’t meeting their goals, Davis hosted regular meetings and had them explain — in front of everyone — what they needed to succeed. 
Davis’ methods weren’t popular at first. Educators went to the school board and complained that the system was “punitive.” Some even quit. But Davis was steadfast and implored board members to see the work she and her team could do, if given the chance. 
The district’s rating didn’t budge in 2018. 
But in fall 2019, after Davis’ first full year as superintendent, Sunflower County Consolidated School District had earned its first “C” rating.
What happened after the first ‘C’
Those early years were difficult, Davis remembered, because she felt so isolated, just her and her team “in the trenches.”
She hosted community meetings, imploring local parents, leaders and business owners to support the district. 
“They told me to come back when we were no longer failing,” Davis said.
So after that first “C,” when she started seeing the district’s hashtags on Facebook, when more people started coming to school events, when she started to get invited to speak at the local Rotary Club, it was bittersweet. 
Teachers, too, took a while to come around. Their performance was being closely monitored through the accountability system, but soon they realized that Davis wasn’t giving them mandates outside of improving test scores. She gave them autonomy in their classrooms. Teachers had the final say on how to improve their students’ achievement. That kind of trust isn’t common, Sunflower County teachers told Mississippi Today.
It wasn’t until 2021, when voters passed a $31 million bond issue that would pay for major school renovations, that Davis felt the full support of the community. 
Davis even won over Betty Petty, a local matriarch and fierce advocate for kids and parents. 
“She has actually shown a presence at the schools, constantly meeting with teachers and making sure all children are learning,” Petty said. “We had community meetings where she would actually come out and listen to our concerns.”
Petty attended the ribbon-cutting ceremony at Gentry High School last July. Before renovations, plumbing problems caused flooding when it rained, so students had to wade through water to get from class to class. Davis said she’d never forget the sight of generations of Gentry graduates in the school atrium, looking around in wonder at the new facility.
“At first, I chose the community,” Davis said. “But eventually, the community chose me.”

The legacy she leaves behind
Strong schools make strong communities, but it can take time for results to show. Indianola Mayor Ken Featherstone hopes to see the dividends soon. 
Featherstone took office four years ago, around the same time the district got its first “B” grade. It has maintained the grade ever since, the highest in the entire region.
He, like Davis, was reared in the Delta, but empathizes with her struggle garnering the support of a community deeply impacted by gun violence and low investment from state officials.

“People are very result-oriented,” he said, leaning back at his desk in city hall. “You till the soil, but it’s not until you start your seed breaking the ground do you see other people starting to water it. That’s just human nature.”
He’s hoping the district’s academic gains will be a boon for Indianola’s struggling economy.
“We’re seeing things slowly come to our area,” Featherstone said. “To get manufacturing jobs to come to our area, we have to improve our public school system. Directors and presidents of manufacturing plants … they need to know where their kids are going to attend school.”
Davis announced in October 2024 that she would be leaving the superintendent job at the end of the school year. Now, she travels the state, consulting with other districts on how to replicate what she did in Indianola, as a director of District and School Performance and Accountability for The Kirkland Group, an education consulting firm based in Ridgeland. 
Her departure was a tough blow, Featherstone said, and leaves the district’s hard-fought success hanging in balance. 
Petty and her network of parents are concerned, too. 
“I don’t think any of us know what will happen moving forward,” she said. 
Davis said there was no big epiphany. She just felt her mission was accomplished. She said she’s adamant that the district’s “best days are ahead,” under new superintendent James Johnson-Waldington. 
Johnson-Waldington, who was most recently serving as superintendent of Greenwood Leflore Consolidated School District, is also Sunflower-grown, and he was Davis’ principal when she taught at Ruleville Central High School. He plans on employing strategies similar to Davis: holding teachers accountable and celebrating their achievements. 
After all, if it’s working, why change it?
“I feel a good kind of pressure,” Johnson-Waldington said. “I like challenges, and this is a new challenge for me. I’m not taking a failing school district to success. This is about maintaining and growing, and I accept that challenge for the very reason that this is home. I’m going to work very hard to maintain what Miskia has done.”
Davis leaves behind a legacy, Featherstone said, that makes her hometown proud. He was in the crowd that day at the parade. He remembers the excitement, the pride. 
“Older teachers were there, and you could see the look on their faces that they knew they had reared someone who threw the oar out to a sinking district and brought it back up,” he said. 
“She made us see ourselves in a better light, and we can’t thank her enough.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/16124454/3X0A7632.jpg,,,2025-08-20 06:57:49.355378

(Getty Images)Kentucky advocates for people with Alzheimer’s are excited by new research showing that lifestyle interventions like exercising and learning can slow cognitive decline. 
Published in The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) in July, The U.S. POINTER Randomized Clinical Trial showed that being social and keeping the brain active can improve brain health over time. 
The Alzheimer’s Association, which helped fund the trial, says it’s the nation’s “first large-scale, randomized controlled clinical trial to demonstrate that an accessible and sustainable healthy lifestyle intervention can protect cognitive function in diverse populations in communities.” 
Erin Abner, the chair of the department of epidemiology and environmental health at the University of Kentucky  Sanders-Brown Center on Aging, said experts were already communicating to patients the importance of healthy lifestyle choices. 
Now, she said, this new research provides “additional evidence” that those interventions are effective in supporting brain health. 
Report shows effects of Alzheimer’s in KY, the disease ‘you can’t see’ 

Researchers haven’t been able to find a way to cure dementia, Abner said, and are looking for ways to slow cognitive decline or prevent it before it takes hold. 
“What this particular research builds on is the idea, I think, that heart health is brain health, and so how do we maximize our brain’s ability to resist maybe the things that we can’t stop from happening?” Abner said. 
Alzheimer’s disease, which falls under the umbrella of dementia, is characterized by memory loss and is incurable, though treatments exist. 
One of those treatments underwent clinical trials at the University of Kentucky, Lecanemab (brand name Leqembi). This is an antibody that targets — and in some cases, removes — amyloid plaques from the brain, and has shown some success in slowing cognitive decline. Amyloid plaques are proteins that form in the brain and are believed to be a significant driver of Alzheimer’s. Lecanemab was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2023. 
Abner said she was “excited” to learn at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference in Toronto this summer that Lecanemab is ”safer than we had hoped.” After two years on the market, she said, “we see less adverse events.” Lecanemab is approved by Medicare and some private insurers. 
Shannon White, executive director of the Alzheimer’s Association’s Greater Kentucky and Southern Indiana chapter, said lifestyle habits and medical treatments “go hand in hand” in managing symptoms.  
“What I am most excited about is that not only are we working on treatments once you are diagnosed, but at the same time, we are also working on how to prevent, slow or stop cognitive decline with brain health and prevention,” White said. “Working on both of those things at the same time is really exciting and proves that you just don’t have to look for a cure, that you can look for ways to improve your quality and length of life and possibly never have cognitive decline with some of these interventions.” 
More than 80,000 Kentucky residents 65 and older live with Alzheimer’s, and an estimated 160,000 people in the state provide unpaid care to their loved ones who have the condition. Those caregivers are providing a service worth $4.9 billion, the Lantern previously reported. 
White believes that if people at risk of dementia engage in these positive lifestyle behaviors, it can lessen this burden down the road. 
“If you do lifestyle interventions that could slow cognitive decline, and then if you do get a diagnosis and you are on treatments that could slow cognitive decline, that makes the caregiver burden less stressful,” White said. 
The U.S. Pointer study 
Over two years, researchers looked at two degrees of lifestyle interventions in more than 2,000 participants ages 60 to 79 who lived sedentary lifestyles and had a family history of dementia. 
“These are people with normal cognition, but at the right age and with the right sort of profile that we would expect them to start declining and developing cognitive impairment and dementia,” Abner explained.

Half of the study’s participants underwent a structured approach to lifestyle changes. Small groups of 10-15 met 38 times over the course of 2 years, went to the YMCA for exercise, got nutrition education, met with an Alzheimer’s Association coach and more. The other half followed a similar path of lifestyle changes, but with “less intensity,” Abner said. The groups with more intensive lifestyle interventions did best, but both groups did well. 
“What (researchers) found was that even with the less intense version of this — of simply helping people, giving them the materials, giving them the knowledge that exercise is important, heart health is important, your diet is important — both of those groups of people did better cognitively as the trial went on,” she said. “And so the people who got that really intense, structured intervention did better. But for me, the really good news is that the lighter intervention group also got better. Their cognition also improved.” 
Interventions will look different person by person, Abner said. It may include reading a book, learning something new like a language or instrument, taking classes, getting out of the house and into social settings, working out and more. People don’t have to go from 0 to 100 either, White said. 
“These are about small, incremental lifestyle changes, such as being more social, making sure you’re not lonely or isolated, having fun, doing brain games like Wordle or reading a book, taking a walk three or four days a week,” White said. “It doesn’t have to be … something that is going to turn your life upside down, but it’s just important to stay active, both mentally and physically, and also be sure that you are having fun and engaged in your community.” 
  Shannon White (photo provided)
Lexington leads the state with a “dementia friendly” business initiative and is “ahead of the curve,” White said, when it comes to being welcoming for people with Alzheimer’s. More than two dozen businesses, churches, health care providers and nonprofits have recognized the importance of people with Alzheimer’s being out in the community, and have trained employees on how to best accommodate forgetfulness, confusion or other issues that may arise.
“If someplace is dementia friendly,” White said, “then those waiters and waitresses and staff understand that someone might be coming in that has dementia and might need a little bit more time, or might need a little bit more understanding and care, when they’re in that setting.” 
Research makes clear that “being socially isolated is bad for us,” Abner said. Scientists will continue to communicate the wide-ranging benefits of being active and social, she said. 
Meanwhile, research into symptoms management is critical for people with Alzheimer’s and those at risk for Dementia. 
“I think there’s a lot to be excited about from the research that’s coming out now,”Abner said. “I hope that the public, especially the taxpaying public, starts to see some of these benefits and understand why we need to do this work.”

States and clinicians are working on getting correct information on vaccines to vulnerable groups amid shifting federal guidance. (Photo illustration by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Heading into the respiratory illness season, states and clinicians are working to encourage pregnant patients to get COVID-19 vaccinations, even though the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services no longer recommends that they should.
Along with being older and having an underlying health condition, pregnancy itself is a risk factor. Pregnant women are more vulnerable to developing severe illness from COVID-19. They’re also at high risk for complications, including preterm labor and stillbirth. The vast majority of medical experts say getting the shot is safe and effective — much safer than having the illness.
But HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced in May that the agency would no longer recommend that pregnant women get the vaccine. Before testifying before Congress in June, Kennedy circulated a document on Capitol Hill claiming higher rates of fetal loss after vaccination. But the authors of those studies told Politico that their work had been misinterpreted.
Experts say the federal shift puts the onus on state health agencies to ramp up vaccine guidance and outreach. Clinicians and public health organizations are trying to dispel misinformation and make sure information reaches low-income people and people of color, who had higher maternal death rates during the pandemic. During the first two years of the pandemic, the virus contributed to a quarter of maternal deaths, according to federal data.
“We are severely disappointed,” said Dr. Neil Silverman, a professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California, Los Angeles David Geffen School of Medicine. He has studied vaccines and pregnancy for the past 15 years and specializes in high-risk pregnancies.
Silverman called the federal shift a “public health tragedy on a grand scale.”
Vaccinations against COVID-19 help prevent severe illness in pregnant people as well as their newborns, who are too young to get vaccinated, Silverman said. In what’s called passive immunity, vaccinated mothers pass on antibodies to their babies through the placenta and through breast milk.
“State public health agencies are probably going to have to implement vaccine guidance that differs from the federal recommendations. And that’s going to be an interesting can of worms,” said OB-GYN Dr. Mark Turrentine, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas.
Turrentine serves on a board of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists that focuses on immunization and infectious diseases. He said his recent pregnant patients who had COVID-19 hadn’t gotten the vaccine.
“The change in guidance on the federal level just really makes a lot of confusion, and it makes it very challenging to try to explain to individuals why all of a sudden the difference,” Turrentine said.
A slew of public health organizations have been making a concerted effort to dispel vaccine myths. They include the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit organization of maternal-fetal experts. At a news briefing the society held this month, clinicians stressed the safety and long-standing science behind COVID-19 vaccines, as well as the shots for RSV and the flu. Cases of RSV and the flu tend to peak in the winter months, while in recent years COVID-19 cases have spiked in the summer and the winter.
Dr. Brenna Hughes, an OB-GYN who chairs the organization’s infectious diseases and emerging threats committee, pointed to survey data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing that less than a third of eligible pregnant patients received COVID-19 shots, and only 38% received RSV shots for the 2023 to 2024 season. Less than half — 47% — received flu shots, and 59% received TDAP (whooping cough) vaccines.
CDC data shows that for last year’s and this year’s season, only between 12% and 14% of pregnant patients got the COVID-19 vaccine.
“The complications from the infection are so much greater than the complications and the very few and typically minor adverse events that might occur from the vaccine,” said microbiologist Sabra Klein, a professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
In June, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and 30 other professional health organizations signed a letter urging insurers to continue covering the COVID-19 shot for pregnant women, and have continued to urge coverage since then.
CVS Caremark, one of the nation’s three major pharmacy benefit managers, told Stateline it will continue covering the vaccine for pregnant women. The Arizona, California and North Carolina state Medicaid agencies also told Stateline they are still currently covering COVID-19 vaccines for pregnant women.
Dr. Kimberly Fortner, president-elect of the Infectious Diseases Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology, said during the maternal-fetal medicine briefing that she hopes medical groups’ joint messaging will bolster insurers.
“Hopefully by us linking arms, that can then help develop consistency so that insurers will continue to pay for the vaccine,” she said.
 Exacerbating disparities

Dr. Ayanna Bennett, director of the District of Columbia Department of Health, said the federal government’s new stance has upended “a system that’s been stable for a very long time.”
Bennett said her agency used federal pandemic aid to shore up vaccine outreach efforts to communities of color. Now that flow of money is ending.
The changes in federal guidance and funding will “almost certainly exacerbate” maternal health disparities, said Marie Thoma, a perinatal epidemiologist and an associate professor in the University of Maryland Department of Family Science who researches pregnancy and COVID-19.
Black and Indigenous women died at higher rates. The virus exacerbated existing racial disparities in maternal health — and created new ones: Latina mothers, who generally see low rates of maternal mortality, saw deaths surge to 28 per 100,000 in 2021. Their rate was about 12 per 100,000 in 2018, according to federal data.
“We are going in with some exposure already that we didn’t have during the start of the pandemic. So, there will be some protection, but now that will erode,” said Thoma. “If we’re not getting vaccines, or if people are hesitant to take them, we could see some increase.”
Silverman said the administration’s efforts to strip mentions of race from government policies makes it difficult for institutions to reach populations at greatest risk. He called the dismissal of decades of data “saddening and infuriating.”
“The politicization of the vaccine process, or access to it, is what concerns me the most,” said Dr. Yvette Martas, a Connecticut OB-GYN who chairs the board of directors of the Hispanic Health Council.
Many women “are trying to navigate an economic system that’s not always in their favor in terms of also providing access to the kind of educational material that they need,” she said.
 Not just COVID-19

In June, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee, replacing them with some members who are vaccine skeptics.
The change is creating chaos. Some states have vaccine laws, such as mandates for kids and coverage statutes, that are specifically tied to the committee’s decisions.


The Vaccine Integrity Project at the University of Minnesota called on frontline health workers, health officials and professional societies to “counter the spread of inaccurate and confusing vaccine information.”


At a news briefing this month held by the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, representatives from Alabama, Connecticut and Washington, D.C., said they will continue to recommend vaccines.
Alabama’s state health officer, Dr. Scott Harris, said clinicians will be instrumental in getting correct vaccination information to patients.
“We don’t think that we necessarily have the same authoritative voice that we might have had a decade ago in trying to guide people in what to do, but we do believe that people trust their health care providers in most cases and are certainly willing to listen to them,” he said at the briefing.
Bennett said she is hopeful that strong, consistent messaging from respected medical organizations will help combat confusion.
“Having established groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics or the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology make very firm recommendations that keep us essentially not changed from where we have been, I think, should reassure families,” she said.

That was the subject of a special meeting at the Diocese of Covington Curia on Monday night. Hosted by the Sisters of the Inter-Community Justice and Peace Committee, which is made up of members of the Sisters of Notre Dame, the Benedictine Sisters and the Sisters of Divine Providence, the meeting was the second in a series of meetings for local congregants on the issue of immigration.

This meeting focused on what Catholic social teachings had to say about the issue and gave advice on how local Catholics could get involved.
Bishop John Iffert led an opening prayer, which expressed the central quandary the speakers at the meeting hoped to unpack, namely that Catholic teachings emphasize the dignity of human beings, regardless of their origins, while also granting nations the right to protect their own borders.
“We live in a time where we are caught between high values,” Iffert prayed. “We recognize that God calls us to hospitality, to respect human dignity, to love our neighbor and to welcome even the foreigner as our neighbor. And we gather in the bosom of the Church that recognizes that nations have a right to control their borders, and sometimes we struggle to know how to balance these great values.”
The meeting was well-attended and featured several speakers, as well as some local nonprofits that provide services to immigrants. 
Sister Kay Kramer spoke about the history of anti-immigrant sentiment in the United States and pointed out that many in the room were likely descended from immigrants.
“A lot of what’s happening across the country now is demonizing and degrading human beings who are made in God’s image and likeness, just as we are,” Kramer said.

Hannah Keegan, the director of the Center for Faith, Mission & Catholic Education at Thomas More University, pulled from both modern and classical Catholic writings to describe what is expected of practicing Catholics as it relates to immigrants. 
Keegan emphasized that treatment of immigrants in the community was “not primarily a political question, but a question of justice and mercy. It’s a question of love, ultimately a question of relationship.”
Jessica Ramos, an attorney and the manager of the immigration team at the Legal Aid Society of Greater Cincinnati, discussed the complexities of immigration law, which she characterized as Byzantine and overly punitive. She projected a flow chart up at the front to show how complex immigration processing in the United States could be. 
“I just like to use this graphic to show you that immigration law is extremely complicated,” Ramos said. “I have cases where we have been battling over whether someone is a U.S. citizen for over a decade, right? Just to prove that someone’s a U.S. citizen. I have other cases that it takes two decades to wind through the system.”

“The law in place today is very harsh and punitive compared to centuries past,” Ramos said, “and, honestly, if most of our ancestors tried to come today, they would be denied entry.”
Organizers distributed literature summarizing Catholic social teachings and providing citations, along with information about local organizations that support immigrants. Sister Alice Gerdeman asked the attendees to reflect on the session and consider how they could contribute to the issue, whether through volunteering, donations, or any other way.
“We cannot all do something about everything, but if we want to be hopeful people, we have to find something we can do about some issue because otherwise we get depressed and we lose our energies,” Gerdeman said.

(Photo by Michael G. Seamans/ Maine Morning Star)Since President Donald Trump asked Texas to redraw its congressional maps to find five more Republican seats ahead of next year’s elections, some Democratic states are considering redistricting to counter the effort. 
Maine is not, at least according to Gov. Janet Mills, though an anonymous group tried to encourage the Pine Tree State to intervene earlier this month by flying planes over Augusta with banners that read “Mess with Texas.” 
The state’s constitutional officers, Attorney General Aaron Frey and Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, both Democrats, condemned Texas’ move, and Trump instigating it, as a blatant abuse of power. But, they said Democratic states exploring the avenues legally available to them to redistrict outside the regular schedule is understandable. 
Bellows refrained from any judgement of those counter efforts, while Frey was more critical, particularly due to what he sees as a likely snowball effect. 
“I am lamenting what this might mean for how our politics will continue, in terms of people trying to do the one-upsmanship,” Frey said in a sit-down with Maine Morning Star. “As much as it probably sounds like it’s a critique, it really is more of a concern about this being the evolution of where the politics is going.”
The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, the official party committee dedicated to electing Democrats to statehouses, called on Democrats on Aug. 4 to pursue redistricting opportunities to respond to possible changes to Texas’ congressional map. 
Last week, California was the first state to release a proposal to that aim. Such ideas have also been floated by officials in New York, Maryland, and Illinois — whose governor has already waded into the redistricting battle by welcoming Texas Democrats who fled the state to block a vote on the Republican proposal. They’ve since returned. 
But, Republicans control more state legislatures than Democrats and Vice President JD Vance is touring those states to encourage more gerrymandering. Several, including Missouri, Florida and Indiana, are now considering redrawing their maps to counter the Democrats’ countering. 
“It should be a concern for all of us about what this means for the next time that the next majority is in power,” Frey said. “I am hoping that I would have just as much concern if California would have been the first state to say that they were going to do this as I have about Texas saying that they’re going to do this, even though it may be perfectly appropriate legally.” 
Maine’s process
Redistricting procedures vary state by state but largely happen every ten years following new census data. 
Under the Maine Constitution, the state Legislature must establish a bipartisan advisory commission to draw its congressional and legislative districts every ten years. These maps are then sent to the Legislature for approval, though lawmakers aren’t bound to those recommendations. 
Approval requires a two-thirds vote, and because neither party has held a supermajority in the last decade, this has typically required bipartisan support. The map is then subject to the governor’s approval. 
Maine last went through this process in 2021.
Mills did not respond to multiple requests for comment about whether she supports the actions other Democratic states are considering to redraw their maps in response to Texas Republicans’ attempts. A spokesperson told the Portland Press Herald in early August that she was not considering any actions related to redistricting in Maine.   
If the Legislature is unable to reach the two-thirds threshold, the Maine Supreme Court would draw the maps instead.
“It’s understandable that other states are seeking to fight fire with fire,” Bellows said, echoing California Gov. Gavin Newsom, “but none of what’s happening outside of Maine would change unless the Legislature and the people of Maine decided to pursue a constitutional amendment.”
A constitutional amendment in Maine requires a two-thirds vote, plus approval by the voters, so such a change, especially before the 2026 midterms, is not likely. 
“What’s the end?”
When asked if Maine should get involved in the nationwide redistricting fight, Frey said, “No, not at this point.” 
As the officer representing the state on legal matters, Frey said he doesn’t see an opportunity for legal recourse given that other states drawing congressional districts is a state-level process pertaining to their residents and it doesn’t have a direct harm to Maine.
However, how these maps ultimately shape Congress will inevitably impact Maine, he said, looking at a list on his desk of lawsuits Maine has filed or joined against the Trump administration. Particularly if Trump gets his way in Texas, Frey said it could result in a continuation of a Congress that doesn’t serve as an adequate check to the executive branch.











Some politicians are seeking to choose their voters instead of their voters choosing them.


– Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows



	 
Like other Democrats across the country, Frey and Bellows walked a line to frame their party’s use of redistricting differently than  Republicans’. 
“The Trump administration is trampling all over the norms in our democracy, and it is really important that people stand strong for our values in this moment,” Bellows said. “What’s concerning about what Texas is trying to do is they are basically trying to cheat their way into electoral success in 2026 and 2028, so it’s understandable that some of the larger states that are blue states are thinking about how they might respond.”
Of those clear political aims, Frey similarly said, “There’s no mask to it,” arguing it would be different if Texas had come to a conclusion that redistricting mid-cycle was needed because its districts were no longer representative due to population shifts or another clear reason. 
“Let’s say this was Joe Biden who in 2023 was like, ‘California, Gavin Newsom, you like us, California does a lot of stuff that supports the administration, I need you to go redistrict and get me five more seats in Congress,’” Frey said. “What would people say?” 
But while Frey said Democratic states may be legally within their right to explore counter measures, he doesn’t see it as a productive way to resolve political discord nor address the priority issues of everyday Americans, such as the cost of living. 
“If anything, it’s creating a system that is going to be more unable to meet what it is that, I think, Mainers and the American people are asking for,” Frey said. 
As Trump eyes election changes, Secretary Bellows warns of fallout

Earlier this month Bellows officially responded to the U.S. Department of Justice’s request for sweeping voter data, questioning the federal agency’s intentions and asking that the request be withdrawn. She sees a throughline with that effort, Trump’s executive orders and his push for Texas Republicans to redistrict. 
“Some politicians are seeking to choose their voters instead of their voters choosing them,” Bellows said. “Many of these initiatives seem designed to shrink the population of people who are participating in elections, to spread fear and deter people from participating, or to create artificial barriers to participation.” 
Frey also sees connections. 
The day before speaking with Maine Morning Star, Frey had returned from a trip to Washington, D.C., where he saw National Guard troops and FBI agents gathered on the mall. “They are pushing boundaries to see how far they can get,” Frey said of the administration. 
Pulling up the president’s post on Truth Social ordering the U.S. Commerce Department to start working on a new U.S. Census that does not count people in the country illegally, Frey asked, “What’s the end?” 
He sees all of these moves as a test of the democratic foundation of the country, the U.S. Constitution.
“If enough citizens out there who are protected by this contract decide that they are unwilling to hold the president to the limitations that the constitution places on government action, I mean, at a certain point that contract by both parties is just going to dissolve,” Frey said. 
The book “The Storm Before the Calm” sat on his desk as he added a hopeful nod, explaining the current moment could provide an opportunity to be reminded of the importance of those protections.
The book, by geopolitical forecaster George Friedman, views American history through cycles, enduring upheaval and conflict but, ultimately, increasing in strength and stability. With 2026 on the horizon — when Maine’s governorship, U.S. Senate seat, two U.S. House seats and Legislature are all up for reelection — Frey said, “Maybe there will be an opportunity for renewal.” 
Time will tell how redistricting may play a part in that.

The Trump administration has threatened the city over its sanctuary policies. City officials say some officers violated the policy by assisting in the arrests. (Photo courtesy of City of Rochester)The Trump administration is once again pressuring liberal cities and states to cooperate with deportation efforts, despite previous setbacks in court.
Attorney General Pam Bondi sent letters last week telling sanctuary states, cities and counties that “you better be abiding by our federal policies and with our federal law enforcement, because if you aren’t, we’re going to come after you,” she said in a Fox News interview. She demanded the areas answer her by Tuesday.
Cities and states with so-called sanctuary policies generally refuse to assist with immigration raids or accede to requests for local jails to hold prisoners for deportation. Those that responded to Stateline’s questions about the letters said they were not inclined to change their positions about cooperation with immigration authorities.
“It’s the tactic of a bully. And the only way to deal with a bully is to let them know that they’re not going to intimidate you,” Rhode Island Democratic Attorney General Peter Neronha said in a statement.
The Trump administration is attempting to force more cooperation with immigration arrests. But it suffered a serious court reversal on July 25, when a federal judge dismissed a sanctuary policies case against Illinois, Chicago and Cook County.
The state and local policies reflect a “decision to not participate in enforcing civil immigration law — a decision protected by the Tenth Amendment,” Judge Lindsay Jenkins wrote in an order now under appeal.
Bondi’s letters follow the Justice Department’s Aug. 5 release of a list of sanctuary jurisdictions including 12 states, the District of Columbia, four counties and 18 cities. That’s fewer jurisdictions than the 14 states and almost 500 counties and cities that appeared on an earlier list, which the agency withdrew after criticism that it included conservative counties that were fully cooperating with immigration enforcement.
The states on the new list are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington state. The list also includes some counties and cities in those states as well as in Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New Mexico.



It’s the tactic of a bully. And the only way to deal with a bully is to let them know that they’re not going to intimidate you.


– Rhode Island Democratic Attorney General Peter Neronha 


Other federal courts have issued injunctions to at least temporarily stop Trump administration from withholding unrelated federal funding from governments that don’t cooperate on immigration. Cities, counties and states have filed lawsuits challenging Trump’s executive orders targeting sanctuary policies, including a February order that federal payments to states and localities must not “by design or effect, facilitate the subsidization or promotion of illegal immigration, or abet so-called ‘sanctuary’ policies that seek to shield illegal aliens from deportation.”
“The executive orders are directing agencies to basically take a maximalist approach to putting pressure on local governments to cooperate with immigration [enforcement], even though they’re not required to do so by federal law,” said Jonathan Miller, one of the attorneys working on the California case for the Public Rights Project, a California-based group promoting civil rights protections for states and cities.
One city on the administration’s list was Rochester, New York, which disciplined some police officers for helping federal agents make a March arrest in the city. The city already faces a lawsuit brought by the Trump administration that prominently mentions the arrest of three men from Guatemala; one of whom has since pleaded guilty to re-entering the United States after a previous deportation.
A spokesperson for the city, Barbara Pierce, said in a statement to The Guardian that, “Nothing in Attorney General Bondi’s letter is new and none of it has legal merit.”
“The letter reiterates many of the frivolous arguments that the federal government has already made in its pending suit against the city of Rochester,” she added. “These same arguments were levied against the city of Chicago and were dismissed by the federal district court for the eastern district of Illinois nearly a month ago.”
Ally Sullivan, a spokesperson for Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis, said in a statement that Colorado “is not a sanctuary state. The Governor continues to be frustrated by this mistaken and incorrect label.” In a televised interview earlier this year, Polis pointed out that Colorado fully cooperates with federal authorities on criminal matters. Immigration, he said, is a civil matter.
“In Colorado, we are improving public safety, apprehending dangerous criminals, cooperating with federal law enforcement on criminal investigations, and keeping our communities safe,” Sullivan said.
Nevertheless, Colorado faces a federal lawsuit brought by the administration over its alleged sanctuary policies. Polis signed a measure in May that limits local law enforcement’s communication with federal immigration authorities and restricts where federal authorities can operate within schools, child care facilities, hospitals and libraries without a judicial warrant.
Connecticut Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont in a statement said the state’s Trust Act, which the Trump administration has targeted as a sanctuary policy, was passed with bipartisan support and helps ensure local police concentrate on serious crimes. The Trust Act, passed in 2013 and expanded in 2019, limits information sharing and compliance with requests to detain immigrants for federal immigration authorities.
“Nothing about this makes Connecticut a sanctuary in any legal or practical sense — it makes our state one that upholds the Constitution, respects the rule of law, and prioritizes the safety and well-being of our communities,” Lamont said.

There’s something universal about scanning a table for the freshest apple, the juiciest peach or the ripest ear of corn. 
Each week in Kentucky, more than 700 customers share in that ritual at our Fort Thomas Farmers Market in Tower Park. But while food matters, I’ve come to find that it’s the human connection that lives at the heart of it all.
  Anna Raines from Rains & Sun Farm. (Fort Thomas Farmers Market)
September is National Harvest Month, and this year I’m reflecting not only on my own journey, but on the farmers, volunteers, and makers who, each week, open their booths and hearts to define what farm fresh means. And how tapping into the support of the community is the essential piece to keep this tradition alive.
As the market manager for our farmers market, my mission is simple: Connect local farmers to our community. Since 2009, our award-winning market has become a midweek destination for fresh, locally sourced goods from across the region. While our location is adjacent to a large metro area, we’ve been proud to maintain a rich, small-town feel. 
When you’re passionate about something, it’s only natural to want to share it. For me, I’ll never stop inviting people to experience all the Fort Thomas Farmers Market has to offer. We live in a time where we can no longer depend on just signs across town to promote our space. We have to meet people where they are, which is online.
Today, social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram have become essential tools for communicating what’s in season, sharing upcoming events, and educating our community about why investing in local matters. Thanks to our digital following, we have a great community that supports us as we open our booths every Wednesday. Our social media posts span beyond picturesque produce and share the real stories of the makers.
  Brenden Neltner from Neltner’s Farm. (Fort Thomas Farmers Market)
With a heartbeat behind every booth, it’s been amazing to see how a Facebook reel of a farmer harvesting sunflowers can brighten the day for our 7,000 followers, or how tagging a friend in a comment has led to a fun-filled Wednesday afternoon for the duo. 
We can now share our 30 diverse vendors in real time with customers through Facebook posts to create a bridge of connection with the very makers who dug the dirt, planted the seeds, and baked the goods they’re taking home. 
While each farmer’s story differs, their dependence on their community remains the same. And we’re committed to keeping our farmers market tradition alive through the online tools at our disposal.
We have found that even in a digital age, people crave real connection — and fresh food happens to be the perfect place to start. As we approach harvest, I encourage our fellow neighboring farmers markets to get their faces out there on digital platforms to get even more Kentuckians involved in the great community our markets create. It’s easy to create a Facebook or Instagram profile, and that might be the missing link to connecting with your local community.
To me, it’s not just about food labels; it’s about faces. It’s about relationships. And it’s about celebrating the people who make our community stronger, one market day at a time. This harvest season, my message is simple: Support local, connect deeply and celebrate the story behind your food.

As iGaming makes it possible for users to gamble with a tap on their phone, the tool offers both benefits and hurdles for policymakers considering how to build Virginia’s gambling market. States like New Jersey have already reaped financial rewards, with that state becoming the nation’s largest regulated online gaming market.
Dave Rebuck, a former director of the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement, told the Joint Subcommittee to Study the Feasibility of Establishing the Virginia Gaming Commission at its meeting in Richmond about how his home state authorized and launched the nation’s first competitive internet gaming market. 
One key factor Virginia policymakers will need to weigh, Rebuck said, is how to foster cooperation among state and federal leaders, backed by a clear plan.
“Based on my experience, there’s proof in concept to taking a multi-pronged approach to cracking down on the illegal market, with legalization being a critical component to every approach,” Rebuck said. 
“But let’s not fool ourselves,” he added. “Unless we have tremendous support and collaboration between government agencies, including the federal government, the status quo of the illegal market and the offshore sites that are engaged in businesses, in every state, are not going to go away.”
How Virginia is addressing the dark side of gambling

Tuesday’s committee meeting zeroed in on iGaming — online casino games such as Blackjack, Craps, Poker, Roulette, and Slots that can be played on smartphones, tablets, or computers. Lawmakers heard multiple presentations weighing internet gambling’s advantages, drawbacks, and challenges.
Supporters argue internet gaming offers convenience by eliminating the need to travel. But critics note that it presents risks for both consumers and policymakers.
Illegal operators, for example, provide no consumer protections and contribute nothing to Virginia’s Problem Gambling Treatment and Support Fund. They often target minors and self-excluded individuals, according to Keith Whyte, founder and president of Safer Gambling Strategies, LLC.
Whyte added that research “consistently” shows iGaming is tied to elevated risks of gambling addiction, with the highest rates among men between 18 and 35.
Experts further briefed lawmakers on the negative impacts online gaming could have on revenue and jobs at casinos. 
Brianne Doura-Schawohl, founder and CEO of Doura-Schawohl Consulting, also outlined some of the public health and economic concerns tied to online gambling, including higher rates of suicides, substance abuse, and drops in average credit scores, and rising credit card delinquency. 
According to her presentation, individuals with a gambling disorder are 15 times more likely to die by suicide than the general population.
Studies have also found that more teenagers are gambling online through the use of loot boxes in video games.
“I think that the federal government may never come to the table when it comes to addressing the public health issue of problem gambling,” Doura-Schawohl said, urging Virginia lawmakers to take action before considering an expansion of the gambling market.
“There’s too many things that need to be resolved before — if I were in your shoes — I would consider doing this,” she said.
During the last General Assembly Session, lawmakers considered legislation to legalize internet gaming in Virginia. Those proposals ultimately failed to advance out of either chamber, and legislators opted instead to send the issue for further study.
iGaming is currently legal in eight states and available to roughly 14% of the U.S. population, Del. Marcus Simon, D-Fairfax, said Tuesday. He added that the industry could generate an estimated $5.3 billion in new taxable revenue during its first five years.
Senate Bill 827, introduced by Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, would have authorized the Virginia Lottery Board to issue licenses to casino operators for online gaming. Like other proposals, the measure was left in committee to allow for additional study.
The subcommittee plans to hold two more meetings before the next General Assembly session begins in January. The next meeting, tentatively scheduled for September, will focus on existing and planned casinos. The final meeting will address broader gaming issues, such as skill games and charitable gaming, all ahead of the 2026 session.
Virginia one step closer to creating single gaming agency

Sen. Bryce Reeves, R-Spotsylvania, committee chair, said gambling enforcement remains one of his top priorities. That effort, he stressed, begins with creating the Virginia Gaming Control Agency to regulate the industry.
“We need to get the VGC set up like yesterday and start enforcing the law so we can get a handle on some of these things,” Reeves said. “Personally, I’m not passing any other bills until you all help us get the VGC done, because we’re just creating more mess and every year that we don’t get it passed, creates more and more chaos.”
Del. Paul Krizek, D-Fairfax, the committee’s vice chair, echoed Reeves’ concerns.
“Gaming can continue to be a powerful engine for jobs, revenue and community investment, but it’s got to be managed responsibly without streamlined oversight,” Krizek said. 
“The risks multiply predatory practices, inconsistent rules, heightened risk for problem gambling and loss of public trust. The Virginia Gaming Commission is a step we need to preserve the good, address those challenges, and build a fair, accountable and prosperous gaming industry for everyone in the commonwealth.”

After failed attempts in the legislature by lawmakers, the Virginia Board of Health held a special meeting this week and granted a petition to begin drafting regulations — a process that could take two years. 
The board has authority to issue regulations affecting public health. In this case, cisgender student athletes petitioned the board, citing frustrations with losing to transgender women, discomfort sharing facilities, and concerns about safety when people assigned male at birth compete with those assigned female. 
The regulatory process is expected to take 18 to 24 months, a Virginia Department of Health staffer told The Mercury Monday. The next steps include publishing a Notice of Intended Regulatory Action and holding additional public comment periods. 
The petition heard on Monday had already undergone a public comment period in which  54% of respondents opposed the request, while 45% supported it. Three comments were ruled “irrelevant,” and 11 were deemed “unclear.”
While the new rules could take years to implement, Equality Virginia Director Narissa Rahaman emphasized that transgender people have already been under scrutiny. 
“Over the last four years,” she said, referring to Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration, “Virginians and the General Assembly have made it clear that targeting transgender athletes is unfair and unpopular.”
In a statement released after Monday’s vote, Rahaman added: “Virginia’s women and girls face pressing real public health challenges, including HIV prevention and treatment, domestic violence, maternal health, and poverty. Addressing those challenges with urgency and intention should be the priority of the board. Instead of prioritizing the health of Virginians, the State Board of Health voted to prioritize politics.”
The petition stemmed from three college swimmers: former Virginia Tech Olympian Réka György and current Roanoke College swimmers Lily Mullins and Carter Satterfield. 
Mullins said that she and her teammates felt “unsupported, vulnerable and unsafe” after raising concerns with  coaches and administrators about a transgender woman joining the team. 
György, who placed 17th in a 2022 competition, missed qualifying for the next round by one spot. She lost to Lia Thomas, who placed first and became the first openly transgender athlete to win a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)  Division I championship. The University of Pennsylvania, Thomas’ former school, has since revoked her records and now bans transgender athletes.
Earlier this year, Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, and Youngkin hosted former athlete Riley Gaines to celebrate a similar legislative push. 
Gaines, who tied for fifth place with Thomas in a competition in 2022, has become a national figurehead in efforts to ban transgender student athletes. Virginia’s latest legislative attempt earlier this year failed. Satterfield is also listed as a plaintiff in Gaines’ federal lawsuit against the NCAA.

Transgender students and student athletes in recent years have faced scrutiny from state laws to  local policies to federal courts. 
Last month, the U.S. Supreme Court decided it will hear two cases over state bans on  transgender athletes this year.  Justices will consider whether such laws violate the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment or Title IX, the federal statute prohibiting sex discrimination in education. 
The conservative-leaning court has already dealt setbacks to LGBTQ+ protections. In 2024, it struck down then- President Joe Biden’s attempt to use Title IX to protect LGBTQ+ students and upheld state bans on gender-affirming care for minors.
Meanwhile, last summer a Hanover County transgender teen was blocked from joining a sports team despite making it through tryouts. A federal judge later ruled the school system had likely violated both Title IX and the Equal Protections Clause — the same issues now before the Supreme Court. The American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia represented the student, while other ACLU branches are handling the cases bound for SCOTUS.
“Categorically excluding kids from school sports just because they are transgender will only make our schools less safe and more hurtful places for all youth,” Joshua Block, legal counsel with ACLU’s LGBTQ and HIV Project said in a press release. 
“We believe the lower courts were right to block these discriminatory laws, and we will continue to defend the freedom of all kids to play.”

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)Summer heat is bearing down on U.S. prisons, where temperatures in uncooled cells can climb well into the triple digits.
Facing growing pressure from advocacy groups, lawsuits and climate projections that show hotter days ahead, some state prison systems are moving to install air conditioning and expand cooling measures — though many facilities remain years away from significant upgrades.
But in other states, such efforts have stalled or failed. That may lead to more lawsuits in the future, experts say, even as judges may raise the bar for such cases.
An emphasis on being “tough on crime” and prioritizing other public safety measures may have contributed to less attention on prison conditions in some states. In others, slowing revenue growth and pressure to rein in corrections spending could be making new investments a harder sell.
At least two states this year, Virginia and Texas, considered legislation addressing excessive heat in prisons but neither measure became law. The Texas bill would have required the state Department of Criminal Justice to purchase and install climate control systems in all of its facilities by the end of 2032. About two-thirds of the state’s correctional facilities have only partial or no air conditioning.
The measure passed the House but did not advance in the Senate before the legislature adjourned in June.
In Virginia, lawmakers approved a bill that would have required the state corrections department to install heat and air conditioning in its prisons and to ensure cell temperatures not exceed 80 degrees. Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed it, citing the cost of installation and operational burdens. Youngkin also wrote that existing state corrections data “does not substantiate the claims of extreme temperatures or health risks.”
But in Delaware, the fiscal year 2026 capital budget approved last month includes $2 million in funding to install air conditioning at the James T. Vaughn Correctional Center.
These changes mark the latest actions in a long-running debate over how correctional systems respond to rising summer temperatures — an issue that affects both incarcerated people and staff. Some of the policy debates and facility updates this year follow years of advocacy and litigation over the health, safety and operational challenges posed by heat in correctional settings.
Stifling prison heat used to be just a Southern problem. Not anymore.

The problem of excessive heat in prisons has persisted for decades and has unfolded alongside other challenges, including chronic understaffing and overcrowding. In some cases, these problems have led to extended facility lockdowns, even during the summer months.
“There are people working in prisons and they have the right to work in climates that are comfortable,” said Nancy La Vigne, a criminal justice researcher and dean of the School of Criminal Justice at Rutgers University. “When they’re not, there’s retention issues, and it’s hard to replace staff. And when you don’t replace staff, then you have challenges in maintaining the safety and security of the facility.”
In New York, for example, correctional officers staged a three-week strike earlier this year and many didn’t return to work. Some facilities now are operating with 30%-60% fewer guards than needed, resulting in some incarcerated people getting only an hour or two outside of their cells each day.
A 2023 study published in the peer-reviewed PLOS One journal found that mortality in state and private prisons rose during periods of extreme heat, with deaths increasing 3.5% on extreme heat days and up to 7.4% during three-day heat waves. Between 2001 and 2019, nearly 13,000 people died in prison during the summer months, almost half of them in the South, though the study did not determine how many of those deaths were directly attributable to heat.
Climate change is fueling longer, more intense periods of extreme heat. Exposure to extreme heat can worsen conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and asthma, and has also been linked to worsening mental health and higher suicide rates among incarcerated people.
“Average temperatures are rising, and you’re going to have more and more states around the country where incarcerated people are held in conditions that are not livable because they’re too hot,” said Sharon Dolovich, a law professor and director of the Prison Law and Policy Program at the University of California, Los Angeles.
Some upgrades
At least 44 states lack universal air conditioning within their prison facilities, even in regions known for sweltering summer temperatures, according to a 2022 USA Today analysis. A recent Reuters investigation also found that nearly half of state prisons across 29 states have partial or no air conditioning in housing units.
But some states are investing millions to update their prison facilities.
In North Carolina, corrections officials are working toward their goal of installing air conditioning in all 54 state prisons by 2026. To date, 33 facilities are fully air-conditioned, 17 are partially air-conditioned, and four have no air conditioning, according to its dashboard.
In California, the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, which operates 31 adult prisons, has spent $246 million in the past five years on cooling improvements at five prisons, according to a department spokesperson.
Lawmakers this year also approved funding for the Air Cooling Pilot Program at three facilities, with $17.6 million allocated for fiscal years 2025-26 and $20 million for fiscal years 2026-27. It will evaluate the effectiveness of two alternatives prior to a statewide plan to address high indoor temperatures across the California prison system.
State prisons turn to extended lockdowns amid staffing shortages, overcrowding

The Texas Department of Criminal Justice, as of Aug. 1, is building 12,827 “cool beds,” or prison cells in air-conditioned units, and is in the process of procuring an additional 7,162, according to its dashboard.
Texas is one of the states most closely associated with heat-related deaths in prison. A 2022 study estimated that, on average, 14 deaths per year in Texas prisons are associated with heat. And a Texas Tribune analysis found that at least 41 incarcerated people died during a record-breaking heat wave in 2023.
In March, a federal judge ruled the extreme heat in Texas prisons is “plainly unconstitutional,” but declined to order immediate air conditioning, saying the work could not be completed within the court order’s 90-day window and temporary systems might delay a permanent fix.
‘More miserable’
Sweltering summer heat can turn prisons into pressure cookers. People inside already may have health conditions, limited access to cooling, or take medications that make it harder for their bodies to handle the heat. And research suggests that high temperatures can heighten irritability and aggression, sometimes fueling more conflicts between incarcerated people or with staff.
“It makes you more miserable. … If you to the point of even thinking about suicide, that’s just going to add to it,” said Ronald McKeithen, who spent 37 years incarcerated in Alabama prisons and is now the director of second chances at the Alabama Appleseed Center for Law and Justice. McKeithen recalls feeling “on edge” due to tension among other incarcerated people on hot days.
At the Oshkosh Correctional Institution in Wisconsin, Devin Skrzypchak said the heat worsens his bladder condition, and he often can’t get the incontinence briefs he needs. The heat forces him to drink more water, and on days when ice isn’t available, he’s left drenched in sweat.
“At times, it’s a living hell. … It can be very excruciating,” Skrzypchak wrote in a message to Stateline through the facility’s messaging platform.











At times, it’s a living hell. … It can be very excruciating.


– Devin Skrzypchak, who is incarcerated at Oshkosh Correctional Institution in Wisconsin



D’Angelo Lee Komanekin — who has spent about 25 years in and out of different Wisconsin corrections facilities — said prison architecture plays a major role in why temperatures inside climb so high.
“The planet is getting hotter and hotter,” said Komanekin, who relies on a small plastic fan to stay cool. Komanekin also is incarcerated at the Oshkosh Correctional Institution. “They’re doing nothing about the architecture. Some institutions’ windows open, some don’t, but most of the doors have steel doors with trap doors.”
Older prison designs that rely heavily on steel and concrete building materials often trap heat, making it difficult to keep temperatures down in the summer. Aging facilities also are less likely to be equipped for the installation of central air conditioning.
Some state prison systems, including Alabama’s and Wisconsin’s, are adding air-conditioning or air-tempering systems to new prison construction and major renovation projects.
Future legal battles
Legal experts say the issue of excessive heat in prisons is likely to become more pressing as climate change drives longer and hotter summers.
Extreme heat in correctional facilities has already been the subject of litigation in dozens of states, with plaintiffs arguing that high temperatures constitute cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. Court rulings in these cases have varied, but some experts say even more lawsuits are likely if facilities do not adapt.
“The conditions are going to worsen. [Incarcerated people are] going to be looking for every possible avenue for assistance they can,” Dolovich, the UCLA law professor, told Stateline.
Prison abuse, deaths and escapes prompt calls for more oversight

One of the latest cases comes from Missouri, where the nonprofit law firm MacArthur Justice Center filed a class-action lawsuit in May on behalf of six incarcerated people at Algoa Correctional Center.
The lawsuit alleges that the conditions violate their constitutional rights under the Eighth Amendment. It seeks to require the Missouri Department of Corrections to work with experts to develop a heat mitigation plan that keeps housing unit temperatures between 65 and 85 degrees. If the department cannot meet that standard, the plaintiffs are asking for the release of three of the incarcerated people who have less than a year remaining on their sentences.
Lawsuits such as the Missouri case often focus on claims that extreme heat worsens existing medical problems. To proceed, they must meet two legal requirements: proving the heat poses a serious health or safety risk, and showing prison officials knew about the danger but failed to address it, according to Dolovich, whose work has focused on the Eighth Amendment and prison conditions.
Courts may also raise the bar for proving such claims if judges echo decisions in cases with similar Eight Amendment arguments related to the death penalty and homelessness, Dolovich said. Judges have shifted, she said, toward a “superadding terror, pain and disgrace” standard under the Eighth Amendment — a higher threshold requiring proof that conditions were created with the intent to cause unnecessary suffering.
Dolovich added that some recent court decisions have provided only narrow remedies, such as ordering ice and fans instead of installing air conditioning.
“Prison officials have a moral and a constitutional responsibility to respond to changing conditions. In this case, it means air conditioning. … Anything less than that, to me, is indefensible.” she said.

KENNETT, MO. — Nestled in Missouri’s Bootheel is the small town of Kennett, the Dunklin County seat. With just over 10,000 residents, it’s a close-knit community where good-natured teasing is a common show of affection.
Once a sprawling swampland, it has since been transformed into an expanse of flat, fertile fields where agriculture stands as the backbone of the region’s economy.
Kennett’s houses don’t get much taller than one story, and as visitors stroll down the main street, they’re welcomed by a mix of restaurants, boutiques and a cozy hair salon. These buildings are dwarfed in size by a silent, boarded-up hospital, its vacancy a remembrance of what the community has lost.
  Unyielding is a University of Missouri School of Journalism project for Investigate Midwest.
It’s the kind of community where if something tragic happens, everyone finds out.
Bobbi Bibbs found this out the hard way. She discovered she had cancer in her colon in December 2023, which then metastasized to her liver, making it a stage four diagnosis.
Bibbs isn’t alone. Dunklin County is among the 10 counties with the highest rates of that type of cancer in the state. This isn’t just a statistic, Bibbs said she can see it and almost can’t fathom it.

“There are so many (cases) where we are from,” Bibbs said. “Like, it’s got to be coming from somewhere.”
Bibbs is surrounded by people who understand her struggles, many of whom work in the agriculture industry. In Dunklin County, there are hundreds of thousands of acres of crops — and most of that land is blanketed by pesticides.
Estimates suggest that thousands of kilograms of pesticides are sprayed over Missouri cropland each year. In some places, wastewater sludge containing “forever chemicals” — per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances — is applied on farmland as fertilizer.
Multiple scientific studies have explored a connection between pesticide use and cancer,  pointing to a silent public health crisis hitting rural communities particularly hard.
The University of Missouri, in partnership with Investigate Midwest, conducted a county-by-county analysis of cancer rates and pesticide use, using the most recently available data for pesticides that are repeatedly cited in research as likely to be associated with cancer risk.
The six counties with the highest use of these pesticides per square mile are all located in the Bootheel, including Dunklin. Four of those counties are in the top 15 for overall cancer rates in Missouri. All counties with the highest rates of cancer are rural.
So in Kennett, there are high rates of chemical usage, high rates of cancer — and the nearest trauma center in the state is more than an hour and a half away.
In other words, it’s a typical rural town in Missouri.
Green hills and kilograms of chemicals

While Missouri has its share of rolling hills covered in trees and wild foliage, much of the land is well developed to suit the needs of farmers and their crops. There are about 27 million acres of Missouri farmland being cultivated and nearly 88,000 farms, according to the Rural Farm & Finance Policy Analysis Center.
The biggest business in the state is agriculture, employing about 460,000 statewide, according to the Missouri Department of Agriculture. Soybeans, corn and wheat are some of the crops that color most of the state’s landscape.
Farming is a dangerous job that requires a good deal of heavy equipment and specialized tools. Those tools include chemicals.
Isain Zapata is a data scientist who researched the relationship between pesticides and the incidence of cancer. He looked at the complex mixtures of pesticides tailored to specific crops that are sprayed in different regions.
“When we look at those pesticides, it’s not just one — it’s all a cocktail,” Zapata said. “It’s the whole rainbow of different colors.”
He found that these colorful combinations are strongly linked to certain cancer rates across the nation.
“Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and leukemias are very intimately associated with pesticide use,” Zapata said. “But we also saw that the overall pesticide use has an effect on all the other non-obvious cancers.”
Other research shows an association between certain pesticides and an increased risk of brain, prostate, breast, kidney and colon cancers.
Pesticides are a classification of substances used to protect crops. This includes killing weeds, insects or even strengthening wood to prevent pests from harming the plant. Farmers typically apply pesticides to crops using methods such as aerial spraying or ground-based equipment.
Serious risks are posed by pesticides because they can harm both human health and the environment. Exposure may lead to short-term or long-term health problems, while also contaminating soil and water, which may disrupt ecosystems and affect wildlife.
But pesticides do what they do best. Zapata emphasizes that without pesticides, agriculture-based economies and the communities tied to them would suffer.
“I am not in favor or against pesticides,” Zapata said. “I know we need them. I don’t like them, but I know why they have to be there.”
He said rural agricultural areas are home to an intense combination of factors that multiply the risk level.
Farmers are under pressure to maintain or increase their productivity, and that comes at the cost of using compounds that carry health risks, Zapata said. Rural areas are often underserved by health care facilities, meaning there are often too few health providers and resources in those areas to monitor and manage the added risk of using pesticides.
“It’s just the perfect storm,” Zapata said. “You combine several factors (heavy pesticide usage, poor regulation and monitoring, socioeconomic disparities), you’ve made it worse.”
The million-acre highway
Mike Milam is a local expert in pesticide application. Based in Kennett, he is a field specialist in agriculture and environment for MU Extension, serving Dunklin, New Madrid and Pemiscot counties.
“I’ve had people tell me, especially the ones who don’t like chemicals at all (that) our bodies weren’t designed to breathe these chemicals,” Milam said. “And they’re right about that.”
The herbicide Roundup is the target of thousands of lawsuits claiming it causes cancer, putting it in the spotlight. Milam listed other chemicals that have caused concern, including paraquat, vydate and dicamba.
Farmers and the workers hired to harvest crops frequently interact with chemicals. From mixing to pouring to spraying, they are there for all of it. They also encounter other farmers’ chemicals when a substance sprayed in one area drifts somewhere it was not intended to be.
“I have known a situation (where) people out in the fields got sprayed, or they sprayed next to them, and then it drifted over. And things like that,” Milam said. “Matter of fact, when I was in graduate school, I was in a field down in Louisiana, and they were spraying right next to us. We actually had to leave the field.”
Direct drift occurs when an applicator applies a pesticide and the wind blows it elsewhere, making monitoring weather conditions an integral part of the process. The stronger the wind, the stronger the potential is for drift.
That said, farmers have a limited window to seed and fertilize their fields during planting season. Fluctuating weather conditions can make this even more difficult. This spring alone, the Bootheel faced tornadoes, dust storms and historic flooding, all of which have the potential to hinder field work.
“We go out here, we can plant a crop, it looks beautiful, a flood wipes it out, and we gotta start back over,” said Sen. Jason Bean, R-Holcomb, a fifth-generation Bootheel farmer.
Milam said that some farmers end up spraying their crops when conditions aren’t ideal.
“The farmers aren’t paying attention or just decide to go ahead and (apply) anyway because they need to get it done,” Milam said. “They are under a lot of stress, they’re trying to get the crops in.”
Jason Mayer, a fourth-generation Bootheel farmer and one of the directors for the Missouri Soybean Association, believes that, nine times out of 10, farmers are doing the right thing. In his mind, it is the “bad actors” going against best practices. Bean compares this to speeding on the highway.
In his analogy, like drivers on the road minding the speed limit, most farmers follow the rules. Just as there will always be that driver blowing past everyone else in the left lane, there will be farmers who break the rules.
Agricultural regulators — such as the Missouri Department of Agriculture or EPA — serve as the cop on the side of the road in the metaphor. They step in when misuse is suspected. Environmental Protection Agency inspectors can show up at any time and ask to see a farmer’s records, Milam said.
With millions of acres of farmland in Missouri, that’s one big highway to watch. So if agencies don’t catch someone breaking the rules, it can fall to local farmers to report their neighbors to the state pesticide control office.
Bean emphasized that proper pesticide application isn’t just about compliance, it’s also in the farmer’s best interest. Misuse wastes costly chemicals, reduces crop effectiveness and decreases consumer trust in locally grown produce.
“I’d say we’re great stewards of the land,” Bean said. “We’re going to continue that, because in the big picture, farmers want to produce for the world the safest, abundant product.”
Milam said the key is to use the chemicals appropriately to minimize exposure. He said wearing personal protective equipment during application is a best practice. So doing things like wearing long pants, long-sleeved shirts, masks and goggles is essential for safe use.
Bean does not believe pesticides cause or increase the risk of cancer. Mayer echoes this sentiment, emphasizing his lifelong experience around crops and chemical applications.
“I’m 42 — knock on wood — today,” Mayer said. “I’m still relatively young, perfectly healthy, and I’ve been on the farm since I was 14.”
Waiting on a waiting room
Striking up a conversation about health care in Kennett is bound to lead to one topic: the hospital.
Kennett doesn’t have one anymore; Twin Rivers Regional Medical Center closed its doors in 2018.
For quick stitch-ups or infection treatment, St. Bernards Urgent Care is open every day. It closes at 7:30 p.m., meaning that Kennett residents have to go elsewhere for their nighttime care.
There are various options in nearby counties, or even in neighboring states, but if someone needs emergency care, for example, it’s a trek.
  The building formerly known as the Twin Rivers Regional Medical Center is seen vacant with its windows boarded up on May 21, 2025, at 1st Street in Kennett, Missouri.

While there’s a Mercy Hospital located in nearby Dexter with a rotation of specialty doctors, the closest Missouri trauma center to Kennett is in Cape Girardeau, about an hour and a half away.
“(If) I have a heart attack at eight o’clock at night, or stroke, and if (the urgent care) was still open, they could give me that little fancy pill and help get me to the hospital to help,” said Cheryl Bruce, the executive director of the Dunklin/Stoddard Caring Council, an organization based in Kennett offering an assistive services program to Dunklin County residents with cancer.
Kennett’s old hospital building is still standing on the town’s main drag. The windows are boarded up, and walking through the halls requires ducking wires and tiptoeing over glass shards.
The current owner is in a zoning battle to turn the hospital into something. They haven’t been able to find buyers yet because they need various approvals from the city to do any work to make the building sellable.
Kennett isn’t alone in facing minimal health care access. Since 2014, 21 hospitals have shut down statewide, including 12 in rural areas, according to the Missouri Hospital Association.
Additionally, the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform’s 2023-2024 report found 26 rural hospitals in Missouri are at risk of closure due to financial strain — nine of them are at an “immediate risk.”
The Twin Rivers CEO said in a 2018 statement that the hospital’s closure was part of an effort to consolidate operations with Poplar Bluff Regional Medical Center, “as health care delivery evolves and medical innovation makes inpatient services less needed,.”  KFVS12 TV reported at the time.
It was a palpable loss for Kennett — people miss the hospital, Bruce said.
“When the hospital closed, all anybody has ever talked about is, ‘Are we going to get another one?’ ” Bruce said.
From 2020 to 2024, the Caring Council’s cancer assistive services program spent $22,650 helping over 400 people with transportation. For cancer care, folks in Kennett often travel an hour to Jonesboro, Arkansas, or an hour-and-a-half to Cape Girardeau in Missouri. Whatever kind of cancer care you need, Bruce said, you’ve got to drive to get it.
The lack of health care providers also means early detection of medical issues, including cancer, can be harder to get.
Some health care transportation programs are available in rural areas, but Bruce said she sees a need in her community for more robust services.
“I’m not asking for a bus system like in St. Louis or Kansas City or Jeff City,” Bruce said. “I’m just asking for access to care, whatever that means.”
Sprayed on all sides
Wherever you go in Kennett, there will be someone who’s called it home their whole life. Kennett’s City Clerk Jan McElwrath is one of those people. Aside from a brief stint at the University of Missouri, she’s spent nearly all of her 68 years in town.
She came back for a classic reason: love. She got married, raised a family and built a life rooted in the same streets where she grew up.
Over the decades, she’s seen businesses open and close, celebrated countless community milestones and weathered natural disasters. Through it all, McElwrath has observed one constant: despite differing beliefs and opinions, the people of Kennett always find a way to come together.
“Our strength is our people, hands down,” she said.
This is especially important when considering the unique challenges of rural living.
An index created by the CDC shows that Dunklin is the county in Missouri least prepared to deal with economic or environmental challenges. According to Feeding America, over 20% of Dunklin County is food insecure, despite the fact that the region is covered in farmland. Milam said that this is largely because the farms in Dunklin are agronomic, which is when crops aren’t always grown for direct human consumption.
“It would help a lot of people if they had fresh vegetables,” he explained.
As manufacturing jobs moved out of many places in the Bootheel, Kennett felt the economic sting. Though Cim-Tek Filtration’s arrival two years ago brought back some manufacturing jobs, Kennett lost its Emerson Motor Company plant in 2006.
One industry that remains is agriculture.
The land is dotted with cotton, soybean and rice row crop operations. McElwrath calls the rows of cotton ready for picking “southern snow,” but to get that snow, farmers usually have to give plants a nudge with defoliants.
Defoliation is a natural process, though it can be artificially induced when chemicals are applied to the plants to get them to open up, making the white cotton easier to harvest.
McElwrath said it’s hard to notice farmers defoliating at first. But then, suddenly, your sinuses sting, your eyes burn, maybe a headache creeps in. It always seems to hit around the same time every year, right when the county fair is going on — with the dust, the dry soil, the demolition derby — everything blending together.
It’s not just that the defoliants make things happen quicker; they help make the cotton a higher grade — that means there is less debris affecting the final product. The grade determines the value.
Many residents of Kennett recognize the need for defoliants and other agricultural chemicals. For some of them, that’s what puts food on the table. But then the time of year creeps around again, and they all experience that familiar sensation.
“We’re surrounded by agriculture,” McElwrath said. “We recognize (chemicals) as a risk, but our economy here is very dependent on agriculture.”

Two Democrats want to prohibit Ohio lawmakers from accepting free or reduced-price tickets for professional sporting events. The proposal comes on the heels of state lawmakers committing $600 million to a new multi-billion-dollar stadium for the Cleveland Browns. The owners of the team, Jimmy and Dee Haslam, are major political campaign donors.
State Reps. Sean Brennan, D-Parma, and Karen Brownlee, D-Symmes Township, argue it’s a conflict of interest for public officials to accept tickets for professional sporting events. The funding mechanism lawmakers established for the Browns is meant to help pay for other sports and cultural facilities in the future. Brennan and Brownlee’s measure creates an explicit prohibition on accepting tickets for the NFL, NBA, NHL, MLB or MLS.
But that doesn’t mean it’s OK to tempt lawmakers with free tickets to a WNBA game or a NASCAR race. Ohio’s ethics law seems broad enough to cover any professional sports ticket already. State law prohibits lawmakers from accepting “anything of value” from an “improper” source.

Definitions
The Ohio Ethics Commission has weighed in where to draw line with gifts repeatedly. A little more than 30 years ago, the commission issued an opinion stating explicitly that city council members couldn’t accept season tickets from professional teams playing in the city.
A Cleveland Plain Dealer story at the time detailed how the Browns and then-Indians had been giving season tickets to all 21 members of the council for roughly 30 years. The Cleveland Cavaliers, which had recently moved from nearby Richfield, gave out several tickets as well.
At the heart of Ohio’s Ethics law are two questions: what’s it worth? And where’d you get it?
Although the statute applies to “anything” of value, the commission states accepting nominal items — a cup of coffee, box of popcorn, etc. — isn’t prohibited. That said, the commission warns that over time several nominal gifts could add up to a substantial one.
In 2001, the Ohio Ethics Commission issued another opinion on whether a public official could accept a free golf outing from an individual that does business with that official’s agency. Again, no.
The commission quoted yet another opinion, this time from the Ohio Supreme Court’s Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline.
“The value of a round of golf or a ticket to a sports event in most instances would be ‘substantial,’ not de minimis,” the commission stated.
The other consideration is a gifts’ source. If the giver is someone doing business with, regulated by, or interested in matters going before the receiver, they would be considered an “improper” source under state law.
Brennan and Brownlee’s bill
As an American government teacher, Brennan worries about the message it could send for lawmakers to show up at games after signing off on the seed money for a franchise’s new stadium.
“I also used to work at the Browns stadium and at the Progressive Field for a season or two,” Brennan said. “And you know, when you see an elected official come in, it always made you wonder, did they pay like everybody else to get in, or did they get a reduced price to get in?”
“I just think it’s a clear ethical violation,” he added. “I think it compromises the credibility of the institution.”
Brownlee said their intent is to cover all professional sports even if a handful of leagues aren’t reflected in the current definition.
“Our thinking was that, especially based on what has happened this year with the budget, that it was imperative to get something clean out very quickly in response to (the) special interest of professional sports,” she explained.
The Haslams gave big donations to Ohio lawmakers, who are now deciding the fate of Browns stadium

Both lawmakers acknowledged the similarities between tickets to some college events and professional ones, but they decided not to go down that road. Even if universities have business before lawmakers, Brownlee said it’s difficult to know where to draw the line. Say lawmakers signed off on funding for a new tennis stadium, she offered. Is an invitation to the inaugural match more like free tickets or more like a ribbon cutting?
Brennan thinks an explicit prohibition on pro sports tickets will clarify questions about which sources are ‘improper.’ He explained some lawmakers already accept tickets and those gifts are reflected on their annual ethics forms.
A review of recent filings from leaders of both parties in the Ohio House and Senate showed only one lawmaker accepting any tickets at all. In December last year House Speaker Matt Huffman accepted two tickets valued at $826 to the Ohio State University v. Tennessee football game in the College Football Playoff. Because it was a college game, Brennan and Brownlee’s measure would have no impact on the gift’s status under state ethics law.
Ohio Capital Journal reached out to Speaker Huffman for comment, but his office did not respond.
“Even if it’s not a huge problem now,” Brennan said, “it’s a way of nipping it in the bud going forward. And again, doing a little part of bolstering public trust in the institution and their elected officials.”

(Photo by Frederick Bass/Getty Images)New Hampshire is not adequately funding its public schools, a superior court judge held Monday — the latest in a string of similar rulings in recent years amid a pair of high-profile lawsuits.
Ruling in the case of Rand v. State of New Hampshire, Rockingham County Superior Court Judge David Ruoff found that local property-tax payers are bearing the burden of paying for much of their local public school budgets due to underfunding by the state, which he called unconstitutional. 
But unlike his sweeping decision in November 2023 in a separate lawsuit, this time Ruoff did not order state lawmakers to change the adequacy formula, instead declaring the current funding unconstitutional and allowing the Legislature to respond. 
The decision came six weeks after the state Supreme Court found that state school funding is inadequate in a separate case, Contoocook Valley School District v. State of New Hampshire, known as the “ConVal” case. In that decision, a 3-2 majority on the court — which featured two substitute justices — stopped short of directing the Legislature to take a specific action. 
There are currently two lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of the way New Hampshire funds its schools and the fiscal differences from district to district. The first, ConVal, was brought by school districts that argued the current state funding system is preventing them from running their schools without local taxpayer contributions, a violation of the state’s constitutional duty.
The second lawsuit, Rand, was brought by taxpayers who claimed that the differences in property taxes between wealthy and poor towns is exacerbated by the lack of adequate state funding provided to public schools — and that the result is that taxpayers in “property-poor” towns face unconstitutionally high taxes.
Ruling in Rand, Ruoff agreed with the plaintiffs. 
“The Court concludes that the plaintiffs have successfully proven that the total amount of current Adequacy Funding and the current amount of special education differentiated aid, as provided for in RSA 198:40-a, are constitutionally insufficient,” Ruoff wrote. “The plaintiffs have further proven that school districts must rely in part on local property tax revenues, assessed at varying rates, to bridge these funding gaps.”
Ruoff’s ruling Monday is the first time he has ruled comprehensively on the Rand case, which was filed two years after ConVal, and comes after the case received a full trial with expert testimony. 
It was not immediately clear whether the state would appeal Ruoff’s Rand ruling up to the state Supreme Court, nor whether the Supreme Court would take on the case, given its decision in the ConVal case in June.
A ‘mock budget’
While the ConVal case centered on whether school superintendents are able to sufficiently run public school districts with the state’s per-pupil adequacy payments, the Rand case focused on the effect on local taxpayers.
Plaintiff Steven Rand, a Plymouth resident, argued that the lack of adequate state education funding means that he and other Plymouth residents must pay disproportionate shares of property taxes in order to properly pay for their local schools.
Lawyers for Rand noted that absent sufficient state aid, the local property-tax burden is larger for residents living in towns with lower property values. Those towns have less wealth to tax, and thus must tax residents at higher rates, the plaintiffs said. The plaintiffs argued those higher rates, in turn, violate the findings in the landmark 1997 Claremont II Supreme Court ruling, which held that the state must provide an adequate education and that any tax to do so must be uniform. 
As in the ConVal lawsuit, lawyers for the state have pushed back at this characterization, arguing that the state does provide constitutionally adequate funding. The state has disputed that some of the expenses of school districts, such as facilities costs, count toward the “adequate” definition of education required in state law. And the state has argued that there is a state tax — the statewide education property tax, or SWEPT — that is applied uniformly to residents across the state to help pay for education. 
But plaintiffs in the Rand lawsuit say in practice, towns set vastly different local property tax rates out of necessity in order to allow schools to meet the minimum standards for adequacy, leaving local taxpayers without much choice. 
To make this point at the trial, the plaintiffs brought forward Dr. John Freeman, a former superintendent in Barrington, Pittsfield, and Strafford. Freeman used Pittsfield’s budget numbers to attempt to demonstrate that the state’s per-pupil adequacy funding to the district would not have been sufficient on its own to fund an adequate education.
To do this, Freeman began with the $2.7 million that the district received in the 2018-2019 school year. He then attempted to draw up a “mock budget,” in which he cut all services that could be seen as unnecessary to meet the state’s definition of an adequate education. But even after doing so, Freeman was not able to craft a budget that would fund the district, due in part to teacher salary costs, special education costs, and other expenses such as transportation, heat, electricity, custodial services, nursing services, and administrators. And he testified that even after doubling that mock budget to $5.3 million, he could not do so.
Lawyers for the Department of Justice sought to dismiss Freeman’s testimony, introducing their own witness, Jay Greene, a senior research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, who argued that Freeman’s choices of what to include and not include in the mock budget were arbitrary, and argued he should have sought larger class sizes and looked to schools in developing countries in order to bring costs down further.
But Ruoff found Freeman’s exercise useful, and he cited the testimony of the plaintiffs’ other experts to conclude that the state’s funding formula does not provide enough to fund an adequate education, and that the remainder must be made up by local taxes. Those experts included Corinne Cascadden, a former Berlin superintendent and Democratic state representative, who testified that when she was superintendent, even after putting together a “bare bones” budget, the district still relied on local property taxes to keep its schools operating.
A mixed ruling
In his ruling, Ruoff agreed with plaintiffs that the school funding model is unconstitutionally low. But he went further, holding that the “differentiated aid” — the specific per-pupil amounts sent by the state for students receiving free or reduced-price lunches, students with disabilities, and English language learner students — are also inadequate.
“In summary, the plaintiffs have proven a ‘clear and substantial conflict’ between the costs necessary to meet Constitutional Adequacy and current Adequacy Funding and special education differentiated aid funding levels “in all, or virtually all” of New Hampshire’s school districts.
But he said that the plaintiffs had not adequately proved one of their requests: that the court should declare that differentiated aid for children in poverty is not duplicative of aid for children who qualify for special education. Ruling that way could have guaranteed the state would provide more funding, but Ruoff wrote that there had not been enough evidence to suggest that students necessarily require both types of funding. 
And he denied the plaintiffs’ request that he order the Legislature to cease using the current funding system by April 1, 2026. 
Instead, following similar reasoning in the Supreme Court’s ConVal decision in July, Ruoff wrote that such a timeline was unreasonable and that the extraordinary remedy of the court directing the Legislature is inappropriate. In doing so, Ruoff acknowledged that the Supreme Court’s ConVal ruling overturned his 2023 directive that the Legislature must change the adequacy formula to a minimum of $7,356.01 per student. 
“If the Court’s rulings, as outlined herein, are upheld on appeal or otherwise become final, the Court anticipates that the legislature will work diligently to enact a new school funding scheme that comports with the State’s constitutional obligations,” he wrote. “If, however, the plaintiffs form the belief that the legislature is not acting diligently in this regard, the plaintiffs may file a renewed request for injunctive relief.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/kidswriting-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-20 05:56:31.988202

Chris Murphy, D-Conn., called on Connecticut to take a “hard line” and ban private equity ownership of hospitals, citing deteriorating conditions at three facilities owned by Prospect Medical Holdings, a hospital operator formerly backed by private equity investors. 
In a report the senator’s office published Wednesday, Murphy documented conversations with hospital employees in which they described Prospect’s mismanagement of its three Connecticut hospitals: Rockville General, Manchester Memorial and Waterbury Hospitals. 
“The state will be much better off if we just say private equity companies shouldn’t own our hospitals,” Murphy said in an interview with The Connecticut Mirror. The senator said the report was intended to shed light on what happened with Prospect and prevent similar companies from operating Connecticut’s hospitals in the future.
Murphy’s report comes as the state awaits the launch of an auction to find new ownership for Prospect’s Connecticut facilities — one step in the sprawling company’s months-long bankruptcy proceedings. The sale process will be overseen by U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Northern Texas, where Prospect filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January. 
Prospect purchased the Connecticut hospitals in 2016. Since then, the facilities have faced crumbling infrastructure, supply shortages and other challenges, hospital workers told Murphy.
An operating room assistant at Waterbury Hospital said supplies were so scarce after Prospect’s takeover that patients were “sometimes left on the operating table while staff scrambled.” Nurses and technicians reported personally buying food for patients so they wouldn’t go hungry after Prospect stopped paying vendors, according to the report. 
At Manchester Memorial, Prospect reduced staffing to the point that there was no longer a doctor available on overnight shifts. One physician there said the hospital reached a point where he would not recommend his own family members receive treatment there.
At Rockville General, Prospect cut all care except for the emergency department and outpatient mental health services without applying for required state permission to do so.
Deborah Weymouth, CEO of Prospect’s Connecticut hospitals, said Murphy’s report relied on anecdotes that hadn’t been independently verified.
“The concern surrounding private equity in healthcare does not reflect the quality of care being delivered in our hospitals each day. Senator Murphy’s ‘Share Your Story’ initiative is aimed at advancing policy discussions and reform, not evaluating the clinical performance of individual hospitals,” Weymouth wrote in the statement. “Calling out unconfirmed events to make a political point completely undermines the local constituents and their life’s work.”
The Connecticut Department of Public Health and a court-appointed patient care ombuds regularly conduct visits to the Prospect hospitals to ensure patient safety standards are being met, Weymouth added.
In a July 29 report in the company’s bankruptcy proceedings, a court-appointed patient care ombuds found no supply issues at the Prospect Connecticut hospitals and noted that staffing had “significantly improved.”

Murphy isn’t the only elected official calling for an end to private equity ownership of health care in Connecticut. 
During the most recent state legislative session, lawmakers tried and failed — for the second year in a row — to pass any measures to curb it. Two different proposals were considered.
The first, backed by Gov. Ned Lamont, sought to increase oversight of major health care transactions, like hospital mergers and acquisitions. The other would have taken Murphy’s preferred approach, banning private equity ownership of hospitals outright.
In June, Rep. Cristin McCarthy Vahey, D-Fairfield, co-chair of the Public Health Committee, said part of the issue was that lawmakers failed to thread the two proposals together in time to bring a bill up for a vote. But industry financial interests also played a role, she said.
McCarthy Vahey told Murphy that lobbyists “showed up the second to last day or the last day of session … ten of them, or twelve of them, objecting to the current version of the bill.”
The private equity playbook
Prospect came to Connecticut promising to invest in the hospitals. An employee who worked in the emergency room at Waterbury Hospital told Murphy that the company had promised a whole new ER, and even went so far as to post blueprints in the break room. It never came to be.
As hospital employees faced empty promises and deteriorating conditions, investors profited.
In 2018, Prospect took out a $1.1 billion loan and used the funds to pay its executives and shareholders a $457 million dividend, CBS News reported. To repay the loan, Prospect sold the land and buildings from hospitals it owns in Connecticut, California and Pennsylvania to a real estate investment trust for $1.4 billion, then leased back those hospitals from the trust. 
[RELATED: In 2016, Rockville was a bustling local hospital. Then Prospect took over.]
Sam Lee, the CEO of Prospect from 2007 to 2023, “made out like a bandit,” Murphy stated in the report. Lee owned two homes in Los Angeles worth more than $15 million combined, according to Murphy’s report.
“Sam Lee pillaged three Medicaid hospitals in Connecticut so he could have two mansions 11 minutes apart,” the report stated. 
Despite the damage that’s been done, Murphy said he believes it’s possible to rein in private equity in health care. 
“Private equity still only has a small foothold in the acute care hospital setting,” Murphy said. 
“It’s not too late to make a decision collectively, as a state and as a country, that we don’t want these profit-obsessed, rapacious private equity companies owning our most critical health care facilities,” he said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/MURPHY-PE-HOSPITALS-1024x788.jpg,,,2025-08-20 05:56:31.988202

(Photo illustration by Dean Mitchell via Getty Images)In 2018 the U.S. Census predicted that by 2034, for the first time, those 65 and older would outnumber those 18 and younger.
Put another way, according to Dr. David Shulkin, the former U.S. Veterans Affairs secretary, by 2034 adult diaper sales are projected to surpass baby diaper sales.
New Hampshire is among 11 states where older adults already outnumber children. Nationally, over the four years from 2020-2024, census data shows that growth in the 65-and-older population was over nine times greater than growth in the working age adult population.
There is an obvious demographic problem here. The number of Americans who can prospectively serve those in long-term care, should they choose this difficult work, will be vastly outnumbered by those needing long-term care.
Immigration reform is the obvious answer to building our caregiving workforce, but we’re now in an immigration freeze. I have seen the facile suggestion from some immigration opponents that providers only need to increase wages and benefits to attract native-born workers. Yet they have already tried this: Federal data shows that wages for non-supervisory workers in long-term care facilities are up over 36% since the COVID-19 pandemic began five years ago, and yet the overall workforce only recovered its pre-pandemic level in January.
Finally getting up to February 2020 workforce levels hardly meets the needs of a senior population that has grown exponentially since then. We have New Hampshire nursing homes with waiting lists because they cannot responsibly admit residents due to staffing, despite having the bed capacity. And the deportation of those with Temporary Protected Status, such as Haitians, threatens to remove existing workers — perhaps 10% of the caregivers in a single Boston nursing home, for example.
Nationally Medicaid is the payor for 63% of all nursing home residents, and Medicaid took huge cuts in the federal budget bill signed by President Donald Trump. Even if the federal contributions to state Medicaid programs were not being slashed, the ability of states, which must live within balanced budgets, to improve Medicaid funding is not inexhaustible. Within limited means, inevitably a generational conflict will be exacerbated between the need for states to fund basic and higher education and the need to fund care for seniors and those with disabilities.
Currently, data shows that immigrants comprise 32% of the home care workforce, and 21% of the frontline caregivers — nursing assistants — working in nursing homes. By 2032 it is projected that home care will lead all occupations in job growth, with software developers distantly trailing in second place. And native-born Americans are not lining up for this work.
Although my wife works in home health, she receives no pay whatsoever when her clients are hospitalized. And while nursing home work is steady, Medicaid funding is precarious. Validating the warning from Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina that federal budget cuts would result in “tens of billions of dollars in lost funding for North Carolina,” Tillis’ state, in response to those cuts and the inability of state legislators to coalesce around sustainable Medicaid funding, recently announced 10% rate cuts for nursing home care.
These types of uncertainties can make recruitment for long-term care employment tough.
No reasonable person can disagree that we had an immigration enforcement problem. It was a leading issue in the 2024 presidential election, and undocumented immigration was creating a humanitarian crisis in cities and border states.
Yet when the public feels we have protected our borders against unlawful entry I see real room in public opinion for immigration reform. Where in 2024 Gallup found 55% of Americans wanting less immigration, the first such majority since 2005, polling now shows only 30% believe that.
In his last speech as president, Ronald Reagan chose to promote immigration, stating that “[t]hanks to each wave of new arrivals to this land of opportunity, we’re a nation forever young, forever bursting with energy and new ideas, and always on the cutting edge, always leading the world to the next frontier.”
We are a much older nation today than when Reagan gave this speech in 1989. And it is because of that fact, and the needs of our older population, that facilitating lawful immigration is more vital than ever.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/caregivingworkforce-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-08-20 05:56:31.988202

“No student should be punished or excluded from learning because of the way their hair naturally grows or how they choose to wear it to embrace their culture,” Brent said in a news release. “The C.R.O.W.N. Act affirms that every child in Ohio deserves to show up as their full self, without facing bias or discipline because of their appearance.”
This is the fourth legislative session in a row Brent has introduced the CROWN Act. The bill passed the Ohio House in the last General Assembly, but only had sponsor testimony in the Ohio Senate. 
The bipartisan bill prohibits discrimination against someone’s hair texture and protective hair styles such as braids, locs, twists and afros under Ohio’s Civil Rights Laws.
“This is not just a cultural issue — it’s an educational equity issue,” Brent said in a news release. “Bipartisan support for this bill shows that Ohio is ready to take real steps to create safe, inclusive learning environments for all our students.”
If the bill were to become law, a student would be able to bring a civil action lawsuit to court if their school violates HB 415. 
Twenty-seven states and Washington D.C., have already enacted the CROWN Act. A handful of Ohio cities — including Columbus, Akron, Cleveland Heights, Cleveland Heights, and Cincinnati — have already enacted the CROWN Act at the local level. 
Two-thirds of Black children in majority-white schools have faced race-based hair discrimination, according to a 2021 CROWN Act study. Of those children, 86% reported experiencing hair discrimination by age 12.

Sherrod Brown (Photo from Brown's website.)Former Ohio U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown is back, officially announcing on Monday his long-anticipated campaign to reclaim a seat in Congress. Ohio Republicans are ready to fight.
“I didn’t plan to run for office again, but when I see what’s going on, I know I can do something about it for Ohio,” Brown said in his announcement. “That’s why I’m running for Senate. Because even in these challenging times, I still believe if you stand up for workers, treat people with respect and always fight for Ohio, you can actually make a difference.”
Brown, who lost his seat in 2024 to Sen. Bernie Moreno, is returning to the political spotlight, and the stakes are high.
“Ohio could very well be the tipping point state for the entire Senate,” said Ohio Democratic strategist David Pepper.
Ohio Democratic Party members, including Pepper, say that the senator’s history of supporting workers will be key to his campaign.
“I think Sherrod’s message, which really gets sort of the wherewithal of every Ohio family in a time where people are really struggling and stressed, I think it’s gonna really hit home,” Pepper said.
He will face off against Ohio Republican U.S. Sen. Jon Husted, whom President Donald Trump and the rest of the Ohio GOP, like party leader Tony Schroeder, are backing.
“Senator Husted’s devotion to the conservative values that we just got done voting for, for President Trump last November, are going to wind up carrying the day,” Schroeder said.
Husted was appointed to his role by Gov. Mike DeWine this January and has already raised $6 million.
“We just got done telling Senator Brown that we didn’t want him to represent us in D.C. anymore, and we’re about to do it again,” Schroeder said. “He’s carried every bit of the woke agenda in D.C. — the open border was a huge issue in Ohio, absolutely huge, and he voted for all of it.”
Brown’s campaign has already begun targeting Husted for his votes to make massive cuts to Medicaid and SNAP.
Husted’s team sent us this statement from spokesperson Tyson Shepard:
“Sherrod Brown’s recent announcement means Ohioans will face a clear choice in 2026. For 30 years, he has imposed Washington’s problems on Ohio, pushing radical liberal policies that have left a lasting burden on the next generation. Jon Husted offers the opposite approach, applying Ohio’s values and solutions to fix a broken Washington. The challenges our nation faces are the same ones Husted has helped our state confront and overcome, championing the values he learned growing up in northwest Ohio: hard work, personal responsibility, family, faith, freedom and patriotism.”
Even though Brown over-performed Democrats all over the country, including Kamala Harris by eight points in Ohio, he lost by four points to Moreno.
Pepper was asked about Brown’s 2024 loss and how he fixes it for 2026.
“I mean it’s a combination of things,” Pepper said. “if you ever lose, you don’t say, ‘Well, we should do everything the same.’ Of course, the Trump turnout mattered. We clearly have to do better in our cities.”

(Photo by Alex Brandon - Pool/Getty Images)Within a year, Kansans will be voting to elect a new governor and fill a U.S. Senate seat, plus four congressional seats, among elections for other offices. Candidates are already announcing for office, and campaigns are getting underway.
Most Republican candidates are fawning at the feet of President Donald Trump. The groveling of these sycophants may be misplaced as Kansas voters recall the toxic remains of Gov. Sam Brownback’s infamous tax experiment, initiated in 2012 and abandoned in 2017 after five years of unfair taxes, deficit spending, and record debt.
Trump’s “one big, beautiful bill” has followed a path that parallels Brownback’s tax experiment and may experience the same result. After six months in office, available evidence suggests that Trump and the bill may become political liabilities for the grovelers.
Take a look at the parallels.
Both Brownback and Trump chose partisanship rather than seeking common ground, and as a result, political liability falls entirely on Republicans. Democrats were shut out of decisions. Both partisan plans had to be forced through with brazen arm-twisting.
When Brownback’s tax bill stalled over disagreements between the legislative chambers, the governor double-crossed state Senate leadership and signed a flawed bill intended for negotiation. Brownback later stood aside as the Kansas Chamber of Commerce PAC effectively purged state senators of the governor’s party who opposed the policy.
Trump issued multiple threats of primary challenges targeted at resistant Republicans to bring them into line on the “big, beautiful bill.” One senator who balked fell victim to the pressure and announced he would not seek reelection.
Both Brownback’s tax experiment and Trump’s bill were Koch inspired. Brownback sought the advice of Arthur Laffer, a Koch-sponsored tax-cut guru, and shortly thereafter embraced “a real live experiment” to eliminate state income taxes. Koch and a handful of well-heeled donors underwrote a million-dollar campaign through the Chamber PAC to elect legislators willing to do their bidding. Their campaign succeeded.
Americans for Prosperity, a Koch political network, called early for Trump to renew and deepen tax cuts and launched a multimillion-dollar campaign to “turn up the heat” on Congress for quick passage.
Both Brownback’s tax experiment and Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” had common intent: Benefiting the wealthy while costing everyone else. Brownback’s experiment tilted the tax burden from rich to poor; it further exempted 330,000 businesses from the income tax and promised the eventual elimination of the tax.
Trump’s law gives households with incomes in the top 10% a break of $12,000 per year while those in the bottom 10% pay an additional $1,600, according to estimates by the Congressional Budget Office. The top 1% are the prime beneficiaries.
Additionally, both Brownback and Trump coupled tax cuts for the rich with measures undermining aid to the needy. Brownback restricted eligibility for income support and food assistance and blocked the expansion of Medicaid.
The budget office estimates the “big, beautiful bill” will slash more than $1 trillion in spending from Medicaid and food assistance for the next 10 years, primarily by restricting eligibility for aid. Ten to 12 million will be cut from Medicaid, and those qualified for food assistance will fall as well.
Brownback’s experiment created red ink as far as the eye could see, and Trump’s plan will do the same. The Kansas Legislative Research Department projected soaring deficits from Brownback’s tax experiment, amounting to $2.5 billion in the first five years. Even after a sales tax increase, the depletion of state balances and the diversion of highway funds, the state faced a mid-year deficit of $300 million in 2017.
The Congressional Budget Office estimates Trump’s law will increase the deficit to $3.4 trillion over the next 10 years and add $4 trillion to the national debt when interest payments are taken into account.
Even so, the rhetoric of both Brownback and Trump soared: Brownback claimed his experiment would provide “a glide path to zero” for state income taxes. And further: “Look out Texas, here comes Kansas!” Trump declares the “big, beautiful bill” would “make this country into a rocket ship. It’s going to be really great. … We’ll have growth in record numbers.”
After five years of unbalanced budgeting, one-sided taxing, and unprecedented borrowing, Kansas voters had seen enough of Brownback’s experiment. The governor’s approval ratings steadily sank to the lowest in the nation among governors. In 2016, voters ousted Brownback’s legislative allies and elected a bipartisan legislative coalition that expeditiously abandoned the experiment and restored sanity to state finances.
In Trump’s first six months, his disapproval ratings have bumped up by 10 percentage points, well above comparable figures for Biden, Obama, and George W. Bush. Recent polling indicates 55% disapproval of the “big, beautiful bill,” compared with 29% approval.
In the upcoming election contests, Kansans will have the opportunity to query incumbents about their choices: shoddy partisan tactics over bipartisanship. Sponsorship by Koch. Support for taxes that benefit the rich and ditch the poor. Votes that swamped the state and nation in a sea of red ink.
We now what they did back in 2016. We’ll see what they decide in 2026.

(Photo by Graham Stokes for the Ohio Capital Journal / Republish photo only with original story.)What Pandora’s Box has Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine opened by joining other Republican-led states in sending hundreds of reinforcement National Guard troops to Washington, D.C. to join the 800 military already mobilized on the streets of the nation’s capital? 
Whatever possessed the lame duck Republican governor to become complicit in Donald Trump’s authoritarian power grab to seize control of an American city with a manufactured “crime emergency” and boots on the ground? 
DeWine must know the bizarre, militarized occupation of D.C. is based on fallacies about rising Washington crime debunked by data that proves otherwise.
Six GOP states send more than 1,000 National Guard to D.C. for Trump crackdown

 To be sure, violent crime is a serious, ongoing problem in D.C. — as it is in other major U.S. cities — but Trump’s hostile takeover of the capital city is not about effective crime-fighting and prevention. It is a distraction. A stunt. Trump has to change the subject about the Epstein coverup with something surreal.
But deployment of National Guard troops in iconic Washington — whose number will nearly double in size after the out-of-state reinforcements arrive — is a gross abuse of power by a would-be autocrat whose favorite tactic is to assert fake emergencies (with no acute crisis) as cover for extreme action. 
Trump has declared 11 of them since January to justify everything from turning the southern border into a military zone (and soldiers into de facto border police) to setting tariffs on every country in the world, promoting fossil fuel production and exerting police power (deploying National Guard troops, federal agents and actual military) in an appalling show of force and weaponry meant to strike fear first in Los Angeles and now in the District.
Tourists on the National Mall are greeted by active-duty soldiers on a domestic mission to surveil Americans and keep them law-abiding. 
The troops have their marching orders from a charlatan drunk on power to look tough on crime as they sightsee in combat fatigues. 
Many will soon be armed against enemy civilians who cross the line — a reversal of initial deployment directives that Guard troops would wear body armor but leave their weapons at the armory. 
Tactical armored vehicles, developed for troops in Afghanistan, are parked throughout D.C. on apparent standby to combat falling crime. Newly erected barricades and random checkpoints conducted by masked federal law enforcement appear out of nowhere.
Outraged local residents have erupted into spontaneous “Free D.C.” demonstrations to protest the insane federal surge of law enforcement flexing its muscle and stopping people for no apparent reason. 
The militarized patrols have had a chilling effect on free speech and the exercise of assembly, but that’s right out of the authoritarian’s playbook. 
Trump uses his unchecked power as a weapon to crush the vulnerable into submission. His stated rationale for excessive use of force in D.C. is to rehabilitate “conditions of law and order,” which is rich coming from a convicted felon who praised and pardoned lawbreakers who violently assaulted police officers, rampaged through the U.S. Capitol and hunted the vice president to hang.  
The performative theatrics of Trump’s military policing of Americans — in the ostensible land of the free — would almost be comical if the unprecedented siege of armed combatants against fellow citizens wasn’t so scary. 
Trump has made no secret of his intentions to squash self-rule elsewhere, too. He has indicated troops could be deployed to other Americans cities such as New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Baltimore where, coincidentally, the mayors are all Black Democrats. 
This is the dystopian hellscape we feared under construction. Trump is desperate to distract his base from his years-long relationship with an infamous pedophile accused of victimizing hundreds of teenage girls, so why not normalize military occupations in America with Republican enablers like Ohio’s governor?
“We’ve been asked by the Secretary of the Army to send 150 military police from the Ohio National Guard to support the District of Columbia National Guard,” read a brief statement from DeWine’s office Saturday night. 
Ohio guard members will “carry out presence patrols and serve as added security,” the press release explained with an odd asterisk that none of the military police from Ohio were “currently serving as law enforcement officers in the state of Ohio.”  
Wait, what? DeWine just dispatched Ohio soldiers to play cops on the beat in Washington but it’s okay?! My friends, we are deep down the rabbit hole.
Would the governor also welcome hundreds of troops to carry out presence patrols in Ohio cities with higher crime rates than D.C., as a few do? 
Would that also warrant hostile federal takeovers by armed military rolling from Toledo to Dayton to restore “law and order” under Trump’s selective application of justice? 
When word spread about DeWine’s decision to send military reinforcements — to be deployed against a nation’s own people — demonstrators gathered at the Ohio Statehouse to protest his offering of homegrown troops “to further militarize D.C.” 
What if Columbus is next?
Could Ohioans count on their governor to be a bulwark against an authoritarian regime leveraging the military for control of Ohio’s “big three” cities, or would DeWine follow orders as a partisan invertebrate to the end and reinforce the takeover with more troops to suppress dissent, maintain power and project strength? 
Ask the 150 Ohio soldiers on their way to D.C.

The Trump administration is once again pressuring cities and states to cooperate with deportation efforts, despite previous setbacks in court.
Attorney General Pam Bondi sent letters last week telling sanctuary states, cities and counties that “you better be abiding by our federal policies and with our federal law enforcement, because if you aren’t, we’re going to come after you,” she said in a Fox News interview. She demanded the areas answer her by Tuesday.
Cities and states with so-called sanctuary policies generally refuse to assist with immigration raids or accede to requests for local jails to hold prisoners for deportation. Those that responded to Stateline’s questions about the letters said they were not inclined to change their positions about cooperation with immigration authorities.
“It’s the tactic of a bully. And the only way to deal with a bully is to let them know that they’re not going to intimidate you,” Rhode Island Democratic Attorney General Peter Neronha said in a statement.
The Trump administration is attempting to force more cooperation with immigration arrests. But it suffered a serious court reversal on July 25, when a federal judge dismissed a sanctuary policies case against Illinois, Chicago and Cook County.
The state and local policies reflect a “decision to not participate in enforcing civil immigration law — a decision protected by the Tenth Amendment,” Judge Lindsay Jenkins wrote in an order now under appeal.
Bondi’s letters follow the Justice Department’s Aug. 5 release of a list of sanctuary jurisdictions including 12 states, the District of Columbia, four counties and 18 cities. That’s fewer jurisdictions than the 14 states and almost 500 counties and cities that appeared on an earlier list, which the agency withdrew after criticism that it included conservative counties that were fully cooperating with immigration enforcement.
The states on the new list are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington state. The list also includes some counties and cities in those states as well as in Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New Mexico.










It's the tactic of a bully. And the only way to deal with a bully is to let them know that they're not going to intimidate you.


– Rhode Island Democratic Attorney General Peter Neronha


Other federal courts have issued injunctions to at least temporarily stop Trump administration from withholding unrelated federal funding from governments that don’t cooperate on immigration. Cities, counties and states have filed lawsuits challenging Trump’s executive orders targeting sanctuary policies, including a February order that federal payments to states and localities must not “by design or effect, facilitate the subsidization or promotion of illegal immigration, or abet so-called ‘sanctuary’ policies that seek to shield illegal aliens from deportation.”
“The executive orders are directing agencies to basically take a maximalist approach to putting pressure on local governments to cooperate with immigration [enforcement], even though they’re not required to do so by federal law,” said Jonathan Miller, one of the attorneys working on the California case for the Public Rights Project, a California-based group promoting civil rights protections for states and cities.
One city on the administration’s list was Rochester, New York, which disciplined some police officers for helping federal agents make a March arrest in the city. The city already faces a lawsuit brought by the Trump administration that prominently mentions the arrest of three men from Guatemala; one of whom has since pleaded guilty to re-entering the United States after a previous deportation.
States, sheriffs puzzle over Trump’s error-filled list of immigration sanctuaries

A spokesperson for the city, Barbara Pierce, said in a statement to The Guardian that, “Nothing in Attorney General Bondi’s letter is new and none of it has legal merit.”
“The letter reiterates many of the frivolous arguments that the federal government has already made in its pending suit against the city of Rochester,” she added. “These same arguments were levied against the city of Chicago and were dismissed by the federal district court for the eastern district of Illinois nearly a month ago.”
Ally Sullivan, a spokesperson for Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis, said in a statement that Colorado “is not a sanctuary state. The Governor continues to be frustrated by this mistaken and incorrect label.” In a televised interview earlier this year, Polis pointed out that Colorado fully cooperates with federal authorities on criminal matters. Immigration, he said, is a civil matter.
“In Colorado, we are improving public safety, apprehending dangerous criminals, cooperating with federal law enforcement on criminal investigations, and keeping our communities safe,” Sullivan said.
Nevertheless, Colorado faces a federal lawsuit brought by the administration over its alleged sanctuary policies. Polis signed a measure in May that limits local law enforcement’s communication with federal immigration authorities and restricts where federal authorities can operate within schools, child care facilities, hospitals and libraries without a judicial warrant.
ICE has a new courthouse tactic: Get immigrants’ cases tossed, then arrest them outside

Connecticut Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont in a statement said the state’s Trust Act, which the Trump administration has targeted as a sanctuary policy, was passed with bipartisan support and helps ensure local police concentrate on serious crimes. The Trust Act, passed in 2013 and expanded in 2019, limits information sharing and compliance with requests to detain immigrants for federal immigration authorities.
“Nothing about this makes Connecticut a sanctuary in any legal or practical sense — it makes our state one that upholds the Constitution, respects the rule of law, and prioritizes the safety and well-being of our communities,” Lamont said.

Brown,,,,,https://marylandmatters.org/2025/08/20/religious-exemptions-for-school-vaccinations-have-been-growing-since-covid/,"About 1.7% of the state’s 63,000 kindergartners, or 1,075 kids, were exempted from required vaccinations for religious reasons during the 2024-2025 school year, continuing a steady increase of the last four years, according to new state data.","Despite a growing number of kids getting religious exemptions from required school vaccinations, Maryland still vaccinates a higher percentage of students than the national average. (Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)“No Shots. No School. No Exceptions.” That’s what’s parents are greeted with on the Prince George’s County Public Schools webpage on required vaccinations for the upcoming school year.
But that’s not entirely true. In Maryland, there are exceptions — specifically, families can easily get religious exemptions to opt their kindergartners out of vaccine requirements in any school year.
And more Maryland families have been choosing that route for the last four school years, according to Maryland Department of Health data released this week.
About 1.7% of the state’s 63,000 kindergartners, or approximately 1,075 kids, cited religious reasons to be exempted from required vaccinations during the 2024-2025 school year.
It’s the highest percentage of religious exemptions since the 2019-2020 school year, when the start of the COVID-19 pandemic not only ushered in a new wave of vaccine hesitancy but also disrupted typical school procedures for many families.



Since the 2021-2022 school year, at least 1% of kindergartners in Maryland have had a religious exemption – a couple hundred a year – and it’s been rising since.
While it’s still a relatively small percent of students compared to the rest of the population, and well below the national rate, public health advocates call rising number of unvaccinated kids “concerning.”
“COVID put us behind the eight ball in terms of vaccination levels in kids,” said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association.
“It’s a very concerning trend because we need to maintain adequate vaccination levels to maintain herd immunity,” Benjamin said Tuesday. “These childhood diseases are not benign. They’re very dangerous.”
Maryland law requires that children have a handful of vaccinations when they enter kindergarten, in order to protect themselves and their classmates from transmissible diseases, such as measles, polio and chickenpox, among others. Children can be exempted if there is a medical reason they cannot receive a vaccine or a religious restriction against it.
A medical exemption requires a written statement from a physician that vaccination would be harmful to the student. But invoking a religious exemption in Maryland is simple. Parents can just sign a form that says: “Because of my bona fide religious beliefs and practices, I object to any vaccine(s) being given to my child.”
Religious exemptions spiked in 2019-2020 when 2.7% of kindergartners, or 1,641 kids, opted out of vaccination requirements. The COVID-19 pandemic did not go into full swing until spring 2020, so those families would have opted out prior to the pandemic in the United States.
Public health officials and researchers look at nonmedical religious exemptions as an imperfect metric for vaccine hesitancy among families, though tracking such data is a tricky task.
“To the extent that people are looking at ways to opt out of being vaccinated, you will see a higher increase in people taking advantage of … religious exemptions,” Benjamin said.
The rate of religious exemptions varies by school district and can be influenced by population size.


Kent and Garrett counties have the highest rate of religious exemptions in the state, for example, with more than 4% of kindergartners  in those counties getting a religious exemption from vaccines last school year, according to the data.
But Kent County had just 155 kindergartners in the 2024-2025 school year, so if seven kids had a religious exemption, that would account for 4.5% of Kent County kindergarten students.
Similarly, Garrett County had 243 students in its 2024-2025 kindergarten class. The 4.12% receiving a religious exemption from vaccinations represents about 10 kids.
“We have fewer kindergartners,” said Rebecca Aiken, school health services manager for Garrett County Public Schools. “It can really skew the numbers.”
She said that there could be many reasons why some kids are not up to date on their vaccinations or use a religious exemption to opt out of them.
She noted that some kids are homeless or do not have a stationary home life, moving between family members or living with grandparents, which can make record-keeping for immunizations challenging. The county tries to help families in those situations get their vaccinations or find their records.
But with the ease of religious opt-out for vaccines, Aiken said there’s no way to know why someone selects the religious exemption for vaccines.
“We can’t force them to prove their religion, so we have to take it at face value,” she said.
She noted that even if the families opt their kids out of vaccination requirements, the county health officials and school nurses help keep the families informed about communicable diseases.
Sherelle Jones, an official with the Prince George’s County Office of School Health, noted that compliance with the vaccination requirement is down for the upcoming school year, but she has not noticed a rise in vaccine hesitancy specifically.
She’s hearing that some families who do not have health care coverage have struggled to get their kids vaccinated. Prince George’s County Public Schools has hosted vaccination clinics in hopes of closing that coverage gap.
Last school year, Prince George’s County’s schools had about 1.7% of its kindergartners getting a nonmedical religious exemption from vaccinations, on par with the state as a whole.
Jones noted that there is still time for families to comply with the vaccination requirements, as school doesn’t start until Aug. 26 in Prince George’s County.
RFK Jr. ends COVID vaccine recommendation for healthy children, pregnant people

But Benjamin noted that families are coming in with more questions about vaccines, which he says is a result of new messaging at the federal level about when to receive vaccines and at what age.
“There is a very well-organized, well-funded antivaccine community out there,” Benjamin said. “Coupled with some of the mistrust that has been promoted by the current Health Secretary [Robert F.] Kennedy — that has raised the questions in people’s minds about when their kids should get their shots, how many shots they should get and whether they should get these shots.
“My colleagues that are practicing pediatrics are telling me that more and more parents are coming in with more questions about vaccinations,” he said. “I would not equate that to vaccine hesitancy, although there is certainly more of that.”
While the rate of religious exemptions is going up in Maryland, state health officials say that vaccine coverage among Maryland kindergartners is still high, especially compared to the rates nationally. The Centers for Disease Control and prevention said 3.6% of kindergartners nationwide were exempt from vaccinations for the 2024-2025 school year, up from 3.3% the previous year.
“In general, vaccine coverage rates remain high in Maryland. The overall exemption rates remain below the national average and stable at 2.2% compared to the previous school year,” said David McCallister, public information officer for the state health department in a written statement. The 2.2% figure combines both 1.7% of kids who have a religious exemption and the 0.5% who have a medical exemption in the 2024-2025 school year.
McCallister noted there’s been an increase in exemptions, “specifically non-medical exemptions” since the COVID-19 pandemic.
“The Department will continue to monitor school exemption trends very closely, especially with regard to their relationship to vaccine preventable diseases,” McCallister said. “MDH continues to recommend vaccinations for all children.”

Local police have indicated publicly that they will not get involved in civil complaints around the power line, leaving workers defenseless, the company said, arguing that the court should assign U.S. marshals to accompany workers in the field to protect them when needed.
In addition to threats of violence in the field, the company said it is “concerned about the safety of its land agents and surveyors given the social media atmosphere in which many individuals are openly calling for violence against the Company’s surveyors and land agents, as well as local law enforcement officials’ public statements of non-involvement,” the petition said.
A company spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the filing Tuesday. But a member of Stop MPRP, the grassroots group of landowners and others who have been fighting the power line for the past year, called the petition little more than a “scare tactic” by a “private, multibillion-dollar company.”
“We don’t believe violence is ever an answer or even threats of violence,” said Betsy McFarland,  who owns 3 acres of land in Frederick County with her husband. “But regardless of that, we understand why people are so upset.
“We’re all donating our time to this cause because we care about our community,” McFarland said. “For this private, multibillion-dollar company to be able to come in and threaten people and take their land is not fair. We want to see the process play out.”
Federal judge grants Piedmont power line company access to land for surveys

McFarland noted that the Maryland Public Service Commission has not granted a key certificate that would allow construction on the power line to move forward.
But PSEG argues that PSC approval cannot come until a route can be mapped. It said it was selected by the regional electric grid operator, PJM Interconnection, and given a deadline of June 1, 2027, to place the 67-mile power transmission line in service — or risk blackouts or other woes due to increasing strain on the electric grid.
The MPRP line is planned to deliver power generated by a plant in southern Pennsylvania, carrying it from northern Baltimore County to southern Frederick County. PJM has said it needs the additional capacity to keep pace with rising demand for electricity at a time when aging power plants in Maryland are set to be retired, and new generation capacity is lagging.
Critics say the project not only presents a threat to private property along the route, but that it would destroy the rural nature of the region, interfere with family farms, harm forests and streams and endanger a longtime youth camp.
Friday’s filing is the latest in a court case that began in May, when PSEG sued more than 100 landowners in the power line corridor who it said were refusing surveyors access to their property for the project.
U.S. District Judge Adam Abelson sided with the company in June, ruling that surveyors had a right to enter a property and “remain … to the extent reasonably necessary to make surveys, run lines or levels, or obtain information relating to the acquisition and future use of the properties in connection with the Maryland Piedmont Reliability Project.” Abelson said the company would first have to provide at least 24 hours of notice of its visits by “taping a notice on the front door.”
Opponents appealed Abelson’s ruling, but the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has not taken the case up yet. In the meantime, PSEG filed suit againts more property owners — a company spokesman said at the time that a lawsuit against a third group of property owners was expected — and began surveying properties in the first group.
The company said most landowners have been cooperative. But in addition to the social media threats, the petition cited six incidents when property owners yelled things to surveyors such as, “Do not come on my property, I have a gun, and I will shoot you,” and “get the [expletive] off my property.” Others threatened to sic dogs on the workers or stopped inches from hitting them with an ATV, the petition said.
The company asked the court to assign U.S. marshals to protect workers when they are threatened, and to set up an expedited process for requesting protection. That petition was filed Friday; Abelson on Monday approved an expedited hearing schedule, giving the property owners until Wednesday to file a response, and the company until Friday to reply.
McFarland said she was not named in any of the lawsuits to date, but said that could change in the near future.
“We’re probably going to get named in a future lawsuit because we’re not letting them on our property either, unless the court requires it,” she said. “I’m going to politely ask them to leave if they try.”

(Photo from the Mississippi Department of Education via The 74 Million)There are many signs of the end of summer in Maryland, and when State Superintendent Carey Wright starts making the rounds of counties to visit schools, it’s a good sign that summer is ending and the school year is starting.
Wright plans to be in Frederick County early Wednesday to see the smiling faces of teachers, faculty — maybe even smiling students — when schools there open for the 2o25-26 academic year. Frederick is one of the first two counties to return tomorrow, along with St. Mary’s County.
Joining Wright will be Frederick County Public Schools Superintendent Cheryl Dyson, the system’s first Black superintendent, now entering her fourth year in the job. Dyson recently received a national award for her work.
Next Monday, Wright is scheduled to visit Baltimore County, one of nine school systems opening on Aug. 25. They will be followed by Calvert, Montgomery and Prince George’s counties on Aug. 25 and Allegany County on Aug. 27. The remaining nine school systems are set to open Sept. 2, the day after Labor Day, according to a state Department of Education calendar.
If it’s any consolation to the kids in Frederick and St. Mary’s counties, the calendar shows that they’re scheduled to be among the first to get out of school next June.
Further information on Wright’s first-day travels was not available as of Monday afternoon.
Lierman scraping for short-term rental scofflaws
Maryland Comptroller Brooke Lierman is looking at short-term rentals in the state.
The effort by the state’s top tax collector has less to do with finding a unique or fun place to stay on vacation and more to do with ensuring that anyone renting out properties in the state is reporting everything on their taxes.
  Comptroller Brooke Lierman (D) said her agency is scraping public data on short-term rental properties in Maryland to ensure each owner “pays their fair share.” (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters.)
This year, the General Assembly passed legislation to centralize the collection of taxes on short-term rentals — think platforms such as Vrbo and Airbnb. Coupled with that are new regulations that have yet to be implemented. Lierman said her agency is already looking at the state’s new law and similar legislation in other states.
“There are probably a couple cleanup things that we’d like to do this year that we’ll talk with the sponsors about, but we care very much about making sure that everybody pays their fair share, and then it gets back to you,” Lierman told the audience at the Maryland Association of Counties meeting last week. “So that will be our central driving force — to make sure that all the taxes are collected and that they are remitted to the appropriate place, and that we’re accounting for that along the way.”
Tangential to that effort, Lierman told the gathering of county officials in Ocean City that her office is now looking for rental owners who might not be honest in reporting their rental income.
Lierman told attendees at the MACo summer conference Saturday that her office has hired a consultant to “scrape publicly available data through Vrbo and Airbnb.”
The data collection is part of an effort to “look at what folks are making and work and then compare that to what they’re reporting their income to us,” Lierman said.
The comptroller said she believes the data collection is the first of its kind in the country.
“So, if I see that you have 10 Ocean City rentals that are rented at $500 a night, nine months of the year. And I don’t see that on your tax return, right?” Lierman said.
‘We told you so’
Members of the legislature’s hard right Freedom Caucus are taking a victory lap after a federal appeals court last week struck down a portion of the state’s digital ad tax.
“The court confirmed what we said from day one: this tax is unconstitutional, reckless, and destined to fail,” said Del. Matt Morgan (R- St. Mary’s), chair of the seven-member group. “Instead of strengthening Maryland’s economy, the Democrat supermajority pushed through a radical scheme to shake down tech companies only to waste millions of taxpayer dollars defending a law that was doomed in the courts.”
The caucus, in letters to Comptroller Brooke Lierman and Attorney General Anthony Brown, both Democrats, demanded to know how much money the state has collected on the tax thus far and how much has been spent defending the law in court.

The 2021 law — the first of its kind in the nation — imposes taxes on large tech companies such as Amazon, Apple and Meta for the digital ads they sell within the state. The law was projected to raise $250 million that would be used to pay for the state’s Blueprint for Maryland’s Future education reform efforts.
But the law faces several legal challenges.
On Friday, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued declared one portion of the law unconstitutional. The three-judge panel found that a provision of the law barring companies from itemizing the cost of the tax on invoices to customers violates the First Amendment.
The court compared the law to Colonial-era tax revolts and said preventing a company from telling customers about the tax is a free-speech  violation.
“No doubt, Maryland has prudential reasons not to want the question answered. But as all we have said so far should make clear, keeping out of hot water with voters is not among the interests that can justify a speech ban,” the court said in its decision.
The ruling does not overturn that tax. The appellate judges merely remanded the case back to U.S. District Court in Maryland where a judge will determine an appropriate remedy. Even so, members of the caucus were quick to taunt Democrats.
“We told you so,” the caucus statement concludes.
Lierman anxious to resolve digital ad tax challenges
Republicans are not the only ones watching the various legal challenges to the ad tax and awaiting a final decision.
Comptroller Brooke Lierman, the state’s top tax collector and an attorney, told Maryland Matters Saturday she had not had an opportunity to fully review the appeals court decision issued the night before.
“I do not think it affects the larger part of the law,” she said, referring to whether or not the state can legally impose the tax.
There are several related legal challenges including one in tax court that could — once all the appeals are exhausted — determine whether the 2021 law stands.
Included in those is a challenge in Maryland Tax Court. “We’re awaiting the tax court’s decision,” Lierman said.
When that decision will come remains an open question.
“We do not know. I wish we did. We’ve been waiting for a while,” said Lierman.
Elliott leaves second floor for campaign trail
More change is coming to the second floor of the State House.
Carter Elliott IV, senior press secretary to Gov. Wes Moore (D), announced his departure in an email to reporters Tuesday. The announcement came a day after Fagan Harris, Moore’s chief of staff, announced he has accepted an offer to become the new president and CEO of the Baltimore-based Abell Foundation.

“As my last day in the Governor’s Office comes to a close I just want to reach out to say it was the greatest pleasure of my life to serve in this role and I’m grateful to have gotten to know some incredible people,” Elliott wrote in his brief goodbye note.
“I grew up in a family where the best career that you could follow was being a farmer, a teacher, or a public servant—this had been my dream for as long as I can remember,” added Elliott, who came to Maryland from Virginia.
Elliott has served nearly three years in Moore’s communications shop. Prior to his state service, he spent seven months with Moore’s first statewide political campaign in 2022.
Elliott described his time in the Moore administration as “a hell of a ride.”
But it’s not the end of the trail for Elliott who leaves his government role to join Moore’s reelection campaign.

The Trump administration has threatened the city over its sanctuary policies. City officials say some officers violated the policy by assisting in the arrests. (Photo courtesy of City of Rochester)The Trump administration is once again pressuring liberal cities and states to cooperate with deportation efforts, despite previous setbacks in court.
Attorney General Pam Bondi sent letters last week telling sanctuary states, cities, and counties that “you better be abiding by our federal policies and with our federal law enforcement, because if you aren’t, we’re going to come after you,” she said in a Fox News interview. She demanded the areas answer her by Tuesday.
Cities and states with so-called sanctuary policies generally refuse to assist with immigration raids or accede to requests for local jails to hold prisoners for deportation. Those that responded to Stateline’s questions about the letters said they were not inclined to change their positions about cooperation with immigration authorities.
“It’s the tactic of a bully. And the only way to deal with a bully is to let them know that they’re not going to intimidate you,” Rhode Island Democratic Attorney General Peter Neronha said in a statement.
The Trump administration is attempting to force more cooperation with immigration arrests. But it suffered a serious court reversal on July 25, when a federal judge dismissed a sanctuary policies case against Illinois, Chicago, and Cook County.
The state and local policies reflect a “decision to not participate in enforcing civil immigration law — a decision protected by the Tenth Amendment,” Judge Lindsay Jenkins wrote in an order now under appeal.
Bondi’s letters follow the Justice Department’s Aug. 5 release of a list of sanctuary jurisdictions including 12 states, the District of Columbia, four counties, and 18 cities. That’s fewer jurisdictions than the 14 states and almost 500 counties and cities that appeared on an earlier list, which the agency withdrew after criticism that it included conservative counties that were fully cooperating with immigration enforcement.
The states on the new list are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington state. The list also includes some counties and cities in those states as well as in Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New Mexico.
(Florida law forbids local governments from enforcing sanctuary policies.)










It's the tactic of a bully. And the only way to deal with a bully is to let them know that they're not going to intimidate you.


– Rhode Island Democratic Attorney General Peter Neronha


Other federal courts have issued injunctions to at least temporarily stop Trump administration from withholding unrelated federal funding from governments that don’t cooperate on immigration. Cities, counties, and states have filed lawsuits challenging Trump’s executive orders targeting sanctuary policies, including a February order that federal payments to states and localities must not “by design or effect, facilitate the subsidization or promotion of illegal immigration, or abet so-called ‘sanctuary’ policies that seek to shield illegal aliens from deportation.”
“The executive orders are directing agencies to basically take a maximalist approach to putting pressure on local governments to cooperate with immigration [enforcement], even though they’re not required to do so by federal law,” said Jonathan Miller, one of the attorneys working on the California case for the Public Rights Project, a California group promoting civil rights protections for states and cities.
One city on the administration’s list was Rochester, New York, which disciplined some police officers for helping federal agents make a March arrest in the city. The city already faces a lawsuit brought by the Trump administration that prominently mentions the arrest of three men from Guatemala, one of whom has since pleaded guilty to re-entering the United States following a previous deportation.
‘Frivolous arguments’
A spokesperson for the city, Barbara Pierce, said in a statement to The Guardian that, “Nothing in Attorney General Bondi’s letter is new and none of it has legal merit.”
“The letter reiterates many of the frivolous arguments that the federal government has already made in its pending suit against the city of Rochester,” she added. “These same arguments were levied against the city of Chicago and were dismissed by the federal district court for the eastern district of Illinois nearly a month ago.”
Ally Sullivan, a spokesperson for Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis, said in a statement that Colorado “is not a sanctuary state. The Governor continues to be frustrated by this mistaken and incorrect label.” In a televised interview earlier this year, Polis pointed out that Colorado fully cooperates with federal authorities on criminal matters. Immigration, he said, is a civil matter.
“In Colorado, we are improving public safety, apprehending dangerous criminals, cooperating with federal law enforcement on criminal investigations, and keeping our communities safe,” Sullivan said.
Nevertheless, Colorado faces a federal lawsuit brought by the administration over its alleged sanctuary policies. Polis signed a measure in May that limits local law enforcement’s communication with federal immigration authorities and restricts where federal authorities can operate within schools, child care facilities, hospitals, and libraries without a judicial warrant.
Connecticut Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont in a statement said the state’s Trust Act, which the Trump administration has targeted as a sanctuary policy, was passed with bipartisan support and helps ensure local police concentrate on serious crimes. The Trust Act, passed in 2013 and expanded in 2019, limits information sharing and compliance with requests to detain immigrants for federal immigration authorities.
“Nothing about this makes Connecticut a sanctuary in any legal or practical sense — it makes our state one that upholds the Constitution, respects the rule of law, and prioritizes the safety and well-being of our communities,” Lamont said.

If we care about making America healthy, we need to fund programs that work.","Slashing SNAP-Ed, WIC, and SNAP isn’t just shortsighted — it’s scientifically indefensible.
If “Make America Healthy Again” were anything more than a political catchphrase, we’d be talking about how to expand — not gut — programs like SNAP-Ed, WIC, and SNAP. Instead, they’re on the chopping block.

State Rep. Jaime Foster
The latest federal budget bill cuts more than $4.6 million from Connecticut’s SNAP-Ed program alone. Nationwide, that means tens of thousands of families will lose access to community nutrition classes, culturally relevant grocery store tours, and evidence-based support for feeding kids on a tight budget.
Let’s be clear: SNAP-Ed is not fluff. It’s one of the most rigorously evaluated nutrition education programs in the country. Research consistently shows that SNAP-Ed improves diet quality, increases fruit and vegetable intake, and even reduces food insecurity. Every dollar invested in SNAP-Ed saves the healthcare system between $2 and $10 in long-term costs. That’s not a soundbite — that’s peer-reviewed science.
Meanwhile, WIC — another program with decades of data behind it — improves birth outcomes, increases breastfeeding rates, improves infant nutrition outcomes (iron deficiency anemia and obesity rates improve), and ensures children are developmentally on track. Enrollment in the program is also a touch point for families with economically vulnerable kids who qualify for additional wrap-around services. It’s one of the few interventions proven to reduce racial disparities in infant health. Yet WIC’s future funding is uncertain, too.
And then there’s SNAP itself — the foundation of food access for over 40 million Americans. The new budget imposes stricter work requirements, cuts benefits, and shifts administrative costs to already overburdened states. All while ignoring the real math: SNAP not only reduces hunger — it boosts local economies and improves health outcomes, especially for children and older adults.
When the president or HHS secretary tells us they want to Make America Healthy Again — but defund the very programs that make healthy living possible — I have to ask: Was this ever really about health?
Because if it were, we’d be doubling down on prevention. We’d be expanding access to SNAP-Ed in every grocery store, community center, and school. We’d make it easier — not harder — for low-income families to access nutritious food. We’d treat food as the critical determinant of health that it is. We would expand produce prescription programs, increase funding for diabetes prevention programs, and set added sugar and sodium limits on foods in schools instead of distractions like food dyes.
I am here for the removal of food dyes, and I want schools (and society) to serve less processed foods, but let’s first make sure every American has access to enough nutritious food to lead a healthy, productive life.
The elephant in the room is that slogans don’t save lives, but science-based policy does. If we care about making America healthy, we need to fund what works.

The law has had a wide-ranging impact, from helping differently abled individuals seek employment without discrimination, to ensuring buildings that serve the public are accessible to everyone and maintaining accessibility standards for public spaces, schools and transportation systems.  


As the head of a school bus company that specializes in transporting students with special needs in Connecticut and Northern Illinois, I am tremendously proud of our contribution to advancing ADA efforts. Yet even as we celebrate the transformative nature of the ADA this Disability Pride Month, we must be mindful of the evolving challenges we face and remain dedicated to finding creative solutions for the issues confronting the differently abled community.  
For instance, as is the case with many essential, frontline jobs across the country, there continues to be a concerning shortage of school bus drivers nationwide, including in Connecticut. While these types of logistical challenges are never easy to solve, they can disproportionately impact students in the disability community for a variety of reasons.  
The first is simply that providing transportation for students with special needs is more logistically challenging, specialized work, making those jobs even more difficult to fill. On a basic level, picking up groups of students at multiple bus stops is far simpler than the type of personalized, door-to-door “individualized” pickups we provide every day to thousands of students with special needs.  
Additionally, bus drivers who work with special needs students – and the aides who assist them -–require not only more training than typical school bus drivers, but a particular temperament and heightened level of emotional intelligence. While patience is certainly a quality that any school bus driver must possess, we always look to recruit drivers who are especially empathetic, compassionate, and able to exhibit calm in stressful situations to reduce anxiety for our passengers and their caregivers.   
Safety consciousness, consistency, reliability, and trustworthiness are also key attributes that any driver transporting students with special needs must have. While every school bus driver bears a tremendous amount of responsibility for the safety and well-being of the students they transport, special needs students often require – and thrive on – routine, consistency, and structure.  
Many of our drivers will transport the same students for years as they progress through school. The relationships and bonds drivers form with students and their families – and the level of experience, familiarity, comfort, and trust that they establish – are critical to the services we provide. However, finding folks with these specific skillsets adds additional layers to our recruiting, screening, and hiring process, making these jobs tougher to fill when there are already widespread driver shortages.  
Beyond simply finding the right people for this specialized work, the fact is that we simply need more bus drivers and aides than ever before. The number of students with disabilities in public schools has increased steadily since the ADA was signed into law. In 1990, roughly 4.7 million students with disabilities were enrolled in grades K through 12 in the U.S. In 2022, that number increased to 7.3 million. In Connecticut alone, it has been reported that 18% of all students have special education needs, a number that has been increasing steadily by 2.5% each year even as total enrollment has decreased.  
Despite these obstacles, we continue to pursue new avenues to find and recruit the drivers we need and our passengers deserve. To tap into new pools of talent, we are partnering with churches and community organizations to find individuals with the qualities we seek who may never have considered a highly rewarding career as a bus driver for students with special needs.  
As we celebrate the anniversary of the ADA this Disability Pride Month, we must continue to focus on ways to advance the goals that this groundbreaking legislation first codified 35 years ago. That means working together with our communities to recruit new drivers and aides into a career that is both rewarding and plays an essential role in the lives of differently abled young people so we can ensure that all people are afforded the same opportunities, no matter their circumstances.

The House and Senate presiding officers — House Speaker Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham, and Senate President Gary Stevens, R-Kodiak — were both on a morning flight that was delayed due to Juneau fog, pushing back the planned floor sessions for more than an hour. But within minutes, they adjourned both the House and Senate until another session at 10 a.m. Aug 31. That’s also expected to be a brief formality, known as a “technical” session.
“We’re going to stand our ground,” Edgmon said in an interview afterward. “And if he wants to call us back in,” he said referring to the chance of the governor calling another special session, “‘second verse same as the first,’ you know. The results are going to be ‘second verse same as the first,’ too.”
Edgmon and Stevens both confirmed that the governor’s education policy priorities would be considered by a new joint education funding task force, which is scheduled to meet Aug. 25, and in the regular session in January. 
Stevens also pointed to the next session for considering a new Alaska Department of Agriculture, as the Legislature has rejected Dunleavy’s executive order creating one. Dunleavy had asked the Legislature again to act on the order in August.
“If it’s his executive order, we can’t affect that. We can’t amend it. We can’t change it in any way. And so we much prefer to have a bill,” Stevens said in an interview Tuesday. “The advantage of going through the legislative process is that we take the time to study all the issues. We can hear various legislators’ thoughts on it, we can hear from the public, and it just winds up with a better process.”
Sen. Robert Myers, R-North Pole, said by phone on Tuesday that the Republican-led minority caucus supports Dunleavy’s education policy items and would have liked to see them considered. “It was at least an opportunity for us to try to drill down a little further and take some time on different education policies, rather than just talking about the funding that was vetoed and then moving on,” he said. 
Jeff Turner, Dunleavy’s communications director, said by email on Tuesday, “it’s disappointing that the legislature is choosing to kick the can down the road.” 
Asked whether Dunleavy plans to call another special session this fall, Turner replied that if the governor chose to do so, it would be announced in a press release.
Myers said he’s not confident there would be any further work or negotiation if the governor called another special session. “Of course, that’s his prerogative, but the way that the majorities are behaving, I don’t see that anything significant is going to change, which is, again, disappointing. You know, we should be focusing on our outcomes for our students, not on playing these kinds of political games.”
Five legislators attended the technical sessions, including Rep. Chuck Kopp, R-Anchorage, Rep. Cathy Tilton, R-Wasilla, and Edgmon in the House and Sen. Bert Stedman, R-Sitka, and Stevens in the Senate.

Noem announced the administration would paint barriers between the U.S. and Mexico black in order to prevent rust and make them hotter to prevent climbing. (Danielle Prokop / Source NM)SANTA TERESA, N.M. — U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced Tuesday that President Donald Trump wants some 600-plus miles of the border barrier with Mexico painted black.
The reasons, Noem said, are twofold. First, it will prevent rust. Second, she said, it will burn the skin of anyone trying to climb over.
“That is specifically at the request of the president, who understands that in the hot temperatures down here, when something is painted black, it gets even warmer, and it will make it even harder for people to climb,” Noem said during an afternoon news conference in which temperatures rose to 92 degrees.
Noem did not answer questions from reporters about the cost or time frame for painting the wall, other than to say not all the work has been contracted yet. She delivered Tuesday’s announcement from behind a podium posed in front of a solitary painted section of the steel barrier. She was flanked by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents on a strip of land sandwiched between rows of empty cattle corrals — a result of the parasitic fly closing cattle trade.

The announcement prompted a rebuke from Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s office.
“Painting a border wall black to injure people who are seeking a better life is, sadly, emblematic of the Trump administration’s cruel approach to immigration enforcement. A more sensible, humane, and economically advantageous solution is to pass comprehensive immigration reform that would benefit both sides of the border,” Communications Director Michael Coleman said in a statement provided to Source NM.
Coleman noted that the governor “for years has requested additional federal assistance to combat drug trafficking and other nefarious criminal activity in the border region, but she strongly opposes the Trump administration’s mass deportation efforts that would break up families and harm New Mexico’s economy and communities.”
Earlier Tuesday, Noem toured with state and local officials areas of Ruidoso damaged by repeated monsoon floods, which Coleman praised, saying Lujan Grisham “appreciates Sec. Noem’s visit to Ruidoso, which allowed her to see firsthand the devastation wrought by recent flooding. Federal assistance after disasters like this is crucial to helping communities rebuild.” Noem announced $11.4 million in disaster funds for Ruidoso Tuesday evening. That’s on top of U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency allocation of $2.7 million for damages related to flooding in New Mexico.
Noem then traveled from Ruidoso to New Mexico’s border, where she delivered her announcement about painting the border barrier along its deadliest stretch. The area saw 176 deaths last year, according to border control, mostly due to heat, but the figure also includes falls from climbing over the barriers.
Deaths in the New Mexico desert surge after Texas’ border crackdown reaches El Paso

Border crossings and deaths are down in the area, Walter Slosar, the interim chief for the El Paso Sector of border patrol, said during the news conference. Slosar attributed the decline to the Trump administration’s hard line. Apprehensions are down to 39 people per day across 268 miles of international border in the sector, down from more than 2,400 people in 2023.
“Words and messages matter,” Slosar said. “It is not OK to enter the country illegally, and somebody’s finally saying it, our leadership here in the U.S. government.”
Noem had little to say about the recent expansion of efforts to detain immigrants in military bases, including plans to hold 1,000 people at Fort Bliss, in El Paso abutting the New Mexico state line.
“My goal is not to build hundreds of thousands of beds, my goal is to get people out of this country that are here illegally,” she said. “That’s where our focus is, and so we’ll build as many detention beds as we need to get the job done.”
When asked by Source NM if the Trump administration has any specific plans for detention in New Mexico, Noem was noncommittal.
“There could be, I know New Mexico is having debates going on with their detention centers. We’re planning on keeping our presence there and expanding if possible,” she said.
The governor’s chief counsel recently told state lawmakers Lujan Grisham may consider legislation to ban the presence of federal immigration detention centers in the state in an upcoming, though as yet unscheduled, special session.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Republican Adam Steen, former director of the Iowa Department of Administrative Services, announced his campaign for governor Tuesday, labeling himself as a “faith guy” in the race to succeed Gov. Kim Reynolds.
Steen held a campaign kickoff event Tuesday at Berean Church in Pleasant Hill, starting with a musical performance from Nathan Thomas and the A17 worship band and an introduction from Pastor Gary Pilcher. As he introduced himself, Steen said there had been some speculation online about what type of candidate he would be.
“Let me tell you, from my own lips, who I am: I am the faith guy,” Steen said. “I’m a Jesus guy. I’m a Make America Great Again guy. I’m a common-sense policy, America first, people first guy.”
In addition to being a credentialed minister, Steen said some of his highest profile commitments to faith were as DAS director. The department had canceled a Satanic Temple of Iowa holiday celebration event at the Iowa Capitol in December 2024, with Steen saying the event was denied because it included “elements that are harmful to minors.”
Steen said at the campaign event he was “the guy that stood in front of the Satanists when they blatantly targeted our children, and I’m the guy getting sued by the Satanists for protecting our children.”
He also said there was another event request at the Capitol he denied, for an all-ages, family-friendly drag show. He said this planned event was not as well known, but that he believed it was the right thing to do despite being at risk of getting sued.
Steen, appointed in 2021 to serve as DAS director in Reynolds’ administration, said he led some of the major policies changing state government, like the government agency restructuring signed into law in 2023. Speaking with reporters, Steen said he had discussed running for the seat with Reynolds and came to a “mutual agreement” that he would resign from his position if he ran for the office.
“Today, at 10 a.m., I walked into the governor’s office and I submitted my resignation,” Steen told the crowd. “Today I walked away from a job that I loved. I walked away from a job that I loved, so I could join the fight and defend the state that I love.”
Before leading DAS, Steen was the director of business development at Syverson Strege, a financial services firm, and had previously owned a management consulting firm called 25 Connections. He also was a minor league baseball relief pitcher in 2002, playing for the Philadelphia Phillies and Batavia Muckdogs.
Steen highlighted his commitment to protecting private property rights, but did not go into detail on his views about the use of eminent domain for carbon capture pipeline projects — the subject of a contentious bill that was vetoed by Reynolds this session.
“I was working with her at this time, and I support everything that Governor Reynolds is doing,” Steen said. When asked about his views on the use of eminent domain in these projects, he said “I’m a pro-property rights, pro-private ownership person.”
Steen is the latest Republican to join the field of GOP candidates seeking to take the mantle from Reynolds after she announced she would not run for reelection in 2026. U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra and state Sen. Mike Bousselot, R-Ankeny, currently have “exploratory” committees for governor, while Rep. Eddie Andrews, R-Johnston, and former state legislator Brad Sherman have announced campaigns.

We are the circle. That’s what life is all about. We take care of one another. So when we have someone in trouble, that’s when the rest of us have to step in.


– Elmer Crow, Nez Perce tribal elder


The Nez Perce Tribe first presented its extinction findings for Snake River salmon and steelhead in 2021 at a Northwest Power and Conservation Council meeting. The opening slide featured this call by Nez Perce elder Elmer Crow for human solidarity with the salmon, fellow makers of the circle, who are in trouble and need our care.
Mr. Crow died in 2013 while rescuing a grandson in the Snake River at Buffalo Eddy. One obituary reported that in the 1970s, while between jobs, he, his wife Lynda and their first two boys, “lived off the land for four months throughout Nez Perce Country, from the Blue Mountains to the South Fork of the Salmon River.” The western parts of the Crow family’s traverse, from the Blue Mountains to the Snake River, are locales in this four-part story.

Since 2021, he has also conducted an experiment – at once professional, personal, and public. It is as scientifically probing and plainly said or shown as he can get.

Jay’s work is featured in this story. And, with Elmer Crow, one of its inspirations: those who are stepping in.
 
Maps are salmon storytellers
 
The best way to observe Snake River salmon and steelhead extinction, to observe its dire motion, is by map. Salmon extinction is a geographic event, place by place in time. As will be salmon recovery, should it occur.
  This map shows the entire natal, reproductive habitat of Snake River spring and summer Chinook salmon, across the Salmon, Clearwater, Grande Ronde, Imnaha and Tucannon River watersheds. The largest part is now in central Idaho, with most of northeast Oregon and a piece of southeast Washington included.
Anyone who has driven from anywhere to La Grande, Lewiston, Stanley or Salmon has been on this map. Many are on it often, by visit or residence. Distinct local populations of salmon and steelhead have ocean-provisioned its places and creatures for many thousands of years. When you cross through, or stop to linger, you intersect with one or more of these populations, bred by and to the same waters and lands that now draw you.  And, you intersect with one or more active trajectories of population extirpation. The endpoint of population extirpations is species extinction.
My presumptuous wish is that each time you drive, walk, bike, or float on this map’s terrain, you think of the local salmon there with you, whose thousands of years’ provisioning to the land, water and life around you is being dismantled in a relative instant.
The map’s colors are the species’ seven major population groups, which track with watersheds. The names are the 43 geographic populations into which the species has been scientifically sorted by differences in behavior, life history and genetics. Endangered Species Act-listed, and non-listed Clearwater River populations, are both included; I focus here on those listed. These populations – at once local and connected, homebodies and explorers, mountaineers and mariners – are the species: Snake River spring and summer Chinook salmon, the highest-spawning salmon on earth.
Snake River steelhead trout are a different fish than salmon, with different relations to their habitats, so the population boundaries differ some. But on this same base map, there are 26 local populations of Snake River steelhead – the highest-spawning steelhead on earth.
With an active map, you could zoom in on headwater laboratories where differences within and between each population come into being. In a wider view, you could watch lights flicker and go out as populations disappear.
Over 30 populations of Snake River Chinook are already extirpated (locally extinct), by the actions of non-Indigenous homo sapiens. Extirpations have continued since Endangered Species Act listings 33 years ago, and more populations are on the way now.

	I think of Stanley, Idaho – home to a self-chosen few people, hub of a geography loved and hard-used by thousands of Idahoans. Stanley’s local Chinook salmon is the Valley Creek population. How near are Valley Creek’s unique salmon to extirpation?
How near are lower Middle Fork Salmon Chinook, and the seven other populations in the wild Middle Fork Salmon River? How near are B run steelhead, a creature found on earth only in the Clearwater River and lower parts of the Salmon River?
Each population in its geography tells stories, which by the nature of salmon weave fish, rivers, places, peoples, and time. In three parts and a coda, I will follow a salmon thread out from some rate-of-extinction science by the Nez Perce Tribe and Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife.
Geographically, I will begin in southeast Washington, then move to northeast Oregon watersheds that descend a wizardry of mountains, valleys and basalt canyons to the Snake River. I will do no justice at all to these waters and lands, or their histories of people and fish.
I will report and reflect on a few conversations, out of many that could be had, with a few local people about their past and present bonds with these fish, and what salmon extinction would mean.

Roots in the Grande Ronde: Two stories
 
“I am descended on my father’s side from Walla Walla and Yakama people, here since time immemorial,” Bobby Fossek tells me.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXMost of their winter villages were on the mid-Columbia and lower Snake Rivers, from which they came up and over each year into the Grande Ronde and Wallowa valleys.





“The Grande Ronde was our Garden of Eden. And not just ours; there was enough to share.”
The Walla Walla, Nez Perce, Cayuse and Umatilla tribes long preceded the existence of Oregon in the Grande Ronde and Imnaha country. In the Cayuse/Nez Perce language, the Grande Ronde was Qapqa’pnim We’ele, “Cottonwood Stream.” Tribal bands moved in seasonal patterns of hunting, fishing, and gathering; assembly, trading and cultural practices; and wintering. The many-fingered Grande Ronde Valley was one of earth’s most bountiful salmon nurseries.
Then came conquest, death and dispossession by soldiers, settlers and state. Despite strong arguments by Cayuse and Nez Perce people, no reservation was established in the Grande Ronde or its tributaries, and salmon nurseries became irrigated croplands. (In 1873, President Ulysses S. Grant issued an executive order setting aside a portion of the Wallowa Valley as a reservation for the Nez Perce. Two years later, he rescinded it.  The forced removal of Nez Perce people from Wallowa country that followed led into the Nez Perce War of 1877, an event that still resounds.)
From the Umatilla Reservation, Fossek’s family kept their Grande Ronde connection alive on fishing trips into the early 1960s. Those ended after The Dalles Dam, John Day Dam and the lower Snake dams were built. Too few salmon remained for the work, time and expense.

	“Our family stopped coming back when the fish stopped coming back,” he said. “The waterways had been engineered, and we had less and less access.”
Mr. Fossek and his own family now live in Cove, on Catherine Creek in the upper Grande Ronde. They are among the tribal people re-establishing in the Grande Ronde.
“We do a lot of driving to the Umatilla Reservation and back,” he says wryly.
Fossek is a conscious restorer and adapter of native rivers, fish, culture, ways and skills at work in a landscape from which his family and many others were removed, and which the United States’ settlement has profoundly altered. Among his projects, he manages an 80-acre restoration on tributaries of Catherine Creek, on land owned by the Episcopal Diocese of Eastern Oregon.

	Joe McCormack lives 12 miles outside the small town of Joseph. He is descended from the Joseph band of the Nez Perce, with homelands mainly in the Wallowa, Joseph Creek and Imnaha country.
When his mother needed to move in 1979, and decided on Joseph, he returned to help her, and stayed. He worked as a fish technician for the Nez Perce Tribe, has a small cattle ranch in the Imnaha, and is a long-time leader to restore lands, waters, fish and tribal use in northeast Oregon while building native and non-native community.
Mr. McCormack capsuled some recent history in the Wallowa Valley.
“Taz Conner was Nez Perce and a navy veteran,” McCormack began. “He worked for the Forest Service here, back when logging and milling collapsed. Wallowa County was a natural resource community. Four or five mills were lost, leaving towns in shambles. It really hurt.
“The county and the Nez Perce Tribe created a salmon habitat recovery plan then, to address the Endangered Species Act listings. It was the first of its kind, by a tribe and a county, in the nation. Taz and some community members in the town of Wallowa started a Friendship Feast, which was first held in the high school, and now is on our own grounds.”
Mr. Conner helped create the Wallowa/Nez Perce Tribe Interpretive Center – now the Nez Perce Wallowa Homeland – to build Nez Perce presence and seek reconciliation with non-tribal people.
“When Taz got sick, I took over for him, and over 20 years a group of us guided the Homeland into the community and region,” McCormack said.  
The Homeland now owns 320 acres in Wallowa, with a mile and a half of Wallowa River frontage plus newly restored side-channels.
“We call it our home. It’s a center for the Chief Joseph Band descendants, whatever reservations they were scattered to,” McCormack said. “We hold a pow-wow, the Tamkaliks Celebration and Friendship Feast, on the third weekend of July. We focus on protecting and securing tribal resources, like salmon. We teach the youth what the elders would have taught them, the skills and resources, in the old days during the winters. Winter was the communal time, in the deep canyons along the rivers. That’s gone now.”
When Fossek and McCormack talk about their peoples’ past, it is present.



The Grande Ronde Valley was our Eden. Everything was there for the people. The Grande Ronde had everything. The camas root was in abundance. When the seasons came there, the people from here went over to the Grande Ronde Valley and dug the camas. Catherine Creek was a main source of salmon and steelhead. There were fishing sites all along Catherine Creek. The Grande Ronde River was one of the main sources from Hilgard to Perry. On down where Elgin is was a main crossroads for the people to travel from Walla Walla over into Wallowa country.

The extinction emergency in Washington’s Tucannon River
 
Now to some extinction science, and the Tucannon River. Jay Hesse recalls conversations within Nez Perce Fisheries in 2020: “We knew that NOAA Fisheries [the federal agency with main jurisdiction over salmon] uses a metric in its planning called ‘quasi-extinction threshold.’ But management is our focus, actions to help fish that are not doing well. And we had grown very concerned about the Tucannon population.”
The 60-mile long Tucannon River slides from the south into the reservoir behind Lower Monumental Dam on the lower Snake River. (The Palouse River enters from the north some six miles further downstream. This three-river area will be active tribally, ecologically and popularly if the lower Snake River is restored to free flow.) 

  The Lower Monumental Dam is on the Snake River in Washington state. (Getty Images)


	Tucannon Chinook are Washington’s only remaining Snake River Chinook salmon population. An Asotin Creek population is already extirpated.
They face six dams and reservoirs when they go to sea, and six when they return. All other Snake River salmon and steelhead, in Oregon and Idaho, face eight dams and 320 miles of continuous reservoir when they go out to and come back from the Pacific Ocean. (The journey outbound kills far more of both fish than the return trip, but that is not well understood, perhaps because the out-bound young are largely invisible, and the big inbound adults unforgettably the opposite.)
In 2019 just eight wild-origin Chinook spawned in the Tucannon; in 2020, seventeen; and, from 2017 forward, fewer than 50 each year.
Thus the Tucannon population has dropped below what NOAA Fisheries calls a “quasi-extinction threshold” for Snake River Chinook: fewer than 50 adult fish in a population returning from the ocean for four consecutive years.
Below that floor, the population’s continued existence can no longer be scientifically assumed or predicted. It is a critical condition signal, flashing red and near black, a population emergency. I will return to this threshold in Part Two.
On the Tucannon River, the Nez Perce Tribe, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation and the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife are responding with a translocation project.
Starting this year and likely for years to come, marked Tucannon-origin, hatchery-born young salmon are being trucked downstream, past all the big dams, to Kalama Falls Hatchery, south of Longview, Washington, for next-spring release toward the Pacific Ocean from there.
Any Tucannon-origin adults that then return to Kalama in after years will be captured, to maintain and build this rescue effort and, it is hoped, eventually return Chinook salmon to the Tucannon River. Any few salmon that might return to the Tucannon itself will also be collected into the project.

  The W.T. Wooten Wildlife Area, pictured, spans approximately 17,000 acres. About 17 miles of Washington’s Tucannon River are located within the area’s boundaries, and elevations range from 4,100 feet on Hopkins Ridge down to 1,800 feet on the lowest section of the Tucannon River, according to the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife’s website. (Photo by Alan L. Bauer/Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife)

“The plan is to create an interim living gene bank that is not associated with natural habitat,” Hesse says. “We are taking every Tucannon Chinook out of the river, their natural environment. A fish is at great risk when it can’t use its river. And this kind of action also badly strains tribal cultural and harvest connections to the river. But with so few fish, every action we could take now, including doing nothing, has large risks.”
“Until the transforming action all Snake River salmon need” – he means restoring the lower Snake River’s 140 miles of reservoir to free flowing river again, by removing the earthen sections of four dams – “our collaborative analysis tells us this translocation, with a few other interim actions, will get us more Tucannon adults back” than the sporadic dribble of natural production left. “Our purpose is to keep the behaviors, patterns, and genetics of Tucannon spring Chinook in existence until more permanent remedies are enacted, which must occur soon.”
Hesse calls the approach a “safety net offsite strategy,” whose high-risk choices tribal and state fish agencies now face as Snake River populations drop toward and to double digits.
Some possible actions, tailored to the situation, include translocation, cryo-preservation, captive-rearing assist in part of the life-cycle, perhaps coupled with targeted predator control and replacement of marine-derived nutrients that salmon once provided at no cost every year. The approach is expressly experimental, population-specific, and interim.
Dave Johnson, who just retired as head of Nez Perce Fisheries, puts the situation plainly: “Tucannon spring Chinook are the canary in the coal mine [for Snake River Chinook], and the canary is dying.”
The three collaborators will try to hold on to Washington’s last Snake River salmon population, knowing the risk is high they will fail. Whatever the outcome, the more Washington people keep watch on this last-gasp, high-risk effort – so that its governor, senators, and Congresspeople are led to keep watch too – the better.
The emergency Tucannon effort also presages the near future for salmon and salmon people in northeast Oregon and central Idaho.
Thirty years ago, the fine Northwest-based writer Tim Egan memorably described his home region: “The Pacific Northwest is simply this: wherever the salmon can get to.”
Mr. Egan is not being literal, but he is being truthful to history, experience, and feeling. By his measure, a large chunk of southeast Washington, the Tucannon River watershed, is, for now, no longer in the Northwest.
Let us pray it is temporary, but let’s not look away.

A recent National Association of Realtors report found affordability increased slightly from last year, but the typical family is still priced out in the West and Northeast.(Photo by Andrew Kitchenman/Alaska Beacon)Housing became more affordable this June, as higher incomes and slightly lower interest rates overcame higher prices, according to a National Association of Realtors report.
However, the South and the Midwest are the only regions where a family with typical or median income can afford a median-priced house, according to the report. The group considers a mortgage to be affordable if the monthly payment (principal and interest) is 25% or less of the family’s income.



The affordability gap is highest in the West, where the typical family income is $113,783, just over two-thirds of the $164,832 that would be needed to purchase a median-priced home.
The Northeast, where the typical family makes $114,559, is also unaffordable by this measure, as a median-priced home requires an income of $141,264.
In the Midwest, the median family income is $102,419, more than the $86,256 needed to buy a median-priced home. The same is true in the South, where the median income is $97,812, slightly more than the $96,720 required to buy a typical home.
Nationally, affordability increased slightly compared with June of 2024, with the typical family making $105,431, about 94% of the $111,648 it would need to buy the median-priced home. That’s up from about 92% in June 2024.
In a video posted Aug. 15, Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors, said he expects lower interest rates to increase affordability in the months ahead.
“We know that mortgage rates will be coming down and that will bring additional buyers into the market. We just need to make sure we have more supply, more supply to meet that demand,” Yun said.

Then they heard about Newsom’s redistricting,Alexei Koseff,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/08/newsom-redistricting-conservative-opponents/,"Conservative opponents dominated the public comment at legislative hearings on Gov. Gavin Newsom’s congressional redistricting plan, though most were at the Capitol for an unrelated rally.","In summary
Conservative opponents dominated the public comment at legislative hearings on Gov. Gavin Newsom’s congressional redistricting plan, though most were at the Capitol for an unrelated rally.


For some of the Republican voters who oppose the partisan redistricting plan moving swiftly through the California Capitol this week, it felt like a divine appointment.
They arrived in Sacramento on Tuesday — thousands of them, by the busload, from Visalia and Riverside and beyond — for an entirely different mission. Pastor Jack Hibbs, the extremely online leader of the Calvary Chapel Chino Hills megachurch, had called his followers to the Capitol to rally against a bill that would expand who can serve as a child’s caregiver when their parents are detained by immigration authorities.
It just so happened, however, that the Legislature also scheduled two hearings that morning to advance Gov. Gavin Newsom’s controversial proposal asking voters to set aside the state’s independent redistricting commission and approve new congressional lines more favorable to Democrats. And as word spread among the flock, dozens of them crowded the halls outside the committee rooms, frustrated and weary conservatives lining up for their precious seconds to publicly denounce another indignity thrust upon them by California’s liberal leaders.
“They’ve been getting away with things for too long,” said Judy Escobedo, a 64-year-old retired teacher from Visalia, as she exited the Assembly hearing where she told legislators that their “childish” effort to override the redistricting commission made her want to move back to Texas. “We voted for that because we want to choose our politicians. We don’t want our politicians to choose their voters.”
Testifying against the redistricting plan was “topping on the cake” for Escobedo, who came for the Hibbs rally with her sisters. “Somebody has to do something,” she said, “and I figured it should be me.”
Despite heated opposition and even legal threats from California Republicans, who could lose more than half their remaining seats in Congress, the Democratic supermajority in the Legislature is poised to approve the plan by the end of this week. Newsom would then call a special election for Nov. 4, when voters would have the final say on the new map. 
A handful of supporters, most of them affiliated with organized labor, showed up at the hearings to speak in favor of what they argue is a necessary step to prevent President Donald Trump from rigging the outcome of the 2026 midterms. Trump is pressuring Republican-led states across the country to undertake an unusual mid-decade redistricting to shore up the narrow GOP majority in the U.S. House of Representatives.

“We are in a moment where we have to respond to an existential threat,” state Sen. Sabrina Certantes, a Riverside Democrat, said during the Senate hearing. “Do you expect Californians to unilaterally disarm ourselves when the Trump Republicans are wielding their control of state governments like weapons against democracy?”
But they were far outnumbered by the serendipitous throng of opponents, many of whom walked right off their chartered buses and into the line for public testimony.
Republicans feel ‘unrepresented’
Some were resigned that they would not halt what has appeared to be an increasing inevitability in recent weeks. Newsom has rallied public support through appearances with Democratic legislators who fled Texas to block a similar gerrymandering effort there.
“I’m not changing these people’s minds,” said David Bolog, a 55-year-old maintenance worker with the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. Since the coronavirus pandemic, he has been traveling to the Capitol weekly as a “citizen lobbyist” for right-leaning groups like Moms For Liberty.
“We already feel very unrepresented,” Bolog said. He was among a sparse crowd outside the Senate hearing earlier in the morning. “Even though you know it’s not going to stop it, you still have to say no.”
Behind him, Maria Carrillo entertained her children, ages 7 and 5. They left Riverside at 1 a.m. to make the drive to Sacramento for the Hibbs rally. Carrillo, a 36-year-old homeschool teacher, planned to turn their visit to the Capitol into a field trip for her children as well.
Like many Californians, Carrillo, who wore a shirt calling to keep men out of girls’ sports, said she had become politically active during the pandemic fights over shutdowns and mandatory vaccines. She wanted Democratic leaders to hear from some of the millions of Trump voters, like her, who supported the president’s agenda and would be disenfranchised by the new congressional lines.
“What I hope is they do listen to the real people who live in these communities and are affected by these policies,” she said.
Rep. Kevin Kiley voters show up
A contingent from the El Dorado County GOP huddled in a corner, monitoring the hearing but hesitant to testify against a plan they felt certain would be ramrodded through.
“We all know this is a farce anyway,” said Todd White of El Dorado Hills, the club’s chair.
“A redistricting war doesn’t benefit anybody,” said Doug Williams of South Lake Tahoe, the club’s vice chair. He said California was chasing Texas “”to the bottom of the barrel.”
The Democrats’ map moves El Dorado County from a sprawling rural district along the eastern border of California — represented by Rep. Kevin Kiley, a Rocklin Republican — to a new seat that stretches out from the more liberal Sacramento suburbs. Williams feared that the issues facing his mountainous community, such as wildfire preparedness and the declining availability of home insurance, would be overlooked. 
“This is only designed to benefit one person and that’s Gavin Newsom,” White said, alluding to expectations that Newsom will soon launch a campaign for president. White complained that the governor was using taxpayer money to run a special election and “he’s made it all about himself.”
“Why isn’t he doing his job?” club treasurer Heather Masten said. After some deliberation, she stepped into the hearing to deliver a brief comment in opposition.
Then the group wandered over to the Assembly hearing to do it all over again.
“We’ll be here all day,” White said, “just getting oppressed by the majority party.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/081925_Redistricting-Hearing_FG_CM_06.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-19 21:56:20.479207

(Photo by Peter Hall/Capital-Star)The Trump administration has cleared the way for states to resume building electric vehicle charging stations after freezing a $5 billion EV infrastructure initiative earlier this year. 
Pennsylvania is among the leading states in the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program, with nearly $77 million in federal funding committed to 90 public-private partnerships to build charging stations along designated routes across the commonwealth. 
With the program’s initial objective achieved, the state is poised to take the next steps with broader deployment of the funds. But, it has been unable to do so since the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) halted the program, a state Department of Transportation spokesperson said.
“Without federal guidelines, we were unable to move forward as quickly as we could have,” PennDOT spokesperson Zachary Appleby said. “The Shapiro administration has consistently pushed for guidelines and a clear path to accessing funds made available to our state by Congress.”
There are now about 20 charging stations built with NEVI funds in operation across Pennsylvania. Over the course of the five-year program, the commonwealth is set to receive more than $171 million.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Citing concerns about its efficiency, the FHWA rescinded the program’s guidelines for a review in February, shortly after President Donald Trump took office. At the time, 84% of the program’s funds were unobligated, which the agency said was “a clear signal of the program’s failure.”
Pennsylvania had expended only $3.1 million of the funds it had received when the program was halted, according the U.S. Department of Transportation.
After a federal judge in Washington ordered the administration to resume the program, the FHWA issued new guidelines Aug. 11 and gave states until Sept. 10 to resubmit plans for the next round of funding. Gov. Josh Shapiro was among 16 governors and attorneys general who sued the Trump administration to release the funding.
Expressing reluctance to proceed with the program, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the new guidance cuts out “red tape” left by the previous administration and gives states more flexibility in how to use the money.

“If Congress is requiring the federal government to support charging stations, let’s cut the waste and do it right,” Duffy said in a statement. “While I don’t agree with subsidizing green energy, we will respect Congress’ will and make sure this program uses federal resources efficiently.”
The FHWA said its review of the program found the Biden administration wasted time, money and public trust in implementing the program. Under Duffy’s leadership, it said the agency has streamlined the NEVI guidance to align with the Trump administration’s priorities of safety, efficiency and innovation. 
Congress funded the NEVI program in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021. In addition to $5 billion for EV charging infrastructure, it also provides $2.5 billion for other alternative fuels including hydrogen, propane, and natural gas.
Initially, projects funded with the money were to be focused on Alternative Fuel Corridors along designated routes across the country. In Pennsylvania, the corridors follow the commonwealth’s interstate highway network. 
According to PennDOT, the NEVI funded charging stations have provided about 28,000 EV charging sessions and eliminated an estimated 1.56 million pounds of carbon dioxide emissions, which are a contributing factor in climate change.
In addition to the program, the state Department of Environmental Protection paid to build EV chargers as part of the Driving PA Forward program, using some of the $118 million the commonwealth received in a settlement with Volkswagen over its diesel emissions cheating scandal. Those include new chargers at the North Somerset and South Somerset service plazas on the Pennsylvania Turnpike.
PennDOT spokesman Zachary Appleby said Pennsylvania achieved full build-out of its Alternative Fuel Corridors in January and can now use remaining funds to build EV chargers along other state roads. 
“We plan to stay the course with a competitive program that maximizes available NEVI funds to provide a robust EV charging program in Pennsylvania,” Appleby said.
The new  guidelines were issued in accordance with Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order titled “Unleashing American Energy,” which, among other objectives, sought to “eliminate the ‘electric vehicle (EV) mandate’ and promote true consumer choice.”
According to the FHWA, the revised guidelines minimize requirements for state NEVI plans that are not included in statutes or regulations and simplifies the state approval process.

They reduce the requirements to engage with and consulate communities where the projects would be built. The revisions eliminate language specifying engagement with rural, underserved and disadvantaged communities, to ensure diverse views are considered and that EV infrastructure provides equitable access.
The guidelines also eliminate requirements to explain how the state plans will provide opportunities for small businesses, including minority- and women-owned businesses and target at least 40 percent of the program’s benefits toward disadvantaged communities.
They also do away with requirements for states to address consumer protection, emergency evacuation plans, and environmental considerations. 
States would have greater flexibility, however, to determine how far apart chargers should be along alternative fuel corridors, when the corridor requirements are satisfied and to select projects where the charging stations are owned by businesses that host them.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_5282-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-19 20:57:22.941952

The state and Denver both received the letter, the officials confirmed. In the letter sent to Denver Mayor Mike Johnston, which Newsline obtained, Bondi said “your jurisdiction has been identified as one that engages in sanctuary policies and practices that thwart federal immigration enforcement to the detriment of the interests of the United States. This ends now.” 
Bondi sent the letter on Aug. 13, and requested answers from the recipients by Tuesday. She demanded the recipients confirm their “commitment to complying with federal law” and identify “the immediate initiatives” they are taking to “eliminate laws, policies and practices that impede federal immigration enforcement.”

Gov. Jared Polis and Acting Denver City Attorney Katie McLoughlin responded on Tuesday, but neither agreed to change any laws or policies, based on letters obtained by Newsline. Both Denver and Colorado have laws that limit certain types of cooperation between local or state officials and federal immigration authorities for non-criminal matters.
“Colorado has and will continue to comply with federal law,” Polis said in his response letter. “Colorado, like many states, will not allow the federal government to commandeer our public safety resources, and our right to do so is protected by the Tenth Amendment of the Constitution. We do not find any conflict between state and federal law in this matter …”
Polis said that “Colorado is not a sanctuary state,” and added that the state “fully cooperates with federal authorities in identifying, apprehending, and prosecuting criminals — regardless of immigration status.”










Denver is not going to be bullied ... Not by the Trump administration, not by anyone.


– Jordan Fuja, spokesperson with the Denver mayor’s office


The Trump administration, which has pursued mass deportations, has faced setbacks in its attempts to force more local cooperation with immigration arrests, including a court reversal on July 25, when a federal judge dismissed a sanctuary policies case against Illinois, Chicago and Cook County. 
The state and local policies reflect a “decision to not participate in enforcing civil immigration law — a decision protected by the Tenth Amendment,” Judge Lindsay Jenkins wrote in an order now under appeal.
The Justice Department on Aug. 5 released a list of jurisdictions it deems sanctuaries, including 12 states, the District of Columbia, four counties and 18 cities. Denver and Colorado are on the list, and both jurisdictions face federal lawsuits challenging their immigration-related policies.
“Denver is not going to be bullied,” said Jordan Fuja, a spokesperson with the Denver mayor’s office. “Not by the Trump administration, not by anyone. We have always followed the law and will continue fighting to protect the rights of residents, as well as the federal funding they are entitled to as taxpayers.”

 Crapo says housing was a top concern in Idaho in recent survey

Crapo said Tuesday that his office has been reviewing a housing survey conducted between March 31 and May 31, and noted affordability of housing emerged as a top issue. 
Of the 5,000 Idahoans who responded, many said that local wages did not keep pace with escalating costs of housing, according to a summary of preliminary results from Crapo’s office. Specific numbers were not yet available, Crapo’s staff said. 
The senator said in a later interview with the Idaho Capital Sun that the biggest complaints he is hearing across the state are that there isn’t enough supply and the costs are too high. 
He highlighted the extension and expansion of the federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credit — which provides tax incentives for developers to build affordable housing units — in the major tax and spending bill Congress passed into law in July. The law permanently boosts the number of credits that will be available for qualifying projects through two types of credits provided in the program. 
One credit program allows developers to write-off around 9% of their construction costs each year for 10 years — this number is capped for each state by a number determined by the Internal Revenue Service each year annually. The law increased each state’s allocation by 12%. 
The program also offers a credit worth 4% of the project cost. While there is no cap on how many of these credits may be allocated per state, there was a requirement that half the project be paid for with a certain type of tax-exempt bond, called private activity bonds, which do have a cap. The bill lowered the bond requirement to 25% of the project. 
“Using the tax code to incentivize the formation of capital around housing is another one of the objectives that we have all in an effort to try to reduce the biggest complaint that we’re picking up on our survey,” Crapo said, “which is the cost of housing and the ability to access affordability of housing.”

 HUD secretary hopes to focus on deregulation, and ‘opportunity zones’ 

Turner, a former NFL player and Texas state lawmaker, said one of his priorities would be to reduce regulations as a way to reduce the cost of building housing. He cited his move to revoke the Biden-era Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule that was meant to tackle housing discrimination.
He said Tuesday that the rule “made Washington, (D.C.), really a national zoning board.” 
Asked about safety codes and regulations, Scott said those would remain. 
“When we talk about bringing out regulations, we talk about bringing down duplicative, burdensome things that cost developers and builders an exorbitant amount of money, which really can be a game changer, whether they do the project or not,” Turner said. 
Crapo said he also supported reducing regulations on builders and that he would encourage local jurisdictions to do the same. 
Turner also served in the first Trump administration heading up HUD’s “Opportunity Zone” program, which is an incentive program focused on “economically distressed communities.” Investments in these areas, which are nominated by state officials and certified by the IRS, are provided tax incentives. 
Turner said he visited a food warehouse built in Twin Falls that was the first opportunity zone project in Idaho, according to Idaho News 6. 
Turner said that 700 new housing units have been built inside opportunity zones in Idaho and 4,000 jobs have been created. 
The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which became the major tax and spending law, also made permanent the opportunity zone program.

 Turner has ‘no concern at all’ about effect of proposed time-limits to housing assistance 

During Turner’s nomination hearing he argued that housing assistance, such as public housing or Section 8 vouchers, should have time limits, the Associated Press reported. Turner and the Trump administration have proposed a two-year limit on rental assistance programs for able-bodied adults. 
There are 27,800 Idahoans who used federal rental assistance, according to a January 2025 fact sheet from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Of those who use the assistance, 24% are seniors, 30% are people who have a disability and 49% are people in families with children. 
Research from New York University, as reported by the AP, found that the majority of Section 8 recipients who could lose housing would be those with children. 
Turner told reporters Tuesday “there’s no concern at all” that the proposed time limits will push families out of housing. 
“Government subsidies were never meant to be a hammock,” Turner said. “They’re meant to be a trampoline.”

Rep. Dawson Holle, R-Mandan, chair of the North Dakota Legislature’s Tribal and State Relations Committee, said the committee “is setting the tone that we want to be in conversation with our tribal leaders.”
The Legislature first invited the Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate to be part of the North Dakota Indian Affairs Commission in 2007, said Sen. Tim Mathern, D-Fargo, vice chair of the committee. Tuesday was the first time the legislative committee had met on the Lake Traverse Reservation, Mathern said.
“Your presence here today demonstrates respect for our people,” Sisseton-Wahpeton Chair J. Garret Renville told the committee. 
Tuesday was the first meeting of the committee for the 2025-27 interim. Holle said the group plans to meet at each of the five tribal nations that share geography with North Dakota. The committee will meet next in September on the Fort Berthold Reservation with the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation. 
Gov. Kelly Armstrong and other state officials participated in separate meetings with tribal leaders Tuesday. 
Armstrong met last month with officials from the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa and earlier this year with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe.

The post Wyoming lawmakers advance bill decriminalizing corner crossing appeared first on WyoFile .","On a 7-6 vote, a legislative panel advanced a bill that declares corner crossing is not an act of criminal trespass or violation of game and fish laws.
The Joint Travel, Recreation, Wildlife and Cultural Resources Interim Committee passed the draft “Corner crossing clarification” for further consideration and potential amendments in November.
The close vote reflects uncertainty about whether the U.S. Supreme Court might consider a lower-court ruling that corner crossing is not trespassing and what effect that might have on a new Wyoming law.
Corner crossing is the act of stepping from one piece of public land to another where they meet with two pieces of private property. Corner crossers do not set foot on private land,but they pass through the airspace above it.
Elk Mountain Ranch owner Fred Eshelman sued four Missouri hunters claiming they trespassed while corner crossing to hunt on public land surrounded by his 20,000-acre wildlife-rich ranch in Carbon County. The hunters did not set foot on his property, and the U.S. 10th Circuit Court of appeals sided with them.
“We know that corner crossing right now is legal.” Karlee Provenza
“We know that corner crossing right now is legal,” Rep. Karlee Provenza, D-Laramie, told the committee. “This is putting in statute that that is the case.”
The Supreme Court could receive the case as early as Sept. 17, the attorney representing the hunters told the committee Tuesday in Casper. Ryan Semerad also said it’s possible the file could be distributed to the justices later, on Oct. 1.
The court could decide on Oct. 10 or Oct. 17 whether to hear the appeal, he said. If justices want the U.S. solicitor general to weigh in and outline his views, that would delay action by a couple of months, Semerad said.
If justices ultimately decide they do want to hear the case, it would be scheduled for the first months of 2026, he said. Inviting the solicitor general’s views could push the case into the summer of next year.
Privatization of public land?
The 10th Circuit decision earlier this year clarifies that corner crossing allows legal public access to public land in the checkerboard area of land ownership in southern Wyoming. Some 2.4 million acres in the state are considered “corner locked” if corner crossing is illegal. The decision also applies to Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Kansas.
A Carbon County deputy in 2021 cited the Missouri hunters for criminal trespass, but a jury found them not guilty. Corner-crossing supporters say prosecuting corner crossers allows private landowners like Eshelman to exclusively enjoy the benefits of public land that his ranch surrounds.
The slim majority of the legislative committee agreed to keep the bill on the table.
“The reason that I’m willing to send it on [is] so that we keep it on the radar screen,” Sen Bill Landen, R-Casper, said, “so that the rest of our legislative friends can get a look at this issue and know that it’s not going away.”
The appeals court used this graphic to depict corner crossing. (U.S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals)
Semerad explained the measure as one that would remove law enforcement from relatively insignificant trespass claims that might arise out of corner crossing. Landowners could still sue trespassers — not necessarily corner crossers — in civil court.
“I don’t think there is a person who believes that someone should be taken off the public lands in handcuffs because they stepped on the wrong blade of grass,” he said.
He won agreement from Casper Republican Rep. Elissa Campbell. “I think it will reduce the burden on law enforcement, whether it’s our sheriffs or our wardens, … and adds some clarity,” she said. “Clarity is a good thing and needs to be in place, regardless of how this court case shakes out.”
Rep. Andy Byron, R-Jackson, voted to move the bill forward. “This is something that was brought up to us,” he said of grassroots support. “We voted on it as … a priority. People have spoken.”
Provenza made a larger case.
“There were 500 people that showed up at the capitol to tell our federal delegation that their public lands aren’t for sale,” she said, recalling a rally earlier this year. “They did it because they enjoy them, because they want access, because they want to be able to get to those public lands.”
“So this issue isn’t complicated to me,” she said. “Do we want to protect the Wyoming people from unnecessary prosecution for accessing their land?
“My answer is ‘yes.’”
Some skepticism
Six legislators were skeptical. “I don’t know how this gets resolved without it going to the Supreme Court,” Rep. Bob Wharff, R-Evanston, said.
Others raised worries about whether corners are well monumented by surveys, whether cell phone apps that use GPS data are accurate, and the prospect of people using e-bikes and deer carriers while crossing corners, something the 10th Circuit did not condone.
Semerad offered more information regarding the Supreme Court, his outlook and the court’s history.
“We certainly don’t think the Supreme Court needs to take this case at all,” he said. “We think the 10th Circuit got it right.”
If the court does hear the case, the hunters are ready to defend their position, he said.
This law on which the hunters won — the Unlawful Inclosures Act of 1885 — has only been addressed by the Supreme Court four times, Semerad said: in 1890, 1897, 1922 and 1979.
“It is quite literally a once-in-a-generation type issue,” he said.
“It is quite possible that they take it,”

April McClain Delaney (D-6th), Gov. Wes Moore and Westernport Mayor Judy Hamilton speak to reporters In July. The three were part of a meeting to discuss a decision by FEMA to deny federal aid to help areas of the state recover from devastating floods in May. Moore appealed that denial Tuesday in a letter to President Donald Trump. (File photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters.)The cost of damage to two Western Maryland counties from a flash flood in May has more than doubled, easily justifying the need for federal emergency aid, state officials said Tuesday.
The new estimates were detailed in a letter from Gov. Wes Moore (D) to President Donald Trump (R). The letter sent Tuesday makes good on Moore’s announcement last month to appeal a denial of federal aid by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
“At the time of our original request, local jurisdictions and Maryland state agencies reported an estimated $15.8 million in damages,” Moore wrote in his seven-page letter to Trump.
The governor said in the letter, which was released to media, that state emergency management officials found $17.9 million in additional costs related to the flooding in Allegany and Garrett Counties that are eligible for federal aid, bringing the overall estimate of eligible damages from the May flood to $33.7 million.
“This amount is nearly triple Maryland’s statewide threshold, indicating the need for FEMA Public Assistance,” Moore wrote.
The damage came from “extreme storms” that inundated parts of Allegany and Garrett counties in May.
George’s Creek surged to more than 12 feet above major flood stage. Wills Creek in Cumberland rose 8 feet. The Potomac River also flooded. Areas of both counties were evacuated. Midland, Lonaconing, and Westernport were among the hardest-hit areas.
Lawmakers call denial of disaster assistance for Western Maryland floods a ‘gut punch’

Moore declared a state of emergency in the area. In addition to providing some state aid, an application for federal recovery funds was also submitted.
FEMA denied that request in a brief letter that offered no detailed justification.
Moore’s letter Tuesday makes good on a vow to appeal that denial.
Last month, the governor traveled to Westernport to meet with local officials in a closed-door meeting. Afterward, he noted that an aid request from West Virginia had been approved for a lower amount of damages, and that the denial of federal aid for Maryland “is petty, it is partisan, and it is punishing and is deeply unfair to the people of Allegany and Garrett County.”
“I’ve stopped trying to do the mental gymnastics of trying to understand how this administration is making its decisions, or what to expect when it comes to partnership with them,” Moore told reporters last month.
In his appeal letter Tuesday, Moore made no mention of West Virginia but instead spent seven pages elaborating on damage to public infrastructure, homes and schools left in the wake of the flooding.
While Westernport Elementary School suffered severe first-floor flood damage, Moore said the school will re-open this fall with students attending classes on upper floors as repairs continue.
But the school has no functioning boiler. Moore noted that the mean temperature in the area in September is 66 degrees. Schools typically turn on the heating systems once temperatures fall below 68 degrees. Moore called the lack of a working heating system “a critical issue.”
The flood also damaged the school cafeteria and kitchen. Breakfast and lunch for students will have to be brought in daily from another school.
Moore added that the state and counties are working together to improve data collection using existing weather stations in the area.
“The terrain in the mountains has made forecasting and monitoring in the area difficult, and incorporation of these tools will improve these areas as well as tracking severe weather trends,” Moore wrote. “By identifying and taking corrective actions, post-disaster mitigation can help Allegany and Garrett Counties reduce future financial burden of property and infrastructure damage, recover faster, and take a more proactive stance towards disaster preparedness.”

(Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser filed a brief Tuesday outlining the state’s arguments defending a 2019 Colorado law that bans conversion therapy for minors in a case before the U.S. Supreme Court.
The case concerns a Colorado state law that bans conversion therapy, the practice of trying to change a person’s sexual orientation, such as to eliminate same-sex attraction, or gender identity. Conservative religious law firm Alliance Defending Freedom represents the plaintiff, Kaley Chiles, a Colorado Springs counselor who argues the Colorado law violates a counselor’s right to free speech by prohibiting certain conversations related to gender and sexuality. 
The named defendant in the case is Patty Salazar, executive director of the Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies. The Supreme Court decided to hear the case in March, and will hear arguments in the case during its term that starts in October.

Colorado law protects patients from receiving “substandard care” and that conversion therapy has been regulated in the U.S. for more than a century, Weiser said in a press conference Tuesday. He said the law does not prohibit a provider from “sharing information, content, or viewpoints with a patient,” and therapists are still permitted to tell patients about conversion practices offered by religious entities or others.
“There’s never been a First Amendment objection to protecting patients and prohibiting substandard … care regardless of whether or not the care is carried out through words,” Weiser said. 
About half of U.S. states and Washington, D.C., ban conversion therapy, and the American Medical Association opposes it. The Human Rights Campaign, a national organization that advocates equality for all LGBTQ+ people, says “every mainstream medical and mental health organization” has rejected the practice for decades and that it can lead to depression, anxiety, drug use, homelessness and suicide, particularly for minors. 
The 2019 law prohibits licensed psychiatrists and mental health care providers from “engaging in conversion therapy” with patients under 18 years old. Providers who conduct conversion therapy are subject to disciplinary action from the appropriate licensing board, though Weiser said the state hasn’t taken disciplinary action against any providers since the law went into effect. 
“There have never been any disciplinary actions against the therapist in this case,” Weiser said of Chiles. “None of what the therapist is alleging actually appears to violate Colorado law, because she says that she’s not trying to change a patient’s sexual orientation or gender identity.” 
Chiles’ petition to the Supreme Court says she is a practicing Christian who “believes that people flourish when they live consistently with God’s design, including their biological sex.” It says she views her career “as an outgrowth of her faith” and that many clients come to her because of her Christianity. 
A ruling against the state would open the possibility to challenging other licensing and malpractice processes, Weiser said. The brief the state filed says, “From this country’s infancy, states have exercised their power to regulate professional healthcare treatment to protect patients from substandard care,” and that has always included treatments performed with words like therapy.
“What is at stake is whether or not the Supreme Court opens up a First Amendment exemption to professional licensing and malpractice systems that are designed to prevent patients from suffering substandard care, and that is the core argument we make in our brief,” Weiser said. “The Supreme Court has never created such an exemption before. They shouldn’t do so now.”
According to The Associated Press, the court declined to review a similar challenge in 2023. While the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has upheld the Colorado law, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has struck down local bans on conversion therapy in Florida.

(Micah Drew/ Daily Montanan)Maybe you’ve never heard of it, but this past weekend, some insect-infatuated communities around the county celebrated National Honey Bee Day. Originally established as “Honey Bee Awareness Day” by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in 2009, the holiday recognizes the crucial role that more than 2.99 million bee colonies in the U.S. play in pollinating more than $15 billion worth of crops, in addition to producing honey and beeswax. 
In Montana, this year’s Honey Bee Day is a little extra special following a new law expanding opportunities for everyday Montanans to engage in beekeeping. 
House Bill 624, introduced by Rep. Eric Tilleman, R-Cascade, doubled the number of hives that a hobbyist beekeeper may own to 10, and also increased the number of apiary sites per registration from one to five. 
“This bill, at the core, promotes the fundamental values of Montana, conservation, agriculture and self-sufficiency,” Tilleman said during a House Agriculture Committee hearing on the legislation early this year. “Allowing hobbyist apiaries more beehives per person not only produces clean and cheap, delicious honey for their toast, but also for their wild game dishes. It also augments the pollination of the gardens and their neighbor’s gardens.”
According to the Montana Department of Agriculture, the state typically ranks in the top five in the nation for honey production and has a robust commercial pollinating industry. 
The department maintains a registry of all apiary sites in the state with more than 6,700 apiaries, though there are likely even more hives that aren’t registered, according to the state entomologist. 
Beekeepers in the state fall under one of four classifications— commercial yards; landowners; hobbyists; and pollination yards. 
While a vast majority of beehives in the state are commercial hives, there is a growing number of landowner and hobbyist beekeepers. Landowners can register any number of hives as long as they manage the hives themselves, while hobbyists, who can now own 10 hives, can locate them at different properties. 
“Small-scale beekeepers, I think, are one of the big pieces that’s helpful for the state because they form these great communities,” Amy Savage, the state entomologist, told the Daily Montanan. “Most counties have a hobbyist group or club that meets and shares information about beekeeping and the best way to keep bees happy and healthy. They’re also key to helping share information about diseases and controlling pests, which keeps all beehives in Montana safer.”
In the Missoula area, the Big Sky Beekeepers Club boasts roughly 55 active members representing more than 100 apiaries in the area. 
Club president Mike Guess got his start beekeeping more than a decade ago, with two hives on Finley Point on Flathead Lake. His bees didn’t do well in his first two seasons, and he came to the realization that despite robust cherry orchards around the lake, there just weren’t enough resources to provide for his beekeeping operation.
He ended up donating his hives to the PEAS Farm in Missoula, a community-run farm, that’s the “perfect environment for bees.” He has worked as the volunteer beekeeper of that apiary ever since. 
“The insect is just such an interesting creature, to look at, to recognize it’s worth to the plants it’s foraging among, and just evolutionarily — it’s just an incredible creature,” Guess said. “The hive mechanics — one queen, thousands of workers, most which only live for five to six weeks — but just this interspecies knowledge that gets transferred genetically to the next generation… it’s amazing to observe that up close.”
Guess took a certification course at the University of Montana to become a master beekeeper and has been helping manage the local club’s mentorship program. 
The biggest barrier for new beekeepers is the cost, Guess said. Two hives, which is the recommended number to start with, can run $1,000. 
“This is not an inexpensive hobby. Of course, many hobbies have expenses — golf clubs or skis, or tennis rackets and memberships,” Guess said. “But you have to put serious thought into maintaining beehives.”
Another expense barrier all beekeepers deal with is replacing hives after colony deaths. 
Guess said that a critical step to successful beekeeping is treating hives for mites and working with other local beekeepers to track and ward off diseases that threaten the colonies. 
Since the mid-2000s, there has been a well-documented and well-publicized decline of bee colonies, highlighted by “colony collapse disorder.” Many beekeepers reported large-scale losses, including as many as 90% of hives, which were attributed to myriad sources including mites, pesticides, diseases and changes in habitat.

While the year-to-year loss of bee colonies has varied, the last year was “catastrophic” nationwide, according to Project Apis m., a honey bee health research nonprofit. 
According to an April press release, data showed that more than 1.6 million bee colonies were lost. Commercial beekeepers lost an average of 62% of colonies from summer 2024 to spring 2025.
“In January 2025, beekeepers across the country began reporting unexpected large-scale honey bee losses—we now know the largest ever recorded in the U.S.,” said Danielle Downey, executive director of Project Apis m. 
Beekeepers saw similar losses in Montana during the last year, according to Michelle Flenniken, a virologist at Montana State University who specializes in bees. Project Apis m. data shows large- and medium-sized commercial operations in the state lost roughly 60% of beehives.
Guess said that in the Missoula club, losses were close to 50% — another reason he recommends hobbyist beekeepers have at least two hives. If you lose one, you can split your hive the next year to recover. But losing a single hive each year can quickly boost expenses and increased colony deaths could limit the expansion of hobbyist apiaries. 
“The consensus is that this is another honeybee collapse period,” Guess said. “Lots of people agree that if the western honeybee were to disappear from our environment, it could lead to the collapse of the human food supply.” 
With such high stakes, there’s a concerted effort by scientists in independent labs and within the USDA to understand what’s behind the latest die-offs and what could be done to prevent them. 
Flenniken said that research by the USDA that has been submitted for peer review identified high levels of two viruses responsible for colony losses across the U.S. which are spread through parasitic mites. 
“That doesn’t mean it’s the only factor, but viruses and mites are a huge problem for bee colonies and that’s what we study here in our lab using federal grant money,” Flenniken said.
One recent study Flenniken’s lab published this month looked at viruses that do not always have visible symptoms in adult bees, and therefore are hard to detect, including one which was identified in the USDA research as contributing to the national colony loss. Her lab studied the flight speed and duration of infected bees on a “flight mill” (the equivalent of a treadmill, but for bees) and found that different viruses affect the speed and distance the honey bees flew. 
Studies like those conducted in Flenniken’s lab are key to understanding bee health on a large scale and finding ways to control and prevent the spread of diseases. 
“To understand what’s killing the bee colonies, it takes science, it takes federal scientific funding and experts in the fields who can understand the role of pesticides, mites, and other risks to colonies,” Flenniken said. “That’s your federal taxpayer dollars at work, and it’s important to local communities and to commercial agriculture around the country.”
Flenniken said that while adding new beekeepers and expanded opportunities for owning hives can be great for pollinating local communities, hobbyist beekeepers bear a lot of responsibility to understand colony health and how to protect their hives. 
“If new beekeepers don’t control their mites, that can be bad for neighboring operations,” Flenniken said. “It’s not that just more colonies are good; more well-managed colonies are good.” 
Flenniken also noted that the number of hobbyist apiaries, even with additional hives, pales in comparison to the state’s commercial operations and can’t make up for large-scale losses. Department of Agriculture data shows that while 88% of registered beekeepers are hobbyists or landowners, they make up less than 4% of bee colonies statewide. 
Guess said that while he’s seen a growing interest in individuals around Missoula ooking to pursue beekeeping as a hobby, he isn’t sure that the new Montana law will boost existing hobbyist apiary numbers. 
“Most of our beekeepers in the club have 2-3 hives and even folks who have five, might not need an incremental increase of one or two more,” he said. “Ten hives is a strong hobby, in my opinion, almost becoming a small business. I don’t know how many hobbyist beekeepers have the time, energy and money to keep that up.”
Montanans can help the state’s bee population without owning hives — including by growing flowers and pollinator-friendly plants.

Exams were closed due to a state-wide power outage for government systems. (Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota state government telephone systems and websites went down across several departments Tuesday, limiting systems and services.
One woman filling out driver’s licensing paperwork at the Sioux Falls One Stop Tuesday afternoon yelled in exasperation over the news. There was no signage to warn her driver’s license exams were closed, just an empty waiting room and blank TV screens. 
She was informed about the closure by a passerby, and later a state Department of Motor Vehicles staff member.
People looking to get marriage licenses and vehicle registrations experienced similar hassles Tuesday across South Dakota. 
As of Tuesday evening, the reason for the power outage behind the state’s technical difficulties – and people’s frustrations – was still unknown.

Bureau of Information and Telecommunications spokesperson Lisa Rahja said it’s not clear how long the power outage will impact state operations and services, she said. 
“The event affected all state-hosted services and some network communications,” Rahja said in an emailed statement. “The state engineer and BIT technical staff have investigated the root cause and are taking measures to remediate.”
The data center is not a single location, Rahja later told South Dakota Searchlight, but rather the term used by the IT bureau to refer to all the hardware scattered across multiple locations and connected to the state’s communications network.
Rahja said the state was still looking into the cause and extent of the outages. But the situation was not weather-related, she said, and that “there’s no reason to believe there’s any other external factors.”
“We’re trying to really get that back up and running, but we can’t even nail down what part of it is having the issues, because it’s all very large and complex for the entire state.”
An incident command center was launched Tuesday to streamline communications between the bureau and the office of the state engineer as they work to resolve the issue.
Outages across multiple departments
Some websites were entirely down Tuesday, including websites for the secretary of state, attorney general, auditor, treasurer, bureau of finance and management, as well as departments of social services, education, agriculture and natural resources, tourism, tribal relations and public safety. 
The state’s medical marijuana page was down even as the state’s Medical Marijuana Oversight Committee met in Pierre. SD.net, the state-run service that streams government meetings, only streamed portions of that committee’s Tuesday meeting. Coverage was also spotty for the audio stream of the state’s Rules Review committee.
South Dakota’s transparency website, Open SD, and the website that hosts meeting agendas, minutes and calendars for dozens of state regulatory and oversight boards and commissions were also affected.
Calls to the state Department of Health, which maintains the medical marijuana page, were dropped throughout the day. The state Department of Public Safety posted on Facebook that it would close driver’s license exam stations until network service returned. A note on the Department of Revenue homepage said the department and clients were having issues accessing the state’s online filing system.

The state Legislature and Unified Judicial System sites were working, though the UJS homepage said “connectivity issues” might prevent some online features from working, including the state’s eCourts system. 
In a post on X, Attorney General Marty Jackley apologized for a lack of public access to his office’s services
“You may not be able to reach our office at this time,” Jackley said.
Local impacts
Local agencies that rely on South Dakota state network access were impacted on Tuesday. The Minnehaha County Treasurer’s office in Sioux Falls, for example, was unable to access the records needed to issue license plates and vehicle registrations.
“Computer issue — no registrations can be printed,” a sign at the treasurer’s office read. “We can review your paperwork.”
Down the hall at the Minnehaha County Register of Deeds, county employees were unable to access any state records on births, deaths or marriages. People could pay in advance for records they’d need to get at a later date, Assistant Treasurer Vicki Fuglsby said, but only if they paid cash.
The system for accepting credit card payments is tied to the state and wasn’t working, Fuglsby said.
“We had to turn away people looking for marriage licenses,” Fuglsby said.
The Lawrence County Treasurer’s office in Deadwood, like every other Treasurer’s office in the state, was unable to print vehicle registrations on Tuesday. Typically, there’s a mailing fee for customers who ask that records be sent, said Sally Atkinson, the First Deputy Treasurer in Lawrence County.
On Tuesday, attendants took checks and prepared paperwork for registrations, titles and the like, and offered to send the documents without the fee.
“It’s not their fault. They drove up here to get this done, and now they can’t,” Atkinson said.

(Coast Guard screengrab)By Ciara Wells
The Patapsco River channel into the Port of Baltimore was reopened Tuesday afternoon after a fiery explosion on a cargo ship Monday night closed the channel for the better part of a day while the Coast Guard investigated.
The incident began about 6:30 p.m. Monday when the bow of the coal-carrying cargo ship W-Sapphire erupted in a fireball as it was leaving the port, not far from the remaining wreckage of the Francis Scott Key Bridge, which collapsed last year. Livestream video footage shows the explosion, followed by black smoke billowing from the ship as it slowly continues its path on the Patapsco River.
The U.S. Coast Guard confirmed to WTOP that there were 23 people and two pilots on board the coal-bearing ship. The Maryland Department of Emergency Management reported on X and the Baltimore City Fire Department reported in a post on Facebook that no injuries to the crew had been reported, and there was no damage found beyond the W-Sapphire, a 751-foot bulk carrier from Liberia.
“Fireboats remain on scene as the Coast Guard and other agencies begin their investigation. The vessel will be moved to a designated anchorage area and held there until cleared by the Coast Guard,” the fire department wrote Monday night.
Key Bridge deconstruction continues as officials eye initial effort for a new span

By Tuesday, the W-Sapphire had been moved and anchored near the Chesapeake Bay Bridge, where the Coast Guard established a safety zone for 500 yards around the vessel.
The explosion blew a hatch off the front of the W-Sapphire and into the river, posing a potential threat to navigation that led the Coast Guard to close the channel for 2,000 yards around the possible resting place of the hatch. By Tuesday evening, that safety zone had been lifted, but the Coast Guard imposed draft restrictions on ships passing through the area and said a 500-yard safety zone could be imposed when recovery of the hatch began.
The explosion occurred not far from the remains of the Francis Scott Key Bridge, which collapsed in the early morning hours on March 26, 2024, when the container ship Dali lost power and careened into the bridge, causing most of it to collapse into the river below.
Six construction workers were killed in the collapse. The destruction and extensive recovery efforts raised concerns about the implications to international shipping and commerce — the Port of Baltimore is the ninth-busiest port in the nation. But the channel was cleared and reopened within weeks.
Crews are now involved in removing remaining parts of the Key Bridge in preparation for a higher, longer replacement span, which is expected to be completed in 2028.

A recent National Association of Realtors report found affordability increased slightly from last year, but the typical family is still priced out in the West and Northeast. (Madison McVan/Minnesota Reformer)Housing became more affordable this June, as higher incomes and slightly lower interest rates overcame higher prices, according to a National Association of Realtors report.
However, the South and the Midwest are the only regions where a family with typical or median income can afford a median-priced house, according to the report. The group considers a mortgage to be affordable if the monthly payment (principal and interest) is 25% or less of the family’s income.



The affordability gap is highest in the West, where the typical family income is $113,783, just over two-thirds of the $164,832 that would be needed to purchase a median-priced home.
The Northeast, where the typical family makes $114,559, is also unaffordable by this measure, as a median-priced home requires an income of $141,264.
In the Midwest, the median family income is $102,419, more than the $86,256 needed to buy a median-priced home. The same is true in the South, where the median income is $97,812, slightly more than the $96,720 required to buy a typical home.
Nationally, affordability increased slightly compared with June of 2024, with the typical family making $105,431, about 94% of the $111,648 it would need to buy the median-priced home. That’s up from about 92% in June 2024.
In a video posted Aug. 15, Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors, said he expects lower interest rates to increase affordability in the months ahead.
“We know that mortgage rates will be coming down and that will bring additional buyers into the market. We just need to make sure we have more supply, more supply to meet that demand,” Yun said.

Greg Gianforte speaks during a ribbon-cutting ceremony for EquipmentShare, a new buisness in Helena, on Aug. 18, 2025. (Jordan Hansen / Daily Montanan)Montana’s construction industry is growing, and so are investments into it.
Gov. Greg Gianforte helped cut the ribbon Monday at EquipmentShare, a new rental service business in Helena. The company is expected to open four locations in Montana, with an investment of $81 million in the state, according to the Governor’s office. 
The Missouri-based company is also expected to add over 80 jobs to the state, Gianforte said. Its website states it has 6,900 employees across 326 locations.
“We’ve seen remarkable interest in businesses expanding here, in large part because of our pro-jobs, pro-business policies,” Gianforte said during an interview Monday. “We’re excited to see EquipmentShare making this investment in Montana. It’s going to mean our construction industry is more efficient and safer, and means jobs in this business.”
Mark Wallace, a representative for EquipmentShare, explained why the company looks at the state as a place for growth.
“We see Montana as a place that not only has a thriving business environment, but is continuing to develop into the future,” Wallace told the Daily Montanan. “So the goal here is to build the future of construction in Montana with Montanans.”
EquipmentShare rents a variety of equipment, including boom lifts, industrial AC units and earthmoving equipment. Its offerings were on display Monday afternoon, with lifts extended around the yard and buckets of excavators filled with ice and cold drinks.
The company also provides some disaster relief services and rentals.
“We’re veterans in the disaster response category of equipment needs and construction needs, job site needs,” Wallace said. “We’ve unfortunately seen a number of natural disasters around the country, but thankfully, we’ve been in a position where we have a local branch and amazing team members across the country who are willing to jump up and assist the community in any way.”
During remarks at the event, Gianforte expressed optimism at job and economic numbers, mentioning Montana’s low unemployment rate. On Tuesday, the Governor’s Office announced the state’s July unemployment rate was 2.8% — the 10th straight month under 3%. The state ranks in the top five in the U.S. for low unemployment.
EquipmentShare also announced donations on Monday to two causes, including Angel Fund which helps children and families with school supplies. The other check was also aimed at youth, going to training and coaching technical industrial construction skills.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DSC_0562-1024x640.jpg,,,2025-08-19 18:58:24.336369

Practically every call that reached their Tacoma communication center was handled by first responders. “The […],"Dispatchers inside South Sound 911's central Tacoma office are working with counselors on behavioral health calls as part of a new partnership between the Washington Department of Health and providers who oversee the state's 988 mental health hotlines. (Photo courtesy of South Sound 911)During Dianna Caber’s 15-year tenure at South Sound 911 – the public safety answering center for a majority of fire and law enforcement agencies in Pierce County – dispatchers have rarely transferred anyone to a regional crisis and suicide hotline. Practically every call that reached their Tacoma communication center was handled by first responders.
“The only caller we were transferring to a crisis line before was someone who called and said, ‘can I talk to crisis?’” Caber, manager of the center, said. “Outside of that, it was getting entered for a law enforcement or fire department response.”
Practices fundamentally changed two years ago, after trained mental health counselors from the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline embedded themselves inside Sound Sound’s call center under a state pilot program. Large numbers of calls are now diverted, at least partially, away from emergency responders like law enforcement.
The shift is one component of a broader and ambitious effort to overhaul Washington’s behavioral health response system following the launch of 988, which debuted across the country in July 2022 as a replacement for the National Suicide Prevention Hotline.
Changing from the former suicide hotline number, 1-800-273-8255, to an easy-to-remember three-digit replacement drove a significant increase in volume. Record numbers have connected with trained counselors via phone, text and chat since 988 launched. In Washington, calls are up 52% from launch, according to a state report published last December. Text messages rose 923%.
And call volumes have continued to grow monthly, said Courtney Colwell, director of 988 Services for Volunteers of America of Western Washington. Calls were up 37% since last year, and 8% between June in July.
Volunteers of America, based in Everett, is one of three providers handling 988 calls in Washington. VOA handles calls from a vast majority of the state, excluding those in King and six counties near Spokane.
Only about 10% of those calls require any sort of dispatch, Colwell said. About 10% of calls end with a mobile crisis outreach team being deployed, while about 2% might need a response from law enforcement or firefighters.
“A lot of people just need someone to talk to,” she said.
Much of the work being done around 988 is still in its infancy, but has shown promising results, Caber says. Their partnership with Volunteers of America has been a “huge benefit.”
One of the biggest innovations has been conference calls, where a 911 call receiver and 988 counselor are on the line at the same time with a caller – able to give them advice as they wait for first responders. About 16% of calls are now being handled in this format, Colwell said, while the rest are flat transfers.
Being together opens up many opportunities to support callers and maintain a “no wrong door approach,” Caber said. “No matter who you call and where you go, we’re going to get you to the right people.”
 Someone to respond and somewhere to go

From the beginning, Washington officials envisioned 988 as an entry point to a more comprehensive system, adopting legislation to enhance the state’s behavioral health infrastructure to provide help beyond the initial call.
The concept, based on the ideal crisis continuum outlined by the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, was that in addition to a crisis line to call, there would be local dispatch services and facilities for people to go for follow-up care.
“At launch, the promise for the future of Washington’s lifeline was threefold: someone to call, someone to respond, and a place to go,” then-Gov. Jay Inslee wrote in a 2024 blog post.
Three years later, many of those initial promises are still a work in progress, said Jolene Kron, executive director of the Salish Behavioral Health Administrative Services Organization. Several state workgroups continue to discuss the future of 988 and its role in the state’s crisis system.
A spokesperson for the Washington state Health Care Authority, the agency tasked with overseeing much of this work, did not make a representative available for an interview by press time.
One of the questions is how 988 fits in with the existing local crisis lines. Salish, one of 10 state-funded regional behavioral health providers, runs its own behavioral health hotline – distinct from and created prior to the launch of 988 – for residents of Kitsap, Jefferson and Clallam Counties.
The Salish Regional Crisis Line and 988 services coordinate with each other. Volunteers of America runs both, but they are separate entities.
Kron said this requires some call transferring between the two lines, in an effort to maintain a no-wrong-door approach. In an emergency, an individual can call either line, she says.
There are few transfers from 988 to the Salish Line, Kron said. Part of that is 988 has historically been used for suicide prevention, meaning most callers are only looking for someone to talk to and their issues are resolved on the phone.


If a call needs an in-person response, it has to be transferred to Salish, Kron said. They are the only ones who can dispatch the mobile crisis outreach team run by the nonprofit Kitsap Mental Health Services. Kron said that is something that could be changed down the road.
Challenges around georouting also exist for 988, to some degree, Kron said. Previously, when some dialed 988, their calls were routed to a call center based on their phone’s area code – not their actual location. That changed for major wireless carriers like T-Mobile, Verizon and AT&T last year, but smaller providers still have this issue.
“Many of the folks we would be serving are probably not on those larger plans, so we continue to support folks using the Salish regional crisis line for most expedient direct access,” Kron said. “There’s not a barrier to using 988, it would just mean an additional call transfer.”

During a news conference Tuesday hosted by the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, the national Democratic Party’s arm focused on electing Democrats to state legislatures, New Mexico House Speaker Javier Martínez of Albuquerque said the Trump administration’s tariffs and trade wars are raising prices of groceries and creating challenges for New Mexico’s small business owners, especially its breweries and coffee roasters, in a state bordering Mexico and where international trade is vital to its economy.
Martínez also pointed to Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s mass deportations’ effects on the state’s entire workforce, especially farmworkers, oil and gas workers and their loved ones.
“We’re the second-highest producer of oil and gas, and a lot of that workforce is either undocumented or in mixed-status families,” Martínez said. “New Mexico is famous for Hatch green chile. Guess who picks that chile: immigrant communities.”
To contrast his party’s policies with those of Republicans, Martínez pointed to New Mexico’s enactment of guaranteed access to child care and early childhood education in the state constitution; tuition-free college; free lunches in public schools and tax cuts for people with lower incomes.
An email and voicemail seeking comment from the Republican Party of New Mexico was not returned on Tuesday. Source NM also asked a spokesperson for the Senate Republican Leadership Office for comment and will update this story as needed.
Illinois House Speaker Pro Tempore Ken Buckner said the tariffs on steel, aluminum and lumber are driving up the prices of housing, food and health care.
“Across the country, families are already stretched to the breaking point,” Buckner said. “And instead of helping, Republicans gave us something that made it all worse: Trump’s tariffs.”
Washington Senate Deputy Majority Leader Manka Dhingra said the tariffs will shrink her state’s robust import and export economy with Canada and raise prices at grocery stores, fuel pumps and car dealerships for everyone. Tariffs on Canadian softwood would hike construction costs for homes and residential buildings, she said.
“This is an artificially created crisis due to the impulse of one man, which will impact the pocketbook of every Washingtonian and American,” Dhingra said.
Dhingra said Democrats are not opposed to tariffs across the board but rather disagree with the way Trump is carrying out his tariffs.
“We can be thoughtful, we can be methodical, we can have conversations and if there are tariffs that need to be imposed, let’s make sure we do it the right way and make sure there’s predictability there,” she said.

Article Summary

The recruiting billboard for a right-wing extremist group, the Proud Boys, was removed in Clinton County after an outpouring of outrage.
The advertising company that put the billboard up near a high school would not say who paid for it.
The Proud Boys has been labeled a hate group and was linked to the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol in Washington, D.C.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

BREESE, Ill. — After strong community opposition, including a county board meeting where dozens of people spoke against it, the Proud Boys billboard that was put up near a high school in Clinton County was removed Tuesday.
A representative from Lamar Advertising’s Collinsville office said the sign was taken down around noon. The company declined further comment.
Clinton County Board Chairman Brad Knolhoff said the county had no legal authority to regulate the billboard’s content, but he and many others contacted the company, expressing their outrage.
“I would say the fact that so many people were reaching out played a large factor” in the decision, he said. “I’m very pleased that the billboard is down because of the animosity it was causing and the angst in the community. It’s not healthy for the community.”
The billboard, up only a few days, was located at Old U.S. Route 50 and St. Rose Road, about 1,000 feet from the entrance to Central Community High School. It listed a local recruiting phone number, but calls went to a voicemail that was full.
The Proud Boys have been labeled a hate or extremist group by multiple organizations and was tied to the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, though the group has been quieter in recent years. Lamar Advertising declined to say who purchased the billboard.
At Monday night’s board meeting, about 70 people attended and more than 30 spoke during public comment, a turnout far larger than usual.

Former judge and state’s attorney Dennis Middendorff reminded the crowd this was not the first time Clinton County had faced such a test. In the 1980s, he recalled, the KKK received a permit to rally at nearby Carlyle Lake.
“I didn’t want to give” the legal advice at the time, he said, but under the First Amendment, they had the right to assemble. Even so, Middendorff told the board Monday night this moment was still an opportunity: “You don’t have to take action to try and stop it. Maybe you can’t stop it, but you can condemn it, and that’s what I’m really asking you to do.”
One by one — teachers, doctors, lawyers, laborers, parents, students — went to the microphone. Most said the same thing: We don’t want it here.
Gene Hemingway, who is Black, said the billboard only made visible what was already simmering. “I heard some years ago, they’re dropping the robes and they’re putting on suits,” he said. “I’m not scared, but I am very aware. Because I know the primary purpose is to eradicate people of my color, the LGBTQ community, anything other than white.”
Naomi Knapp, a recent graduate of Central Community High School, said she was disappointed but not surprised.
“I don’t think a lot of people in this county actually believe the things that people like the Proud Boys are saying,” she said. “But I did hear it in my high school. I did hear racial slurs. … And I can’t even imagine any person of color having to honestly live here. And that’s devastating, because I know that most of us are amazing people who actually believe in family and faith and community.”
At the conclusion of public comments, board member Greg Riechman said he appreciated the concerns raised and thanked the residents for “speaking from their hearts.”  He then introduced a nonbinding resolution condemning “hatred, bigotry, divisiveness or racism of any kind,” which  passed unanimously.
Though the billboard did not include much content beyond a phone number, logo and website for the Proud Boys, many objected to it being an obvious recruiting tool that was placed near the high school.
Knolhoff said he hopes the county can move forward, but added, “We will remain vigilant.”

U.S. Geological Survey analysis using demographic data from 13 Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem elk herds suggests few overall benefits from feeding, including for hunting. 
The post Feedgrounds grow elk herds? Wolves, grizzlies might mop up benefits, study finds. appeared first on WyoFile .","Biologist Brian Dugovich’s colleagues came up with that catchy four-word soundbite — “farming elk feeds wolves” — to sum up one finding from a study he led that investigated the effectiveness of Wyoming’s system of feeding elk in the winter. 
Dugovich’s study, recently published in the journal Ecosphere, initially set out to test some of the assumptions about elk feedgrounds and their benefits. One reason why big game outfitters have been steadfast proponents of elk feeding for generations is a belief that feedgrounds improve elk hunting. But it’s a premise that’s never really been tested in the modern era using data. 
“We thought it would be a good idea to revisit some assumptions,” said Dugovich, a Ph.D. wildlife disease ecologist who published the study while working at the U.S. Geological Survey’s Northern Rocky Mountain Science Center. 
Dugovich and his colleagues examined several demographic indicators for Wyoming’s six fed elk herds, comparing their performance to seven unfed elk herds on the east and north sides of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Specifically, they looked at the rates of calves being recruited in a herd, the population size relative to the acreage of available winter range and the “surplus” of elk, which is essentially the huntable number that could be killed each year without reducing populations. 

Demographic indicators illustrated in these graphs suggest that feeding has little effect on elk herd production in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. (USGS/EcoSphere)
Results varied — the Jackson and Fall Creek elk herds were more stimulated by feeding than the four others —  but overall, the effects of feeding were “small,” said Paul Cross, a USGS research wildlife biologist who collaborated on the research. 
“The question then is, ‘Well, why is it so small?’” Cross said. “We’re proposing that it could be that predators are assuming some of that effect.” 
In scientific terms, Dugovich described it as a “predator subsidization effect.” In regions where elk are fed hay and alfalfa for months during the brunt of winter, herds brought aboard about 5% more calves than elsewhere in the Yellowstone region. But those extra hooves on the ground didn’t necessarily translate to a larger surplus of elk available for hunting, he said. 
“The benefit you might be getting from feeding was being mopped up by the predators,” Dugovich said. “In a more intact ecosystem [that includes large carnivores], the energy you put into the system is going to be harder to get back out again as harvest.”

The dynamics were evident in the raw data, Cross said. But a statistical model that was part of the study corroborated the findings, he said. The model used 26 years of data, included thousands of simulations and took into account factors like winter severity and the presence of predators. 
The USGS research was conducted in collaboration with federal land and wildlife managers, who shared data. Co-authors listed include USGS’ Emma Tomaszewski, the National Elk Refuge’s Eric Cole, Grand Teton National Park’s Sarah Dewey, Utah State University’s Dan MacNulty, Wyoming Game and Fish Department’s Brandon Scurlock and Yellowstone National Park’s Dan Stahler.

Wyoming Game and Fish, which administers 21 winter elk feedgrounds, declined an interview for this story. Its staff was not involved in the study’s analysis or conclusions about the feedgrounds, which are a political hot potato. 
“Game and Fish consistently utilizes the best available data and science to inform wildlife management strategies,” Scurlock, the Pinedale Region’s wildlife management coordinator, said in an emailed statement. 
The USGS has been assisting land and wildlife managers with scientific analyses to help inform what they should do about elk feeding in the long run. Although the feeding system is a century old, the recent arrival of chronic wasting disease projects to change the elk feeding equation significantly.  Wildlife disease experts anticipate that keeping the historic practice going will produce the worst outcomes for the future of elk populations and elk hunting. 
Dugovich’s findings about feedgrounds and elk herd productivity were not included in recent analyses that informed decisions about feeding elk on federal land, according to Cross. 
In early August, Bridger-Teton National Forest Supervisor Chad Hudson made a “difficult” decision to keep feeding elk for at least three more winters on the 35-acre Dell Creek and 100-acre Forest Park feedgrounds. A decision about what to do with elk feeding on the National Elk Refuge also looms. Wyomingite and recently confirmed U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Director Brian Nesvik will presumably play a major role in making the decision.

(Photo by Patrick Lohmann / Source NM)New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced Tuesday that housing funds the state Legislature approved this year will soon leave state coffers as agencies try to address an affordable housing and homelessness crisis here.
Record number of housing bills introduced this session, but little to show for it, advocate says

Between the last two legislative sessions, the Legislature has dedicated more than $300 million to various housing-related measures at different agencies, including revolving loans for builders, down-payment assistance and anti-homelessness programs. That figure includes $140 million lawmakers approved this session. 
In a news release Tuesday, the governor said that the Office of Housing within the New Mexico Department of Workforce Solutions will distribute $120 million of that funding beginning this month. 
“These investments prioritize solving New Mexico’s housing crisis through focused investments in affordable and attainable housing, support for prevention, and proven solutions
 to the challenge of homelessness,” the governor said in a statement. “When we face a challenge of this magnitude, we must take an ‘all the above’ approach.”
According to the news release, the funding includes: 

more than $80 million for housing and homelessness projects in the Albuquerque area 
more than $11 million for housing and homelessness projects in the Las Cruces area
more than $13 million for housing projects in other parts of New Mexico 
$7.8 million for projects to support students experiencing homelessness at public schools in Albuquerque, Las Cruces and Santa Fe

According to recent estimates, the state lacks more than 32,000 housing units. Rents and homelessness have increased far beyond the national average in recent years, especially in Albuquerque, the state’s biggest city. 
The newly created Office of Housing, which was transferred to DWS shortly after the session, is overseeing the spending, according to the news release. DWS Secretary Sarita Nair said the funding will go toward “proven strategies” for tackling the housing crisis.
Amid funding cut threats and homeless camp sweeps, a volunteer loses hope but keeps counting

That means focusing on building more housing, preventing homelessness and ensuring that people who move into homes after living on the street have “wrap-around support and thoughtful interventions,” she said in the news release.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderGeorgia officials discussed eliminating the state income tax Tuesday but provided little detail on how to do so.
Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, who is campaigning to be Georgia’s next governor, helped kick off the first meeting of the Senate Special Committee on Eliminating Georgia’s Income Tax. 
“If we want to continue to stay competitive here in the state of Georgia, and continue to be the number one state to do business, we’ve got to be looking for ways to keep us competitive and make it where we have a competitive advantage over states that we are competing with all the time,” Jones said at the start of the meeting.

The goal, lawmakers discussed in the committee, is to make Georgia more competitive with neighboring states that have no income tax, such as Florida and Tennessee, and states that are in the process of eliminating its income tax, such as Mississippi and North Carolina.
Personal income taxes are estimated to account for 41.6% of Georgia’s estimated revenue for the current budget year, which started on July 1, according to the Governor’s Office of Planning and Budget. With corporate income tax included, which officials indicated would be reduced along with personal income tax, that number rises to just over 50% of all state revenues.
  Sen. Blake Tillery. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Danny Kanso, senior fiscal analyst at the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, said after the meeting that he’d “like to see the math on that.” He said that for most of Georgia’s households, eliminating the income tax would amount to a “massive” tax increase. The state would have to triple the sales tax and expand the sales tax to new products to make up for the deficit, calling it “a very tall order to replace the state’s largest source of revenue.”
“The proposal would have to increase taxes on far more Georgians than it would reduce taxes on, and so it’s a little bit of a solution in search of a problem that would likely cause ripples all across the state and across the economy as well,” Kanso said.
But Grover Norquist, president of the Americans for Tax Reform, a conservative organization advocating for tax cuts, said that it’s possible for Georgia to eliminate its 5.19% income tax rate without increasing sales tax. He argued that eliminating the income tax could still allow the state budget to increase through sales tax revenue as Georgians would have more income to spend.
“When you attract more people into the state and more business into the state and more investment into the state, you end up with both more money for individuals earning it, but also more tax revenue at lower rates,” Norquist said. 
He said that Florida, which does not tax income, “makes more money every year from sales tax and other taxes that aren’t going up. There’s more money because there are more people with higher earnings who have more resources who move to Florida.”
Norquist also said that with tariffs the Trump administration is imposing on other nations to promote domestic manufacturing, eliminating the income tax would make Georgia a more attractive state for industries looking to move manufacturing to the state.
“President Trump put in a lot of incentives for people to invest in the United States. There are still 50 choices,” he said.
  Sen. Nan Orrock. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Sen. Nan Orrock, an Atlanta Democrat, saying that lawmakers are tasked with “meeting the needs of our population,” asked for clarification about how the Legislature could raise revenue at a time when the federal government is shifting the cost of disaster relief and food assistance programs to the states.
“How do you square reducing our state revenues with the needs that we have as a state, and the unknown needs that are going to happen as higher ed and K-12 [and] enormous cuts that are coming down from [the federal government]?” Orrock said.
Norquist did not say how the state could raise revenue but instead pointed to North Carolina, which has lowered its income tax rate but “spending has gone on every year.”
“It is going up because revenue is coming, and they have reduced marginal tax rates and revenue has come in higher than before,” he said.
Kanso called it “wishful thinking,” saying that relying on growth is not a “viable path to raise $19 billion a year and replace more than 50% of the state budget.”
“[It] doesn’t really make sense when you hear we’re going to lower taxes, eliminate sources of revenue, and somehow we’re also going to raise more money,” Kanso said. “That’s not something we’ve really seen work in the past.”",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DSC0051-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-19 18:58:24.336369

Smith Entertainment Group, the owner of Utah’s NBA and NHL franchises, announced on Tuesday a partnership with Live Nation Entertainment to build the new venue, the first of many major announcements for the heart of the state-created downtown sports, entertainment, culture and convention center district.
Smith Entertainment Group unveils one-of-a-kind vision for Delta Center remodel

“Once the transformation of Delta Center was underway, partnering with Live Nation on what a world-class concert venue could look like in downtown became a top priority. Not only will it bring the best artists in the world to Utah, but it will also bring a million people downtown to experience Salt Lake City every year,” Ryan Smith, chair and CEO of Smith Entertainment Group said in a statement.
Both Smith Entertainment Group and Live Nation will commit “considerable financial investment” for the project, Smith said.
The announcement comes after Salt Lake City’s approval of a 0.5% sales tax increase to gather $900 million mostly to renovate the Delta Center to equip it to host hockey games, but also to redevelop three downtown blocks. That was part of a plan drawn by a 2024 law that allowed Salt Lake City to help fund renovations to the Delta Center and an enhanced downtown.
The new development is considerably smaller than its neighboring Delta Center, which is able to accommodate 12,000 to 19,000 attendees in Salt Lake City and will continue hosting concerts and other entertainment events “while the new venue will serve artists seeking a best-in-class, mid-size indoor option,” according to a news release.
Smith Entertainment Group expects to host 200 events a year, including 100 concerts and other corporate, conference and community events.
The venue is also part of a Live Nation national expansion in sports and entertainment districts, adding to the MGM Music Hall at Boston’s Fenway Park and other similar projects in Pittsburgh, Indianapolis and Atlanta.
“Utah is a great market for live music, and Smith Entertainment Group is the right partner to help us deliver a world-class venue to fans in Salt Lake City,” Michael Rapino, CEO of Live Nation said in a statement. “SEG’s incredible vision for the downtown district aligns with our mission to expand access to live music.”

“Vermont does not have any law or policy that impedes the enforcement of federal immigration law. In fact the opposite is true,” the governor said in a letter to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi.

Gov. Phil Scott has responded to the U.S. attorney general’s recent letter which labeled Vermont as a sanctuary jurisdiction, reiterating that the state does not hold that status and does not violate any federal immigration laws.
“I believe this designation of Vermont as a so-called ‘sanctuary jurisdiction’ has been made in error,” Scott wrote to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi in an Aug. 19 letter shared with VTDigger.
Scott’s comments refer to an Aug. 13 letter in which the attorney general’s office identified Vermont as a state that “engages in sanctuary policies and practices,” threatening criminal charges, civil action and potentially withholding federal funds if it does not cease.
That letter comes on the heels of the Justice Department announcing its latest list of 35 sanctuary jurisdictions, which includes Vermont, as part of the federal government’s continued effort to target communities it believes are interfering with immigration enforcement.
Scott pushed back on the assertion. 
“Vermont does not have any law or policy that impedes the enforcement of federal immigration law. In fact the opposite is true,” his letter states. “Vermont State law is very clear that the State does not prohibit or impede any public agency from complying with the lawful requirements of 8 U.S.C. §§ 1373 and 1644.”

(Photo by Darrell Ehrlick of the Daily Montanan)Puget Sound Energy announced on Tuesday that its Beaver Creek wind farm, a 248-megawatt wind project located on the high plains in Stillwater County is now fully operational.
The Beaver Creek wind farm is the latest addition of renewable energy resources that PSE has brought online as it works toward complying with Washington state’s clean energy laws. By 2030, the amount of new, non-emitting generation resources PSE will need to have is more than the utility has accumulated in its 150-year history.
The wind farm has an initial nameplate capacity of 248 megawatts, enough energy to power about 83,000 homes a year. Montana wind has a high production rate that is especially valuable during extremely cold weather in the Pacific Northwest, when high pressure systems mean that Washington wind farms produce less energy.
“The Beaver Creek project moved from construction to full operation in just over a year, demonstrating what’s possible when we combine innovative planning with strong partnerships,” Mary Kipp, president and CEO of Puget Sound Energy, said in a press release. “I want to particularly thank Montana’s state and local officials for their support and collaborative approach that helped make this aggressive timeline possible. Their partnership has been instrumental in bringing this important energy resource online to serve our customers.”
PSE has been a partner in Montana’s energy economy since the 1970s and continues to invest in the state of Montana and its communities. The project uses existing PSE transmission on the Colstrip Transmission System to bring the robust wind energy back to PSE customers. PSE is proud to own and operate the Beaver Creek facility in Stillwater County, employing local workers and supporting the community. The wind farm utilized an estimated 200 to 300 skilled workers during construction and now employs 10 permanent on-site workers for ongoing operations.
“The Beaver Creek Wind project is a great example of how we can harness Montana’s abundant natural resources while strengthening our economy,” Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte in the press release. “This is another important milestone in Montana’s all-of-the-above energy approach. I appreciate this investment in our state, and I look forward to seeing the benefits it brings to families and businesses in Stillwater County and beyond.”
As part of the clean energy transition, PSE continues to partner with energy producers in the state of Montana. Recent examples include power purchase agreements signed with Energy Keepers, Inc., the tribally owned corporation of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes for hydroelectric power, and an agreement with NextEra for power from Montana’s largest wind farm, Clearwater Wind, based in Rosebud, Custer and Garfield Counties. PSE also has a power purchase agreement with Clearway Energy Group to receive clean energy from its Haymaker Wind facility, that will be constructed in Wheatland and Meagher Counties, Montana.

This story by Michael Coughlin Jr. was first published in the Valley News on Aug. 15, 2025.
HANOVER — A former Dartmouth cross country head coach filed a federal lawsuit against the college this week, alleging that the school had “blacklisted” him, damaging his “reputation and his ability to obtain employment.”
Attorneys for Justin Wood, of Quechee, who coached the men’s cross country team and was an assistant track and field coach between 2020 and 2022, filed the lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Concord, seeking an unspecified amount in damages. Along with the college, the suit names as defendant Porscha Dobson Harnden, former director of Dartmouth track and field and cross country, currently living in Auburn, Alabama, according to the lawsuit.
During Wood’s time as coach, he “raised a number of concerns about Defendant Harnden, and his belief that she was leading those programs with a glaring disregard for Ivy League and NCAA policies, along with potential admissions fraud and laxities taken with the health and safety of Dartmouth’s student-athletes,” the complaint states.
A spokesperson from Dartmouth declined to comment on the lawsuit and Wood’s allegations against Harnden.
After “confronting defendants” about his concerns in 2022, Dartmouth offered Wood a severance agreement, according to the suit. Both parties entered into a “Separation Agreement and General Release Agreement” in August 2022, which contained a “non-disparagement” clause.
Over the next couple of months, Wood attempted to secure a position as the head coach of track and field at New York University (NYU). The complaint alleges that during a background check call between NYU and Dartmouth in December 2022, “the individual at NYU who was managing the background check was informed that Wood had been blacklisted.”
“The NYU individual who was managing the background check made a statement that something happened at Dartmouth, and ‘we just can’t,’” the lawsuit states.
The 12-page complaint also contains a screenshot from a post on a LetsRun.com message board in October 2022, which claimed Wood resigned “because he was associated with some inappropriate actions by coaching friends of his and was brought to light in an investigation.”  
The lawsuit goes on to say that when Wood called the manager of the blog “regarding this false and defamatory information, and seeking to have it removed, the manager indicated to (Wood) that he had spoken with Defendant Harnden’s spouse regarding Wood’s departure from Dartmouth.”
Harnden made the statements with “actual malice, in response to Wood’s complaints of her improper conduct, i.e., her glaring disregard for Ivy League and NCAA policies, along with potential admissions fraud and laxities taken with the health and safety of Dartmouth’s student-athletes,” the suit maintains.
The suit also alleges that Harnden, “sometime in the Fall of 2022, told at least one individual and possibly a team captain, a cryptic reason for Wood’s departure. More specifically, there had been an incident or altercation involving Wood and a coach from another college, where the police were involved and the coach from the other school was immediately let go.”
According to the suit, Dartmouth “has taken concrete, retaliatory steps to prevent Wood from securing comparable employment,” by removing him from the college’s 2020-2021 and 2021-2022 men’s track and field rosters, and the 2021 men’s cross country roster. 
This was done, the suit maintains, to “interfere with Wood’s application processes at other institutions,” including Tufts University in Medford, Mass.
Before coming to Dartmouth, Wood was a head coach at the University of La Verne in California. 
Valley News’ attempts to reach Harnden this week were unsuccessful. Dartmouth did not respond to the paper’s inquiry regarding when Harnden left her position.
In August 2024, The Dartmouth, the college’s daily newspaper, indicated that Harnden had not communicated with the cross country team since February of that year and that a job opening for an interim director of track and field and cross country was posted that June.
Wood referred questions to his attorneys at Shaheen & Gordon, a major New Hampshire law firm based in Concord. His attorneys did not respond to a request for comment.

(File/Getty Images)COLUMBIA — A transgender student in Berkeley County will be allowed to use the boys’ bathroom this school year, despite a state law that says otherwise, a federal appeals court decided.
The student, identified only as John Doe in the lawsuit, is suing the state over a clause initially inserted in the budget last year. It puts school districts at risk of losing 25% of their state aid if they let transgender students use multi-occupancy bathrooms and locker rooms that align with their gender identity.
Budget clauses carry the same legal weight as permanent state law. They’re technically one-year laws, but unless legislators vote to take them out, they carry over indefinitely. Legislators made no attempt to remove the rule, titled “student physical privacy,” from the budget that took effect July 1.
Transgender student sues SC to use bathroom of choice

Last week’s court ruling applies only to the student — now a high school freshman — as his case continues to move through the appeals process.
Attorneys for the family had initially asked a judge to block the law entirely, allowing an estimated 3,000 transgender students across the state to use the bathroom of their choosing. But that request was denied last month.
Due to being bullied, the student left his middle school last September. After nearly a year of homeschooling, the ninth grader “cannot wait for relief,” his attorneys wrote in their renewed request to exempt him from the rule.
“As a new school year approaches, his family is now forced to choose between two agonizing options: send John back to public school, where he will experience discrimination, including discipline, or keep him home, where he will continue to miss out on the academic and developmental benefits of an in-person education,” reads the request dated July 10.
The student’s parents opted to send him back to public school. He began ninth grade last Wednesday, one day after the ruling required his Berkeley County high school to let him use the boys’ bathroom, according to legal filings.
The court’s Aug. 12 decision “is a powerful affirmation that every student deserves to be treated with respect and humanity,” said Ronald Patane, board chair of LGBTQ+ rights group Alliance for Full Acceptance, in a statement. “We are grateful the court recognized this young person’s right to exist and learn as themselves.”
After the budget rule took effect last summer, administrators at Cane Bay Middle School in Summerville told the transgender student when classes started that he needed to use the girls’ restroom or the single-stall bathroom in the nurse’s office, according to legal filings.
No student had complained about the student using the boys’ bathroom, according to legal filings.
But the budget clause put Berkeley County School District at risk of losing more than $74 million if administrators didn’t comply, according to state Department of Education data.
When the student continued using the boys’ bathroom, he received a daylong suspension, with the threat of expulsion. To enforce the rule, teachers began monitoring which bathroom the student used, according to the lawsuit.
Other students began bullying the student over his gender identity, causing him to drop out of school and enroll instead in online classes, which he often skipped because he wasn’t engaged with his online courses, his attorneys said.
The student’s parents have been homeschooling him. But he missed the social parts of in-person public school, leading them to reenroll him despite concerns that he wouldn’t be able to use the bathroom of his choosing, according to legal filings.
In their response, the state and school district wrote that the student’s problems were due to disobeying the directive. The district offered the student an alternative, but he chose not to use it, the attorneys argued.
They also argued any bullying wasn’t due to the budget clause. The student had been open about his transgender identity, so his classmates already knew. The bathroom question didn’t reveal anything, according to state and district attorneys.
SC senators approve K-12 mandate that ‘a boy will use the boys’ bathroom’

Attorneys for the student and his family argued the budget clause violated transgender students’ constitutional rights to equal protection, as well as federal laws that prohibit discrimination. The attorneys pointed repeatedly to a 2020 case out of Virginia, in which the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court’s ruling allowing a transgender student to use the bathroom and locker room of his choice.
But in a July 23 order, a federal judge declined to block South Carolina’s law, citing recent and upcoming rulings from the U.S. Supreme Court.
In June, the high court upheld a Tennessee law banning gender-transitioning medical treatments for transgender minors. That brought into question how judges should consider all cases involving transgender youth, U.S. District Judge Richard Gergel wrote last month.
And the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to consider a West Virginia case asking whether transgender students should be able to play sports on the team of their choosing, which could further complicate matters, Gergel wrote.
Justices’ decision on that case “has the potential of bringing clarity and providing guidance” as to how to proceed in the South Carolina case, Gergel wrote. Any decision in the meantime could lead to a “‘yo-yo’ effect,” in which the courts go back and forth based on various rulings, he continued.
Last week’s decision by the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals overturned Gergel’s decision for the Berkeley County student only. A full explanation for the decision is pending. It has not yet been filed, according to court documents.
Sen. Wes Climer, who proposed the budget clause, said he was hopeful the U.S. Supreme Court would overturn the appeals court’s decision, or that the court might change its mind.
“The 4th Circuit’s decision is disappointing, but at least it is narrow in its application,” the Rock Hill Republican said.
Climer said he proposed the budget clause to protect students, particularly girls, from having to share a bathroom or locker room with a classmate who’s biologically different. That’s “basic common sense,” he said.
The rule applies to multi-stalled school restrooms and places where students undress, to include “changing facilities” in gyms. It also specifies that during overnight school trips, students of different genders can’t sleep in the same room or use the same multi-occupancy bathroom — unless they’re siblings.
When legislators return to Columbia in January, Climer plans to renew a push for a bill that would make the budget clause permanent state law, he said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/locker-room-.jpg,,,2025-08-19 18:58:24.336369

More specifics on how the plan will roll out are expected before the end of the month, according to Agency of Natural Resources Secretary Julie Moore, who sent an email to her staff on Monday.

As news of an upcoming return-to-office plan reverberated within state government this month, the leader of at least one Vermont agency has looked to quiet the concerns of its employees.
In an all-staff email sent Monday, Agency of Natural Resources Secretary Julie Moore told employees that the expected changes did not reflect on the professionalism or quality of their work. 
But she indicated more in-office time could bring positive changes and urged staff to remain calm while details are developed. 
“I understand this creates real challenges for many, and those concerns are valid. At the same time, this directive comes from the governor’s office as part of broader policy decisions about how state government operates,” Moore wrote. “I need everyone to focus on solutions rather than resistance, understanding that work arrangements can and do change, and our response must remain professional even when changes are unwelcome.”

Earlier this month, Gov. Phil Scott first signaled his intention to bring state employees back to the office on a hybrid basis. That move prompted Agency of Administration Secretary Sarah Clark to write to all state employees, assuring them that the plans are only in their early stages and will develop with input across departments.  
But more details may arrive in the next two weeks. According to Moore, the Agency of Administration plans to share the timeline of the proposal and the number of in-office days expected by the end of the month. 
Covid-19 transformed how the state did business, shifting work from downtown offices to video calls. Years later, some of the state’s more than 8,000 employees have started increasing their in-person presence, but remote work remains prevalent. For many, work location is handled on a case-by-case basis, according to the Vermont State Employees’ Association, the union representing the workforce.
On Tuesday, Steve Howard, the union’s executive director, said members have thus far overwhelmingly opposed the idea of returning to the office. Some people were hired under assurances that they could work remotely, he said, and may live 90 minutes from their potential offices. 
“We’re hearing a lot from people who are saying how am I going to be able to pick my child up from child care,” he said. 
Howard pointed to California, where the state auditor’s office determined a new hybrid return-to-office plan had not been fully studied by the governor, and that partial remote work would save millions of dollars. California’s governor refuted those findings.  
It’s unclear how all Vermont agencies are handling the early stage discussions about a hybrid schedule. A spokesperson for the Vermont Agency of Education said the agency would keep its employees up to date but was still awaiting more details. The Agency of Human Services and Agency of Agriculture did not respond to requests for comment.

Moore said she first communicated with staff about the governor’s proposal earlier this month and welcomed feedback from employees. 
Last week, the Department of Environmental Conservation, which is housed in the Agency of Natural Resources, hosted a “coffee talk” where Moore said she heard from more staff.
“The tone was moving in an unhelpful direction, I felt,” she said.
A more balanced approach to in-office time would strengthen relationships between employees who may work for different teams or departments, according to Moore.  
“For me, there is something that I think we are in the process of losing,” she told VTDigger, adding that the agency also has customer-facing responsibilities that benefit from being in-person, such as reviewing state permits.
Of the agency’s roughly 650 full-time, year-round employees, about two-thirds have telework agreements that allow them to set flexible schedules, working remotely up to 40 hours per week, according to Moore. Generally, teams and programs have at least one in-office day per month, she said. 
Natural resource staff are already making suggestions about how to optimize the changes, Moore said, like increasing Green Mountain Transit buses and designating quiet and collaborative spaces in the office. 
As long as the conversation is constructive, Moore said she’s willing to discuss the impending proposal — just not whether it should be implemented at all.  
“At the end of the day, that’s a decision the governor has made,” she said, “and it’s not up for discussion.”

Stock photo by Greenleaf123/Getty Images)Police did not act improperly when an officer gained access to the phone of an individual detained for kidnapping, sex assault, and other serious charges after watching the man enter his cellphone passcode and committing it to memory, a New Jersey appeals court ruled Tuesday.
Tyrone Ellison, who was arrested and convicted after kidnapping a minor with substance abuse issues from a Newark hospital, had no reasonable expectation of privacy when he unlocked his phone while in police custody and under the supervision of a detective, the court ruled.
“There was no violation of defendant’s Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination where defendant voluntarily requested his cell phone, was not compelled to provide the passcode and voluntarily entered the passcode in the officer’s presence,” the judges wrote.
Police could not leave Ellison unattended with his phone without risking him deleting evidence, the ruling adds.
The judges said prior case law that found an arrestee maintained a reasonable expectation of privacy when making a call from a police station without being told that call may be monitored or recorded does not apply to Ellison’s case.
Ellison, the judges wrote, was aware of the detective’s presence when entering his passcode, did not attempt to conceal his password, and was not stopped from concealing his passcode from police.
“There was no deception or trickery used to obtain defendant’s passcode. Nor did the police orchestrate the situation to induce defendant to reveal the passcode,” the court wrote. 
In effect, Ellison’s expectation of privacy vanished when he chose to unlock his phone in the presence of police, the court found.
A divided New Jersey Supreme Court in 2020 ruled in Andrews v. New Jersey that while the Fifth Amendment presumptively protects individuals’ passcodes, they can be compelled to reveal them under the foregone conclusion exception to the amendment. That exception allows the compelled disclosure of documents and passcodes as long as authorities know they exist and the individual subject to the warrant knows and possesses them.
Tuesday’s ruling says another doctrine that allows authorities to use improperly obtained information if it would have inevitably come into their possession through proper channels would have allowed police to use the passcode even if it was initially obtained improperly.
Police obtained a communications data warrant to search the phone and could have obtained an order to compel Ellison to disclose his passcode, the judges wrote.
“Once the passcode was compelled, law enforcement would have been able to access the contents of the phone,” the judges wrote.
The New Jersey Office of the Public Defender represented Ellison. Alison Perrone, deputy of the office’s appellate section, called the ruling concerning and said her office will ask the New Jersey Supreme Court to review the case.
“The ability of law enforcement to observe and later use a person’s private phone passcode while in custody presents serious questions about constitutional rights in the digital era,” Perrone said in a statement.

(Photo by Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird is calling on the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in a joint letter to take emergency action to schedule a drug that has been linked to deaths in the state and across the country.
Bromazolam is described in the letter penned by Sunday and 20 other state attorneys general as a “designer Xanax.” The prosecutors say the drug is increasingly contributing to overdose deaths and posing a growing threat to public health. It is also highly potent and unpredictable, Pennsylvania Attorney General Dave Sunday’s office wrote, especially when mixed with opioids. Narcan, which is used to reverse an overdose, is ineffective against the drug in such emergencies.
Bromazolam is unscheduled under the federal Controlled Substances Act.
“Despite its clear dangers, bromazolam remains unscheduled at the federal level, creating significant challenges for law enforcement and public health officials trying to respond to this emerging crisis,” the attorneys generals wrote. “Without scheduling, this drug continues to evade traditional regulatory and prosecutorial tools, hindering interdiction efforts and enabling continued distribution through illicit channels.”
“Taking emergency action to schedule bromazolam will help law enforcement remove it from circulation, give prosecutors the tools to hold traffickers accountable, and send a clear signal that this dangerous substance has no place on our streets,” the attorneys general wrote.
“Bromazolam, or ‘Designer Xanax’ is a lethal, counterfeit drug with no medical use that is highly addictive and killing Americans,” Bird said in a statement. “It is already an illegal drug in Iowa, and I strongly urge the DEA to take swift and definite action at the federal level to give law enforcement the tools they need to stop this crisis, save lives, and hold traffickers accountable.”

Smith Entertainment Group, the owner of Utah’s NBA and NHL franchises announced on Tuesday a partnership with Live Nation Entertainment to build the new venue, the first of many major announcements for the heart of the state-created downtown sports, entertainment, culture, and convention center district.

“Once the transformation of Delta Center was underway, partnering with Live Nation on what a world-class concert venue could look like in downtown became a top priority. Not only will it bring the best artists in the world to Utah, but it will also bring a million people downtown to experience Salt Lake City every year,” Ryan Smith, chair and CEO of Smith Entertainment Group said in a statement.
Both Smith Entertainment Group and Live Nation will commit “considerable financial investment” for the project, Smith said.  
The announcement comes after Salt Lake City’s approval of a 0.5% sales tax increase to gather $900 million mostly to renovate the Delta Center to equip it to host hockey games, but also to redevelop three downtown blocks. That was part of a plan drawn by a 2024 law that allowed Salt Lake City to help fund renovations to the Delta Center and an enhanced downtown. 



Let us know what you think...


 


The new development is considerably smaller than its neighboring Delta Center, which is able to accommodate 12,000 to 19,000 attendees in Salt Lake City and will continue hosting concerts and other entertainment events “while the new venue will serve artists seeking a best-in-class, mid-size indoor option,” according to a news release.
Smith Entertainment Group expects to host 200 events a year, including 100 concerts and other corporate, conference and community events.
The venue is also part of a Live Nation national expansion in sports and entertainment districts, adding to the MGM Music Hall at Boston’s Fenway Park and other similar projects in Pittsburgh, Indianapolis and Atlanta.
“Utah is a great market for live music, and Smith Entertainment Group is the right partner to help us deliver a world-class venue to fans in Salt Lake City,” Michael Rapino, CEO of Live Nation said in a statement. “SEG’s incredible vision for the downtown district aligns with our mission to expand access to live music.”

(Photo courtesy of Anne Tuchelski)The scale of damage in Milwaukee County left behind after unprecedented flooding last week is beginning to come into view. Over 300 volunteers from the county’s Office of Emergency Management (OEM), Wisconsin Emergency Management (WEM), and local partner organizations have assessed  3,434 homes for property damage from a storm that brought upwards of 10 inches of rain to some areas. As of Monday, 53% of the homes inspected have been categorized as “destroyed” or having sustained “major damage.” Public infrastructure has sustained more than $34 million in damage, according to preliminary evaluations 
Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley thanked local agencies for assisting in recovery and damage assessment efforts in a press statement Tuesday. 
“I joined our damage assessment teams in the community last week and spoke directly with residents affected by flooding,” Crowley said. “I’ve heard your stories, your challenges, and your calls for help. But I also heard your resilience and witnessed neighbors helping one another. That spirit of service is what defines Milwaukee.”

The Wisconsin Department of Military Affairs announced Tuesday that teams from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will arrive Thursday to visit communities, accompanied by state personnel. The teams will verify damage. Teams will interview homeowners, renters and business owners to document property damage and the impact of the storms and flooding. Their work will help determine the extent of damage and inform the state’s request for federal assistance.
“The safety and well-being of Wisconsin residents is our top priority,” said Gov. Tony Evers in a press statement. “These severe storms have caused significant hardship, and we are committed to ensuring that those affected receive the support they need. The collaboration between state and federal agencies through this damage assessment process is critical to unlocking the resources necessary for recovery.”
After FEMA completes a preliminary damage assessment, the agency’s regional administrator will make a recommendation on whether the president should declare a disaster, allowing for federal disaster assistance to be sent to Milwaukee County and other Southeast Wisconsin communities. 
Over 12,000 calls have been made to 211 in Milwaukee County, and residents are encouraged to continue reporting damage to that number or to make an online damage report here. The data will be used to persuade the Trump administration that Milwaukee requires federal assistance. 
Community and local government organizations are continuing cleanup efforts, and volunteers are encouraged to register at Crisis Cleanup, a program providing free service to those in need. Emergency shelters established by the Red Cross have also served dozens of residents displaced by the flood. The Milwaukee Health Department is reminding people to assume any standing water in the street or around homes is contaminated with sewage, and to avoid the spread of mold in homes, which can be harmful to health. 
The Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection is also advising that people seek “trustworthy” contractors, and to keep an eye out for scammers. “Vulnerable consumers are often targeted by scammers,” said department Secretary Randy Romanski. “Property owners should stay alert and that quick and easy fixes may be too good to be true.” People should especially be cautious of door-to-door crews which use “high pressure tactics to solicit business”, the department warns.
The rain that  fell overnight on Aug. 9 overwhelmed roads, highways, and neighborhoods. Many people were forced to abandon their cars on the roads as the water rapidly rose. Firefighters worked to rescue people whose homes had become inundated, as residents were forced to brave the downpour to check on vulnerable loved ones.

In Wauwatosa, Hart Park looked as if it was underwater, and wetland habitats in the County Grounds natural area were swallowed by water and became small lakes. The Wisconsin State Fair closed early as rain fell, pooling water to knee or waist level as people waded to their cars. Local dumps have seen lines of cars stretching down the block, and filled with damaged furniture, clothing, and equipment. 
Some Milwaukee residents expressed that they didn’t feel the city was prepared for the level of flooding. Researchers  have long-warned that climate change would bring more intense rainfall and greater risks of floods in Wisconsin. In 2020, it was estimated that 273,400 homes in Wisconsin were at substantial risk of flooding, nearly twice what FEMA estimated. 
Flooding also severely affected other parts of southeastern Wisconsin. State agencies warned that following the floods, the Waukesha County dam was at a high risk of failure, and would need to be reinforced. 
FEMA teams have also been inspecting other communities in southeastern Wisconsin. The Wisconsin National Guard was also deployed to parts of the state, assisting with rescue and recovery efforts, and providing specialized vehicle support. 
Greg Engle, the WEM administrator, said on WISN Channel 12’s “UpFront” program Sunday that federal assistance was likely to take time.

FEMA’s help is “going to be critical because we don’t have a similar program here in the state,” Engle said, adding that, “we want to get that assistance to our families and folks in Wisconsin, but I will say it’s not immediate.” 
Engle said that state teams are working as quickly as they can, and that the FEMA Region 5 team from Chicago has been helpful, and federal personnel have embedded with the state emergency management agency to provide support with planning and training. 
“We expect they’re going to be very supportive, but I cannot guarantee that we’ll get approved for a disaster declaration,” he said. 
Asked Tuesday about the ongoing flood recovery efforts and the possibility of FEMA sending assistance, Sen. Tammy Baldwin replied that “confident and Trump administration are two phrases that I don’t necessarily always put in a sentence together.”
Baldwin said that she believes that “the president has said very disparaging things about FEMA before the start of his term. He even talked about abolishing FEMA and the responsibility should gravitate towards the states after a natural disaster. He’s changed his tune as he’s wont to do, especially after the Texas flooding, so I want to keep his feet on the fire, hold him accountable as we face significant damage in Southeastern Wisconsin.”
The senator described touring communities to see the damage first hand and pledged to continue pushing Trump to send federal aid to Wisconsin.",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1184f171-bd96-418c-9b74-77a06ee281a9-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-08-19 18:58:24.336369

After leading the Onion City for seven years, Lott is resigning as of Sept. 15. She said she is expecting her first child and is looking forward to a new chapter in her life.

Winooski’s Mayor Kristin Lott announced Tuesday she would be stepping down as of Sept.15. She is expecting her first child and said she is looking forward to prepare for a new chapter in her life.
“This was not an easy decision — the seven years I have served my neighbors has been the honor of a lifetime,” Lott stated in a press release. 
Deputy Mayor Thomas Renner will serve as interim mayor for the rest of Lott’s term, which ends March 2027. Winooskie residents will elect a new leader next Town Meeting Day.
Lott, 40, who is from Michigan, came to Vermont in 2009 and has lived in the Onion City since, she said. She served on the City Council before she was elected mayor in March 2018, beating fellow council member Eric Covey.
At the time, she said she was excited to be the first woman to be mayor of Vermont’s most diverse city. She draws an annual stipend of $17,000 for the volunteer position.

Lott first got involved in government when she volunteered to be on the housing commission in 2017 “just to be a part of problem solving around housing issues and to be more connected, more engaged in my community,” she told VTDigger on Tuesday.
And community seems to have become the cornerstone of her term there. She has reached out and participated with residents at various levels – from building ties with the local mosque to joining a clean-up crew to pick up dog waste.
“Local government, it’s supposed to be by the people, for the people,” said Lott. She sought to hear directly from constituents and plugged the feedback back into the system to make decisions that benefitted the community, she said.
“Kristine was good about connecting with and listening to a wide range of community members, which is such an important aspect of governing,” City Manager Elaine Wang wrote in an email. “With me, as the Mayor is Council’s liaison to the City Manager and staff, she struck a great balance between acting as a partner while maintaining the authority of Council.”

Wang said she first met Lott for a chat in a local cafe in 2022. Lott had just been hired after a nationwide search but hadn’t started work yet. 
“She signaled a good mix of high expectations, yet interest in being supportive, which was buoying me as a first-time manager,” Wang stated.
The community engagement is what Lott remains most proud of.
In her first year as mayor, Lott said she visited the local mosque to foster a relationship that has lasted, and joined a downtown riverbank cleanup where volunteers cleared dog poop from the area. 
“I was really interested in just doing more community engagement and adding more transparency and outreach. And I think we certainly have made improvements there,” she said. “That has been really rewarding for me, to build more relationships and see more people engaged in local government.”
Mukhtar Abdullahi recalled meeting Lott at the Islamic Community Center of Vermont during her visits, where she always wore a head covering.
“A lot of people come to us, most of the time they’re looking for something,” he said. “For her, she comes in, she makes eye contact, respects the people, listens to them, never interrupts. She’s a wonderful, wonderful human being.”
As a Somali and Mai Mai language liaison in the Winooski School District and a prevention educator at Winooski Partnership for Prevention, Abdullahi said he has crossed paths with Lott many times since, and that she has either helped directly or guided the community in the right direction. 
Lott has always been welcoming, supportive and accessible, even on short notice, he said, so he is sad to see her go.
Renner, who is about to step into Lott’s role, wrote in an email he has enjoyed her mentorship and will miss serving by her in the council chambers.
“Kristine is a dedicated public servant who has spent years working to make Winooski an incredible place to live, visit, and work,” Renner wrote, adding he is happy her expertise is just a phone call away.
Lott highlighted several achievements in Winooski during her term — from closing out the 20-year Tax Increment Financing debt that has helped invest in essential services, to zoning regulations that have led to more affordable and family-friendly housing amid a statewide housing crisis. 
As she leaves behind multiple ongoing projects — the Main Street revitalization that’s expected to be completed this year, for instance — Lott said she feels good about leaving the council and interim mayor “in a good position” to keep advancing this year’s priorities and the upcoming budget process.  
She hopes they will “continue the focus on deep community engagement in the decision making process,” she said.
“While I’ll always care deeply about public service and what comes next for this incredible community I call home, it is the right decision to focus my priorities and energy on family, career, and personal life,” she stated in the release.

(Photo by Bill Lucia/Washington State Standard)Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson swiped back Tuesday in response to threats from U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi to condition federal funding and potentially prosecute officials if they fail to cooperate with the Trump administration on immigration enforcement.
“You are hereby notified that Washington State will not be bullied or intimidated by threats and legally baseless accusations,” Ferguson, a Democrat, wrote in a sharply-worded letter.
In a letter to Ferguson last week, Bondi wrote that federal, state and local law enforcement have long cooperated, including on immigration enforcement.
“For too long, so-called sanctuary jurisdiction policies have undermined this necessary cooperation and obstructed federal immigration enforcement, giving aliens cover to perpetrate crimes in our communities and evade the immigration consequences that federal law requires,” she wrote.
Her letter threatens to hold back “grants, contract, and federal funds” from jurisdictions that she believes violate federal immigration law. 
She also said officials in these places could be prosecuted criminally. 
Washington is among about three dozen states, counties and cities nationwide that received such a warning from Bondi, who President Donald Trump appointed. Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell also received one. Bondi gave recipients until Tuesday to respond.
Ferguson, the former three-term attorney general, retorted that the threat of prosecution “embarrasses and disgraces” Bondi’s office, adding that he didn’t have this “on my bingo card” as governor. 
He delivered his response in a press conference Tuesday at the state Capitol alongside more than four dozen state leaders and advocates.
The developments of the past week bring immigration tensions between the two Washingtons to a head after months of circling each other on this issue, as Trump has sought to use any means necessary to increase deportations. A spokesperson for the governor confirmed the two letters are the extent of the communication between Ferguson and Bondi on this issue.

The state law at the center of the dispute has also faced scrutiny from congressional Republicans after Attorney General Nick Brown used it to sue an eastern Washington county over allegations its sheriff’s office cooperated with federal immigration agents.
In an interview Monday, Brown said he takes these ultimatums seriously, even if he doesn’t think they have much merit.
“I think we have to also just pause and recognize for a moment that we have the attorney general of the United States and the president threatening independently elected officials,” Brown said. “That’s really scary, and we shouldn’t get numb.”
The law and the backlash
Washington’s Democratic lawmakers passed the Keep Washington Working Act in 2019, limiting information sharing and collaboration between local police and federal immigration enforcement. 
For example, police can’t provide nonpublic personal information to federal authorities investigating civil immigration cases, and can’t interview or detain people solely based on questions about their immigration status. 
Police also aren’t allowed to ask about their immigration status except in rare cases. Democrats say the goal is to focus limited policing resources on local public safety. 
One exception is that the state Department of Corrections is allowed to ask about immigration status and tell U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement when people will be released from prison. In February, Ferguson said he wouldn’t close that gap, despite calls from immigration advocates.
On Tuesday, he said Washington is a welcoming community for immigrants and refugees while also complying with federal law. 
Even with Washington’s barriers, the Trump administration has still sharply increased civil immigration arrests here, according to data culled by researchers. Arrests in June, around 290, were at least double any month since Trump reclaimed the presidency in January. Arrests dropped about 25% in July, the preliminary data shows, but still outpaced the usual rate.
Trump has long threatened to withhold federal funding from cities and states with laws like Washington’s that won’t aid in his vision for mass deportations. He issued similar warnings during his first term in the White House.
Bondi’s Department of Justice has sued Illinois, New York City and others over their policies. A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit against Illinois, Chicago and Cook County last month, finding that the Trump administration couldn’t show their sanctuary policies violated federal law.

In another case, a federal judge in California in April ordered the administration to stop denying federal funds over immigration enforcement policies, in a lawsuit brought by Seattle, King County and jurisdictions across the country. That preliminary ruling is now under appeal.
King County is not one of the governments targeted by the Department of Justice’s latest effort.

Brown has also already joined in multiple lawsuits against the federal government over attempts to condition federal funding on assisting in immigration efforts. 
He expects to litigate the Keep Washington Working Act with the Trump administration at some point. Ferguson said he doesn’t know what to expect from the federal government, but told Bondi, if they end up in court, to “be advised that we will defeat you and seek all appropriate costs and fees.”
The first-term governor recalled a walk home from elementary school with his daughter in 2017 as he battled the first Trump administration in court as attorney general. She had heard he could get in trouble for taking on the president.
“Katie, look, we’re lucky to live in a country, right, where your dad, or any American, can speak out against the president,” he recalled telling her, “where your dad can file a lawsuit against the president, say things that are pretty direct about that president, be critical, stop him from doing something illegal, and I don’t get in trouble.”
Eight years later, Ferguson said he’s “not so sure about that.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Ferguson-sanctuary-presser-6-1024x654.jpg,,,2025-08-19 17:57:23.739947

A recent National Association of Realtors report found affordability increased slightly from last year, but the typical family is still priced out in the West and Northeast. (Photo by Madison McVan/Minnesota Reformer)Housing became more affordable this June, as higher incomes and slightly lower interest rates overcame higher prices, according to a National Association of Realtors report.
However, the South and the Midwest are the only regions where a family with typical or median income can afford a median-priced house, according to the report. The group considers a mortgage to be affordable if the monthly payment (principal and interest) is 25% or less of the family’s income.



The affordability gap is highest in the West, where the typical family income is $113,783, just over two-thirds of the $164,832 that would be needed to purchase a median-priced home.
The Northeast, where the typical family makes $114,559, is also unaffordable by this measure, as a median-priced home requires an income of $141,264.
In the Midwest, the median family income is $102,419, more than the $86,256 needed to buy a median-priced home. The same is true in the South, where the median income is $97,812, slightly more than the $96,720 required to buy a typical home.
Nationally, affordability increased slightly compared with June of 2024, with the typical family making $105,431, about 94% of the $111,648 it would need to buy the median-priced home. That’s up from about 92% in June 2024.
In a video posted Aug. 15, Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors, said he expects lower interest rates to increase affordability in the months ahead.
“We know that mortgage rates will be coming down and that will bring additional buyers into the market. We just need to make sure we have more supply, more supply to meet that demand,” Yun said.

Police said Tuesday they were awaiting autopsy results to determine the cause and manner of death of the man, who they declined to identify.

A man who police said was assaulted and injured near City Hall Park in Burlington, allegedly by a group of teens a week ago, has died, interim Burlington Police Chief Shawn Burke confirmed Tuesday morning.
News of the man’s death had previously been reported on news sites and on social media. 
Burke said that he was still awaiting autopsy results determining the cause and manner of the man’s death. The chief declined to provide the man’s name or any other details surrounding the man’s death.
Officers on foot patrol around 1:30 p.m. on Aug. 11 in City Hall Park in Burlington came upon an assault taking place involving several people on Church Street near the park, according to a press release issued last week by Burlington Police. 
“As the Officers approached, the group fled on foot and by bicycle,” the release stated. “Officers were able to chase and apprehend three juveniles who were involved in the assault.”
The juveniles were later issued citations to appear in Chittenden County Superior family court, the release stated. Juvenile court matters are heard behind closed doors. 
Because the matter involved juveniles, Burke said he could not provide additional information, including their ages. He also declined to discuss what may have prompted the incident. 
“That’s all germane to the investigation, and we have to preserve the integrity of that,” the police chief said. 
One of the teens arrested had a firearm, according to the release, and “further investigation revealed the firearm having been displayed during the assault of the victim.”  
The injured person, who police described as an adult man, was taken to the University of Vermont Medical Center in Burlington for treatment for serious injuries, the release stated.
The police chief said the investigation was continuing and that there may be additional arrests.

However, the South and the Midwest are the only regions where a family with typical or median income can afford a median-priced house, according to the report. The group considers a mortgage to be affordable if the monthly payment (principal and interest) is 25% or less of the family’s income.



The affordability gap is highest in the West, where the typical family income is $113,783, just over two-thirds of the $164,832 that would be needed to purchase a median-priced home.
The Northeast, where the typical family makes $114,559, is also unaffordable by this measure, as a median-priced home requires an income of $141,264.
In the Midwest, the median family income is $102,419, more than the $86,256 needed to buy a median-priced home. The same is true in the South, where the median income is $97,812, slightly more than the $96,720 required to buy a typical home.
Nationally, affordability increased slightly compared with June of 2024, with the typical family making $105,431, about 94% of the $111,648 it would need to buy the median-priced home. That’s up from about 92% in June 2024.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)For the past three months, pedestrians on the tree-lined walking path on Providence’s Blackstone Boulevard could look across the street and see Butler Hospital’s striking workers marching up and down the picket line.
The hospital’s approximately 720 members of SEIU 1199NE who walked off the job on May 15 are going back to work, after 99% of participating members voted Monday night to approve a new four-year contract with their employer and the hospital’s owner, Care New England (CNE).  
“I will enjoy being back inside,” Dan Camp, a Butler employee, said in a phone interview Tuesday morning. “But I gotta say, I got a nice tan while I was out there.”
The tentative agreement between the union, SEIU 1199NE, and Care New England, the psychiatric facility’s owner, was announced Sunday evening. It replaces the four contracts that expired in March and covered unionized nurses, social workers, technicians, environmental service staff and clerical workers.  
A complete copy of the contract was not immediately available Tuesday, but among the highlights are:

A $20-an-hour wage floor for workers across the unionized groups, which is guaranteed for all workers by the end of the four-year deal. Full-time workers will see their pay increase by at least $6,000 in the first year.
Health benefits will remain intact, and the hospital agrees to control costs for its Health Savings Accounts (HSAs). 
Retirement and pension benefits are preserved. 
Concerns about worker safety amid an increasing amount of violence from patients crystallized into a jointly funded “time bank” that will provide financial support to employees injured on the job, ensuring they can supplement workers’ compensation without losing income. 

Union members said the strike, purported to be the longest hospital labor action in state history, dragged on because the hospital’s offers left the lowest-paid employees — including dietary and clerical staff — earning about $18 an hour. That figure would not suffice for a livable wage in Rhode Island, the union argued, and worker solidarity kept employees of all pay grades on the picket line.
For employees like Camp, who now works in the call center of the psychiatric facility but started in one of the lowest-paid departments, dietary services, the deal represents equity.
“That’s always been a priority to make sure that from top to bottom, everyone gets what they need,” Camp said.
During the walkout, Care New England shuttered three units at Butler, cutting the psychiatric hospital’s operations to roughly half of its 197-bed capacity. 
Courtney Threats, a social worker and a member of the bargaining committee, said the union will soon meet with hospital leadership to discuss a phased return to work. She said workers want to “get back sooner rather than later, so that we can resume caring for our patients who we’ve missed and we’re eager to return to.”

A week ago, Threats spoke to the media in what turned out to be the final union press conference, and noted that bargaining sessions the week before had fizzled once more, even with federal mediators present. On its website two days later, the hospital stated that union leaders were mischaracterizing events and ultimately misleading the press and the public.
What changed in seven days? 
The protracted labor dispute was resolved in part because of Rhode Island House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi, said Threats. 
Asked if Shekarchi had tipped the scales in favor of the union, Threats said, “Absolutely, absolutely.”
The speaker’s spokesperson Larry Berman said in an email Tuesday that Shekarchi personally convened both sides’ leaders after negotiations continued to collapse, hosting bargaining sessions in his State House office and other locations.
“Sometimes in tough negotiations an outside voice helps bring the parties together,” Shekarchi said in a statement. “Rhode Island’s health care system needs Butler Hospital to be fully operational.  Under the agreement patients will again be able to access all the mental health care services offered at Butler, frontline workers will earn better compensation, the hospital will have more predictability, and there will be increased collaboration on workplace safety. Everyone wins moving forward!”
One accusation leveled by Care New England leadership, including its CEO Michael Wagner, was that union leadership puppeteered the strike and made it longer than it needed to be.
Threats had a different interpretation of union leaders.
“They taught us a lot about ourselves,” Threats said. “When we walked out on May 15, we were colleagues, many of us not knowing one another. And when we return, we’re returning as a family.”
Butler’s costs compromised Care New England’s gains
The union may be emerging from the strike stronger than before, but the hospital — which comprises 10 acres, 37 buildings, and 578,300 square feet — helped incur a $4.4 million loss because of temporary staffing costs used to keep Butler operating during the labor stoppage.
That reverses more positive news for Care New England’s finances from earlier this year — specifically, its bonds issued through the quasi-public Rhode Island Health and Educational Building Corporation, which are backed by the hospital system’s revenues — a common arrangement for nonprofit hospitals that cannot trade publicly on the stock market.










Everyone wins moving forward!


– Rhode Island House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi on the new agreement between Butler Hospital and its unionized workers with SEIU 1199NE


On May 5, just 10 days before the Butler strike began, Fitch’s Ratings upgraded Care New England’s bonds and noted the company’s tighter control of costs, improved revenue, and a slim but improving operating margin. After years of losses, CNE’s balance sheet looked positive, Fitch’s stated.
The strike toppled these projections, according to the third quarter finance report recently issued by Care New England for the nine-month period ending June 30. CNE’s top line grew during this time, and by the end of June, the company had collected $63.7 million in patient service revenue, an increase of 7.1% compared to the previous year. Other revenue sources climbed about 16% from the year prior, a total increase of $25.6 million.   
The expense side of the ledger was less encouraging. Spending on Butler replacement staff contributed to the health system’s overall operating costs ballooning to $95.1 million, a 9% increase year-over-year. 
“It should also be noted that prior to the third quarter of fiscal year 2025, Care New England had generated eight consecutive quarters of generating positive operating income,” the report reads.
As for contract negotiations, Care New England is not done with those either. More than 4,500 employees are union members across its properties. According to the third quarter report, two more unionized workforces — including the SEIU-represented visiting nurses association — had contracts expire earlier this year, with negotiations still underway as of the third quarter report. There are also three new contracts being forged with the Committee on Interns and Residents in multiple Care New England facilities.
The two largest unions with Care New England are currently covered. At Women & Infants Hospital, SEIU workers who were briefly enlisted into the Butler scuffle in July are covered through May 2027 by a contract created last year. Kent Hospital has 1,400 nurses and professionals under a contract set to expire until 2029, though wages and outsourcing can be renegotiated in 2026.

Loose threads from Blackstone Boulevard
Accolades for the strikes’ resolution arrived quickly. Gov. Dan McKee’s praise came in a Monday night email issued alongside AFL-CIO President Patrick Crowley, one of the state’s top union leaders. 
Rhode Island’s entire U.S. congressional delegation — Sens. Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse, and Reps. Seth Magaziner and Gabe Amo — issued a joint statement Tuesday applauding the contract, while simultaneously jabbing at President Donald Trump’s administration.
“The deal reached this week respects the heroic work that the nurses, mental health professionals, and staff at Butler Hospital do each day for Rhode Island patients in the dangerous environment of looming Republican Medicaid and Medicare cuts,” the delegates wrote.
Meanwhile, state labor regulators are still unwinding the legal saga sparked during the strike. Department of Labor and Training spokesperson Edwine Paul confirmed Tuesday that a lockout case in Rhode Island Supreme Court tied to the strike has automatically entered the appeals process, as both parties appealed. Paul said the Board of Review will examine the case next, after which point either party can decide to continue the appeals.
As for the now defunct picket line on Blackstone Boulevard, Providence mayoral spokesperson Josh Estrella said the total municipal costs associated with the strike were $398,266, which includes a police detail that had a constant presence alongside strikers, waving motorists in and out the long driveway leading up to the Butler campus.
Now Blackstone Boulevard will be a little quieter with the strikers gone. But not that much quieter: Noise violations issued early in the strike, with six as of mid June, stopped as the strike lingered on. 
“There were no additional noise violations issued at this location,” Estrella said.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Family, Florida legislative figures past and present, and Florida State University stakeholders honored the life of John Thrasher Tuesday in an ceremony representing his lifetime of service to the Sunshine State. 
Former Gov. Jeb Bush, Thrasher’s successor President Richard McCullough, and children and grandchildren were among those who eulogized the former Florida House Speaker and senator who died in May at the age of 81.
Inside the Ruby Diamond Concert Hall on FSU’s campus, Thrasher was recalled for his kindness, mercy, and gentleness. 
“If you knew him, you loved him, and chances are he loved you right back,” Julie Weinberg, Thrasher’s daughter, said. “Looking around this room today, it’s clear how many people called him a friend.”
Thrasher’s wife of 60 years, Jean Thrasher, said she remembers him as a “sweet man.”
“He never gave up hope and he never complained, he gave us comfort when we all needed it most,” she said.
Thrasher died about a month after announcing a cancer diagnosis.
Record
Thrasher was president of FSU from 2014 through 2021, the culmination of a lengthy legislative career that began with him lobbying for the Florida Medical Association and eventually led him to serve in both chambers of the Florida Legislature.
He served in the Florida Senate, starting in 2009 and leaving in 2014, and in the Florida House for eight years, starting in 1992 and terming out in 2000. Thrasher was speaker of the chamber for his last two years. 
Former House Speaker and FSU President John Thrasher dies at 81

Bush recalled the record of Florida’s government under Thrasher’s speakership, during the first two of Bush’s eight years in office. Thrasher’s policies, Bush said, “became the building block for a generation of conservative governance.”
“We now live in a world where owning the other side through social media, going on cable news is the way that you measure your sense of accomplishment. You know what? I thank God I got to work with John Thrasher in an era where getting stuff done mattered a lot more than virtue signaling,” Bush said to a round of applause.

Bush called Thrasher the “godfather” of FSU’s medical school, the establishment of which was a priority for the former speaker.
“For a guy who as successful at everything he did,” Bush said, listing all Thrasher’s titles, “John Thrasher had one of the smallest egos — not just among politicians, which are known for ego, but out of everyone. He always deflected praise and shared the credit for success.” Bush called him the “epitome of a servant leader.”
“When things didn’t go according to plan, he took the blame, even if it wasn’t his fault,” Bush said. 
The service was led by David Swanson, pastor of First Presbyterian church of Orlando. It featured musical performances from an FSU choral ensemble and the FSU hymn by the school’s marching band.

FSU
Thrasher was a double alumnus of the school he led, earning his bachelor’s and law degrees from FSU. In between the two degrees, he served in the U.S. Army and received two Bronze Stars for his service in Vietnam and the Army Commendation Medal in Germany. 
Thrasher co-founded The Southern Group, a lobbying firm, too. 
He served on the faculty of the FSU College of Law. In 2010 and 2011 he was chair of the Republican Party of Florida. 
“John made sure that every student that came to Florida State University had a chance to succeed,” McCullough said. 
Ed Burr, who served on the FSU Board of Trustees during much of Thrasher’s tenure, recalled the impressiveness of Thrasher’s responses to the 2014 shooting at Strozier Library shortly after he became president, the death of a fraternity brother after a hazing incident in 2017, and an off-campus shooting that killed a student in 2018.
“I remember when I came here, I had many people, but the ones that really got [to me] were the students telling me that I had very large shoes to fill, and indeed, I had very large shoes to fill,” McCullough said. 
Speakers echoed that Thrasher often credited his successes to God, wife Jean, and FSU, in that order. 
“His schedule never kept [him] from stopping to engage others — student, faculty member, legislator, or a groundskeeper,” Kyle Clark, FSU’s senior vice president for finance and administration said. 
“He treated everyone with the same respect, dignity, and kindness. He believed in listening and finding common ground and in making sure every person, whether they agreed with him or not, left the conversation knowing that they mattered and that they were heard.”

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) HARLAN – County supervisors in Shelby and Story counties voted Tuesday to pursue further legal action in their case against Summit Carbon Solutions pertaining to county-specific ordinances on hazardous liquid pipelines.
A U.S. district judge and federal appeals judges have previously ruled on the case in favor of Summit and now the counties are seeking a review of the rulings from the U.S. Supreme Court, though a Summit filing holds the ordinances would still be preempted by state laws.

In Harlan, at the Shelby County Courthouse, landowners opposed to the pipeline gathered to thank the supervisors. 
Sherri Webb, an affected Shelby County landowner, said Iowans across the state look to Shelby County and say “I wish you were our supervisors.” 
“Thank you,” Webb said, noting that it’s no small feat to decide to appear before the Supreme Court. 
“No matter what, I’m behind you guys,” Webb said. 
Another landowner, Jan Norris who lives in Montgomery County and is a neighbor to the pipeline route, called the board a David standing up to a “well-resourced and motivated” Goliath. 
“Your constituents may not know how lucky they are, but I do,” Norris said. “Because my board has chosen to play it safe and avoid the fight.” 
Norris and Webb have been active at their respective county supervisor meetings since they first learned of the Summit project several years ago. The pipeline would connect to biorefineries across the state and transport liquid carbon dioxide through Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, South Dakota and to underground storage in North Dakota. 
The two said the actions of the Board of Supervisors are important for maintaining local control and working toward standards they believe will be safer and better for their properties. 
Norris said if the outcome of the case is reversed and in favor of the counties, it will benefit many Iowa counties, and other states impacted by the pipeline and similar projects. 
“You guys are doing your job and you shouldn’t be sued for doing your job,” Webb said.
Cindy Hansen, who lives in Ankeny but owns affected land in Shelby County with her sister, said the supervisors have restored some of the hope in the state that she had lost from the actions of the Iowa Utilities Commission and state legislators. 
The Shelby County board said the cost of the lawsuits “have mounted,” but have been covered by the county’s insurer, ICAP, and by a fund the board created, shortly after it was sued by Summit in November 2022, that uses American Rescue Plan Act dollars to cover the costs. 
A copy of both counties’ letter of engagement, obtained by Iowa Capital Dispatch, shows fees for the endeavor would be capped at $60,000.
Mike Kolbe, one of the Shelby County board members, said the budget was a consideration in the decision, but with the fund and continued coverage from ICAP, Kolbe said the county can afford it “with no cost to the taxpayers.” 
Bryce Schaben, the chair of the Shelby board, said the feedback he has received from his community showed there was only one way forward. 
“Everything we’ve heard is to do what we did today,” Schaben said following the meeting. “When you get that kind of support, it’s an easy decision.”
Schaben said if the Supreme Court follows the direction of the previous courts on the case, he will be confused. 
“It’s very confusing that the rulings don’t want to make our counties safe,” Schaben said. “That’s what it comes down to.”
Ordinances in both counties established setbacks and permitting requirements for the pipeline company to construct in the county. Summit argued, and a federal judge in the Southern District of Iowa ruled, the ordinances were preempted by federal pipeline safety standards. 
The counties appealed the case, and judges for the Eighth Circuit court of appeals concurred with the lower court, though one judge partially dissented on the case. 
Story County supervisors approved the decision as part of a consent agenda and did not discuss the decision to engage the D.C. law firm on the suit. 
Steve Kenkel, a former Shelby County supervisor who now serves as an adviser to the board on topics related to the pipeline, quoted Iowa Code where it directs county supervisors to “protect and preserve the rights of their constituents.” 
“That’s what we’re trying to do here,” Kenkel said. “Without county zoning ordinances, the tools supervisors presently have in their tool box … will be tools of the past if this ruling is allowed to stand.”
Both counties voted to engage Kellogg, Hansen, Todd, Figel & Frederick P.L.L.C. to petition the Supreme Court. 
Summit legal filing says ordinances would be preempted regardless
Summit has sued several counties for similar county ordinance issues, including Emmet, Kossuth and Palo Alto counties. The later-filed cases have been paused while Shelby and Story counties’ case was heard and then appealed. The two counties also petitioned the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eight Circuit for an en banc rehearing of the case in July, which the court denied. 
The other affected counties have requested stays through this process again as Shelby and Story counties decided to take the case to the Supreme Court. 
Summit’s legal team submitted a motion to lift the stay for these other counties, arguing that regardless of the outcome of the Supreme Court petition, the county ordinances would be preempted by state laws. 
“Any county ordinance—including the one here—that attempts to impose additional permitting requirements, control pipeline routes, or regulate construction and operation is preempted by state law,” the motion said. 
The Summit motion for leave of stay in Kossuth County also said certiorari from the Supreme Court was “unlikely in general” and “particularly unlikely” in Shelby and Story counties’ case. 
The motion holds that the Supreme Court could only review whether or not the ordinances were preempted by federal pipeline laws. Still in place, it argues, would be a piece of Iowa Code that gives the Iowa Utilities Commission the authority to set pipeline routes. 
This was noted in the ruling from the Eighth Circuit. Here, the judges explained that a county would be inconsistent with state law, and therefore preempted, if it denied a local zoning permit application from the pipeline company to build on a location that had been approved by the IUC. 
The appellate court decision notes some other states cede this power to local governments and might not be preempted as Iowa counties are. 
Kenkel argued Tuesday that if the Supreme Court did not act in the counties’ favor, the IUC would not be able to route the pipeline based on safety considerations. These and permitting and setback regulations, he said, would instead be up to the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration’s rules.
Rob Sand speaks in Harlan on eminent domain
State Auditor Rob Sand, a Democrat who is running for governor, stopped in Harlan Tuesday as part of his campaign tour across the state. 
Among the things he was asked by the bipartisan crowd at Milk & Honey restaurant downtown: How would he protect property rights from such projects? 
Sand said he does not support eminent domain for CO2 pipelines, “period.” The comment was met with applause, especially considering some of the crowd had filed across the street to the restaurant after the board meeting.

Sand said there are two main reasons why he feels this way. He said he is “deeply skeptical” that a carbon capture pipeline can be considered a common carrier and if “there is a true public purpose” to the project. 
“You can be a supporter of agriculture in the state of Iowa and a supporter of ethanol, and say that the carbon capture pipeline ain’t it,” Sand said. 
Sand said there are other options to sequester CO2 that have an established market. 
Sand said Gov. Kim Reynolds’ lack of action, or public opinion on the issue has been her “single biggest failure.”  
“Never in the state of Iowa, if there’s a tremendous issue with lots of people showing up at the state capitol every single year for the legislative session, will I let five years go by before I decide to maybe share my opinion, only after a bill gets passed,” Sand said.
Reynolds, a Republican, is not seeking reelection.

,Mississippi Today,2025-08-19 21:22:54+00:00,Mississippi Today,FBI arrests ex-coach of elite gymnastics in Iowa on child porn charge from Mississippi,Associated Press,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/08/19/gymnastics-ex-coach-arrested-iowa-mississippi/,"Sean Gardner, who coached at a center in Iowa that has trained Olympic champions, is facing allegations that he abused young female gymnasts in Iowa and secretly photographed others undressing at a prior job in Purvis, Mississippi.","IOWA CITY, Iowa — The U.S. gymnastics world was just recovering from a devastating sexual abuse scandal when a promising young coach moved from south Mississippi to Iowa to take a job in 2018 at an elite academy known for training Olympic champions.
Sean Gardner coached some of the most promising girls at Chow’s Gymnastics and Dance Institute in West Des Moines, Iowa. The club’s owner, Liang “Chow” Qiao, also thought highly enough of Gardner to put him in charge of a premier junior event.
But four years later, Gardner was gone from Chow’s with little notice.
USA Gymnastics, the organization rocked by the Larry Nassar sex-abuse crisis that led to the creation of the U.S. Center for SafeSport, had been informed by the watchdog group that Gardner was placed on its website’s banned list and was suspended from all contact with gymnasts.

The reason for Gardner’s removal wasn’t disclosed. But court records obtained by The Associated Press show the coach was accused of sexually abusing at least three young gymnasts at Chow’s and secretly recording others undressing in a gym bathroom at his prior job in Purvis, Mississippi.
The FBI arrested Gardner, 38, last week in Iowa on a federal child pornography charge from Mississippi. A parent in Iowa said her daughter, who had alleged wrongdoing by Gardner, did not want to seek criminal charges against him.
The arrest happened more than three years after Gardner was suspended from coaching, but his disciplinary case has still not been resolved by SafeSport, which handles sex-abuse cases in Olympic sports.
In cases like Gardner’s, the public can be in the dark for years while SafeSport investigates and sanctions coaches. SafeSport requires that allegations be reported to police to ensure abusers don’t run unchecked outside of sports, but critics say the system is a slow, murky process.
“From an outward operational view, it seems that if SafeSport is involved in any way, the situation turns glow-in-the-dark toxic,” said attorney Steve Silvey, a longtime SafeSport critic who has represented people in cases involving the center.
While acknowledging there can be delays as its investigations unfold, SafeSport defended its temporary suspensions in a statement as “a unique and valuable intervention” when there are concerns of a risk to others.
Nevertheless, in 2024, Gardner was able to land a job helping care for surgical patients at an Iowa hospital — two years after the abuse allegations against him were reported to SafeSport and the police.
And it was not until late May that West Des Moines police executed a search warrant at his home, eventually leading to the recovery of a trove of photos and videos on his computer and cellphone of nude young girls, court records show.
Authorities in Iowa sealed the court documents after the AP asked about the investigation earlier this month, before details of the federal charge were made public Friday. Gardner, Qiao and Gardner’s former employer in Mississippi did not respond to AP requests for comment. Mississippi Today also left phone messages Tuesday at Jump’In Gymnastics & Tumbling in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, seeking comment.
‘The job that I’ve always wanted’
Chow’s Gymnastics is best known as the academy where U.S. gymnasts Shawn Johnson and Gabby Douglas trained before becoming gold medalists at the 2008 and 2012 Olympics.
Qiao opened the gym in 1998 after starring on the Chinese national team and moving to the United States to coach at the University of Iowa. The gym became a draw for top youth gymnasts, with some families moving to Iowa to train there.
Gardner moved to Iowa in September 2018, jumping at the opportunity to coach under Qiao.
“This is the job that I’ve always wanted. Chow is really someone I have looked up to since I’ve been coaching,” Gardner told the ABC affiliate WOI-TV in 2019. “And you can tell when you step foot in the gym, just even from coaching the girls, the culture that he’s built. It’s amazing. It’s beautiful.”
A year later, Gardner was promoted to director of Chow’s Winter Classic, an annual meet that draws more than 1,000 gymnasts to Iowa. He also coached a junior Olympics team during his four-year tenure at Chow’s.
Several of his students earned college gymnastics scholarships, but Gardner said he had bigger goals.
“You want to leave a thumbprint on their life, so when they go off hopefully to school, to bigger and better things, that they remember Chow’s as family,” he said in a 2020 interview with WOI-TV.
Coach accused of sexual misconduct in Iowa and Mississippi
Gardner is accused of abusing his position at Chow’s and his former job at Jump’In Gymnastics & Tumbling, then located in Purvis, Mississippi, to prey on girls under his tutelage, according to a nine-page FBI affidavit released Friday that summarizes the allegations against him.
A girl in Iowa reported to SafeSport in March 2022 that Gardner used “inappropriate spotting techniques” in which he would put his hands between her legs and touch her vagina, the affidavit said.
It said she alleged Gardner would ask girls if they were sexually active and call them “idiots, sluts, and whores.” She said this behavior began after his hiring in Iowa in 2018 and continued until she left the gym in 2020 and provided the names of six other potential victims.
SafeSport suspended Gardner in July 2022 – four months after the girl’s report – a provisional step it can take in severe cases with “sufficient evidentiary support” as investigations proceed.
A month after that, the center received a report from another girl alleging additional “sexual contact and physical abuse,” including that Gardner similarly fondled her during workouts, the FBI affidavit said. The girl said that he once dragged her across the carpet so hard that it burned her buttocks, the affidavit said.
SafeSport shared the reports with West Des Moines police, in line with its policy requiring adults who interact with youth athletes to disclose potential criminal cases to law enforcement.
While SafeSport’s suspension took Gardner out of gymnastics, the criminal investigation quickly hit a roadblock.

Police records show a detective told SafeSport to urge the alleged victims to file criminal complaints, but only one of their mothers contacted police in 2022. That woman said her daughter did not want to pursue criminal charges, and police suspended the investigation.
Victims of abuse are often reluctant to cooperate with police, said Ken Lang, a retired detective and associate professor of criminal justice at Milligan University.
“In this case you have the prestige of this facility,” he said. “Do they want to associate their name with that, in that way, when their aspirations were to succeed in gymnastics?”
Police suspended the investigation, even as Gardner was on probation for his second-offense of driving while intoxicated.
A dormant case reopened, and a year later, an arrest
The case stayed dormant until April 2024 when another former Chow’s student came forward to the West Des Moines Police Department to report abuse allegations, according to a now-sealed affidavit signed by police detective Jeff Lyon. The AP is not identifying the student in line with its policy of not naming victims of alleged sexual abuse.
The now 18-year-old told police she began taking lessons from Gardner when she was 11 or 12 in 2019, initially seeing him as a “father figure” who tried to help her get through her parents’ divorce. He told her she could tell him “anything,” the affidavit said.
When she moved in 2021, she told police, he gave her a hug and said she could text and follow him on Instagram and other social media sites, where he went by the nickname “Coach Seanie,” because gym policy barring such contact no longer applied.
According to a summary of her statement provided in Lyon’s affidavit, she said Gardner fondled her during exercises, repeatedly touching her vagina; rubbed her back and butt and discussed his sex life; and made her do inappropriate stretches that exposed her privates.
She told police she suspected he used his cellphone to film her in that position.
Reached by the AP, the teen’s mother declined comment. The mother told police she was interested in a monetary settlement with Chow’s because the gym “had been made aware of the complaints and they did nothing to stop them,” according to Lyon’s affidavit. The gym didn’t return AP messages seeking comment.
It took 16 months after the teen’s 2024 report for the FBI to arrest Gardner, who made an initial court appearance in Des Moines on Friday on a charge of producing visual depictions of minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct, which can carry up to 30 years in prison. A public defender assigned to represent him didn’t return AP messages seeking comment.
It’s unclear why the case took so long to investigate or when the FBI, which had to pay $138 million to Nassar’s victims for botching that investigation, got involved in the case.
Among evidence seized by investigators in late May were a cellphone, laptop and a desktop computer along with handwritten notes between Gardner and his former pupils, according to the sealed court documents.
They found images of girls, approximately 6 to 14 years in age, who were nude, using the toilet or changing into leotards, those documents show. Those images appear to have come from a hidden camera in a restroom in Mississippi.
They also uncovered 50 video files and 400 photos, including some that appeared to be child pornography, according to the FBI affidavit. One video allegedly shows Gardner entering the bathroom and turning off the camera.
Investigators also found images of an adult woman secretly filmed entering and exiting a bathtub, and identified her as Gardner’s ex-girlfriend. That woman as well as the gym’s owner, Candi Workman, told investigators the images appeared to come from Jump’In Gymnastics’ facility in Purvis, which has since moved to the nearby city of Hattiesburg.
SafeSport’s power has limits
SafeSport has long touted that it can deliver sanctions in cases where criminal charges are not pursued as key to its mission. However, Gardner’s ability to land a job in health care illustrates the limits of that power: It can ban people from sports but that sanction is not guaranteed to reach the general public.
While not commenting about Gardner’s case directly, it said in a statement provided to AP that a number of issues factor into why cases can take so long to close, including the 8,000 reports it receives a year with only around 30 full-time investigators. It has revamped some procedures, it said, in an attempt to become more efficient.
“While the Center is able and often does cooperate in law enforcement investigations,” it said, “law enforcement is not required to share information, updates, or even confirm an investigation is ongoing.”
USA Gymnastics President Li Li Leung called the center’s task “really tough, difficult to navigate.”
“I would like to see more consistency with their outcomes and sanctions,” Leung said. “I would like to see more standardization on things. I would like to see more communication, more transparency from their side.”
A case that lingers, even after the SafeSport ban
As the investigation proceeded, Gardner said on his Facebook page he had landed a new job in May 2024 as a surgical technologist at MercyOne West Des Moines Medical Center. It’s a role that calls for positioning patients on the operating room table, and assisting with procedures and post-surgery care.
Asked about Gardner’s employment, hospital spokesman Todd Mizener told the AP: “The only information I can provide is that he is no longer” at the hospital.
Meanwhile, the case lingers, leaving lives in limbo more than three years after the SafeSport Center and police first learned of it.
“SafeSport is now part of a larger problem rather than a solution, if it was ever a solution,” said attorney Silvey. “The most fundamental professional task such as coordination with local or federal law enforcement gets botched on a daily basis, hundreds of times a year now.”

Bromazolam is described in the letter penned by Sunday and 20 other state attorneys general as a “designer Xanax.” The prosecutors say the drug is increasingly contributing to overdose deaths and posing a growing threat to public health in Pennsylvania and beyond. It is also highly potent and unpredictable, Sunday’s office writes, especially when mixed with opioids. Narcan, which is used to reverse an overdose, is ineffective against the drug in such emergencies. 
Bromazolam is unscheduled under the federal Controlled Substances Act.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“Despite its clear dangers, bromazolam remains unscheduled at the federal level, creating significant challenges for law enforcement and public health officials trying to respond to this emerging crisis,” the attorneys generals wrote. “Without scheduling, this drug continues to evade traditional regulatory and prosecutorial tools, hindering interdiction efforts and enabling continued distribution through illicit channels.”
“Taking emergency action to schedule bromazolam will help law enforcement remove it from circulation, give prosecutors the tools to hold traffickers accountable, and send a clear signal that this dangerous substance has no place on our streets,” the attorneys general wrote.
Sunday said that “designer” benzodiazepines, such as bromazolam, surfaced in Pennsylvania in 2022 and contributed to 59 overdose deaths that year. Data from the state Department of Health showed that the number of deaths nearly tripled one year later, according to the joint letter.
“It is a race to stay ahead of drug traffickers when dealing with synthetic drugs, and lives depend on immediate action that will give law enforcement the tools to proactively target traffickers,” Sunday said. “This substance has no legitimate purpose, and is becoming far too common in Pennsylvania and across the nation.”
Sunday, who was sworn into office in January, has joined other coalitions of attorneys general on various letters and lawsuits. Earlier this month, he teamed with 50 attorneys general in a letter to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, calling on the U.S. Department of Justice to assist in addressing illegal offshore gaming and gambling across the country.

Santiago/Getty Images)BILOXI, Miss. — The Trump administration is developing a powerful data tool it claims will let states identify noncitizens registered to vote. But Democratic critics and data experts warn it could allow the federal government to vacuum up vast quantities of information on Americans for unclear purposes.
Some Democratic election officials and opponents of the effort fear President Donald Trump wants to build a federal database of voters to target political opponents or cherry-pick rare examples of noncitizen voters to fuel a sense of crisis. Republican election officials allied with the president counter that he’s helping states to maintain accurate voter rolls.
The Trump administration has rolled out changes to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, tool at the same time the U.S. Department of Justice is asking states for copies of their voter rolls. The timing, combined with questions about what happens to voter data uploaded to the program, has alarmed critics.
Trump wants Congress to pass a national proof of citizenship voter registration requirement and in March tried to unilaterally impose one for federal elections through executive order. But with the legislation stalled and the order halted by the courts, the citizenship data tool may offer a backdoor way to accomplish the same goal.
SAVE was originally intended to help state and local officials verify the immigration status of individual noncitizens seeking government benefits. But U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, this spring refashioned it into a platform that can scan states’ voter rolls if election officials upload the data.
Justice Department demand for state voter lists underscores their importance

The changes to SAVE, rolled out over just a few months and with little public debate, are “tinkering with sort of the bones of democracy,” said John Davisson, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington, D.C.-based research and advocacy group that argues privacy is a fundamental right.
“You’re talking about the voting process and who will be eligible to vote,” Davisson said. “And to take a system that is not designed for use in that process and repurpose it, really on the fly, without a formal comment process, without formal rulemaking, without congressional intervention — that’s pretty anomalous and pretty alarming.”
Previously, SAVE could only search one name at a time. Now it can conduct bulk searches, allowing state officials to potentially feed into it information on millions of registered voters. SAVE checks that information against a series of federal databases and reports back whether it can verify someone’s immigration status.
Since May, it also can draw upon Social Security data, transforming the program into a tool that can confirm citizenship because Social Security records for many, but not all, Americans include the information. NPR reported earlier on changes to SAVE.
“It is incredible what has been done, really since March,” Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray, a Republican who supports proof of citizenship requirements and the SAVE tool, told a gathering of state secretaries of state in Biloxi, Mississippi, last week.
Individuals registering to vote in federal elections must already sign a statement affirming they are citizens under penalty of perjury, and those who cast a ballot face criminal penalties and deportation. One study of the 2016 election placed the prevalence of noncitizen voting at 0.0001% of votes cast.
But as Trump has spread falsehoods about elections, Republicans have made purging noncitizens from voter rolls a central focus.

Democratic concerns were on display last week at the National Association of Secretaries of State conference, held at the Beau Rivage casino-resort in Biloxi. In interviews on the sidelines of the conference, Democratic secretaries of state voiced deep reservations — or outright opposition — about plugging their voter data into SAVE.
Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said Aug. 6 that the federal government appeared to be trying to take over election administration. She formally rejected the Justice Department’s voter roll request two days later.
Bellows said the Department of Homeland Security told her in a recent phone call that it planned to retain SAVE data for 10 years for “audit purposes only.”
“Just like the [Justice Department] is asking us to hand over an electronic file of all the voters in our state, it seems like the Department of Homeland Security is through this backdoor system also asking us to share voter information about every voter in our state,” Bellows said.
At least one state appears to have granted the federal government sweeping authority over any voter data it provides to SAVE.
Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales announced in July he had reached an agreement with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to access the newly expanded system for voter list maintenance. Indiana’s agreement allows the federal agency to use information the state provides for any purpose permitted by law, including criminal prosecutions.
Morales, a Republican, said in a news release that SAVE represented “another step in safeguarding the rights” of eligible voters. His office didn’t respond to Stateline’s questions.
The Trump administration has ramped up efforts to encourage state election officials to use the expanded program. The White House hosted a bipartisan “fly in” event for state secretaries of state on July 29. Multiple secretaries of state told Stateline that USCIS Director Joseph Edlow, who was confirmed on July 15, spoke at the event.
“The president is very much keyed in on voter list maintenance,” Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, a Republican, said in an interview — echoing other GOP secretaries of state who released statements praising the Trump administration after the meeting.












When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances.


– Minnesota Democratic Secretary of State Steve Simon




Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, a Democrat who attended the meeting, said he questioned how the federal government would handle voter information provided to SAVE. He added that the Justice Department’s request for his state’s voter rolls raised his level of concern about how data would be used.
“When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances,” Simon told Stateline.
The White House referred questions about SAVE and the event to the Department of Homeland Security and USCIS.
In response to questions from Stateline, USCIS didn’t directly answer whether the agency would share voter roll data with other parts of the federal government but confirmed it disposes of records after 10 years.
“The SAVE application is a critical tool for state and local governments to access information to safeguard the integrity of elections across the country. It’s no wonder many states have quickly adopted it, and we continue to promote the tool to other states and counties not using SAVE,” USCIS spokesperson Matthew Tragesser said in a statement.
“We look forward to continued optimization efforts and implementing more updates to SAVE.”
GOP pressure
Some Republican election officials and Trump allies have long wanted the federal government to take an expanded role in searching state voter rolls for noncitizens.
Last summer the Trump-aligned litigation group America First Legal, co-founded by Trump adviser Stephen Miller, encouraged states to submit to the Department of Homeland Security the names of individuals for citizenship or immigration status verification.
Some states did just that. Texas, for example, asked USCIS to verify the citizenship of some voters in September, and Indiana asked the agency to verify 585,774 voters in October. The same month, 16 Republican state attorneys general signed a letter criticizing Homeland Security, then under the Biden administration, for failing to work with states on verification.
Trump’s DOJ wants states to turn over voter lists, election info

After Trump took office, GOP state officials kept up the pressure. Twenty-one Republican secretaries of state urged Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in February to prioritize SAVE improvements.
On April 16, Indiana sued the department in federal court for not responding to its verification request last fall. USCIS announced an overhaul of SAVE less than a week later.
As the agency continues to remake SAVE, the tool will soon allow searches using the last four digits of a Social Security number, multiple state secretaries of state told Stateline. The agency confirmed the feature is under development and will be available soon but didn’t provide an exact date.
The change would mark another significant expansion of the program because most states collect the last four digits when individuals without a driver’s license register to vote.
Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican, said SAVE represents a better way to verify citizenship than a state law requiring voters to produce documents. “I think there’s a real opportunity for us to do a lot of this through just sharing of information and I think that’s what we’re seeing happen,” McGrane said in an interview.
Unreliable data?
But some voting rights advocates and experts on government data caution against an overreliance on Social Security data.
The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, a progressive policy nonprofit, has noted that Social Security only began tracking the citizenship status of all applicants in 1978 — meaning the database doesn’t include comprehensive citizenship information for older Americans. Additionally, Social Security may not always have up-to-date information on the status of naturalized U.S. citizens.
The nonpartisan Institute for Responsive Government also warned in May that since SAVE hasn’t used Social Security numbers to verify citizenship in the past, its accuracy and effectiveness are unknown. The success of the expanded SAVE program may also partially depend on whether it has adequate staff and resources, it said.
Though noncitizens can vote in few local elections, GOP goes big to make it illegal

A 2017 Government Accountability Office report found that between fiscal years 2012 and 2016, about 16% of the nearly 90 million SAVE searches required additional verification, which the institute says often translates into federal workers manually checking files. Now that SAVE allows bulk searches, the need for manual checking could rise dramatically.
Nick Doctor, director of implementation at the Institute for Responsive Government, said in an interview that a tool confirming the eligibility of registered voters in a way that doesn’t burden individuals can be a good thing. But he emphasized that it depends in large measure on SAVE’s implementation.
“The changes that have been made to SAVE happened very quickly and, to my knowledge, we haven’t seen releases on the level of accuracy of that information,” Doctor said.
During interviews, Republican secretaries of state stressed that voters aren’t kicked off the rolls because SAVE can’t verify their citizenship. Instead, an inability to verify would likely trigger a follow-up process with the voter.
“Just because we get something back from the SAVE database, it’s not a cut and dry, especially on those they’re not sure about,” Hoskins, the Missouri secretary of state, said.
Still, Arizona illustrates why some Democrats worry about any large-scale effort to ask voters — especially longtime, older residents — to prove their citizenship. After the state discovered errors in how it tracked voter citizenship dating back years, election officials are contacting some 200,000 voters seeking proof of citizenship documentation.
Some have been casting ballots for decades without incident and many feel targeted, Arizona Democratic Secretary of State Adrian Fontes said during a presentation at the state secretaries of state conference. “They feel insulted when they get that letter,” Fontes said.












There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside.


– Charles Stewart III, professor of political science at MIT who studies elections




Charles Stewart III, a professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies elections, said Arizona may actually point to the potential usefulness of SAVE. If Arizona runs its voter roll through the program, a list of 200,000 voters needing citizenship verification would perhaps drop into the hundreds, he suggested.
“There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside,” Stewart said.
Connecticut Democratic Secretary of State Stephanie Thomas told Stateline that every secretary wants tools to keep voter lists as clean as possible. But the details are important.
When she hears of something new, Thomas said she asks whether it’s the best option available and whether “the i’s are dotted, the t’s crossed.” She said she’s asked USCIS a series of questions about SAVE and is waiting on some responses.
“When it comes to voter lists,” Thomas said, “I don’t want Connecticut voters to be a guinea pig.”

(Photo by Anna Padilla for Source NM)Economists tasked with predicting New Mexico’s financial health said Tuesday the state will generate a little more than $14 billion in revenue in the upcoming fiscal year, a figure that means the state will have nearly half a billion dollars in “new” money to spend when they craft the budget early next year. 
Lawmakers with the interim Legislative Finance Committee heard new projections Tuesday about how much the state is expected to generate in revenue via taxes, investment returns and oil and gas royalties over the next few years. One key estimate they provide is how much “new” money lawmakers will have for the upcoming fiscal year, which is the amount of projected revenue minus how much the state will spend this fiscal year.
Department of Finance and Administration Wayne Propst, whose agency is one of four that team up to develop statewide economic forecasts, said the forecast is just the latest positive sign for the state’s financial health after years of record growth and revenue. 
“I keep thinking that one of these days I’m going to have to show up with some bad news,” he told lawmakers. “But fortunately, today is not that day. The fiscal position of the state of New Mexico remains strong.”
In total, the roughly $14.1 billion the state expects to generate in revenue in the fiscal year beginning Sept. 1, 2026 is about $485 million more than the total amount the state is currently spending this fiscal year, which is approximately $13.6 billion. 
That $485 million in “new” money prompted celebratory news releases from Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and fellow Democrats in charge of the Legislature, who said it will help soften the blow of expected federal spending cuts that could mean the state will have to step in to pay for low-income health insurance or food assistance. 
New Mexico economist: Don’t expect huge jump in oil production, even if Trump slashes regulations

“New Mexico’s strong revenue projection announced in Las Cruces today is good news at a time when the federal government is ruthlessly slashing revenues that states have historically relied on,”  Lujan Grisham said in a statement. “Today’s announcement that our state can expect nearly a half-billion dollars in additional revenue will help us protect the essential services for New Mexicans that Washington has abandoned.”
According to state House Democrats, the “One Big Beautiful Bill” Congress and Trump enacted late last month will mean at least $305 million less in federal funding in the budget that lawmakers will craft during the legislative session beginning in January. The governor’s office put that figure at about $200 million each year for the next few years, primarily due to tax code changes. 
In response to the new forecasts, House Democrats championed their approach of investing a glut of oil and gas royalty payments into revenue-generating reserve funds, saying that the investment strategy has removed volatility from the budgeting process and insulated essential services from price fluctuations in the oil and gas sector. 
Oil and gas revenues are expected to contribute about one-third of the state’s general fund over the next few years, but that figure would have been close to 50% if the state hadn’t diverted excess oil and gas revenues into trust funds that fund early child education, behavioral health or other reserve funds, according to estimates forecasters released Tuesday. 
“Despite the constant stream of chaos coming out of Washington, D.C., New Mexico’s economic outlook remains strong thanks to years of hard work and smart budgeting,” said House Speaker Javier Martínez (D-Albuquerque), in a news release. 
New House budget wrangles record revenue again, but experts warn it won’t last much longer

In addition to the federal cuts, forecasters have predicted a slowdown in oil and gas growth and prices in the next few years, a message they they repeated Tuesday. Ismael Torres, the LFC’s chief economist, said the slowdown and uncertainty around President Donald Trump’s economic policies should give lawmakers caution when crafting the state’s spending plan. 
Along with unpredictable effects of federal policy on the global economy, Torres also mentioned that lawmakers have greatly increased the amount of money they’ve dedicated to non-recurring spending, including significant multi-year funding commitments.
He said continued growth in that type of spending is reducing the amount of funds lawmakers can put in reserves could end up hamstringing lawmakers if expected future revenues “don’t materialize.”
“As economists, you might hear us say that there’s a lot of uncertainty always,” he said. “But this time I really mean it.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_0528-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-19 17:57:23.739947

Idaho Department of Lands seeks to balance pending budget cuts with firefighting needs

The Rock Fire was started by lighting late Aug. 12 or early on Aug. 13 and is burning in the Payette National Forest just south of Tamarack Resort, about 5 miles outside the town of Donnelly.
As of Tuesday, the Rock Fire had increased in size to 2,695 acres, with 0% percent containment, officials said. Nearly 700 personnel were helping fight the Rock Fire on Tuesday, using six helicopters and 26 engines, according to the Great Basin Interagency Incident Management Team 6.
As a result of the Rock Fire, the Valley County Sheriff’s Office has issued evacuation notices for nearby residents and the Payette National Forest and Boise National Forest have issued local road, campground and trail closures.
On Tuesday, the Valley County Sheriff’s Office upgraded the evacuation status for Zone WM-07 located near West Mountain Road from “ready” status to “set” status. 
Idaho operates under a three-tier fire evacuation system. 
“Set” means residents and visitors need to be prepared to evacuate at a moment’s notice because there is significant danger in their area, according to the Valley County Sheriff’s Office. The sheriff’s office instructed people within the “set” status area to face their vehicles toward the street and load up pets, important papers, people, priceless items and prescription medication. In preparation for evacuation, people should close all doors and windows to their home and leave their outside lights on so that fire crews can see the property. To prepare for evacuation, people should wear sturdy shoes, dress in clothing with long sleeves and pants to protect them and grab a handkerchief and googles if they have them available. 
Fire conditions and evacuation orders may change quickly. 
The latest fire and evacuation information is available online at the Valley County Evacuation Map and the Valley County Sheriff’s Office’s Facebook page.

The Trump administration is once again pressuring liberal cities and states to cooperate with deportation efforts, despite previous setbacks in court.
Attorney General Pam Bondi sent letters last week telling sanctuary states, cities and counties that “you better be abiding by our federal policies and with our federal law enforcement, because if you aren’t, we’re going to come after you,” she said in a Fox News interview. She demanded the areas answer her by Tuesday.
Cities and states with so-called sanctuary policies generally refuse to assist with immigration raids or accede to requests for local jails to hold prisoners for deportation. Those that responded to Stateline’s questions about the letters said they were not inclined to change their positions about cooperation with immigration authorities.
“It’s the tactic of a bully. And the only way to deal with a bully is to let them know that they’re not going to intimidate you,” Rhode Island Democratic Attorney General Peter Neronha said in a statement.
The Trump administration is attempting to force more cooperation with immigration arrests. But it suffered a serious court reversal on July 25, when a federal judge dismissed a sanctuary policies case against Illinois, Chicago and Cook County.
The state and local policies reflect a “decision to not participate in enforcing civil immigration law — a decision protected by the Tenth Amendment,” Judge Lindsay Jenkins wrote in an order now under appeal.
Bondi’s letters follow the Justice Department’s Aug. 5 release of a list of sanctuary jurisdictions including 12 states, the District of Columbia, four counties and 18 cities. That’s fewer jurisdictions than the 14 states and almost 500 counties and cities that appeared on an earlier list, which the agency withdrew after criticism that it included conservative counties that were fully cooperating with immigration enforcement.
The states on the new list are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington state. The list also includes some counties and cities in those states as well as in Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New Mexico.










It's the tactic of a bully. And the only way to deal with a bully is to let them know that they're not going to intimidate you.


– Rhode Island Democratic Attorney General Peter Neronha


Other federal courts have issued injunctions to at least temporarily stop Trump administration from withholding unrelated federal funding from governments that don’t cooperate on immigration. Cities, counties and states have filed lawsuits challenging Trump’s executive orders targeting sanctuary policies, including a February order that federal payments to states and localities must not “by design or effect, facilitate the subsidization or promotion of illegal immigration, or abet so-called ‘sanctuary’ policies that seek to shield illegal aliens from deportation.”

“The executive orders are directing agencies to basically take a maximalist approach to putting pressure on local governments to cooperate with immigration [enforcement], even though they’re not required to do so by federal law,” said Jonathan Miller, one of the attorneys working on the California case for the Public Rights Project, a California-based group promoting civil rights protections for states and cities.
One city on the administration’s list was Rochester, New York, which disciplined some police officers for helping federal agents make a March arrest in the city. The city already faces a lawsuit brought by the Trump administration that prominently mentions the arrest of three men from Guatemala; one of whom has since pleaded guilty to re-entering the United States after a previous deportation.

A spokesperson for the city, Barbara Pierce, said in a statement to The Guardian that, “Nothing in Attorney General Bondi’s letter is new and none of it has legal merit.”
“The letter reiterates many of the frivolous arguments that the federal government has already made in its pending suit against the city of Rochester,” she added. “These same arguments were levied against the city of Chicago and were dismissed by the federal district court for the eastern district of Illinois nearly a month ago.”
Ally Sullivan, a spokesperson for Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis, said in a statement that Colorado “is not a sanctuary state. The Governor continues to be frustrated by this mistaken and incorrect label.” In a televised interview earlier this year, Polis pointed out that Colorado fully cooperates with federal authorities on criminal matters. Immigration, he said, is a civil matter.
“In Colorado, we are improving public safety, apprehending dangerous criminals, cooperating with federal law enforcement on criminal investigations, and keeping our communities safe,” Sullivan said.
Nevertheless, Colorado faces a federal lawsuit brought by the administration over its alleged sanctuary policies. Polis signed a measure in May that limits local law enforcement’s communication with federal immigration authorities and restricts where federal authorities can operate within schools, child care facilities, hospitals and libraries without a judicial warrant.

Connecticut Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont in a statement said the state’s Trust Act, which the Trump administration has targeted as a sanctuary policy, was passed with bipartisan support and helps ensure local police concentrate on serious crimes. The Trust Act, passed in 2013 and expanded in 2019, limits information sharing and compliance with requests to detain immigrants for federal immigration authorities.
“Nothing about this makes Connecticut a sanctuary in any legal or practical sense — it makes our state one that upholds the Constitution, respects the rule of law, and prioritizes the safety and well-being of our communities,” Lamont said.

In a sweeping 105-page ruling, Aycock, a President George W. Bush appointee, found that the three Supreme Court districts were drawn in violation of the federal Voting Rights Act. Aycock asked the Legislature to redraw those districts in the future to give Black voters a fair shot at electing candidates of their choice.   
Out of the 100-plus justices who have served on the Mississippi Supreme Court, only four have been Black.
Mississippi law establishes three distinct Supreme Court districts, commonly referred to as the Northern, Central and Southern districts. Voters elect three judges from each of these districts to make up the nine-member court. These districts have not been redrawn since 1987. 
The main district at issue in the case is the Central District, which comprises many parts of the majority-Black Delta and the majority-Black Jackson Metro area. Currently, two white justices, Kenny Griffis and Jenifer Branning, and one Black justice, Leslie King, represent the district. 
Last year, Branning, a white candidate who described herself as a “constitutional conservative” and was backed by the Republican Party, defeated longtime Justice Jim Kitchens, a white man widely viewed as a candidate supported by Black voters. 
No Black person has ever been elected to the Mississippi Supreme Court without first obtaining an interim appointment from the governor, and no Black person from either of the two other districts has ever served on the state’s high court. 
“In short, the evidence illustrates that Black candidates who desire to run for the Mississippi Supreme Court face a grim likelihood of success,” Aycock wrote in her ruling. 
The lawsuit was filed in April 2022 by the American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Mississippi, the Southern Poverty Law Center and private law firms on behalf of a group of Black Mississippians, including state Sen. Derrick Simmons of Greenville, and Ty Pinkins, a previous Democratic nominee for the U.S. Senate.
Aycock wrote that the parties will convene a status conference soon to discuss an appropriate deadline for the Legislature to address the districts. The Legislature earlier this year adjourned its regular session, and Gov. Tate Reeves is the only person with the power to call lawmakers into a special session.
The state could appeal Aycock’s ruling to the conservative U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/06101021/HB-1020-appeal1.jpg,,,2025-08-19 17:57:23.739947

(Photo by Madison McVan/Minnesota Reformer)Housing became more affordable this June, as higher incomes and slightly lower interest rates overcame higher prices, according to a National Association of Realtors report.
However, the South and the Midwest are the only regions where a family with typical or median income can afford a median-priced house, according to the report. The group considers a mortgage to be affordable if the monthly payment (principal and interest) is 25% or less of the family’s income.
The affordability gap is highest in the West, where the typical family income is $113,783, just over two-thirds of the $164,832 that would be needed to purchase a median-priced home.
The Northeast, where the typical family makes $114,559, is also unaffordable by this measure, as a median-priced home requires an income of $141,264.
In the Midwest, the median family income is $102,419, more than the $86,256 needed to buy a median-priced home. The same is true in the South, where the median income is $97,812, slightly more than the $96,720 required to buy a typical home.
Nationally, affordability increased slightly compared with June of 2024, with the typical family making $105,431, about 94% of the $111,648 it would need to buy the median-priced home. That’s up from about 92% in June 2024.
In a video posted Aug. 15, Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors, said he expects lower interest rates to increase affordability in the months ahead.
“We know that mortgage rates will be coming down and that will bring additional buyers into the market. We just need to make sure we have more supply, more supply to meet that demand,” Yun said.

Two New Mexico residents, Paul Ortega and Rebecca Scott, both of whom say they were forced to wait for their gun purchases despite quickly passing background checks, sued Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and Attorney General Raúl Torrez over the law on the day it took effect: May 15, 2024. Their suit, backed by the National Rifle Association and other pro-gun organizations, contends the law is unconstitutional under the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, as made applicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment. A federal district judge in July of 2024, however, denied the plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction against the law while the lawsuit proceeded.
In its 2-1 split decision Tuesday, the Appeals Court reversed that decision, pausing the law, and sent the case back to the lower court. “Cooling-off periods infringe on the Second Amendment by preventing the lawful acquisition of firearms,” the decision reads. “Cooling off periods do not fit into any historically grounded exceptions to the right to keep and bear arms, and burden conduct within the Second Amendment’s scope. In this preliminary posture, we conclude that New Mexico’s Waiting Period Act is likely an unconstitutional burden on the Second Amendment rights of its citizens.”
The governor’s office says it is reviewing its legal options for responding to the ruling.
“Today’s decision by the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals is deeply disappointing, plainly wrong and likely to cost lives in New Mexico,” Lujan Grisham said in a statement. “New Mexico’s waiting period law was carefully crafted to minimize gun violence while respecting Second Amendment rights. The dissenting opinion in today’s ruling even notes that New Mexico’s law ‘is likely to save approximately thirty-seven lives per year.’”
Bill to establish a 7-day wait for gun sales headed to Gov. Lujan Grisham

The governor’s statement continues to say that the Tuesday ruling ignored a prior Tenth Circuit ruling that upheld Colorado’s law barring gun purchases by anyone under the age of 21, or “a law that requires 18-year-olds to wait three years to purchase a weapon.” Judge Scott M. Matheson dissenting opinion in Tuesday’s decision makes the same argument. The majority opinion acknowledges that precedent and also acknowledges that “courts have only partially fleshed out the boundaries of these commercial conditions.” However, it continues, “even in this murky territory, the Waiting Period Act falls far short of a presumptively constitutional law.”
Lujan Grisham’s statement also contends the ruling mischaracterized New Mexico’s gun-purchase waiting period as applying to “everyone,” when it exempts people with concealed carry permits; law enforcement officers; and people who sell guns to immediate family members.
“The evidence is clear,” the governor concludes. “Waiting periods prevent impulsive acts of violence and suicide, giving people time to step back and reassess their emotions during moments of crisis. I’m disappointed that today’s ruling doesn’t take this into account.”
The NRA issued a statement commending the decision. “In courtrooms across America, the NRA is successfully leading the charge to protect law-abiding Americans’ Second Amendment rights,” said NRA-Institute for Legislative Action Executive Director, John Commerford said in a statement. “The 10th Circuit has sided with the NRA and held that radical waiting period laws are indeed unconstitutional. This decision not only impacts gun owners in New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, Kansas, and Oklahoma, but serves as a key piece in dismantling similar gun control laws across the country.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/gun-rack-1-1024x678.jpeg,,,2025-08-19 16:56:23.755042

“We have developed a common theme in our interaction with department employees, and it’s simply this: Tell us about what’s going on, share us information. And what we get consistently from those employees is, ‘I will be happy to share information with you, but I will not come and testify, and I would prefer you don’t use my name, because the retribution that may come back at me in our department could be swift and severe because of what we may be telling you,’” Committee Chair Jay DeBoyer (R-Clay Township) said. 
After reviewing the state’s current whistleblower protection law, DeBoyer found it “woefully inept” saying it provided “exactly zero penalties, maybe a $500 fine if it is determined that an employer, a department head, a supervisor, has intimidated or harassed you because you have come forward and spoke the truth.”
In response, DeBoyer’s bill, which has yet to be introduced and given a bill number, would up the fine to $2,000, with the fine placed in the general fund. 
While the current law allows for the reinstatement of any employee who was terminated for speaking out against misconduct, DeBoyer’s bill would allow them to receive up to three times the amount of back wages as well as full reinstatement of fringe benefits and seniority rights. 
“If all you’re going to get for coming forward and then being treated poorly is your job back, what’s the motivation, right? You’ve been treated poorly, probably, possibly run through the ringer. Your reputation may have been damaged.…Obviously, getting their job back and the $2,000 fine puts a little more teeth into the bill,” DeBoyer said.

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Central College has spent this summer making internal changes to leadership and operations, concluding work college leadership said they started strategizing on after the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Central College President Mark Putnam said he’s approached decisions around changing university operations as “rethinking the work” — looking at measures to save money and streamline services without lowering the quality of a Central education and experience.
“I think how any institution approaches this could risk, in a negative scenario, quality, but I think for most it’s about maintaining quality by rethinking the ways in which we do things and beginning to change the conformities and conventional-wisdom pathways that we have followed,” Putnam said.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In spring 2022, Putnam said Central College staff and leadership began looking at how the university could shrink costs in both academic and business areas. The goal was to take a more holistic look at operations and implement measures they believed would work, even if they went against the traditional practices of most universities.
Putnam said the amount they were targeting for savings at the time was around $5 million from an expense base he said was “north of $40 million” in order to reach and exceed a neutral cash-flow budget. The university achieved a balanced budget at the end of fiscal year 2025 in early July, he said, with a “10-percent structural realignment” in funds.
After having academic departments go through quantitative and qualitative data to determine how they could both evolve and sustain themselves, Putnam said the university has, in phases, brought its number of departments down from 18 to seven. This was done by integrating separate programs, like music and art and theatre, into singular departments, categorized by their similarities of subject.
This allowed the Pella university to save money and prompted further collaboration between faculty and staff, which Putnam said could lead to new innovations and efficiencies. The university also offered “voluntary separations” to certain employees throughout this time, he said.
“Having one mind looking across those various interests that are manifested within the campus, and increasingly through ‘Imagine More’ with the community, in partnerships that we’re beginning to form in that arena, well, suddenly this makes more sense, to have a more integrated, thoughtful design, rather than having them isolated from each other,” Putnam said.
The “Imagine More: It’s Central to Pella” initiative, launched in December 2023 to bring college and community closer together, was also factored into thinking about efficiencies on campus, Putnam said. Some Central facilities will be repurposed for projects undertaken through partnerships between the college and outside groups, Putnam said, and the college has taken some buildings offline and moved some operations around to save money and square-footage.
Other areas of integration have come from the business side of the university, Putnam said, including the creation of the executive director for retail management role. Iwan Williams — appointed to the new position in January — oversees everything from local business partnerships and retail services run by Central to catering, concessions, events, clinics and more.
When someone comes to Central hoping to put on an event or partner on a project, Putnam said they can now go to one person for all of their needs rather than having to jump between a bunch of different people to sort things out.
With three years of work now complete, Putnam said the university finished the past fiscal year with a balanced budget, successful fundraising and plans to retire short-term debt the institution still has. This was done through a mix of restructuring and increasing revenue streams.
Central’s advancement division also saw changes this summer, with the university announcing a realignment in a news release in order to support “A World of Good,” a comprehensive fundraising campaign launched in the spring.
Sunny Eighmy, vice president for advancement at Central, said there have been a couple of departures from the team that led to a downsize in the workforce and this summer several people were promoted in order to better integrate communications and advancement staffs and handle alumni engagement.
The “A World of Good” campaign will have Eighmy and other advancement staff working on fundraising, she said mainly for endowed scholarships, and going into communities Central is a part of and tracking the university’s economic impact, which includes recording volunteer service hours from members of the Central campus. According to its website, the campaign has already raised nearly $46 million of its $50 million goal.
“For us at Central, it’s always been about our students first, and they’re really at the heart of most of our decisions,” Eighmy said.
While Putnam said the job of reorganization may be done for now, he is still looking ahead to what could impact university operations in the future. One area which Putnam said could impact the university, and in some ways already is, is AI and its applications both in the classroom and business office.
Changes Central may or may not have to make in the future could come less from an internal need to shift things and more from society as it evolves and its wants change.
“Do I think there’s going to be more organizational development? Absolutely,” Putnam said. “I just don’t know what it’s going to look like.”

(Quenton King | Courtesy photo)Representatives with the United Coal Workers of America have condemned a federal court’s decision to continue delaying the implementation of a federal rule to lower coal miners’ exposure to dangerous silica dust, calling the pushback “bureaucratic cowardice.”
The silica dust rule — finalized under the U.S. Department of Labor and the Mine Safety and Health Administration last year — should have gone into effect on Monday after being delayed for the first time in April.
But now the rule has yet again been pushed back to at least October due to a previous temporary injunction issued by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in response to a request from the National Sand, Stone and Gravel Association to block the rule’s implementation completely.
The rule would have gone into effect on Monday only for coal mines; the NSSGA — along with several other industry groups who joined the organization in its request — would not have been impacted by the new regulations until 2027, per the rule.

Meanwhile, as the rule is delayed, more and more coal miners are working in dusty conditions known to cause and exacerbate black lung disease.
“This is bureaucratic cowardice, plain and simple,” said UMWA International Secretary-Treasurer Brian Sanson. “We’ve buried too many friends, too many fathers, and too many sons because of black lung. Bowing to corporate interests doesn’t solve the problem; it puts more miners at risk. The science is clear, the rule is needed, and the delay is shameful.”
Other industries have had similar protections in place for their workers for years due to settled science showing the dangers posed by constant exposure to silica dust.
“This delay is simply a death sentence for more miners,” said UMWA International President Cecil E. Roberts. “The fact that an industry association with no stake in coal mining can hold up lifesaving protections for coal miners is outrageous. The Department of Labor and MSHA should be fighting to implement this rule immediately, not kicking enforcement down the road yet again. Every day they delay, more miners get sick, and more miners die. That’s the truth.”

Black lung has no cure. Experts say the most effective way to stop the disease from forming or from evolving into a more complicated case is to limit exposure to silica dust.
The finalized silica dust rule, if implemented, would cut the exposure limits for coal miners in half for the first time ever. It would also impose new penalties for mines that operate out of compliance and require companies to offer free medical monitoring for their workers with the hope of detecting black lung and other respiratory diseases earlier.
Coal miners and advocates for people with black lung have been directly fighting since at least 2009 for industry protections against the disease.
Rebecca Shelton, director of policy for the Appalachian Citizens’ Law Center, said the continued delay of the rule shows that “the Trump Administration and the coal companies are seemingly working hand-in-hand to slow down the process and weaken future protections.”
“These delays and efforts to weaken the rule are a disgrace, and undermine the claims of anyone in the Trump Administration who claims to be on the side of coal miners,” Shelton said.
While the rule is being continuously delayed, President Donald Trump has called for the country to increase coal production.
But coal miners in Central Appalachia and beyond are already seeing higher rates of black lung than any time in the previous 25 years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The disease is also hitting coal miners at younger ages than ever before due to a lack of easily accessible coal. Today, miners must cut through more layers of silica-rich sandstone to reach the coal that remains in existing seams, creating dustier conditions that increases their risk of developing black lung.
“Every American worker deserves to come home from work with their lungs intact, miners included,” Roberts said. “It’s as simple as that.”

State Ports Authority)MOUNT PLEASANT — Tariff uncertainties dented cargo numbers at the Port of Charleston last month, although the drop was in line with State Ports Authority expectations.
And, overall, the maritime agency finished its most recent fiscal year with an increase in containers.
“We’ll see,” Barbara Melvin, the authority’s president and CEO, said when asked about the impact of the Trump administration’s wide-ranging and on-again, off-again tariffs on foreign imports.
European imports to see 15% tariffs after Trump strikes trade deal

“There has certainly been a responsiveness in importers to watch the implementation of tariff deals as well as what might come in the future,” Melvin said. “I think, just as in any economic cycle that we have endured, the port — because of our infrastructure investments — will come out on the strong side of that.”
The port finished fiscal 2025, which ended June 30, handling a little more than 1.4 million containers of all sizes – up 2.3% from the previous 12-month period.
But in July, the first month of the new fiscal year, the port moved 117,059 cargo containers of all sizes through its terminals. That’s a nearly 6% drop from the same month a year ago.
Containers that arrived at the port loaded with goods declined by 7.5% year-over-year.
How all of that translates into money for South Carolina’s economic driver is unclear. The port’s financial numbers for the fiscal year will come out next month.
“I think that, obviously, there’s a substantial amount of uncertainty that we’re seeing” among shippers, Phil Padgett, the authority’s chief financial officer and vice president of administration, told the agency’s board of directors during a meeting Tuesday.
Depending on how tariffs play out, the port could see cargo levels land somewhere between an 8% loss and a 6% gain by the time the current fiscal year ends next June, according to an analysis by Joey Von Nessen, a research economist at the University of South Carolina.
The authority is projecting containerized cargo will be flat year-over-year.
Melvin said Charleston’s port could see import growth in the coming months as retailers look to stock their shelves with holiday-related merchandise. A 90-day pause in tariff hikes on Chinese goods, announced earlier this month, will likely help those numbers.
“Chinese imports have stayed steady during the first quarter of our fiscal year,” Melvin said.
Another boost could come from two new container line services that will start stopping at Charleston’s port in September.
Mediterranean Shipping Co. will add weekly calls on both its Albatross and Dragon services linking the port with stops in Europe, the Mediterranean and Asia. Ships on those routes can carry up to 15,000 cargo boxes measured in 20-foot equivalents.

The national outlook isn’t as bright.
U.S. ports are expected to see a year-over-year 5.6% decline in imported cargo by the end of this year, according to the National Retail Federation and Hackett Associates, a maritime consultant.
“Tariffs are beginning to drive up consumer prices, and fewer imports will eventually mean fewer goods on store shelves,” Jonathan Gold, the federation’s vice president of supply chain and customs policy, said in a written statement. “Small businesses especially are grappling with the ability to stay in business.”
The forecast comes as tariffs on dozens of countries around the world that had been announced, postponed and then finally enacted after months of negotiations and deals began to take effect.
“Friends, allies and foes are all being hit by distortions in trade flows as importers try to second-guess tariff levels by pulling forward imports before the tariffs take effect,” analyst Ben Hackett said in a statement.
Hackett said the result will be “a downturn in trade volumes by late September because inventories for the holiday season will already be in hand.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/wando-welch-1024x575.jpg,,,2025-08-19 16:56:23.755042

Expanded use of mobile centers, which can be set up in rural areas that are miles away from brick-and-mortar clinics, are seen as a way to address access challenges. 
“We know that transportation is a tremendous barrier to people in this state receiving treatment particularly in rural parts of our state where there is a lack of public transportation and there are long distances between clinics and where people live,” said First Lady Anna Stein, who spoke at the mobile center’s unveiling Tuesday. 
“Mobile units can help alleviate burdens felt in our rural areas,” she said. “They also have the potential to serve highly vulnerable and harder to access populations such as people living in shelters or in jails.” 
The Morse Clinics, founded by Dr. Eric Morse, runs the clinic parked outside Healing Transitions in Raleigh.
Stein called him a leader in advocating for mobile opioid treatment programs in the state. 
The state’s rules have staffing and counseling requirements for the mobile units. They are considered extensions of brick-and-mortar programs and must operate within 75 miles of a clinic. 
Healing Transitions offers a long-term recovery program for Wake County residents. Having the mobile unit on its campus puts medications and counseling within easy walking distance of the main building. However, it’s not necessary to be in a Healing Transitions program to use the van. 
More mobile units may be open by the end of the year.  
Vaya Health, the regional mental health agency with a footprint in western and central North Carolina, plans to use Hurricane Helene recovery money for six units. 
Three more mobile units sponsored by private providers could be open in Greensboro, Charlotte, and Raleigh by the end of the year, according to a state Department of Health and Human Services news release. 
Fifty-five of the state’s 100 counties have at least one opioid treatment clinic.
Morse said he sees using mobile units to help scout locations for future brick-and-mortar programs. 
“I see mobile units as an opportunity to set up locations in places where we’re not sure whether or not they’ll be successful,” he said. “If it is, great, we’ll keep it here. If it’s really successful. We might actually build a clinic here. And if it’s not successful we can just move it to another location.”
County data on the location of overdose deaths can point to places where opioid treatment programs are needed, he said. 
“It makes sense to target where people are dying and need our help the most,” Morse said. 
Stein said one of her missions is to reduce the stigma surrounding mental health and substance use disorders. 
“That stigma has too often resulted in a lack of access to medication-assisted treatment,” she said. “Methadone and buprenorphine, medications provided in our opioid treatment programs, are gold standard treatments for opioid use disorder, and everyone who can benefit from these medications should have access to them.”
Stigma is one of the reasons people don’t seek help, said Kelly Crosbie, director of the Division of Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities and Substance Use Services at DHHS. 
Part of the stigma comes from the claim that medication-assisted treatment substitutes one drug for another. 
“That’s just silly,” Crosbie said. People aren’t made to feel ashamed for taking medication to treat diabetes or heart conditions, she said. 
“Methadone and other medications for opioid use disorder save lives,” Crosbie said. “They help people maintain long-term recovery. To have the lives they were meant to have.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_4697-1024x587.jpg,,,2025-08-19 16:56:23.755042

(Photo by Clark Corbin/Idaho Capital Sun)Idaho Department of Lands officials are seeking to balance state-mandated budget cuts that almost all state agencies face this year with the desire to provide the aggressive and safe wildfire response Idahoans expect, state officials said. 
Idaho governor calls on state agencies to cut budgets by 3%

On Friday, Idaho Gov. Brad Little issued an executive order requiring all state agencies, other than public schools, to reduce spending by 3% in the current fiscal year 2026, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported.
During an interview Tuesday at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise, Idaho Department of Lands Director Dustin Miller confirmed the department is subject to the 3% cuts. 
“The 3% holdback planning work is occurring right now,” Miller said. “Nothing’s been finalized, but we are making sure that we continue to maintain strong initial attacks (in response to wildfire) and a robust firefighting force, because we’ve got another four weeks or so – knock on wood – of fire season left. So we’re going to continue to ensure that we’re making the necessary proposals to reduce our general fund component of our budget by 3%, while at the same time still providing that same level of fire protection and services for our customers and the public.”
The Idaho Legislature already low-balled the amount of state funding available to fight wildfires this year. During the 2025 legislative session, Idaho legislators approved a one-time $40 million transfer to the state’s Fire Suppression Deficiency Fund. 
The $40 million is less than Little requested and less than the $58 million the state spent fighting wildfires during the long and difficult 2024 fire season, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
 How much has Idaho spent fighting wildfires this year?

So far this year, the state has accrued about $18.9 million in total fire season costs, Miller told Little and members of the Idaho State Board of Land Commissioners during the land board’s monthly meeting Tuesday.
Little’s executive order on the budget holdbacks and the state’s overall revenue situation are also having an effect on the Idaho Department of Land’s upcoming 2027 budget request that officials will submit to the state by the end of this month.

Miller shared documents with the State Board of Land Commissioners showing that the department was preparing to request new general fund budget enhancements totalling $1.9 million with three new full-time positions for 2027. However, after meeting with the Idaho Division of Financial Management about the state’s budget guidance, the department is reducing next year’s general fund budget request to just $16,600 in new, ongoing general fund spending, an increase of 0.14%. The $16,600 is just enough to cover inflation and a 1% change in employee compensation pay increase for timber protection associations that fight fires, land board meeting documents show. 
“This is a maintenance budget only,” Miller told the Land Board, borrowing the phrase “maintenance of operations budget” that state legislators now use to refer to a bare-bones budget that is basically just intended to keep the lights on.
 Why are Idaho state agencies forced to cut their budgets in the middle of the year?

The decision to reduce state agency budgets by 3% came just months after Little and the Idaho Legislature reduced the amount of revenue available to spend in the state budget by more than $450 million during the 2025 legislative session so they could cut taxes and pay for a new tax credit that reimburses families for education expenses including tuition at private, religious schools.

Additionally, state revenues have come in below the projections the Idaho Legislature set in building the state budget several times in recent months. 
Most recently, state revenues came in $39.1 million below the state’s new projection for the month of July, which is the first month of the current 2026 fiscal year. That’s a miss of nearly a full 10%, according to the Idaho General Fund Revenue Report for July that the Idaho Division of Financial Management released Friday. 
By law, all state agencies must submit their budget requests for next year to the state by Sept. 1.

(Exhibits from Iowa District Court files) Lawyers for the family of an Iowa woman murdered by her estranged husband say that had it not been for Bellevue police officers’ “deliberate refusal to enforce the law” and “arrest their buddy,” the woman would be alive today.
The family of the late Angela Prichard sued the Bellevue city police in 2024, arguing that despite Christopher Prichard’s well-established pattern of defying court orders and behaving in a threatening manner, city police repeatedly failed to enforce a no-contact order against him in the summer and fall of 2022.

Shortly before 8 a.m. on Oct. 8, 2022, the Jackson County Sheriff’s Office responded to a 911 call from the Mississippi Ridge Kennels where Angela Prichard worked. When police arrived, Angela Prichard was found dead from a gunshot wound to the chest. She was 55 years old.
The next day, Christopher Prichard was located in a Jackson County residence with the murder weapon and ammunition still in his possession. He was later convicted of murder in the first degree.
The lawsuit claimed the murder was the result of a “state-created danger” caused by the malfeasance, reckless or intentional behavior of the Bellevue Police Department. It accused city police officers of “showing favoritism toward Christopher Prichard,” and alleged that his friendly relationship with the police “enabled and fostered” his ability to murder his estranged wife.
In October, the chief judge of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa, C.J. Williams, dismissed the family’s lawsuit, writing that he was “skeptical that more aggressive conduct by the officers would have changed anything.”

The judge said the position of the plaintiffs seemed to be that “had the officers arrested Christopher more often, it would have prevented Angela’s murder. Arguably, one could equally speculate that it was the officers’ arrest of Christopher for violating the no-contact order that angered him enough to kill Angela.”
David O’Brien, the Cedar Rapids attorney for Angela Prichard’s family, has appealed that ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.
In court filings, O’Brien says Christopher Prichard “avoided a lengthy jail sentence solely because of the defendants’ deliberate refusal to enforce the law … Had the defendants held (Christopher Prichard) accountable for even a fraction of his unlawful conduct — like they would any other defendant — he would have been incarcerated and Angela would be alive.”
O’Brien also says the city’s “repeated and intentional violations” of the Iowa Open Records Law and federal civil procedure involve efforts by the city to “intentionally conceal” information about the matter.
Plaintiffs point to inaction by the city police
In a brief filed with the appellate court, O’Brien includes what he calls a “list of critical pleaded facts, entirely ignored by the defendants on appeal,” that should overcome any deficiencies in the case cited by Judge Williams.
Among those alleged facts:
— Christopher Prichard was out on bail for a felony offense, and his bail could have been revoked at any time for unlawful behavior, placing him behind bars at the time he murdered Angela Prichard.
— The police allowed Christopher Prichard “to get away with another Class C felony after he placed a tracking device in Angela’s car, a serious breach of (his) bail requirements that would have resulted in prolonged pre-trial incarceration and a ten-year prison sentence if convicted.”
— There were at least four documented violations of the temporary restraining order that were “ignored” by the police, any one of which could have led to bail revocation or a prison sentence.
— Nine days before the killing, then-Jackson County Attorney Sara Davenport wrote an email to the police advising them that Christopher Prichard had until 2 p.m. the next day to report to jail. “If he does not report I will be requesting a warrant,” she wrote. “I wanted all of you to be aware as I’m afraid he might try to do something tonight.” The next day, she wrote to the police, “Prichard did not show for (jail) and a warrant has been issued!” The police department’s failure to act on that warrant demonstrates the department’s “complete disregard for foreseeable harm,” O’Brien alleges.
In his appellate brief, O’Brien goes on to state that in the week before the murder, the police opted not to arrest Christopher Prichard but did find time to escort “a large vehicle” through town, chaperone a high school dance, make six traffic stops, perform funeral escorts and investigate complaints of a sick-looking raccoon and a growling dog.
It’s reasonable to infer from those actions, O’Brien argues, that city police officers “intentionally avoided arresting their buddy, Christopher Prichard, and there was not a competing resource allocation issue preventing them from doing so.”
City: We’re not liable for ‘murder committed by a third party’
In its brief to the appellate court, the city has argued that the plaintiffs’ assertion of due-process violations fails because, as other courts have held, the state’s failure to protect an individual against violence at the hands of another person does not constitute a violation of due process rights.
Under prevailing law, the Constitution only requires that the government protect a private individual in two circumstances: when the individual is in government custody, or when the government, through its actions, has fostered a state-created danger.
The city’s lawyers note that while Judge Williams recognized allegations related to inaction by the police, there was no evidence to show the police “affirmatively acted” to put Angela Prichard at increased risk.
Lawyers for the city also argue that even if the police had arrested Christopher Prichard prior to the murder, “this does not guarantee that the tragic outcome of this case would have been any different,” noting that prosecutors or judges might have dismissed any case initiated by the officers or simply released Prichard from custody.
“Plaintiffs ask this court to hold the defendants liable for an intentional murder committed by a third party,” lawyers for the city argue in their brief to the appellate court. “Implied in this demand is that the defendants be held liable for factors well outside their control …  This court should affirm the district court’s ruling.”

(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images).Self-driving vehicle technology continues to advance, prompting a wave of liability and safety regulations from state lawmakers.
This year, lawmakers in Arizona, Louisiana, Montana, Nevada and the District of Columbia enacted legislation to regulate driverless vehicles, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures.
While much of the legislation aims to update existing law to include new definitions for autonomous vehicles, other measures put rules in place regarding insurance, permitting, licensing and road testing.
In total, lawmakers in 25 states introduced 67 bills related to autonomous vehicles, according to the database. California, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania currently have bills under consideration. Alaska, Delaware and Washington have bills that will be carried over into the next legislative session.
Governors vetoed two measures this year. Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis shot down a measure that would have required a driver to be present in any commercial vehicle being operated by an automated driving system.
Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed a measure that would have put rules in place for “high-risk artificial intelligence systems,” but would have excluded “autonomous vehicle technology” from that category.
As of now, there are no vehicles that have achieved full autonomy, according to the Society of Automotive Engineers’ criteria. But several car companies have introduced automated driving features, allowing drivers to take their hands off the wheel.
Tesla is rolling out its Full Self-Driving feature, a system under which a vehicle can drive itself almost anywhere with minimal intervention from the driver. Tesla Autopilot, which the company made available to the public in late 2024, also helps with basic vehicle maneuvering.
And Waymo, the country’s first autonomous ride-hailing service, is currently operating in Atlanta; Austin, Texas; Los Angeles; Phoenix and San Francisco. The robo-taxi company plans to expand to Miami and Washington, D.C., next.
According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, vehicle safety is the main benefit of driverless cars. With higher levels of automation, there is less room for human error or driver distractions. The new technology also could improve safety for bicyclists and pedestrians, according to the agency.
But driverless cars have been involved in hundreds of accidents over the past few years. Between 2021 and 2024, there were 696 accidents reported that involved a Waymo vehicle, according to an analysis by California-based law firm DiMarco | Araujo | Montevideo.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma is a “blueprint” for Washington, D.C. of how to implement public-private partnerships in biotechnology, said a federal official who has been tasked with reviewing advancements in the industry. 
Michelle Rozo, vice chair of the National Security Commission on Emerging Biotechnology, said Oklahoma stands out from other states because of the collaboration between industries and the public-private partnerships in the state.
The Commission, which was established by Congress to advance the United States’ leadership in biotechnology, is traveling across the country to discuss how states are advancing biotechnology and understand how the group can best implement its recommendations. 
The main recommendation, Rozo said, is to maintain public-private partnerships in the biotechnology industry.
“I like to say we’re beginning to be able to program biology like we program computers, but the outcomes are going to have much more of a wide- reaching effect,” Rozo said. “‘When you program computers, you just get ones and zeros out. When you program biology, you get medicines, you get food, you get materials, you get treatments. … The limits almost do not exist.”
Rozo was joined by a handful of other commissioners, including Republican U.S. Rep. Stephanie Bice, during a stop in Oklahoma City on Tuesday as part of a nationwide roadshow to discuss how biotechnology advancements could shape national defense. The Commission provides recommendations about the intersection of national security and biotechnology, which uses biology or living organisms to develop new products and technologies or improve existing ones. 
The commission in April offered Congress a series of recommendations. 
Representatives from Oklahoma State University, the University of Oklahoma and the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation spoke about the importance of higher education in pushing innovation in biotechnology forward. Research at these institutions ranges from food security and supply chain resiliency to developing medical treatments and devices. 
The commission also heard from state leaders about strategies to create hands-on learning opportunities and address gaps in the workforce. 
The greatest need is more talent and researchers in Oklahoma to push for innovation, but it can be difficult to draw them when most research dollars go to institutions on the East and West Coasts, officials said. 
When asked about federal cuts to research grants and higher education, Bice said Congress “isn’t interested” in huge cuts to research. 
“We recognize that research at large, whether it is through organizations like OMRF or organizations like OU and OSU that are doing really innovative things, is important,” Bice said. “And we’ll continue to invest in those things moving forward.”
Since President Donald Trump took office in January, his administration has proposed cutting over $1 billion from the National Institutes of Health, which conducts and supports medical research. Some of the proposals have faced legal challenges. 
Bice said the commission is on the road to highlight the importance of biotechnology and address the role Oklahoma can play in addressing challenges the U.S. faces in national security.

Miller,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/08/newsom-redistricting-republican-lawsuit/,"California Democrats used a common legislative tactic called ""gut and amend"" to rush legislation for a special election on new election maps. Republicans say that violates the state constitution.","In summary
California Democrats used a common legislative tactic called “gut and amend” to rush legislation for a special election on new election maps. Republicans say that violates the state constitution.


A group of California Republicans is suing the state to block the Democratic-controlled Legislature from considering the bills that would allow Gov. Gavin Newsom to facilitate a special election on gerrymandered congressional maps. 
The legal action could slow down the process by which elections officials, already tight on time, get the maps onto Californians’ ballots for the Nov. 4 special election Newsom wants. But that depends on how quickly the California Supreme Court moves, and whether it suspends the process while considering the lawsuit.
Newsom needs voter approval for the maps because California has an independent redistricting commission that draws election maps after every census. He’s in a hurry to get the measure on the ballot as a response to Republican gerrymandering efforts in Texas that are intended to sway the 2026 congressional elections in the GOP’s — and President Donald Trump’s — favor.
The Republicans argue that Democratic leaders violated the state constitution by bypassing a rule that says with few exceptions legislation must be publicly available for 30 days before lawmakers vote on it. 
To get the maps on the ballot, Democrats repurposed two existing bills rather than introduce new legislation that would trigger the 30-day window.
Sen. Tony Strickland, Republican of Huntington Beach and the lead lawmaker on the lawsuit, slammed Newsom and Democrats for drawing up a “backroom deal” with “ “no public input, no transparency, no light of day”
“If they did it right, they would have public hearings, public notice, they would get the authority from the people of California, and then they would draw the maps,” Strickland said.
The bills in question, Assembly Bill 604 and Senate Bill 280, were first introduced and given bill numbers in early February. The new language on the redistricting effort was posted early Monday morning. 
Chris Micheli, a longtime lobbyist, said lawmakers “for decades” have viewed a bill’s initial introduction date – often in early January near the start of session – as the date that starts the 30-day clock. For gut-and-amends, the Legislature abides by a different rule added to the state constitution by voters in 2016: the language needs to be published for 72 hours before lawmakers can vote.
“To be fair, it is untested and there’s no court decision on this,” Micheli said of Republicans’ lawsuit. But, “I don’t think it will succeed.”
Lawmakers frequently use the gut-and-amend tactic to skirt deadlines and introduce new legislation late in the season. Rarely, if ever, does the opposition party call on the California State Supreme Court to mediate what is otherwise a wonky game of insider legislative baseball.
But with the redistricting push, Republican lawmakers have doubled down on their defense of the state’s citizen redistricting commission, established in 2010 on a bipartisan basis to prevent politicians from drawing maps that are self-serving. 
“The public cannot have a voice if they do not know what’s going on,” said Assemblyman Carl DeMaio of San Diego, who is not party to the lawsuit. “What Governor Newsom and the legislators are trying to do is prevent the public from knowing what’s going on before it’s too late.”

(Getty Images)Representatives with the United Coal Workers of America have condemned a federal court’s decision to continue delaying the implementation of a federal rule to lower coal miners’ exposure to dangerous silica dust, calling the pushback “bureaucratic cowardice.”
The silica dust rule — finalized under the U.S. Department of Labor and the Mine Safety and Health Administration last year — should have gone into effect on Monday after being delayed for the first time in April.
But now the rule has yet again been pushed back to at least October due to a previous temporary injunction issued by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in response to a request from the National Sand, Stone and Gravel Association to block the rule’s implementation completely.
The rule would have gone into effect on Monday only for coal mines; the NSSGA — along with several other industry groups who joined the organization in its request — would not have been impacted by the new regulations until 2027, per the rule.
Meanwhile, as the rule is delayed, more and more coal miners are working in dusty conditions known to cause and exacerbate black lung disease. 
“This is bureaucratic cowardice, plain and simple,” said UMWA International Secretary-Treasurer Brian Sanson. “We’ve buried too many friends, too many fathers, and too many sons because of black lung. Bowing to corporate interests doesn’t solve the problem; it puts more miners at risk. The science is clear, the rule is needed, and the delay is shameful.”
Other industries have had similar protections in place for their workers for years due to settled science showing the dangers posed by constant exposure to silica dust. 
“This delay is simply a death sentence for more miners,” said UMWA International President Cecil E. Roberts. “The fact that an industry association with no stake in coal mining can hold up lifesaving protections for coal miners is outrageous. The Department of Labor and MSHA should be fighting to implement this rule immediately, not kicking enforcement down the road yet again. Every day they delay, more miners get sick, and more miners die. That’s the truth.”
Black lung has no cure. Experts say the most effective way to stop the disease from forming or from evolving into a more complicated case is to limit exposure to silica dust.
The finalized silica dust rule, if implemented, would cut the exposure limits for coal miners in half for the first time ever. It would also impose new penalties for mines that operate out of compliance and require companies to offer free medical monitoring for their workers with the hope of detecting black lung and other respiratory diseases earlier.
Coal miners and advocates for people with black lung have been directly fighting since at least 2009 for industry protections against the disease.
Rebecca Shelton, director of policy for the Appalachian Citizens’ Law Center, said the continued delay of the rule shows that “the Trump Administration and the coal companies are seemingly working hand-in-hand to slow down the process and weaken future protections.”
“These delays and efforts to weaken the rule are a disgrace, and undermine the claims of anyone in the Trump Administration who claims to be on the side of coal miners,” Shelton said.
While the rule is being continuously delayed, President Donald Trump has called for the country to increase coal production. 
But coal miners in Central Appalachia and beyond are already seeing higher rates of black lung than any time in the previous 25 years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
The disease is also hitting coal miners at younger ages than ever before due to a lack of easily accessible coal. Today, miners must cut through more layers of silica-rich sandstone to reach the coal that remains in existing seams, creating dustier conditions that increases their risk of developing black lung.
“Every American worker deserves to come home from work with their lungs intact, miners included,” Roberts said. “It’s as simple as that.”

(Pool photo by Bethany Baker/The Salt Lake Tribune) The Utah Board of Pardons and Parole has denied Ralph Menzies’ request for clemency, one of the death row inmate’s final appeals ahead of his execution scheduled for Sept. 5. 
The announcement came Tuesday afternoon, four days after the commutation hearing for the 67-year-old inmate, where board members heard arguments for and against granting Menzies mercy. 
Menzies is scheduled to die by firing squad after spending nearly four decades in prison for the 1986 murder of Maurine Hunsaker, a 26-year-old gas station clerk whom Menzies kidnapped. Hunsaker was brought up Big Cottonwood Canyon, where Menzies tied her to a tree, strangled her, then slashed her throat.

Last week, the Utah Board of Pardons and Parole conducted a two-day commutation hearing, listening to testimony from Menzies’ attorneys, the Utah Attorney General’s Office, and 10 victim representatives, including eight members of Hunsaker’s family. 
With death penalty cases, the board has the power to instead impose a sentence of life without the possibility of parole. The arguments don’t have to be legal — for instance, Menzies has terminal dementia, and his attorneys said that the state should simply allow him to die in prison, rather than his scheduled execution. 
But in a statement Tuesday, board members wrote that, “after carefully reviewing all submitted information and considering all arguments from the parties, the Board does not find cause to commute Mr. Menzies’ death sentence.”
The Utah Board of Pardons and Parole has never granted a death row inmate clemency. 
Menzies’ attorneys, in a statement, called the notion of executing a 67-year-old inmate with dementia a “grotesque spectacle” — meanwhile Matt Hunsaker, Maurine’s son, said he was “very pleased” with the ruling. 
‘He does not deserve two seconds more’: Victim’s family makes emotional plea to execute Menzies

With his execution less than three weeks away, the commutation hearing marked one of the final appeals for Menzies. His attorneys contend that his dementia makes him incompetent to be executed, and will argue their case before the Utah Supreme Court on Thursday. Utah Gov. Spencer Cox also has the power to delay the execution, though he cannot issue clemency. 
“Ralph Menzies is a 67-year-old man with progressively worsening dementia. He’s tethered to an oxygen tank, uses a wheelchair, is confused and disoriented, and no longer understands why Utah is trying to kill him,” said Lindsey Layer, one of Menzies’ attorneys. “This is reason enough to grant mercy.” 
In addition, Layer said the judge who sentenced Menzies later changed his mind, writing in a 2010 affidavit that he incorrectly applied the law that allowed for the death sentence, and should have instead sentenced him to life in prison. And, the Salt Lake County District Attorney’s independent Conviction Integrity Review Panel has since found that Menzies’ death sentence should be vacated, pointing to false testimony at the time of the trial. 
“Mr. Menzies’s record for nearly 40 years on death row confirms he poses no threat to anyone in prison if given a life without parole sentence. We will continue our fight to save his life to avoid a grotesque spectacle of shooting to death a severely debilitated man with dementia,” Layer said. 
Matt Hunsaker, in a text message to Utah News Dispatch, thanked the board, calling the decision one of the final hurdles. 
“This closed all but one door for his ability to get out of being executed. We look forward to going to the Supreme Court this week and again as a family,” he said.

He stands outside the Borden Avenue Veterans Residence, a short-term housing facility in the Long Island City neighborhood of Queens, N.Y., where he lives. Chavis relies on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and is worried about new work requirements for the program, commonly known as food stamps (Shalina Chatlani/Stateline).NEW YORK — After a year in the U.S. Navy, Loceny Kamara said he was discharged in 2023, because while on base he had developed mental health issues, including severe anxiety and nightmares, and had fallen into alcoholism.
Kamara, 23, went to rehab and managed to get sober for some time while living with family in the Bronx, he said. But after he lost his job as a security guard in December, Kamara was kicked out of his home. Now he lives at a veterans homeless shelter in Long Island City, a neighborhood in Queens, New York, and he relies on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — commonly known as food stamps — and odd jobs to make ends meet.
Each month, nearly 42 million people receive SNAP benefits to help supplement their grocery budgets. Able-bodied SNAP recipients who are between 18 and 54 and don’t have children have always been required to work. Veterans, however, have been exempt from those rules — but that’s about to change.
The giant domestic policy measure that President Donald Trump signed on July 4 eliminates that exemption. Beginning in 2026, veterans will have to prove they are working, volunteering, participating in job training, or looking for work for at least 80 hours a month to keep their food stamps beyond three months, unless they qualify for another exemption, such as having certain disabilities.
Republicans in Congress and conservatives who helped formulate the law say these eligibility changes are necessary to stop people who could be working from abusing the system. But critics say the change fails to take into account the barriers many veterans face, and that the new work rules will cause thousands of veterans to go hungry.
“I’m pissed. I mean, I cannot get a job. Nowhere to live,” said Kamara. As he spoke, Kamara pointed to his collared shirt, noting that he had just dressed up to interview for a job as a security guard. He learned that morning he hadn’t gotten the job.
“I’ve been out of work for eight months,” Kamara told Stateline. “It’s hard to get a job right now for everybody.”
Nationally, around 1.2 million veterans with lower incomes, or about 8% of the total veteran population of 16.2 million, rely on food stamps for themselves and their families, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research group.
An analysis by the group found veterans tend to have lower rates of employment because they are more likely to have health conditions, such as traumatic brain injuries, that make it difficult for them to work. They also tend to have less formal education, though many have specialized skills from their time in the military.
There has been a work requirement for most SNAP recipients since 1996. But Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, said the rules have “never really been enforced.” Rector argued that able-bodied people who have been exempt from the work requirement, such as veterans and homeless people, create an unnecessary burden on the system if they are capable of working but don’t.
“Most of the people that are in this category live in households with other people that have incomes, and so there really isn’t a chronic food shortage here,” Rector said in an interview. “We have tens of thousands of free food banks that people can go to. So it’s just a requirement to nudge these people in the proper direction, and it should no longer go unenforced.”
Darryl Chavis, 62, said that view ignores the difficulties that many veterans face. When Chavis left the U.S. Army at 21 after two years of service, he said, he was “severely depressed.”
“Nobody even came to help me,” said Chavis, who served as a watercraft operator, responsible for operating and maintaining tugboats, barges and other landing craft.
Chavis said he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, which has made it difficult for him to keep a job. He just moved back to New York from Virginia after leaving a relationship. He’s been at the housing shelter in Long Island City since January.
“What I’m trying to do is get settled in to, you know, stabilize into an apartment. I have the credentials to get a job. So it’s not like I’m not gonna look for a job. I have to work. I’m in transition, and the obstacles don’t make it easy,” Chavis said.
The new SNAP work rules apply to all able-bodied adults between 55 and 64 who don’t have dependents, and parents with children above the age of 14. Some groups, such as asylum-seekers and refugees, are no longer eligible for the program.
Barbara Guinn, commissioner of the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, estimates that around 300,000 New Yorkers could lose SNAP benefits due to work requirements. Of those, around 22,000 are veterans, homeless or aging out of foster care, she said. Almost 3 million New Yorkers relied on SNAP as of March 2025.
Veterans in other states are in a similar situation. In California, an estimated 115,000 veterans receive SNAP benefits, according to a study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The number is nearly 100,000 in Florida and Texas, and 49,000 in Georgia.
Between 2015 and 2019 about 11% of veterans between the ages of 18 and 64 lived in food insecure households, meaning they had limited or uncertain access to food, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP.
“We know that SNAP is the best way to help address hunger. It gets benefits directly to individuals,” Guinn said. “There are other ways that people can get assistance if they need it, through food banks or other charitable organizations, but we do not think that those organizations will have the capacity to pick up the needs.”
 A greater burden on states

In addition to the work rule changes, the new law reduces federal funding for SNAP by about $186 billion through 2034 — a cut of roughly 20%, according to the Congressional Budget Office, an independent research arm of Congress. The federal government expects the new work requirements to reduce SNAP spending by $69 billion as people who don’t comply are dropped from the rolls.
SNAP has historically been funded by the federal government, with states picking up part of the cost of administering the program. Under the new law, states will have to cover between 5% and 15% of SNAP costs starting in fiscal year 2028, depending on how accurately they distribute benefits to people who are eligible for the program.

“This has been a strategic agenda to dismantle SNAP and to blame states for doing so, because they knew they are making it so incredibly burdensome to run and operate and unaffordable,” said Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center, a poverty and hunger advocacy group.
“States are going to have to cut something, because there’s no surplus. There are no unlimited resources that states may have in order to be able to offset the harm.”
Guinn said New York expects to see a new cost burden of at least $1.4 billion each year. In California, new state costs could total as much as $3.7 billion annually, according to the California Department of Social Services.
Kaitlynne Yancy, director of membership programs at Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said many veterans with disabilities will not be able to fulfill the work requirements or find resources elsewhere. And it’s unclear whether states will be able to provide their own relief to people who are no longer exempted from work requirements or will be excluded from the program.
“It is a frustrating thing to see, especially for those that have been willing to put everything on the line and sacrifice everything for this country if their country called them to do so,” she said.
Yancy, 35, served in the U.S. Navy from 2010 to 2014. She began to use food stamps and the Medicaid program, the public health insurance program for people with lower incomes, as she navigated life’s challenges. They included going back to school to pursue her bachelor’s degree, becoming a single mother, and a leukemia diagnosis for one of her children. Frequent trips to the hospital made it hard for her to work steadily or attend school for 20 hours each week, she said.
Guinn said the new rules will create significant administrative challenges, too; even SNAP recipients who are working will struggle to prove it.
“Maybe they’re working one month, they have a job, and then their employer cuts their hours the next month,” Guinn told Stateline. “There are mechanisms for people to upload documentation as needed to demonstrate compliance with the program, but from an administrative standpoint, right now, we don’t have any super-high-tech automated way of doing this.”

The Trump administration has threatened the city over its sanctuary policies. City officials say some officers violated the policy by assisting in the arrests. (Photo courtesy of City of Rochester)The Trump administration is once again pressuring liberal cities and states to cooperate with deportation efforts, despite previous setbacks in court.
Attorney General Pam Bondi sent letters last week telling sanctuary states, cities and counties that “you better be abiding by our federal policies and with our federal law enforcement, because if you aren’t, we’re going to come after you,” she said in a Fox News interview. She demanded the areas answer her by Tuesday.
Cities and states with so-called sanctuary policies generally refuse to assist with immigration raids or accede to requests for local jails to hold prisoners for deportation. Those that responded to Stateline’s questions about the letters said they were not inclined to change their positions about cooperation with immigration authorities.
“It’s the tactic of a bully. And the only way to deal with a bully is to let them know that they’re not going to intimidate you,” Rhode Island Democratic Attorney General Peter Neronha said in a statement.
The Trump administration is attempting to force more cooperation with immigration arrests. But it suffered a serious court reversal on July 25, when a federal judge dismissed a sanctuary policies case against Illinois, Chicago and Cook County.
The state and local policies reflect a “decision to not participate in enforcing civil immigration law — a decision protected by the Tenth Amendment,” Judge Lindsay Jenkins wrote in an order now under appeal.
Bondi’s letters follow the Justice Department’s Aug. 5 release of a list of sanctuary jurisdictions including 12 states, the District of Columbia, four counties and 18 cities. That’s fewer jurisdictions than the 14 states and almost 500 counties and cities that appeared on an earlier list, which the agency withdrew after criticism that it included conservative counties that were fully cooperating with immigration enforcement.
The states on the new list are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington state. The list also includes some counties and cities in those states as well as in Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New Mexico.
Other federal courts have issued injunctions to at least temporarily stop Trump administration from withholding unrelated federal funding from governments that don’t cooperate on immigration. Cities, counties and states have filed lawsuits challenging Trump’s executive orders targeting sanctuary policies, including a February order that federal payments to states and localities must not “by design or effect, facilitate the subsidization or promotion of illegal immigration, or abet so-called ‘sanctuary’ policies that seek to shield illegal aliens from deportation.”
“The executive orders are directing agencies to basically take a maximalist approach to putting pressure on local governments to cooperate with immigration [enforcement], even though they’re not required to do so by federal law,” said Jonathan Miller, one of the attorneys working on the California case for the Public Rights Project, a California-based group promoting civil rights protections for states and cities.
One city on the administration’s list was Rochester, New York, which disciplined some police officers for helping federal agents make a March arrest in the city. The city already faces a lawsuit brought by the Trump administration that prominently mentions the arrest of three men from Guatemala; one of whom has since pleaded guilty to re-entering the United States after a previous deportation.

A spokesperson for the city, Barbara Pierce, said in a statement to The Guardian that, “Nothing in Attorney General Bondi’s letter is new and none of it has legal merit.”
“The letter reiterates many of the frivolous arguments that the federal government has already made in its pending suit against the city of Rochester,” she added. “These same arguments were levied against the city of Chicago and were dismissed by the federal district court for the eastern district of Illinois nearly a month ago.”
Ally Sullivan, a spokesperson for Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis, said in a statement that Colorado “is not a sanctuary state. The Governor continues to be frustrated by this mistaken and incorrect label.” In a televised interview earlier this year, Polis pointed out that Colorado fully cooperates with federal authorities on criminal matters. Immigration, he said, is a civil matter.
“In Colorado, we are improving public safety, apprehending dangerous criminals, cooperating with federal law enforcement on criminal investigations, and keeping our communities safe,” Sullivan said.
Nevertheless, Colorado faces a federal lawsuit brought by the administration over its alleged sanctuary policies. Polis signed a measure in May that limits local law enforcement’s communication with federal immigration authorities and restricts where federal authorities can operate within schools, child care facilities, hospitals and libraries without a judicial warrant.

Connecticut Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont in a statement said the state’s Trust Act, which the Trump administration has targeted as a sanctuary policy, was passed with bipartisan support and helps ensure local police concentrate on serious crimes. The Trust Act, passed in 2013 and expanded in 2019, limits information sharing and compliance with requests to detain immigrants for federal immigration authorities.
“Nothing about this makes Connecticut a sanctuary in any legal or practical sense — it makes our state one that upholds the Constitution, respects the rule of law, and prioritizes the safety and well-being of our communities,” Lamont said.

U.S. Agriculture officials announced a new initiative Monday to stop subsidies for solar energy panels that take up farmland while supporting cuts in agriculture grants to Tennessee universities.
Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins introduced the initiative by the Trump administration after a Future Farmers of America breakfast at the State Fairgrounds in Lebanon where she said the federal government will make new grants to bolster Tennessee farming while targeting grants that don’t help farmers’ production.
Rollins criticized the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act and “market distorting incentives” for solar panels, which she said are eliminating Tennessee farmland.
The secretary made the statements even though a study by the nonpartisan Tennessee Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations found that solar facilities aren’t likely to be the “primary driver” of development on farmland for decades. The study also determined that land can be returned to farming once a solar facility goes out of use.

Earlier this year, the federal government made dramatic cuts to higher education grants, including eliminating more than $31 million in funding to the University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture, which houses agricultural research and resources for Tennessee farmers and communities in 95 counties.
Rollins defended the reductions, saying “Those cuts were being made in programs that did not align with the president’s vision of putting farmers first.”
Deputy Secretary Stephen Vaden of Tennessee described the reduction as a “repurposing” and said changes were made in research funding based on whether a grant “helps a farmer in the field make more money.” Projects aimed at “clean energy” or based on “racial criteria” were eliminated, he said.
In addition to stopping solar panel development on farmland, Rollins announced that nearly $89 million will go toward 13 rural development projects in 28 Tennessee counties to “promote partnerships” and infrastructure investments for rural education. The department has distributed nearly $100 million this year to more than 10,000 farmers through the Emergency Commodity Assistance Program, according to Rollins.
Some farmers have said they expect prices to increase because of President Donald Trump’s tariffs, which are forcing them to pass on higher rates to customers. Rollins said Monday the administration has signed eight new trade agreements expected to boost the nation’s economy.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Other states should emulate Florida’s election laws, which have been changed twice following the 2020 election but still allow people to vote by mail, Gov. Ron DeSantis said Tuesday.
“So, we showed it can be done. I think our model is the best model for the country,” DeSantis said.
His remarks somewhat distanced the governor from President Donald Trump, who on Monday said administration lawyers are drafting  an executive order to eliminate mail-in voting. He made the announcement after Vladimir Putin told him the 2020 U.S. elections were rigged because of postal ballots. (Election laws are set at the state level and Trump cannot unilaterally end mail voting.)
DeSantis contended that Trump’s remarks were aimed more at other states.
“When [Trump] says vote-by-mail, I think, is the states like California and Nevada and others where they just send all these ballots out into the ether, basically, ” the governor said, alleging voting lists aren’t accurate in those states and they allow “ballot harvesting” by third parties, including volunteers or campaign workers.
Ballot harvesting — delivering mail-in ballots belonging to anyone except the single voter and immediate family members — is a third-degree felony in Florida, punishable by five years in prison and $5,000 in fines.
Voting-rights groups have long used ballot harvesting to get out the vote but DeSantis demonized it after the 2020 elections and again Tuesday.
The “mass voting of ballots has been a huge mistake and I don’t think that they’re adequate safeguards on that, when you start talking about the Californias and the Nevadas, and so I think it should be discontinued.”
First round of changes
Trump lost the 2020 election to former president Joe Biden. Trump, at the time the incumbent, alleged widespread fraud, an assertion that has been repeatedly debunked.
While DeSantis acknowledged in 2023 that Trump lost the election, he initially dodged answering the question and focused his efforts on changing the state’s election laws.
And the Legislature delivered in early 2021 with SB 90. The changes include requiring voters to show ID and provide the last digits of their Social Security numbers to request a vote-by-mail ballot.
SB 90 also restricted the locations of drop boxes for ballots to be returned to the local supervisor of elections office or at an early-voting location during early voting hours. Or via the U.S. Mail, FedEx, UPS, or another mail carrier.
The law bars anyone other than poll workers from distributing food or water to people in line within 150 feet of a polling place or drop box.
Challenges and more changes
The League of Women Voters and other voting- and civil-rights organizations successfully challenged SB 90 in court, arguing the changes suppressed voting by Blacks voters, Latino voters, and others.
In a 288-page ruling, U.S. District Judge Mark Walker in Tallahassee barred the state and county supervisors of elections from enforcing, among other things, the ban on supplying food and water to people waiting in line to vote and limiting the use of drop boxes.
Walker also ordered the state to clear any future changes in voting laws during the next 10 years with him. But the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eleventh  Circuit largely reversed Walker’s decision.
Before DeSantis’s 2022 historic landslide re-election, the Legislature in early 2022 passed another round of election law changes in SB 254. That bill established an elections crimes unit. He said he worked on the initiative with his then-chief of staff, now-Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier.
It “has actually brought people to justice for violating election law. Illegal aliens voting, people voting in multiple jurisdictions, people that have been convicted of homicide and sexual assault illegally voting, and those folks have actually been brought to justice in Florida,” DeSantis said.

A recent National Association of Realtors report found affordability increased slightly from last year, but the typical family is still priced out in the West and Northeast. (Photo by Madison McVan/Minnesota Reformer)Housing became more affordable this June, as higher incomes and slightly lower interest rates overcame higher prices, according to a National Association of Realtors report.
However, the South and the Midwest are the only regions where a family with typical or median income can afford a median-priced house, according to the report. The group considers a mortgage to be affordable if the monthly payment (principal and interest) is 25% or less of the family’s income.



The affordability gap is highest in the West, where the typical family income is $113,783, just over two-thirds of the $164,832 that would be needed to purchase a median-priced home.
The Northeast, where the typical family makes $114,559, is also unaffordable by this measure, as a median-priced home requires an income of $141,264.
In the Midwest, the median family income is $102,419, more than the $86,256 needed to buy a median-priced home. The same is true in the South, where the median income is $97,812, slightly more than the $96,720 required to buy a typical home.
Nationally, affordability increased slightly compared with June of 2024, with the typical family making $105,431, about 94% of the $111,648 it would need to buy the median-priced home. That’s up from about 92% in June 2024.
In a video posted Aug. 15, Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors, said he expects lower interest rates to increase affordability in the months ahead.
“We know that mortgage rates will be coming down and that will bring additional buyers into the market. We just need to make sure we have more supply, more supply to meet that demand,” Yun said.

,Mississippi Today,2025-08-19 19:51:55+00:00,Mississippi Today,Setting the runway or flying the plane in Jackson’s economic development department,Molly Minta,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/08/19/setting-the-runway-or-flying-the-plane-in-jacksons-economic-development-department/,"In a city that struggles with poverty, low educational attainment and suburban competition, the lack of development justifies the lack of development, a paradox that has faced nearly every leader of the city of Jackson’s planning and development department in recent years.","If it weren’t for Drake, a row of abandoned homes next to Jackson State University might still just be sitting there, slipping into disrepair.
About a month ago, two real estate investors from California bought them up – a deal facilitated by the city’s former planning and development director Jhai Keeton, who met the pair through connections he had made working on tour logistics for the Canadian rapper. 
Keeton did this off the clock in part because he wanted to prove that something, anything, could happen in the economically stagnant city. 
But if another developer tried to rehab the properties through a more traditional route – that is, by securing a bank loan – Keeton said they might be out of luck. In recent years, so few homes have sold in this area of Jackson, it’s impossible to get what’s called a “comparable,” a measurement of a property’s value that without, banks won’t issue a loan. 
“It ain’t no comp because a bank ain’t financing any new thing to be built for somebody to buy,” said Keeton, who headed up the crucial city department for just a year.
In a city that struggles with poverty, low educational attainment and suburban competition, the lack of development justifies the lack of development, a paradox that has faced nearly every leader of the city of Jackson’s planning and development department in recent years.  
“The rule of money often is that money goes where it can grow,” said Mukesh Kumar, a former professor of urban planning who led the city department from 2017 to 2019. 
This problem isn’t going away any time soon, even as Jackson’s newly elected Mayor John Horhn had pledged to make the city more business friendly. His search for a new planning and development director has gone national, but with low salaries at City Hall, it might be hard to entice the leader Jackson needs to come work in the fastest shrinking large city in America. 
When that’s the case, what can any one head of the city’s planning and development department even do to turn the tide? Former department heads agree – it takes gumption, social capital and a good deal of finagling to bring development to a city as statistically challenged as Jackson: High poverty rates, low property values and poor economic mobility.
“People are always like why don’t we have this, why don’t we have that,” said Jordan Hillman, who served as director from 2019 to 2022 and is now the chief data officer at JXN Water. “Well, it’s math.” 
Historically, Jackson’s planning and development department has focused more on the process, pushing through zoning and permitting documents and writing comprehensive plans. That’s because most development in a city is led by the private market, not the government. 
“Rarely do cities drive economic development,” said Chloe Dotson, who led the department from 2022 to 2024. “It’s questionable to even look at a city, and say, ‘well why isn’t a city pushing economic development?’ That’s not its job.” 
The department’s goal, then, is to work to make a city’s conditions favorable for private development. When Kumar led the department, he said he tried to change its mindset from regulating to enabling, even as much of its work was purely administrative: issuing grants, conducting code enforcement or overseeing the bus system. 
For big businesses that want to come to Jackson, Kumar said the planning and development’s role was to “get out of the way” or offer an incentive, like tax-increment financing, that could help them locate in the city while turning a profit. 
But Kumar felt the department needed to do a better job of fostering the city’s small businesses. 
“The businesses that are not making the market-driven decisions, they’re making the personal decisions,” he said. “They may not even know they need a business license.” 
Dotson had a similar philosophy: “We can’t create demand, but we can shape it,” she said. 
Keeton, whose background is in economic development, not planning, took somewhat of a different course. Starting at the city in 2020 as a deputy director in the department, Keeton said he wanted to fly the plane, not set the runway. 
“I’m trying to get out of the abandoned group,” he said. “I’m at the bottom. I might make more money than my peers, but I’m trying to engage in power.” 
He found his taste for big-picture ideas aligned with former Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba’s. The former mayor, who lost reelection last spring, found in Keeton a staffer who would prioritize a pair of long-held dreams: bringing a Top Golf and a Dave and Busters to Jackson.
“He was looking for some family-type of entertainment,” Keeton said. 
Keeton quickly realized that Jackson’s math didn’t compute for attracting Dave and Busters. But Top Golf seemed more promising — especially if the city could make it happen at a site on Lakeland Drive, one of the busiest corridors in the state, in a part of Jackson where residents have more disposable income. 
Though Keeton said the demographic data supported the project, state-owned institutions in the area opposed it. Top Golf ultimately went the way of other developments pitched for this particular site — to Madison County. 
“There’s not really much you can do when the institution shuts you out,” Keeton said. 
The day the news hit social media two years ago, Keeton was leaving Atlantic City. He said he texted Lumumba, “Mayor, I need you to help me to determine how to feel about this. He said ‘I feel just like you, I’m deflated, it sucks that we didn’t even get an attempt to play the game.’” 
It seemed that everywhere Keeton turned in his department, something was out of his control. After a stint at the Mississippi Development Authority, Keeton returned to the city as director in 2024.
Could he bring a shopping center to downtown Jackson? “We don’t have an after five population in downtown Jackson,” he said. 
Could he work with small businesses to help them meet Jackson’s regulations for storefronts in downtown Jackson? “We only have four, five inspectors for the whole city.” 
Then there was “the famous RFQ,” he said. 
The vacant lot across from the downtown Jackson Convention Center, the site of decades of failed development, was another task on Keeton’s plate.
But after the prospective hotel development became the center of an FBI corruption probe that led to federal indictments against Lumumba, the county prosecutor and two council members, Keeton said he couldn’t talk about the project because “it was political.”

He decided to do something different. Keeton said he asked himself, “What do we have the resources to do right now without waiting for a $100 million deal?”
A project known as “The Pulse at Farish Street” was born. The goal was to turn the lot into an outdoor space with a skate park and pickleball courts that would attract more people to downtown Jackson, to provide a justification for building another hotel in the future. 
Then Lumumba lost reelection. Keeton got a text that Horhn would not be keeping him on as director. The new administration quickly announced it was abandoning The Pulse and turning the vacant lot into a “functional, upgraded parking area,” the Clarion Ledger reported.
Keeton has returned to his consulting firm, including working with One Voice, a civic engagement nonprofit born out of the state’s NAACP and headed up by Lumumba’s reelection campaign manager. 
Keeton considers breaking ground at The Pulse to be one of his biggest accomplishments in his year leading the office. His other was working with the 1% Sales Tax Commission to unlock funds to repave the roads around the Northwest Industrial Park in northeast Jackson. 
“That is a huge win,” Keeton said. “Site development is the name of the game.”                                                                          
Creative solutions exist to combat Jackson’s data doldrums. In areas of the city that lack “comps”, Dotson said investors who are shut out from traditional lending could turn to programs like the low-income housing tax credit to help them build rental properties tenants can eventually own. 
“I am not as pessimistic,” said Dotson, who is now the chief program officer at the HOPE Enterprise Corporation. “I believe that Jackson can do whatever it wants to do. It just has to have the correct leaders and it has to have the correct partnerships and the right people that know what they’re doing.” 
The secret to overcoming a city’s bad math, Kumar said, is twofold: A mindset shift that can lead to “momentum.”
“It is real,” he said. 
But a city’s priorities change when leadership turns over.
Recently, Kumar, who now works in planning in Waco, Texas, said he was looking at satellite images of Congress street in downtown Jackson, where he’d deployed a small grant the city received to build wooden benches, tables and an archway that became a popular destination for graduation pictures.

Photo by Rilyn Eischens/Minnesota Reformer. An anti-pipeline demonstrator convicted of a felony is entitled to a new trial after the Minnesota Court of Appeals ruled Monday that the prosecutor’s repeated misconduct robbed her of a fair trial.
A jury in Aitkin County found Mylene Vialard, 56, guilty of felony obstruction of legal process for tying herself to another demonstrator in a 25-foot structure to protest the Enbridge Line 3 replacement pipeline in 2021. The appeals court ruled the jury’s decision may have been tainted by the prosecutor’s “pervasive” misconduct, including telling the jury to weigh facts not in evidence.
“It is rare for the system to hold prosecutors accountable, even though the system is all about accountability,” Vialard’s attorney Claire Glenn said. “We’re hopeful this will be the end of the road for Mylene’s case.”
The decision is the latest rebuke of Garrett Slyva, a former Aitkin County assistant attorney who oversaw numerous since-dismissed prosecutions of Line 3 protesters including prominent Ojibwe activist Winona LaDuke.
Slyva left the Aitkin County Attorney’s Office in April 2024, according to his LinkedIn page, just before he was suspended from practicing law by the Minnesota Supreme Court for 30 days. The suspension stemmed from misconduct in North Dakota, where Slyva sexually harassed two jailed female defendants while working for the Fargo Public Defender Office, the court found. He was fired and reprimanded by the North Dakota Supreme Court and then suspended in Minnesota.
The Aitkin County Attorney’s Office and Slyva did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
  Photos included in court filings show law enforcement officers removing Mylene Vialard and another anti-pipeline protester from a structure on an access road that led to the Line 3 pump station.
Enbridge’s Line 3 replacement pipeline stretching across northern Minnesota was the source of widespread protests led by Indigenous activists during its planning and construction, leading to hundreds of arrests and charges.
The criminal proceedings have carried on for years after the protests ended and the pipeline began carrying millions of gallons of oil from Alberta, Canada to Superior, Wisconsin. Activists have accused local prosecutors of weaponizing the justice system, using felony charges to crack down on free speech.
In August 2021, Vialard and another protester installed themselves in hammocks suspended from a bamboo structure on an access road that led to the Line 3 pump station.
As law enforcement approached them in a bucket truck to remove them, Vialard and the other protester locked their arms to one another through a pipe in a maneuver called a “sleeping dragon.” The officers initially tried to remove them together, but the other protester removed his arm from the device, allowing officers to extract them separately.
The Minnesota Attorney General’s Office represented the state on the appeal and conceded to five of the 20 instances of Slyva’s alleged misconduct.
The misconduct includes attempting to bolster one of the law enforcement witness’ testimony by asking him about his lack of ethical violations and asking a second law enforcement witness if he had sustained injuries responding to Line 3 protests that were unrelated to Vialard’s case.
Slyva also improperly suggested that Vialard would have pleaded guilty if there was better video evidence and invited the jury to “draw reasonable inferences off of what’s not in evidence.”
“It is extremely troubling that the prosecutor made explicit arguments during the state’s closing and rebuttal encouraging the jury to base its verdict on facts outside the record,” Judge Jeanne Cochran wrote for the court.
The court also held that Slyva was wrong to say the sheriff was elected to protect “our” community, which aligned the state with the jury and may have “inflamed the passions of the jury by creating an ‘us versus them’ scenario” since Vialard is a Colorado resident who speaks with a French accent.
Vialard also argued the appeals court should reverse the jury’s verdict because there wasn’t enough evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that she intentionally locked herself into the sleeping dragon to obstruct law enforcement. She said she locked herself in the device to protest Line 3.
The appeals court found the jury did have sufficient evidence for the conviction, although it noted the evidence wasn’t particularly strong because the state’s witnesses’ accounts were inconsistent at times.
Vialard said in a statement that she was glad the appellate court recognized the prosecutor’s misconduct, but that a larger fight against Enbridge remains.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Does a state lawmaker qualify as an independent contractor when hired by Rhode Island’s court system to represent clients who can’t otherwise rely on a public defender? 
That was the question that kept the Rhode Island Ethics Commission debating for more than 40 minutes as its members weighed Rep. Jason Knight’s bid to rejoin the judiciary’s roster of attorneys representing indigent clients. 
Commission staff say the state’s ethics code clearly bars Knight from returning to the court’s list because he’s a lawmaker and thus an independent contractor that would be paid by the court. But the panel is now exploring whether there’s a way to let him back without running afoul of its own “revolving door” rule.
Knight, a Barrington Democrat, had been on the list before his election to the Rhode Island House of Representatives in 2016. In 2019, he requested his name be removed because the rates the criminal courts paid were not high enough.
“The cases were basically practice killers,” he said in an interview after the ethics commission meeting. “To do them correctly, you would have to set aside just about everything in your world and (as) criminal defense lawyers, we’re solo outfits, you need to be thoughtful in what your two hands can do on any given day.”
At the time, court-appointed lawyers were paid by the judiciary $90 an hour for representing clients facing Class 1 felony charges for crimes like rape, kidnapping and robbery. The rate was $60 an hour for Class 2 crimes such as breaking and entering, larceny, possession of a stolen motor vehicle and certain drug offenses.
Lawyers representing someone accused of murder were paid $100 an hour.
In April, the Rhode Island Supreme Court increased the range from $112 for most cases to $142 per hour for clients facing murder charges. Knight now says he wants to return to the court’s rotating list as a way to gain some additional revenue as he “thinks about what the future’s going to bring.”
“I need to get back on the horse,” Knight told the Ethics Commission.
There’s just one problem: The state ethics code bars elected officials from taking state jobs until they’ve been out of the General Assembly for at least a year. That’s the position staff attorney Lynn Radiches urged the commissioners to keep.
“Indigent clients do have a right to an attorney, they do not have a right to Mr. Knight as their attorney.” she said. “I don’t write the rules, but I’ve become pretty good at interpreting them.”
Officials can work for the state if they held the position at the time of their election, but Radiches said because Knight withdrew from the court list in 2019 he is ineligible to return.
But commissioners argue that just because Knight would be appointed by the court to a client does not mean he is necessarily working for the state.
“He is providing services, as an attorney, to his client — just like a private attorney would be,” said commissioner Frank Cenerini. “And he, or any person providing indigent services, is still bound by the legal code of ethics.”
That’s not how John Marion, executive director of Common Cause Rhode Island and a longtime observer of the commission, sees it.
“The money is coming from the state of Rhode Island,” Marion said in an interview. “That’s the point of the rule.”
Chairman Lauren E. Jones acknowledged that the court may cut Knight’s checks, but said it’s only in order to represent a third party.
“He’s not representing the interest of his contractor,” Jones argued. 
The panel ultimately rejected its staff’s advisory opinion but stopped short of ruling in Knight’s favor. Instead, it directed staff to draft a new opinion on what legally defines an independent contractor in Rhode Island.
Should the commission grant an exception for Knight, Marion warns it could set a dangerous precedent.
“If we start down that path, that only leads to a place where there is no enforceable code of ethics and that’s not a good place,” Marion said.
The new advisory opinion is expected to be complete by the time the panel reconvenes in September.

Will Carpenter, R-El Dorado, says he doubts the state can ever build the nursing staff needed to operate state psychiatric hospitals in Larned and Osawatomie. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The state of Kansas invests more than $60 million annually to hire contract nursing staff to work at state psychiatric hospitals in Larned and Osawatomie, but the financial boost hasn’t closed job vacancy gaps exceeding 33% at both facilities.
On Tuesday, Kansas legislators on a special committee exploring contract nursing shared disappointment with results of years of stopgap appropriations to hire temporary nurses provided by private companies. The state also has devoted resources to raising salaries and providing bonuses to encourage state-employed nurses to remain at the hospitals.
Lawmakers expressed skepticism Kansas would ever have enough people to fill vacancies at state hospitals serving involuntarily committed or criminally charged individuals with mental health issues, as well as sexually violent offenders detained at Larned after serving prison sentences.
“In my experience, we’re not going to build this staff to take care of the number of people that are out there right now,” said Rep. Will Carpenter, an El Dorado Republican who chairs the Legislature’s interim health committee. “Prove me wrong, because I want to be wrong.”
Carpenter suggested consideration be given to transferring about 100 patients from Larned to other locations so staffing levels could be sustained without contract nurses. In 2027, Kansas is scheduled to open a new 104-bed state psychiatric hospital in Sedgwick County.
Expenditures at Larned State Hospital for nursing contract labor increased from $5.9 million in 2019 to $8.6 million in 2021, $43.1 million in 2023 and $46 million in 2025. At Osawatomie State Hospital, contract costs surged from $233,000 in 2019 to $3.2 million in 2021, $16 million in 2023 and $15.4 million in 2025. The job vacancy rate at Osawatomie stood at 35.5%, while the rate at Larned was 33.5%.
“I’ve been incredibly disappointed on how that’s worked,” Carpenter said.
 
Contract labor not answer
Scott Brunner, deputy secretary of the Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services, said the agency used state tax dollars to bring in dozens of registered nurses and licensed practice nurses to care for patients who generally had complex medical needs. Some require one-on-one care.
“To keep our bed count open at the levels that they are,” he said, “we have to have enough staff to make sure patients are safe.”
He said the starting salary for a registered nurse at the state hospitals was about $40 per hour. The state paid companies providing contract registered nurses $90 to $100 per hour to take on the same responsibilities, with the nurse receiving approximately two-thirds of the total.
“We certainly don’t think contract labor is a solution,” Brunner said. “It’s a way of addressing the need to keep beds open and keep patients moving through the system.”
He recommended the Legislature pass House Bill 2237, which is hung up in the Senate, to place in state law the ability of state agencies to award employee bonuses in amounts up to $10,000 per year. He urged lawmakers to keep funding cost-of-living and market-rate adjustments to salaries so state hospitals could compete with the private sector for labor. The existing budget for contract nurses needs to be sustained, he said.
In addition, Brunner suggested the state expand college scholarships for nurses, consider providing nursing students with financial support in exchange for post-graduation employment agreements and provide training opportunities for experienced nurses to advance their careers.
 
  Lindsey Topps, superintendent of Larned State Hospital, said the facility serving about 400 patients with mental illness relies extensively on contract nursing staff to operate programs serving sexual predators, individuals charged with crimes and people struggling with acute illness.

‘Increase the salaries’
Ashley Byram, superintendent of the Osawatomie hospital, said only half of the facility’s RNs, LPNs and mental health technicians were state employees. Here’s the split between state employee and agency contract workers at Osawatomie: RNs, 16 state and 16 private; LPNs, three state and 13 private; and mental health techs, 39 state and 33 private.
She said Osawatomie contract nurses were asked what it would take for them to accept state employment. The nurses weren’t interested in signing bonuses or housing allowances, she said, but were keen to earn salaries of at least $50 per hour. The average RN at Osawatomie has been paid $44 per hour, or $59 per hour when benefits were included.
“I would increase the salaries,” Byram said. “It’s the current wage gap between agency and state positions that is our primary obstacle.”
If the Legislature prohibited payment of contract nurses to staff the Osawatomie hospital, she said, the facility had enough nurses to make use of 43 beds. She said 116 beds at Osawatomie would be closed if contract nurses were removed and replacements weren’t hired.
Lindsey Topps, superintendent at Larned, said the hospital averaged 400 patients with more than half the total in a sexual predator treatment program.
“We have, I say, no fat on campus,” Topps said. “We’ve maximized the amount of residents or patients to the RNs and LPNs in order to provide safe and good patient care as well as follow the regulations.”
Here is the breakdown between state employees and contract laborers at Larned: Registered nurses, 17 state and 38 private; LPNs, nine state and 27 private; mental health workers or CNAs, 194 state and 179 private.
Topps said debate by the Legislature about reducing contract nursing labor should take into consideration the aggressive, disruptive, suicidal and homicidal conduct of people at Larned. She said most community-based health facilities didn’t have the staff or facilities to deal with individuals who ended up at the state hospital.
“We have some of the most severe mentally ill individuals in the state of Kansas,” Topps said.
 
‘It’s not translating’
During the 2025 legislative session, the House and Senate didn’t approve financing for new spending on contract nursing at the two state hospitals.
“Sometimes we set aside money because that feels good and we think that’s going to to do something,” said Sen. Beverly Gossage, a Republican from Eudora.
Sen. Renee Erickson, R-Wichita, said the state had a handful of initiatives designed to develop a Kansas pipeline of nurses who could fill jobs at state hospitals. She said the state spent millions of dollars so 2,700 high school students could take courses required to become a certified nursing assistant. She said only one-third of those students became CNAs.
“We’re paying to fill that pipeline, but it’s not translating,” she said. “It doesn’t appear like (it’s) actually reducing the demand and getting to the root of the problem. It doesn’t seem to be making the impact it should or we would hope it should.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/P4100504-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-08-19 15:58:25.280966

(Photo by Chris Trotman/LIV Golf)The LIV Golf team championship is set to host professional stars and international music acts this weekend at The Cardinal at Saint John’s Resort in Plymouth, Michigan – but with it comes criticism from at least one of the resort’s patrons over the league’s connection to the Saudi Arabian government and its noted record of corruption and human rights abuses.
LIV Golf was founded in 2021 and is owned by the Saudi government’s Public Investment Fund. The mammoth $941 billion sovereign wealth fund was created in the 1970s as a means to invest the Saudi royal family’s money on the government’s behalf. 
Much of that funding has gone to prominent Saudi business families with strong ties to the royal family, all controlled by the nation’s Crown Prince, according to reporting from The Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal. 
Current Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud, the nation’s prime minister and its de facto ruler, has been described as an authoritarian leader who has since taken power created an oppressive regime that stifles women’s and human rights activists, and tortures and kills political dissidents.
The U.S. The Central Intelligence Agency also concluded that the bin Salman regime was responsible for the brutal assassination of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, who was highly critical of bin Salman and helped amplify progressive Saudi political thought.
All those noted instances of political violence and repression have raised questions about Saint John’s Resort hosting the event.
The resort is owned by the Pulte Family Charitable Foundation, which prides itself as a key funder of humanitarian initiatives through nonprofit organizations and education institutions across the globe.
Some of that work focuses on the basic human needs of marginalized people, socioeconomically disadvantaged youth, seniors, people with disabilities and impoverished people.
The resort in Plymouth is also one of the foundation’s three “Humanitarian Hotels,” which delivers all of its net profits to Pulte’s charity work.
David Chrzanowski, a California based filmmaker and actor who was born and raised in Michigan, is a frequent patron of the Plymouth resort. For him, the foundation’s charity work and the stated mission of the hotel doesn’t appear to jive with the LIV Golf event and the Public Investment Fund’s connection to an oppressive regime like the one that rules Saudi Arabia.
“They have the literal word humanitarian embossed on their front desk,” Chrzanowski said in an interview with Michigan Advance. “The question of ethics and money when you’re using a lot of that money for charity is an age-old discussion. Is it OK to take 100 percent of your money going toward charities [from an organization like the Saudi Public Investment Fund]? I don’t know the answer to that question, but what I do know is that we need to be talking about it.”

The Advance asked the Pulte Foundation if it viewed its decision to host the LIV event in conflict with the hotel’s mission and its charity work. Pulte was also asked if it weighed the ethical concerns of hosting a Saudi-backed sports event before agreeing to embrace the league, and if it would consider making a public statement disavowing the human rights abuses of the Saudi government.
In an email, the foundation said the resort was “deeply committed to giving back, with 100% of our net profits supporting communities in need – both in SE Michigan and around the world.”
The foundation said that mission was at the heart of everything it did in terms of its charity work. Quixotically, while the Pulte Foundation said that hosting the LIV event was part of that mission, it did acknowledge that it was “aware of the broader discussions around LIV Golf’s funding.”
“Our participation in the tournament is focused solely on the charitable impact we can make through an event of this scale,” the foundation said. “The LIV Golf tournament presents a unique opportunity to highlight our Humanitarian Hotels and Foundation’s broader charitable mission on a global stage, offering unprecedented exposure and the chance to amplify the important work we do.”
The foundation also went to bat for the LIV Golf league, saying it works with dozens of nonprofit organizations “to uplift underrepresented communities, make the game of golf more accessible, and support local charitable efforts around the world – including programs at Saint John’s Resort.”
“Not only will this event allow us to expand our local charitable programs, but it will also drive local business growth and provide a strong economic boost to the region,” the foundation said. “LIV Golf events drive an average estimated $40 million in economic impact within each local community, and to date, have generated over $1 billion in economic impact across the globe.”

The foundation went on to say that it believes it “can bring a deeper purpose to the LIV Golf tournament, beyond the completion,” and that it remains committed to “upholding our values as a foundation during this event and all events held at our property.”
Reputation laundering, by way of sports
Although the resort highlighted ways that LIV Golf also works with charities and humanitarian causes, several critics have accused Saudi Arabia’s various engagements with the sports world through its Public Investment Fund – like LIV Golf – as ways for the government to “sportswash” its image.
The term is self-explanatory, defined as the act of a nation or a company to use sporting events or teams to improve the reputation of the nation and to distract from its ongoing and past human rights abuses.
According to testimony provided to the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Investigations in 2023 by Joey Shea, a Saudi Arabia researcher with Human Rights Watch, the nation’s Public Investment Fund reportedly owned a 93% controlling share in the LIV Golf league. 
Calls for LIV Golf to develop a strategy to limit the laundering of the nation’s reputation through the league’s events have gone unanswered, Shea said, adding that LIV Golf’s proposed commercial merger with the PGA Tour and the DP World Tour, with an aim to form a new for-profit entity to unifying the game, has enabled the Saudi government to have a position of major influence across the entire golf world. 
The deal has not yet been inked yet, however, due to significant delays, but some professional golfers on the PGA Tour, including Tiger Woods, and the tour’s top brass, have publicly stated their opposition to joining the league and taking Saudi money.
The Center for a New American Security, an independent bipartisan nonprofit organization that focuses on national security and defense policies, has also been sharply critical of the Saudi government’s attempts at cloaking its human rights abuses through the fanfare of sports.
Sarath Ganji is the director of the center’s Autocracy and Global Sports Project, which was launched to investigate the role of malign finance in global sports leagues. He was featured in a 2023 discussion about the LIV Golf league and its attempts to merge with the PGA Tour produced by WBUR-FM, Boston’s NPR station.
The host of that discussion, WBUR’s Meghna Chakrabarti, noted that PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan at first banned his players from engaging with LIV, questioning the movies and ethics of the league.
Monahan later embraced the ongoing merger with LIV when it was announced, throwing away his earlier criticisms.
Ganji said the Saudi interest in LIV and galvanizing the larger share of the golf world was a clear example of sportswashing.
“If we think of sports and entertainment as a singular sector, there are two qualities about it that make it really attractive to investors in general, but to autocratic investors in particular,” Ganji said. “The first is its high visibility. We know about the English Premier League. We know about the World Cup. We know about the Dustin Johnsons and the Cameron Smiths and the Phil Mickelson’s of the world. These are all leagues and franchises and players and nine-figure broadcasting and sponsorship contracts that have global reach.”
Ganji added that visibility might serve a purpose for nations with “dirty, stained reputations and are looking to district audiences from those games by linking themselves with highly positive brands.”
The low bar of access helps wealthy firms, families and nations help those bad actors latch on to ownership stakes in those leagues, Ganji said, because they often are unregulated environments.
As some nations try to keep abuses buried beneath stadiums and flashy trophies, Chrzanowski told the Advance that he just wants host sites for LIV, much like Saint John’s Resort, to acknowledge the issue in a transparent way.
After visiting the resort for the last three years with his family, Chrzanowski, who also plays golf, also sought answers from the Pulte Foundation when he visited Saint John’s this year.

In response, the Pulte Foundation told Chrzanowski that the foundation remains “committed to transparency and to upholding our values as a Foundation during this event and all events held at our property.”
The line about transparency, without engaging further in a discussion about whether the foundation should reconsider the event given its mission and stated values, irked Chrzanowski.
“A simple search on my end showed that the foundation made no public statement about this, and they’re hiding from it,” Chrzanowski said. “They know what they’re doing and they’re just taking the money. That made me really question going back to stay at that place again.”
An offer to discuss the matter further was floated to Chrzanowski, which he told the Advance he was eager to take up. But when he inquired about when they could have that conversation, Chrzanowski said he never heard back from Pulte.
“They say they want to talk about it, and they say they want to be transparent, well then, great, let’s do that,” he said. “Let’s talk about the human rights abuses and where the money is coming from. … They’re playing a billion dollars, they’ve got four really good pros. Look, I’m not trying to take money out of their pockets, but in the same sense, I don’t take money for doing shady [things] in my life.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/liv-golf-adelaide-1024x6831749856100-1.jpg,,,2025-08-19 15:58:25.280966

(Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer)Attorney General Keith Ellison sued TikTok on Tuesday for violating Minnesota consumer protection laws, alleging the social media giant illegally preys on young users’ developmental vulnerabilities with addictive algorithms.
“TikTok has created a dangerously addictive platform that exploits the unfinished reward system in our children’s brains,” Ellison said at a press conference Tuesday.
The lawsuit alleges TikTok ensnares young users with multiple parts of its design.
The suit says TikTok feeds young users personalized recommendations to keep them on-site and scrolling. The app allows for what’s called “infinite scroll,” a never-ending stream of content that its own inventor described as addictive.
The lawsuit addresses TikTok’s “beauty filters.” TikTok acknowledged in an internal report cited in the lawsuit that teens are “more susceptible” to the negative effects of beauty filters while they are “at a critical period for developing body dysmorphia [and] eating disorders.” Despite knowing this, TikTok deployed hundreds of beauty filters and would turn on filters for young users by default, the suit alleges.
The lawsuit highlights the livestreaming feature called “LIVE” introduced by TikTok in 2019, which allows users to pay creators through an unregulated marketplace that the lawsuit charges can be used for sexual exploitation.
“Operating in part like a virtual strip club, LIVE allows young streamers to turn their homes into a performance stage, and allows other users to entice streamers into sexual acts in exchange for virtual money,” the lawsuit alleges.
The suit also makes a pointed comparison between TikTok and nicotine.
Minnesota and a bevy of other states that have brought suits against social media companies are using a similar playbook that led to billions in damages levied against Big Tobacco in the 1990s and helped drive down American nicotine use until vapes and pouches brought about a revival.
These features — combined with TikTok’s misrepresentations of its own dangers — amount to “deceptive and unfair” practices constituting multiple violations of consumer protection law, according to the suit.
“It’s an unfair thing to expect that a kid can overcome the pressures and the design features and the research and the brain science of some of the most highly trained people in the world,” Ellison said.
The lawsuit seeks $25,000 per violation, which could rise to stratospheric levels given the app’s popularity among teens, though Ellison’s office said they could not provide an estimate of how much TikTok could be forced to pay if they’re victorious after what’s expected to be a yearslong legal battle.
Ellison’s office previously announced in 2022 that Ellison would join a nationwide coalition of state attorneys general to investigate TikTok’s possible consumer law violations. Thirteen states — comprising a mix of Democratic and Republican attorneys general — from that coalition filed suits last October against TikTok, with Minnesota joining them just now.
The lawsuit also follows the attorney general’s suit against Meta in October 2023, which was similarly part of a coalition of states accusing the social media behemoth of deliberately targeting children in its addictive design. Nearly two years out, that case is still in the “mushy middle” of a discovery phase, said Assistant Attorney General Bennett Hartz.
In a statement, a TikTok spokesperson said that the lawsuit is “based on misleading and inaccurate claims that fail to recognize the robust safety measures TikTok has voluntarily implemented.”
The spokesperson noted that the platform has many safety features built into teen accounts, along with parental controls for screen time, content and privacy.
TikTok is fighting for survival in the U.S. on multiple fronts. The U.S. Congress and then-President Joe Biden signed a law requiring Chinese parent company ByteDance to divest TikTok, fearing Chinese propaganda and surveillance. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the law in January.
The divest-or-ban law has not been enforced in practice, though, and President Donald Trump has since punted enforcement three times, with a new deadline of September 17.
At the press conference, Ellison declined to offer an opinion on TikTok’s ownership.
“This lawsuit is designed to make them obey the law, whether they’re owned by somebody in the U.S. or China,” Ellison said.

(Dan Severson/USFWS)TOPEKA — The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will not allocate water in 2026 to a Kansas wildlife refuge that serves as a key destination for hundreds of species of migrating birds.
Kansas Republican U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran in an Aug. 14 announcement applauded the service’s decision to take no action to honor water rights for the Quivira National Wildlife Refuge, a more than 22,000-acre marsh and sand prairie in central Kansas.
Federal officials made the same decision in 2020 and again in 2023, despite a report from Kansas regulators that found the refuge received insufficient amounts of water in two out of every three years between 2008 and 2021.
“I met with FWS Administrator Brian Nesvik and emphasized the need for long-term solutions led by stakeholders at the local level, and I am pleased by the recognition of the progress that is being made,” Moran said in a news release.
Moran did not specify what progress entails, but he said the service acknowledged a Kansas Department of Agriculture group’s conservation efforts.
A 2016 analysis determined that irrigators upstream from Quivira were infringing on its state water rights, which entitle it to more than 14,000 acre-feet of water each year, equivalent to about 4.6 billion gallons. Irrigators reduce the groundwater in Rattlesnake Creek, which flows into the refuge. Conservationists say lower flows threaten endangered species.
In 2024, the refuge reportedly used none of its allocated water for the first time since 2017, according to state water rights data. In 2023, it used 45 acre-feet.
U.S. Rep. Ron Estes, a Republican representing Kansas’ 4th District, wrote a letter in February to U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, asking for assurance that the department wouldn’t call for water allocation for Quivira.
“Agriculture is the basin’s primary industry, generating millions of dollars in direct and indirect revenue,” Estes said. “Losing the ability to irrigate crops would reduce these revenues by tens of millions of dollars, forcing many of these already struggling family-run farms to exit the industry entirely.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/usfws-waterfowl-quivira-national-wildlife-refuge-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-19 15:58:25.280966

Article Summary

Former federal officials are backing an effort to reform the state legislature’s redistricting process. Congressional districts would be unaffected.
Illinois’ state Senate map gives a partisan advantage to Democrats, and its House map isn’t compact enough, according to researchers at Princeton.
Ray LaHood and Bill Daley hope to get a constitutional amendment on the ballot in November 2026, but they’ll need hundreds of thousands of signatures and millions of dollars to do so.
Past efforts to reform legislative redistricting, most notably in 2016, failed after ballot measures were thrown out by state courts.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story. 

CHICAGO — A group of former Obama administration officials and election lawyers announced Tuesday they are attempting to reform the way the state draws district maps for the state legislature. They want to do this by passing a state constitutional amendment via a ballot initiative during the 2026 general election.
They say the current legislative redistricting process leads to overrepresentation of Democrats and few competitive legislative districts, meaning politicians must do less to serve their constituents.
Former U.S. Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood, a Republican, and former Secretary of Commerce Bill Daley, a Democrat and member of the Daley political family, are leading the effort. Both served under President Barack Obama, with Daley as his chief of staff.
Former State Board of Elections Chair Bill Cadigan and election lawyer Michael Dorf, whose past clients include the Democratic Party of Illinois and several sitting statewide officials, also are backing the effort.
12-member redistricting commission
The proposal would create a 12-member “Legislative Redistricting Commission,” appointed by the top Democrat and Republican in each legislative chamber. Each legislative leader would appoint one member of the General Assembly and two members who are not lawmakers.
Commissioners would be barred from considering political party registration or voting history data when drawing maps. Districts also would be required to be compact, contiguous and drawn along existing county and municipal lines where possible.
The amendment would only apply to the redistricting process for the state legislature. It would not apply to congressional districts, which would still be drawn by state lawmakers.
The amendment would also change the size of the state legislature, so that if the state’s population significantly increases or decreases, so too would the number of districts.
This model is based on Iowa, Arizona and Pennsylvania. The Princeton Gerrymandering Project, which analyzes how severely gerrymandered states’ legislative maps are, gives Illinois a “B” grade for the state House and an “F” for the state Senate. Iowa and Arizona received A grades for their state maps and Pennsylvania received “B” grades.
“I’ve talked to people in Iowa and I’ve talked to people in California,” LaHood said. “They love the idea that politicians are not drawing their maps. And if you look at their maps, they’re compact and contiguous. And people like that.”
The amendment, according to its backers, will need about 320,000 valid signatures to appear on the 2026 November ballot. Because some signatures might be invalid, Cadigan said they’ll aim for roughly double that.
LaHood said the effort would need “3 to 4 million” dollars, “primarily to pay people to help us get the signatures.”
Failed 2016 effort
In 2016, the state Supreme Court case threw out an effort to reform legislative redistricting on a 4-3 vote. The court ruled along partisan lines that the wording of the amendment didn’t comply with the state’s constitution’s narrow wording on citizen initiatives.
The Supreme Court now has a 5-2 Democratic advantage after the General Assembly redrew its district lines in 2021.
The 2016 effort was itself a response to a 2014 court case that tossed out a proposed constitutional amendment that year.
Dorf said the wording of the proposed amendment takes into consideration court precedent, but LaHood noted that “no one will predict what the Supreme Court does.”
Still, Daley said the amendment will hopefully influence the 2026 campaign.
“I think politicians will respond to that when it’s on the ballot for the general election in 2026. Everyone running — from state rep to the state Senate, congressional and statewide officeholders — will be asked the question ‘Where do you stand on the fair maps amendment?’” Daley said. “And woe with those who don’t say they’re for it.”
The effort comes as Texas considers an unorthodox mid-decade redistricting in order to expand the Republican majority in Congress, which has sparked Democratic states like California and Illinois to consider something similar to counteract Texas’ move.
“As far as the congressional thing is concerned, I fully understand what (California Gov. Gavin) Newsom is doing and what Gov. (JB) Pritzker has said he’s considering because of the egregiousness, at the congressional level, of what’s going on in Texas,” Daley said. “If Texas just played according to the rules and in five years wanted to do a map to do away with five Democrats, that’s their right.”

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — U.S. Secretary of Education Linda Mahon on Tuesday didn’t rule out a plan to end statewide standardized testing in Oklahoma during a local visit focused on limiting federal involvement in public education.
McMahon, whom President Donald Trump tasked with closing the U.S. Department of Education, said she’s “very happy to sit down with any state” to discuss new policy ideas. 
“We want to give them the most flexibility that we can give them to operate within their state,” McMahon said while speaking with reporters at the state Capitol. “So, we’re happy to sit down in Oklahoma or other states that we’ve already sat down with to push those programs along.”
However, she said the proposal from state Superintendent Ryan Walters to replace statewide tests with a mixture of district-selected assessments still “has not gone through all the different steps that it needs” to gain federal approval.
Walters wasn’t present for McMahon’s visit despite being a vocal supporter of the Trump administration. She said meeting with him wasn’t on her schedule Tuesday.
Instead, McMahon joined Gov. Kevin Stitt and former House Speaker Charles McCall, now a gubernatorial candidate, for a tour of Dove Science Academy, a high-performing charter school with a new campus in Warr Acres. Once allies, Stitt and Walters have been publicly at odds with each other for the past six months.

Dove high school students demonstrated robots they had built and coded, flew drones and tested virtual reality software, even having a remote-controlled robot dog give McMahon a handshake. U.S. News and World Report on Tuesday ranked Dove Science Academy as the No. 3 high school in the state, behind Classen High School of Advanced Studies and Harding Charter Preparatory High School, both in Oklahoma City.
McMahon later accompanied Stitt at the state Capitol as the governor signed a bill prohibiting diversity, equity and inclusion programs from higher education institutions, another major policy goal of the Trump administration.
“I think Oklahoma should be very proud of what I’ve seen this morning,” McMahon said.
Oklahoma was the latest stop in McMahon’s 50-state “Returning Education to the States Tour,” which started earlier this month in Louisiana. 
The tour has highlighted McMahon’s goal of cutting federal regulations and giving individual states more authority and flexibility in how they operate their public school systems. Last month, the U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way for the Trump administration to proceed with mass layoffs and downsizing at the federal Department of Education.

The administration has proposed sending federal funds in large block grants that individual states could decide how to spend. Congress would have to agree to any wholesale changes to the federal structure of education funding.
McMahon declined to answer whether she has any concerns over expanding the powers of the Oklahoma State Department of Education, which has been consistently in turmoil under Walters.
Stitt touted policies Oklahoma enacted in recent years that increased facility funds for charter schools, expanded student transfer options, offered tax credits to private-school families and increased state funding for public education overall.
National testing, though, has shown the state as a whole is still struggling to improve its poor academic outcomes.
While Oklahoma has promoted more choices for parents to select their children’s school, Stitt said he is eager for the federal government to grant more flexibility, as well. He said educators and school district administrators have to spend too much time on paperwork that federal programs require.

“That’s, I think, what President Trump wants and what we believe in is let’s get rid of the bureaucracy and let’s get those dollars on target to kids in Oklahoma City and in Enid and in Lawton and all over the country,” Stitt said.

Nevada received about $24 million in funding from the Victims of Crime Act, or VOCA, in 2024 according to the Victim Assistance Data Dashboard. Withholding funds would put the state, and the 58 organizations that receive grant funding, at risk of losing money needed to offer support services to victims. 
The U.S. Department of Justice threatened to block VOCA funding nationwide, which provides critical grant funding for state agencies and nonprofits addressing domestic violence and sexual assault, if states don’t cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Survivors of crime “should not be used as pawns to score political points” in Trump’s efforts to force states to comply with aggressive immigration enforcement”. Ford said in a statement earlier this week.
“It is despicable that President Trump is using vital funding to play political games,” Ford said. “He is putting victims and survivors of crime in even more precarious situations when what they deserve is help with regaining a sense of normalcy.”
The act was created in 1984 and has allowed helped fund a variety of services and assistance, including paying for emergency shelter, medical expenses, crime scene cleanup, and sexual assault forensic exams. 
“Between 2021 and 2024, states have used federal VOCA funds to assist, on average, more than 8.5 million crime victims per year and to pay more than 200,000 claims per year for losses suffered by crime victims,” the lawsuit reads.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/flashing-lights-police-car-1-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-08-19 15:58:25.280966

(Courtesy of Nebraska Department of Correctional Services)LINCOLN — Nebraska’s version of the so-called “Alligator Alcatraz” immigration detention center appears to be headed for the southwestern part of the state, Red Willow County.
President Donald Trump’s administration is set to build or create a major center to hold migrants in McCook, the county seat of Red Willow, according to documents obtained by the Washington Post from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
The detention center is to be located at or adjacent to the McCook Work Ethic Camp, a medium-security facility operated by the state prison system. While the state facility is intended to house up to 200 people, the Post documents indicate federal plans that the Nebraska center in McCook will have capacity for 300 detainees. 
People briefed by Gov.  Jim Pillen’s team said he plans an announcement Tuesday afternoon about at least the McCook part of a larger effort to assist the Trump administration’s effort to dramatically increase detention capacity for migrants.
Will Nebraska be home to the next ‘Alligator Alcatraz?’

Laura Strimple, a Pillen spokeswoman, declined to comment Tuesday about the state facility or plans. ICE and Department of Homeland Security officials did not respond immediately to a request for comment. FBI Director Kash Patel was in Nebraska on Tuesday, having met with state and local law enforcement, including Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers.
Gene Weedin, a McCook City Council member, said he was still learning details and forming an opinion on the center coming to his city of nearly 8,000.
He said Pillen was in McCook with the Corrections Director over the weekend talking to various local officials. Weedin’s understanding is that the work ethic center would stop operating in its current form, and those in the facility would be transferred to other places.
Weedin said the people currently housed at the center have contributed to the community by picking up trash, putting up annual Christmas decorations and doing other public service.
“There are just a lot of questions,” said Weedin.
Sen. Teresa Ibach of Sumner, who represents part of west central Nebraska outside McCook, said she only just learned about the ICE effort and was “still gathering more information.”
Nebraska owns nearly 45 acres at the McCook site. It is unclear whether the ICE facility would be built new or as an expansion to the existing facility.
In its detention expansion strategy, the Trump administration has revived other dormant prisons, repurposed military bases and secured partnerships with private prison contractors, local sheriffs and Republican governors to house its record number of detainees, the Post reported.
Nebraska has historically struggled to hire enough staff to use the McCook Work Ethic facility as it was originally intended, to reform younger men who’ve committed crimes by assigning them jobs and tasks. The camp focuses its counseling and other efforts on encouraging behavior changes to reduce recidivism.
It is the least crowded of Nebraska’s adult prison facilities, running a daily census of about 184 in Fiscal Year 2025. But it is also one of the prison facilities with the greatest need for additional staffing. The department’s census says it was staffed to house an average of about 125 people in FY 2025.
Cristine Schwartz, the public information officer at the McCook Work Ethic Camp, referred calls to a state Correctional Services spokeswoman, who did not immediately return calls. 
The state has been working around the Douglas County Jail deciding to no longer actively participate in ICE detentions. Detainees from eastern Nebraska have been sent to Council Bluffs, Iowa, and as far away as the Lincoln County Jail in North Platte — where the 76 workers arrested in the high-profile immigration raid at Omaha’s Glenn Valley Foods plant were transported. Many are still there.
ICE also plans to contract with jails in eastern Nebraska’s Sarpy and Cass Counties for 30 beds each and the Washington County Jail for 15, according to the Post’s ICE documents. It is apparently Nebraska’s contribution to a plan that the federal documents showed would open or expand 125 immigration detention facilities this year.
By January, it said, ICE would have capacity to hold more than 107,000 people, up from close to 50,000 currently. That road map, last updated July 30, reflected ICE intentions to rely increasingly on makeshift “soft-sided” structures that could be built in a few weeks and taken down as easily. 
The government is also planning to make more room for detaining parents and children.
Earlier this month, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in an interview with CBS News that Nebraska was being considered as a home to one of the state-run, federally funded migrant detention centers that the Trump administration hoped to launch across the country in the likeness of the so-called “Alligator Alcatraz” state-run facility in the Everglades.
Noem said she had already appealed to governors and state leaders. Strimple at the time responded to the Examiner’s request for comment by saying it was premature to comment on potential detention operations. She added, “Gov. Pillen will make details public at the appropriate time.”

Lindsay James announced Tuesday she is running for Iowa’s 2nd Congressional District seat, joining two other Democrats in the race to challenge U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson in 2026.
James, a Presbyterian pastor who is serving her fourth term as a state lawmaker, had said in July she was considering a run. In an interview Tuesday with the Iowa Capital Dispatch, she said in the past month, she has spent time talking with Iowans in the northeast Iowa congressional district about which issues matter most to them. She said she came to the decision to run in part, because of her “faith commitment that compels me to stop and lend a helping hand” in working to better Iowans’ lives.
“I am running because too many hard-working Iowans are being forced to make impossible choices in their lives,” James said. “Choices like, ‘Do I pay child care costs, or say, for a house? Do I pay my utility bill or buy my child a new winter coat?’ Washington, D.C., works for billionaires and lobbyists. It is not working for everyday families, and they need to hear the truth from us here in Iowa.”

Many of the policies coming out of Washington that Hinson supported — like the budget reconciliation bill that made cuts to Medicaid and SNAP — are policies that will make costs rise for average Iowans, James said, both threatening rural hospital access and potentially causing electricity and fuel costs to rise.
The Dubuque Democrat said Hinson, first elected in 2020, has “lost her way” since being elected to Congress.
“She has just become a talking head in Washington, D.C., and she is no longer listening to Iowans,” James said. “… Her vote record is staggeringly devastating.”
In addition to the budget reconciliation bill, James said Hinson has supported President Donald Trump’s “reckless, sweeping tariffs that are raising costs and threatening Iowa’s egg industry,” has voted against capping the cost of insulin, and has not taken action to address the loss of more than 2,000 jobs in the district.
Republican advocates said James is fighting a losing battle in taking on Hinson.
“Lindsay James is extreme, out of step, and totally unelectable,” Emily Tuttle, spokesperson for the National Republican Congressional Committee said in a statement. “She’ll only help drive the clown car in this Democrat primary further off the rails, while Ashley Hinson delivers for Iowans.”
The Republican incumbent won reelection with 57.1% of the vote in 2024 against Democratic challenger Sarah Corkery, who garnered 41.6%. While political forecasters including the Cook Political Report have highlighted Iowa’s 1st and 3rd Congressional District races as potentially competitive in the 2026 midterms, Iowa’s 2nd District has not received the same attention.
But before Hinson won her first term in office, northeast Iowa was represented by former U.S. Rep. Abby Finkenauer, a Democrat who won in 2018. James said she believes the district can flip in the upcoming election as voters reflect on the struggles their communities face with struggling schools, job losses and higher economic pressures.
“I’m excited because people are really hungry for change,” James said. “And people are able to see through her perfectly polished politician act, right? Iowans are smart, and they can see that the decisions that she’s making (have) not resulted in their lives becoming any better.”
If elected, James said she would focus on issues like making housing, child care and health care affordable and accessible, as well as supporting public schools.
Two other Democrats have announced campaigns for the Democratic nomination: Clint Twedt-Ball, the founder of the nonprofit Matthew 25 and Kathy Dolter, the former dean of nursing at Kirkwood Community College and a retired Army nurse. James said her work fighting for Iowans in the state Legislature, as well as her “moral compass,” will make her the best contender in the race.
“What I am passionate about doing is calling out Hinson for all of the ways in which she (served) special interests and billionaires in Washington, D.C.,” James said. “She has forgotten about us and left us behind, and people want someone who isn’t going to be blown about by political winds.”

Aug. 19, 2025 | Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceWhile canvassers work to collect signatures in support of enshrining ranked choice voting in the Michigan Constitution, lawmakers are mulling a potential ban on the practice, with the bill’s sponsor arguing it flies in the face of “one person, one vote.” 
Rep. Rachelle Smit (R-Martin), chair of the House Election Integrity Committee on Tuesday testified on her House Bill 4707, which would prohibit ranked choice voting in the state, and invalidate any local ordinance that permits it.
Rather than casting a ballot for one candidate, ranked choice voting asks voters to rank candidates for a position based on preference. However, Smit argued the system is confusing, and would burden clerks after sweeping changes to Michigan’s election system were approved by voters in 2022. These include allowing for nine days of early voting, permitting voters to use a photo ID or sign an affidavit in order to verify their identity and allowing voters to place themselves on a permanent absentee voter list. 
“By prohibiting ranked choice voting, we will ensure that the principles of one person one vote continues, and we will avoid confusion and additional burdens on our already-stressed election administrators,” Smit said. 
In her testimony, Smit noted that two states currently use ranked choice voting, Alaska and Maine. Sixteen others have prohibited the practice, while its legal status remains up in the air in Michigan. 
However, Rep. Stephen Wooden (D-Grand Rapids), the committee’ minority vice chair, questioned the need for a ban, noting that Michigan’s election law already prescribes the time and manner of each election in a way that does not allow for ranked choice voting.
Five cities in the state have adopted Ranked Choice Voting measures for their local elections: Ann Arbor, Ferndale, East Lansing, Kalamazoo and Royal Oak. However, state law has kept the localities from implementing these measures. 
  House Election Committee Minority Vice Chair Stephen Wooden (D-Grand Rapids). Aug. 19, 2025 | Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan Advance
In response, Smit said the state does not expressly prohibit or allow for ranked choice voting, and that the goal of the bill is to clearly establish that it is not allowed in state, local or federal elections. 
Responding to another question from Wooden, Smit said the bill was a response to the Rank MI Vote ballot effort, later confirming that if Michigan voters were to approve the proposed constitutional amendment, her bill would be rendered unenforceable. 
Trent England, one of the chairs of the anti-ranked choice voting coalition Stop RCV, argued ranked choice voting makes the whole process more difficult, complicating ballot design, lengthening instruction on the ballot and requiring voters to have more information both about the ranked choice voting process, and the candidates themselves. 
“You might say, ‘Well, I only have one candidate I like,’ but if you don’t rank other candidates, you run the risk of being actually disenfranchised in the election,” England said.

He also cited a 2022 incident in Alameda County, California where the county’s ranked choice voting system was not properly configured. As a result, the initially certified results for an Oakland school board race were not correct. 
Shelly Lake, deputy clerk for Irving Township in Barry County, said that if ranked choice voting was approved in Michigan, she expected the number of spoiled ballots would greatly increase due to issues with how a voter fills out their ballot. 
However, Joe Spaulding, campaign director for Rank MI Vote, said the error rate for ranked choice elections is roughly the same as single-candidate elections. 
Spaulding noted that Michigan’s political parties currently use a modified form of ranked choice voting in selecting their nominee for attorney general and secretary of state. 
“If ranked choice voting is good for the party in the primary, I promise it’s good for the public in the general election,” Spaulding said.

Spaulding also argued that single-choice elections punish voters when more candidates run, while ranked choice voting incentivizes collaboration over partisanship. 
“Liberals and conservatives don’t want to vote for the lesser of two evils. Progressives want options outside of the oligarchy, in their words. [Make America Great Again Republicans] want choices beyond what they call a uniparty.…ranked choice voting is a very simple solution to the issue of voters getting punished when they’re given more choices in an election,” Spaulding said. 
Members of the committee voted 6-3 along party lines to send the bill back to the House floor for further consideration.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_4940-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-19 15:58:25.280966

States and clinicians are working on getting correct information on vaccines to vulnerable groups amid shifting federal guidance. (Photo illustration by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Heading into the respiratory illness season, states and clinicians are working to encourage pregnant patients to get COVID-19 vaccinations, even though the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services no longer recommends that they should.
Along with being older and having an underlying health condition, pregnancy itself is a risk factor. Pregnant women are more vulnerable to developing severe illness from COVID-19. They’re also at high risk for complications, including preterm labor and stillbirth. The vast majority of medical experts say getting the shot is safe and effective — much safer than having the illness.
But HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced in May that the agency would no longer recommend that pregnant women get the vaccine. Before testifying before Congress in June, Kennedy circulated a document on Capitol Hill claiming higher rates of fetal loss after vaccination. But the authors of those studies told Politico that their work had been misinterpreted.
Experts say the federal shift puts the onus on state health agencies to ramp up vaccine guidance and outreach. Clinicians and public health organizations are trying to dispel misinformation and make sure information reaches low-income people and people of color, who had higher maternal death rates during the pandemic. During the first two years of the pandemic, the virus contributed to a quarter of maternal deaths, according to federal data.
“We are severely disappointed,” said Dr. Neil Silverman, a professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California, Los Angeles David Geffen School of Medicine. He has studied vaccines and pregnancy for the past 15 years and specializes in high-risk pregnancies.
Silverman called the federal shift a “public health tragedy on a grand scale.”
Vaccinations against COVID-19 help prevent severe illness in pregnant people as well as their newborns, who are too young to get vaccinated, Silverman said. In what’s called passive immunity, vaccinated mothers pass on antibodies to their babies through the placenta and through breast milk.
“State public health agencies are probably going to have to implement vaccine guidance that differs from the federal recommendations. And that’s going to be an interesting can of worms,” said OB-GYN Dr. Mark Turrentine, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas.
Turrentine serves on a board of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists that focuses on immunization and infectious diseases. He said his recent pregnant patients who had COVID-19 hadn’t gotten the vaccine.
“The change in guidance on the federal level just really makes a lot of confusion, and it makes it very challenging to try to explain to individuals why all of a sudden the difference,” Turrentine said.
A slew of public health organizations have been making a concerted effort to dispel vaccine myths. They include the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit organization of maternal-fetal experts. At a news briefing the society held this month, clinicians stressed the safety and long-standing science behind COVID-19 vaccines, as well as the shots for RSV and the flu. Cases of RSV and the flu tend to peak in the winter months, while in recent years COVID-19 cases have spiked in the summer and the winter.
Dr. Brenna Hughes, an OB-GYN who chairs the organization’s infectious diseases and emerging threats committee, pointed to survey data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing that less than a third of eligible pregnant patients received COVID-19 shots, and only 38% received RSV shots for the 2023 to 2024 season. Less than half — 47% — received flu shots, and 59% received TDAP (whooping cough) vaccines.
CDC data shows that for last year’s and this year’s season, only between 12% and 14% of pregnant patients got the COVID-19 vaccine.
“The complications from the infection are so much greater than the complications and the very few and typically minor adverse events that might occur from the vaccine,” said microbiologist Sabra Klein, a professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
In June, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and 30 other professional health organizations signed a letter urging insurers to continue covering the COVID-19 shot for pregnant women, and have continued to urge coverage since then.
CVS Caremark, one of the nation’s three major pharmacy benefit managers, told Stateline it will continue covering the vaccine for pregnant women. The Arizona, California and North Carolina state Medicaid agencies also told Stateline they are still currently covering COVID-19 vaccines for pregnant women.
Dr. Kimberly Fortner, president-elect of the Infectious Diseases Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology, said during the maternal-fetal medicine briefing that she hopes medical groups’ joint messaging will bolster insurers.
“Hopefully by us linking arms, that can then help develop consistency so that insurers will continue to pay for the vaccine,” she said.
Exacerbating disparities
Dr. Ayanna Bennett, director of the District of Columbia Department of Health, said the federal government’s new stance has upended “a system that’s been stable for a very long time.”
Bennett said her agency used federal pandemic aid to shore up vaccine outreach efforts to communities of color. Now that flow of money is ending.
The changes in federal guidance and funding will “almost certainly exacerbate” maternal health disparities, said Marie Thoma, a perinatal epidemiologist and an associate professor in the University of Maryland Department of Family Science who researches pregnancy and COVID-19.
Black and Indigenous women died at higher rates. The virus exacerbated existing racial disparities in maternal health — and created new ones: Latina mothers, who generally see low rates of maternal mortality, saw deaths surge to 28 per 100,000 in 2021. Their rate was about 12 per 100,000 in 2018, according to federal data.
“We are going in with some exposure already that we didn’t have during the start of the pandemic. So, there will be some protection, but now that will erode,” said Thoma. “If we’re not getting vaccines, or if people are hesitant to take them, we could see some increase.”
Silverman said the administration’s efforts to strip mentions of race from government policies makes it difficult for institutions to reach populations at greatest risk. He called the dismissal of decades of data “saddening and infuriating.”
“The politicization of the vaccine process, or access to it, is what concerns me the most,” said Dr. Yvette Martas, a Connecticut OB-GYN who chairs the board of directors of the Hispanic Health Council.
Many women “are trying to navigate an economic system that’s not always in their favor in terms of also providing access to the kind of educational material that they need,” she said.
Not just COVID-19
In June, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee, replacing them with some members who are vaccine skeptics.
The change is creating chaos. Some states have vaccine laws, such as mandates for kids and coverage statutes, that are specifically tied to the committee’s decisions.
The Vaccine Integrity Project at the University of Minnesota called on frontline health workers, health officials and professional societies to “counter the spread of inaccurate and confusing vaccine information.”
At a news briefing this month held by the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, representatives from Alabama, Connecticut and Washington, D.C., said they will continue to recommend vaccines.
Alabama’s state health officer, Dr. Scott Harris, said clinicians will be instrumental in getting correct vaccination information to patients.
“We don’t think that we necessarily have the same authoritative voice that we might have had a decade ago in trying to guide people in what to do, but we do believe that people trust their health care providers in most cases and are certainly willing to listen to them,” he said at the briefing.
Bennett said she is hopeful that strong, consistent messaging from respected medical organizations will help combat confusion.
“Having established groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics or the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology make very firm recommendations that keep us essentially not changed from where we have been, I think, should reassure families,” she said.

“This is a painful moment,” the school’s president, Laura Walker, said in the statement. “Like many peer institutions across the country, we are confronting an uncertain economy and a challenging overall environment for higher education. I remain profoundly grateful to the dedicated staff, past and present, who make Bennington such a singular place.”
The college said it was providing severance proposals to affected employees.

The college employs a total of 90 full-time faculty members and 214 full-time staff members, Jowett said.
The announcement comes just months after the college finalized collective bargaining agreements with three groups that make up Bennington College United. The union is backed by AFT Vermont, an umbrella labor union for higher education and health care workers.
Those agreements increased wages and bonuses for staff and faculty members, and guaranteed tuition exchange and benefits for family of staff, according to previous reporting.
Twelve of the 15 staffers were members of the union and performed work at the school in academic services, institutional research and in the college’s business office.
The union in a statement said members were “very concerned about the ability of the reduced workforce to keep the college functioning and to make sure that students receive the services they need to thrive.”
The union said it has requested information related to the decision “and will be requesting a meeting to discuss alternatives to the layoffs.”

Entergy Louisiana plans to spend $3.2 billion on a power plant to run the center, plus additional money on a related gas plant in south Louisiana and transmission lines. (Meta)Fast-tracking a vote that was originally expected to happen two months from now, state utility regulators plan to decide tomorrow whether to approve a controversial power plant Entergy wants to build specifically for tech company Meta to run a giant data center planned for Northeast Louisiana.
A utility ratepayer advocacy group that opposes the project says this attempt to rush the Louisiana Public Service Commission’s approval has been shrouded in secrecy and “back door deals.”
The commission never actually scheduled the vote but did set an October deadline for the matter to be settled, leaving many to expect the vote would take place that same month. But stakeholders and some parties previously opposed to the project told regulators last month they had reached an agreement with Entergy — ahead of deadline — that would allow its power plant to advance. Among the organizations and companies that have joined the agreement are the Southern Renewable Energy Association, Walmart, the Sierra Club, 1803 Electric Cooperative, Occidental Chemical, Northeast Electric Cooperative and Housing Louisiana. 
“It looks like we got a peace deal with everybody — most of the big players — so it’s time to move on. Why wait?” Public Service Commission Chairman Mike Francis, R-Crowley, said Monday in a phone interview. 
However, some groups have not signed onto the agreement. They include the Alliance for Affordable Energy, Louisiana Energy Users Group and Union of Concerned Scientists. 
The Alliance for Affordable Energy is urging the commission to postpone its vote until October to give the public the time many expected to have to learn more about the proposal. Logan Burke, the alliance’s executive director, said she is concerned with a lack of transparency around the project. 
“Everything about it is unusual,” Burke said in a text message.  
Entergy Louisiana wants to install three natural gas-powered turbine generators that would provide 2,250 megawatts of electricity for Meta’s facility. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, has 20 other data centers around the world, and its Louisiana facility would be the largest. The power plant project is being built specifically for the data center, though it will be connected to the larger electric grid and could supply power to other customers.
The growing appetite for digital services has fueled the growth of data centers, leading to a great demand for power supply to run the facilities. A December 2024 report from the U.S. Department of Energy found that data centers consumed 4.4% of the electricity generated nationwide the year before. That share is expected to climb to a range between 6.7% and 12% by 2028. 
Neither Meta nor its data center affiliate, Laidley, is involved in the proposal before the Public Service Commission. The commission’s administrative law judge, who handles matters under its jurisdiction, has sealed some of the filings that are normally available to the public and redacted details such as the estimated energy loads Meta will need for the data center and Entergy’s cost projections for the power plants. 
The companies insist these details are commercially sensitive and proprietary, so Administrative Law Judge Melanie Verzwyvelt allowed the utility to file many of its documents under seal.
The Louisiana Energy Users Group, whose membership includes some of the state’s largest industrial companies, also opposes the power plant. It recently fought to get Public Service Commission approval to buy its own independent power source rather than wait on Entergy to build the clean energy sources its members have long requested. 
The group has argued that Meta will receive preferential treatment from Entergy Louisiana, which has committed to teaming up with Meta to build 1,500 MW of solar power generation that will connect to the broader grid. LEUG members say other companies have been waiting years on Entergy to fulfill commitments they had for their own renewable projects and worry they will now have to take a backseat to Meta — an argument the utility company refutes. 
Power for data centers could come at ‘staggering’ cost to consumers

Commissioner Jean Paul Coussan, R-Lafayette, said the agreement includes a section that prohibits Meta from skipping the line. 
“That section ensures that Meta will not be provided access to renewable generation before existing customers have access to it,” Coussain said via text. 
Francis, the chairman, said the commission could postpone its vote on Entergy’s proposal if the commissioners still have concerns at Wednesday’s meeting, but the matter seems to have support from both sides of the aisle. Three Republicans and two Democrats sit on the commission. 
Commissioner Foster Campbell, D-Bossier Parish, has said he backs the data center and the power plant because of the jobs they would bring to an economically depressed area of the state. The Meta facility is slated for a  2,250-acre state-owned site known as Franklin Farms, a rural area 30 miles northeast of Monroe. Poverty and unemployment rates in the area are among the highest in the state. 
Joe Shyne, Campbell’s chief of staff, said the projects will bring an estimated 6,500 construction jobs and 500 more from Meta once the data center is operating.
“This is something [Campbell’s] been fighting 50 years for — to bring jobs to that area,” Shyne said in a phone interview.
The commission’s other Democrat, Davante Lewis of Baton Rouge, said he has some concerns but is generally not opposed to the project. He cited analysis from the commission’s staff and Entergy showing the power plant will likely benefit Louisiana’s electric grid at little or no cost to ratepayers for at least the first 15 years of its lifespan. He said his biggest concern is one that could come to fruition many years from now. 
Meta has committed to working with Entergy to build at least 1,500 MW of solar energy generation, though it could be years before the utility can start on that. 
Also, Meta’s power supply agreement with Entergy is for 15 years, while the average working lifespan of a natural gas power plant is 30 years. If Meta decides not to renew its deal with Entergy after 15 years, Louisiana ratepayers could have to pay the remaining cost of the power plants, Lewis said.   
The Public Service Commission meeting will take place Wednesday at the Carl F. Grant Civic Center in Plaquemine, starting at 10 a.m.

At its first meeting Tuesday, the search committee announced it would work with SSA Consultants of Baton Rouge with the aim of finding a candidate by the end of the year. SSA’s  experience primarily involves recruiting executives for the finance, general business, construction, health care, nonprofit and public sectors.  
The committee will meet three times this fall before submitting its recommendations to the LSU Board of Supervisors, which has the final vote on who will lead the LSU System and the Baton Rouge campus. The search process hopes to forward three and five finalists for the board. 
LSU Board Chairman Scott Ballard said he hoped the new president could start at the beginning of the spring semester next year, though he said the start date could change depending on who is ultimately hired. 
The committee is tasked with finding a replacement for former President William Tate, who left earlier this year to take the same job at Rutgers University in New Jersey. Since Tate left, LSU Vice President for Agriculture Matt Lee has served as interim president. 
SSA Consultants president Christel Slaughter said some of her firm’s work related to the search will be subcontracted to Eric Monday, executive vice president for finance and administration at the University of Kentucky. Monday, who was formerly LSU’s chief financial officer, has been rumored to be interested in being LSU’s next president. 
Several people have already expressed interest in the LSU presidency, Slaughter said, but ads will be placed soon to allow candidates to formally apply. 
Among those rumored to be interested in the position are Lee, McNeese President Wade Rousse, who has the support of LSU Board Vice Chairman Lee Mallett, and Republican U.S. Rep. Julia Letlow. 
This is the first leadership hire at LSU since Gov. Jeff Landry, with the legislature’s support, gained control of choosing the chairs of the state’s higher education system board. Since Landry took office in January 2024, he has moved to steer college curriculum and faculty governance to the right.    
Slaughter has ties to conservative politics in Louisiana. She is on the board of the Louisiana Association of Business and Industry, and state campaign finance records show she has primarily donated to Republicans. They include former LABI CEO Stephen Waguespack, who ran unsuccessfully against Landry for governor in 2023. 
The search committee members are: 

Scott Ballard, LSU Board of Supervisors chairman 
Lee Mallett, LSU Board of Supervisors vice chairman
Valencia Sarpy Jones, LSU Board of Supervisors past chair
Rémy Voisin Starns, LSU Board of Supervisors past chair
James Williams, LSU Board of Supervisors past chair

Cristina Parajón (left) and Sen. Harold Pope (right) on Aug. 18 resigned from the New Mexico Redistricting Task Force. (Photos by Austin Fisher and Danielle Prokop / Collage by Julia Goldberg)Pointing to a national “arms race” around redrawing the maps used to elect members of Congress, two New Mexico lawmakers on Monday resigned from a task force devoted to reforming how the state’s political maps are made.
Rep. Cristina Parajón and Sen. Harold Pope, both Albuquerque Democrats, on Monday resigned from the New Mexico Redistricting Task Force, an independent group convened by Fair Districts for New Mexico, which is affiliated with the nonpartisan advocacy group League of Women Voters New Mexico.
The task force met for the first time earlier this month and its second meeting is scheduled for Tuesday afternoon. Organizers have said the task force’s major focus will be resuming a push to create an independent redistricting commission and divest lawmakers’ authority in redrawing political maps.
That goal comes alongside heightened national attention to “gerrymandering,” in which officials redraw political maps to benefit specific candidates and parties. Efforts by Republican lawmakers in Texas to redistrict mid-decade — versus at the typical start of the decade — has sparked redistricting battles in other states, States Newsroom reports. New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham hosted Democratic members of the Texas House of Representatives last month as they sought support from governors across the country.
In their resignation letters on Monday, Pope and Parajón both cited the national redistricting controversy as the reason for their departures.
“It’s not right to move forward with state-level independent redistricting without action at the national level,” Parajón wrote. She expanded on that thought in an interview with Source, noting that, “If New Mexico were to reform in isolation, while other states continue to manipulate their maps, then our voters are losing their voice at the Congressional level on issues that affect them every single day.” She said she would like to see the state Constitution amended to make redistricting independent, and believes the rest of the task force feels the same way.
Pope told Source NM that his departure has nothing to do with the task force itself.
“It’s not the board; their intentions, I think, are to do the right thing,” Pope said in an interview Tuesday. “But I felt that I can’t be part of this with what’s going on.”
Task Force Co-Chair Rod Kennedy, a former New Mexico Court of Appeals judge and Republican turned Independent, told Source that he’s disappointed in the lawmakers’ decision to leave and wishes they had a better reason for doing so.
“When things outside of redistricting in New Mexico are used as an excuse to say ‘I can’t talk about it here,’ then is it a matter of party over principle? I don’t know,” Kennedy said in an interview. “We just lost two bright, young, talented people.”
Kennedy said the task force will look to replace Parajón and Pope and offer their seats to Democrats in order to reestablish parity between the two major parties.
Sen. Jay Block (R-Rio Rancho), one of the four remaining Republican elected officials on the task force, told Source that he thinks Pope and Parajón’s resignations are hypocritical because the Democratic majority in the Legislature did not entirely follow the Citizen Redistricting Committee’s recommendations the last time it redrew the state’s maps in 2021.
“No one believes these Democrats, especially when they can’t even speak up when the shoe is on the other foot,” Block said in an interview Tuesday. “Give me a break.”
Kennedy said while Pope and Parajón mention Republicans’ gerrymandering in Texas and Ohio in their resignation letters, they don’t mention that the Democrats in California and New York are also preparing to do the same thing.
“There’s four states that are showing that the principles of fair districts are, in a sense, more important than ever,” he said. “It’s a double standard to say, ‘We want fair districts only so long as we’re in the majority and we don’t have to worry about it.’”

(Photo by Henry Redman/Wisconsin Examiner)  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul has joined a multi-state lawsuit against the Trump Administration’s demand that states participate in federal immigration enforcement efforts or risk losing access to federal money available through the Victims of Crime Act. 
If the conditions are allowed to go through, Wisconsin could lose up to $24 million meant to help compensate victims of crime as well as fund local advocates, counselors and crisis response centers, according to a state Department of Justice news release
“VOCA funding is intended to be used to help victims of crime,” Kaul said in a statement. “It is appalling that the Trump administration is weaponizing this funding.”
Wisconsin is joined in the lawsuit, which was filed in a Rhode Island federal district court, by New Jersey, California, Delaware, Illinois, Rhode Island, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, and the District of Columbia.
VOCA takes fees, fines and penalties collected in federal court proceedings and disburses those funds to the states to use on victim services — which can include the operations of community-based organizations such as domestic violence shelters and rape crisis centers and the work of victim-witness offices within county district attorneys’ offices. 
While individual law enforcement agencies have agreed to help immigration authorities in various capacities through efforts such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s 287(g) program, the lawsuit argues that civil immigration enforcement is strictly a federal responsibility.  Requiring that states participate in such actions violates the constitution’s tenets of separation of powers and federalism, the suit argues. 
A handful of communities across the state have enacted policies to prevent local law enforcement from aiding ICE enforcement. Milwaukee Police Department policy states that immigration enforcement is the authority of the federal government and local cops getting involved in the enforcement of immigration law could harm the department’s relationship with immigrant communities. 
“With a policing philosophy that is community-based, problem-oriented, and data-driven, we are committed to ridding the city’s streets of violent offenders regardless of whether such offenders are in the United States legally or illegally,” the policy states. “We are also committed to facilitating safe, sustainable communities where individuals are encouraged to report crime and provide the police with useful information and intelligence. However, proactive immigration enforcement by local police can be detrimental to our mission and policing philosophy when doing so deters some individuals from participating in their civic obligation to assist the police.” 
The Trump Administration’s threat to withhold VOCA funds comes as the program has already seen massive cuts. Last year, Wisconsin’s portion of federal VOCA grants dropped from $40 million annually to $13 million. 
Because of those previous cuts, shelters across Wisconsin have been struggling to make ends meet and retain the services available for victims of crime. 
“Victim services is not just about one person gets hurt and experiences trauma, and then they’re helped and they go on with their lives,” Shira Phelps, executive director of DOJ’s Office of Crime Victim Services, told the Wisconsin Examiner last year. “This is really about sort of taking away a foundation for communities that help in every other aspect. Housing, education, all of those different fields are going to feel this really deep impact.”

Aug. 19, 2025 | Photo by Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceA new approach to solving Michigan’s housing crisis was pitched on Tuesday, with a $160 million legislative funding request that supporters said would be a bold new strategy for new and rehabilitated attainable dwellings.
Dubbed the MI Home Program, the plan would leverage partnerships with local governments, developers and the Michigan Legislature with fewer barriers to boost housing construction and rehabilitation, supporters said at a news conference hosted Tuesday by the Michigan Municipal League. The goal was to also revamp local zoning rules to help accelerate new home builds across the state.
The $160 million investment pitched at the news conference – which would need legislative approval and is not yet a part of the state’s upcoming budget, which remains in limbo – would span five years and could lead to the development of 10,000 housing units within reach for Michigan residents.
Dan Gilmartin, CEO and executive director of the Michigan Municipal League, said the proposal addresses the need for attainable housing, which has grown to a topic of discussion all across the state.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“Here in Michigan, we’ve identified the need to put forward a statewide housing plan, made significant investments and changed policy to help each of these has been successful,” Gilmartin said. “But we must continue to work together if more progress is to be made.”
Gilmartin said the proposal includes four targeted programs that would fund updates to zoning regulations, provide grants to fill finance gaps on a short-term basis, create a revolving loan fund to address long term gaps, and ongoing funding for the employer assisted housing fund.
Eligible properties would include single use unit houses, duplexes, triplexes, quadplexes, town homes, row houses, condos in a complex, condos in a community, dwelling units in a mixed use structure and modular homes, Gilmartin said. 
Under the plan, properties that would be awarded grants would be sold or rented to individuals who have an annual income of not more than 120% of an area’s median income. 
“It also ensures the property stays attainable for no less than 10 years,” Gilmartin added.
The readiness incentive grants would need an investment of $5 million, while base level home grants would need an investment of $95 million in the first two years of the plan, increasing to a $145 million investment in years three through five. Those latter grants would fill the gap when building or rehabbing homes.
The revolving home fund would need a $50 million investment in the first two years that can be layered with grant dollars to address other gaps.
The employer-assisted housing fund would need $10 million annually to continue operation, all with the aim of matching employer investments toward workers securing housing.
Aside from Gilmartin and other members of the Michigan Municipal League, the news conference also featured state representatives including Republican Mark Tisdel of Rochester and Democrats Samatha Steckloff of Farmington Hills and Amos O’Neal of Saginaw, respectively.
“This is a housing development strategy that chooses partnership over preemption,” Steckloff said. “It’s about empowering local decision makers to meet the unique housing needs of their communities and ensuring they have the resources and flexibility to get the job done.”
Brian Farkas, director of workforce housing with Allen Edwin Homes, said the plan was about building more homes and building them the right way, in partnership with communities.
“By aligning resources, incentives, and local leadership, we can continue to work to address today’s housing needs and set the stage for long-term economic vitality across the state.”
When asked if Democrats and Republicans in the Michigan Legislature, who have shown a clear unwillingness to get a budget down quickly in a new era of divided government, could guarantee that the funding proposal would pass in a fractured environment, Gilmartin said nothing is guaranteed in Lansing. 
Tisdel added that the money would only be awarded after communities have engaged in the type of zoning and code ordinance overhauls that the proposal calls for.
“The governor has rightly told us several times how many hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars we’ve spent over the last several years in generating more housing,” Tisdel said. “This is a relatively small portion of that. It’s not up front money. This is money after results.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1000068557-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-19 14:57:40.460079

Read it here.
El fiscal general Rob Bonta presentó el lunes la 39.ª demanda de California contra la administración Trump , impugnando los nuevos requisitos de aplicación de la ley migratoria que impuso a la financiación federal para las víctimas de delitos.
 Se esperaba que los estados recibieran más de 1200 millones de dólares en fondos federales para víctimas de delitos este año, y se esperaba que California solicitara 165 millones. Sin embargo, el mes pasado, la Oficina de Víctimas de Delitos del Departamento de Justicia de EE. UU. anunció que los estados deben comprometerse a apoyar y asistir al Departamento de Seguridad Nacional en la aplicación de las leyes migratorias federales para acceder a dichos fondos.
Algunos estados consideran que esta condición es inaceptable, y la posible pérdida de fondos podría ser el segundo golpe significativo este año de la administración Trump a los programas californianos que apoyan a las víctimas de delitos. A principios de este año, el Departamento de Justicia de EE. UU. recortó drásticamente las subvenciones para programas de prevención de la violencia y servicios a las víctimas, inicialmente valoradas en 811 millones de dólares. Solo en California, el departamento recortó poco más de 80 millones de dólares.
 “El Congreso nunca ha impuesto condiciones de control migratorio civil a esta financiación porque no tiene nada que ver con la inmigración. Esto es un abuso descarado del poder presidencial”, declaró Bonta en una conferencia de prensa el lunes sobre la última demanda.
 California y otros 20 estados demandaron a la administración Trump por el posible recorte en el Tribunal de Distrito de EE. UU. para Rhode Island. Los estados buscan que los tribunales impidan que el Departamento de Justicia implemente las nuevas normas.
 La financiación disputada para las víctimas de delitos financia gastos como refugio de emergencia, asistencia médica en caso de agresión sexual, compensación por salarios perdidos y gastos funerarios.
 La demanda alega que la administración Trump viola la Constitución de Estados Unidos al eludir al Congreso en cuanto a la financiación de un programa que creó. También alega que la administración Trump violó la Ley de Procedimiento Administrativo, ley objeto de la mayoría de las demandas que California ha presentado contra la Casa Blanca. Esta ley establece que una agencia federal debe seguir los procedimientos y explicar sus razones para cambiar una política.
 Los estados alegan que el Departamento de Justicia “se basó arbitrariamente en factores relacionados con la inmigración que el Congreso no le autorizó a tener en cuenta al asignar fondos de subvenciones federales para apoyar a las víctimas”.
 El fiscal general de Rhode Island, Peter Neronha, declaró durante la conferencia de prensa que las nuevas normas del Departamento de Justicia contradicen sus valores. Puso el ejemplo de un menor víctima de agresión sexual que fue entrevistado en un centro de defensa infantil. “Una pregunta que no debería hacerse es si ese menor se encuentra en este país legal o ilegalmente”, afirmó. El fondo de la ley contra el delito fue promulgado por el presidente Ronald Reagan en 1984. La ley surgió tras un informe del Grupo de Trabajo sobre Víctimas del Delito de Reagan de 1982, que afirmaba que la “negligencia hacia las víctimas del delito es una vergüenza nacional”, según la demanda del lunes. Entre las recomendaciones del informe se encontraba “promulgar legislación para proporcionar fondos federales a los programas estatales de compensación a las víctimas del delito”.
 En mayo, California presentó otras dos demandas contra la administración Trump por vincular la aplicación de leyes migratorias con el financiamiento del transporte y la lucha contra el terrorismo, lo que afectó miles de millones de dólares en apoyo federal.

 La primera vez que subí a un avión fue en un vuelo desde Delhi, India, hasta el Aeropuerto Internacional John F. Kennedy de Nueva York. Llegué a Estados Unidos como estudiante, primero a la Universidad de Illinois y, tras obtener mi maestría, a California, donde he vivido desde entonces. He creado empresas, contratado personal y me he forjado una vida aquí.
Mi historia es la de innumerables personas que vinieron a Estados Unidos a estudiar, trabajar y construir. Mi compañero de cuarto en la universidad, Arvind Krishna, es ahora director ejecutivo de IBM. Millones de personas más han llegado aquí y han construido vidas y oportunidades.
 Los estudiantes internacionales no son la única comunidad inmigrante, ni la más numerosa. Hace unas semanas, asistí a la graduación de mi sobrina de la Universidad de California en San Diego y visité el Parque Chicano, donde grandes murales adornan una catedral al aire libre dedicada al activismo comunitario, celebrando a millones de inmigrantes cuyo trabajo y creatividad construyeron California.
 Eso es lo que hace que las noticias de hoy sean tan difíciles de ver. Como fundador de un servicio de orientación universitaria, estoy en primera fila para ver las recientes políticas que están transformando la educación.
 Recientemente, la Corte Suprema permitió que el Departamento de Educación de Estados Unidos despidiera a miles de empleados, lo que provocó demoras en el procesamiento de la ayuda financiera, ralentizó las investigaciones de derechos civiles y presentó desafíos para las comunidades.
Ese es solo el golpe más reciente. Se han producido recortes en la financiación de la investigación, una oleada de nuevos obstáculos para las visas y esfuerzos para desmantelar las iniciativas de diversidad e inclusión que ayudan a los estudiantes pertenecientes a minorías. Y, por supuesto, las recientes redadas del ICE han perturbado a las comunidades inmigrantes asentadas desde hace tiempo en ciudades como Los Ángeles.
 Vemos el efecto dominó en nuestro trabajo. Algunos estudiantes internacionales tienen miedo de solicitar admisión a la universidad, de mudarse a un campus lejano o incluso de venir a Estados Unidos.
 Muchos de nuestros estudiantes son inmigrantes o hijos de inmigrantes. La madre de una estudiante que iba a la universidad es de Vietnam y trabajaba en un salón de uñas en Oakland. Mientras aún estaba en la preparatoria, la estudiante se encargaba de los impuestos de la familia, llenaba formularios y tenía un trabajo.
 También obtuvo una beca completa para asistir a la universidad. Después de terminar sus estudios, confío en que hará una contribución notable al mundo.
 Un estudiante, cuyos padres emigraron de la India, asistió a la Universidad de California en Berkeley con una beca tras desarrollar una aplicación para detectar sustancias químicas permanentes en el suministro de agua de su comunidad. Otro estudiante, cuyos padres vinieron de México para forjarse una vida en el sur de California, cursa actualmente un programa de enfermería en la Universidad Estatal de California en Fullerton.
Hay miles de historias como esta. Cada joven tiene el potencial de mejorar nuestro futuro, de convertirse en el próximo gran líder, innovador o médico.
 Los estudiantes internacionales no sólo aportan habilidades y ambición, sino que también aportan dinero real a California.
Los aproximadamente 141,000 estudiantes internacionales en California gastaron $6.4 mil millones en 2023, lo que generó 55,000 empleos, según la Asociación de Educadores Internacionales (NAFSA, por sus siglas en ingles). En universidades públicas como la UC y la CSU, el aumento en la matrícula de estos estudiantes ayuda a financiar la ayuda financiera y los servicios para los residentes.
 En términos más generales, los hogares inmigrantes aportan $715 mil millones, o aproximadamente un tercio del producto interno bruto del estado . Tan solo los californianos indocumentados pagan alrededor de $8.5 mil millones al año en impuestos estatales y locales.
 Gran parte de los comentarios sobre los recientes cambios de política se centran, con razón, en su crueldad, pero estas medidas nos perjudican a todos .
La fuerza de California reside en sus comunidades inmigrantes. Nuestro liderazgo en ciencia, tecnología, agricultura y artes depende de estudiantes, académicos y trabajadores de todo el mundo.
 A los manifestantes que luchan por preservar los derechos y las oportunidades de los inmigrantes, les digo que su lucha es nuestra lucha. A quienes piensan que esto no les afecta, les prometo que sí. Afecta su economía y el futuro de sus hijos. Y a los líderes que impulsan estas políticas: deténganse antes de que California y Estados Unidos pierdan las mismas fortalezas que los construyeron.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/050625-TurnitinAICollege-JAH-CM-02.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-19 13:57:59.248503

The Beaver Creek wind farm is the latest addition of renewable energy resources that PSE has brought online as it works toward complying with Washington state’s clean energy laws. By 2030, the amount of new, non-emitting generation resources PSE will need to have is more than the utility has accumulated in its 150-year history.
The wind farm has an initial nameplate capacity of 248 megawatts, enough energy to power about 83,000 homes a year. Montana wind has a high production rate that is especially valuable during extremely cold weather in the Pacific Northwest, when high pressure systems mean that Washington wind farms produce less energy.
“The Beaver Creek project moved from construction to full operation in just over a year, demonstrating what’s possible when we combine innovative planning with strong partnerships,” Mary Kipp, president and CEO of Puget Sound Energy, said in a press release. “I want to particularly thank Montana’s state and local officials for their support and collaborative approach that helped make this aggressive timeline possible. Their partnership has been instrumental in bringing this important energy resource online to serve our customers.”
PSE has been a partner in Montana’s energy economy since the 1970s and continues to invest in the state of Montana and its communities. The project uses existing PSE transmission on the Colstrip Transmission System to bring the robust wind energy back to PSE customers. PSE is proud to own and operate the Beaver Creek facility in Stillwater County, employing local workers and supporting the community. The wind farm utilized an estimated 200 to 300 skilled workers during construction and now employs 10 permanent on-site workers for ongoing operations.
“The Beaver Creek Wind project is a great example of how we can harness Montana’s abundant natural resources while strengthening our economy,” Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte in the press release. “This is another important milestone in Montana’s all-of-the-above energy approach. I appreciate this investment in our state, and I look forward to seeing the benefits it brings to families and businesses in Stillwater County and beyond.”
As part of the clean energy transition, PSE continues to partner with energy producers in the state of Montana. Recent examples include power purchase agreements signed with Energy Keepers, Inc., the tribally owned corporation of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes for hydroelectric power, and an agreement with NextEra for power from Montana’s largest wind farm, Clearwater Wind, based in Rosebud, Custer and Garfield Counties. PSE also has a power purchase agreement with Clearway Energy Group to receive clean energy from its Haymaker Wind facility, that will be constructed in Wheatland and Meagher Counties, Montana.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Cables-wind-turbine-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-19 13:57:59.248503

The Trump administration is once again pressuring liberal cities and states, including Denver and Colorado, to cooperate with deportation efforts, despite previous setbacks in court.
Attorney General Pam Bondi sent letters last week telling sanctuary states, cities and counties that “you better be abiding by our federal policies and with our federal law enforcement, because if you aren’t, we’re going to come after you,” she said in a Fox News interview. She demanded the areas answer her by Tuesday.
Cities and states with so-called sanctuary policies generally refuse to assist with immigration raids or accede to requests for local jails to hold prisoners for deportation. Those that responded to Stateline’s questions about the letters said they were not inclined to change their positions about cooperation with immigration authorities.
“It’s the tactic of a bully. And the only way to deal with a bully is to let them know that they’re not going to intimidate you,” Rhode Island Democratic Attorney General Peter Neronha said in a statement.

The Trump administration is attempting to force more cooperation with immigration arrests. But it suffered a serious court reversal on July 25, when a federal judge dismissed a sanctuary policies case against Illinois, Chicago and Cook County.
The state and local policies reflect a “decision to not participate in enforcing civil immigration law — a decision protected by the Tenth Amendment,” Judge Lindsay Jenkins wrote in an order now under appeal.
Bondi’s letters follow the Justice Department’s Aug. 5 release of a list of sanctuary jurisdictions including 12 states, the District of Columbia, four counties and 18 cities. That’s fewer jurisdictions than the 14 states and almost 500 counties and cities that appeared on an earlier list, which the agency withdrew after criticism that it included conservative counties that were fully cooperating with immigration enforcement.
The states on the new list are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington state. The list also includes some counties and cities in those states as well as in Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New Mexico.

Other federal courts have issued injunctions to at least temporarily stop Trump administration from withholding unrelated federal funding from governments that don’t cooperate on immigration. Cities, counties and states have filed lawsuits challenging Trump’s executive orders targeting sanctuary policies, including a February order that federal payments to states and localities must not “by design or effect, facilitate the subsidization or promotion of illegal immigration, or abet so-called ‘sanctuary’ policies that seek to shield illegal aliens from deportation.”
“The executive orders are directing agencies to basically take a maximalist approach to putting pressure on local governments to cooperate with immigration [enforcement], even though they’re not required to do so by federal law,” said Jonathan Miller, one of the attorneys working on the California case for the Public Rights Project, a California-based group promoting civil rights protections for states and cities.
One city on the administration’s list was Rochester, New York, which disciplined some police officers for helping federal agents make a March arrest in the city. The city already faces a lawsuit brought by the Trump administration that prominently mentions the arrest of three men from Guatemala; one of whom has since pleaded guilty to re-entering the United States after a previous deportation.
A spokesperson for the city, Barbara Pierce, said in a statement to The Guardian that, “Nothing in Attorney General Bondi’s letter is new and none of it has legal merit.”
“The letter reiterates many of the frivolous arguments that the federal government has already made in its pending suit against the city of Rochester,” she added. “These same arguments were levied against the city of Chicago and were dismissed by the federal district court for the eastern district of Illinois nearly a month ago.”
Ally Sullivan, a spokesperson for Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis, said in a statement that Colorado “is not a sanctuary state. The Governor continues to be frustrated by this mistaken and incorrect label.” In a televised interview earlier this year, Polis pointed out that Colorado fully cooperates with federal authorities on criminal matters. Immigration, he said, is a civil matter.
“In Colorado, we are improving public safety, apprehending dangerous criminals, cooperating with federal law enforcement on criminal investigations, and keeping our communities safe,” Sullivan said.
Nevertheless, Colorado faces a federal lawsuit brought by the administration over its alleged sanctuary policies. Polis signed a measure in May that limits local law enforcement’s communication with federal immigration authorities and restricts where federal authorities can operate within schools, child care facilities, hospitals and libraries without a judicial warrant.
Connecticut Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont in a statement said the state’s Trust Act, which the Trump administration has targeted as a sanctuary policy, was passed with bipartisan support and helps ensure local police concentrate on serious crimes. The Trust Act, passed in 2013 and expanded in 2019, limits information sharing and compliance with requests to detain immigrants for federal immigration authorities.
“Nothing about this makes Connecticut a sanctuary in any legal or practical sense — it makes our state one that upholds the Constitution, respects the rule of law, and prioritizes the safety and well-being of our communities,” Lamont said.

States and clinicians are working on getting correct information on vaccines to vulnerable groups amid shifting federal guidance. (Photo illustration by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Heading into the respiratory illness season, states and clinicians are working to encourage pregnant patients to get COVID-19 vaccinations, even though the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services no longer recommends that they should.
Along with being older and having an underlying health condition, pregnancy itself is a risk factor. Pregnant women are more vulnerable to developing severe illness from COVID-19. They’re also at high risk for complications, including preterm labor and stillbirth. The vast majority of medical experts say getting the shot is safe and effective — much safer than having the illness.
But HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced in May that the agency would no longer recommend that pregnant women get the vaccine. Before testifying before Congress in June, Kennedy circulated a document on Capitol Hill claiming higher rates of fetal loss after vaccination. But the authors of those studies told Politico that their work had been misinterpreted.
Experts say the federal shift puts the onus on state health agencies to ramp up vaccine guidance and outreach. Clinicians and public health organizations are trying to dispel misinformation and make sure information reaches low-income people and people of color, who had higher maternal death rates during the pandemic. During the first two years of the pandemic, the virus contributed to a quarter of maternal deaths, according to federal data.
“We are severely disappointed,” said Dr. Neil Silverman, a professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California, Los Angeles David Geffen School of Medicine. He has studied vaccines and pregnancy for the past 15 years and specializes in high-risk pregnancies.
Silverman called the federal shift a “public health tragedy on a grand scale.”

Vaccinations against COVID-19 help prevent severe illness in pregnant people as well as their newborns, who are too young to get vaccinated, Silverman said. In what’s called passive immunity, vaccinated mothers pass on antibodies to their babies through the placenta and through breast milk.
“State public health agencies are probably going to have to implement vaccine guidance that differs from the federal recommendations. And that’s going to be an interesting can of worms,” said OB-GYN Dr. Mark Turrentine, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas.
Turrentine serves on a board of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists that focuses on immunization and infectious diseases. He said his recent pregnant patients who had COVID-19 hadn’t gotten the vaccine.
“The change in guidance on the federal level just really makes a lot of confusion, and it makes it very challenging to try to explain to individuals why all of a sudden the difference,” Turrentine said.
A slew of public health organizations have been making a concerted effort to dispel vaccine myths. They include the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit organization of maternal-fetal experts. At a news briefing the society held this month, clinicians stressed the safety and long-standing science behind COVID-19 vaccines, as well as the shots for RSV and the flu. Cases of RSV and the flu tend to peak in the winter months, while in recent years COVID-19 cases have spiked in the summer and the winter.
Dr. Brenna Hughes, an OB-GYN who chairs the organization’s infectious diseases and emerging threats committee, pointed to survey data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing that less than a third of eligible pregnant patients received COVID-19 shots, and only 38% received RSV shots for the 2023 to 2024 season. Less than half — 47% — received flu shots, and 59% received TDAP (whooping cough) vaccines.
CDC data shows that for last year’s and this year’s season, only between 12% and 14% of pregnant patients got the COVID-19 vaccine.
“The complications from the infection are so much greater than the complications and the very few and typically minor adverse events that might occur from the vaccine,” said microbiologist Sabra Klein, a professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
In June, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and 30 other professional health organizations signed a letter urging insurers to continue covering the COVID-19 shot for pregnant women, and have continued to urge coverage since then.
CVS Caremark, one of the nation’s three major pharmacy benefit managers, told Stateline it will continue covering the vaccine for pregnant women. The Arizona, California and North Carolina state Medicaid agencies also told Stateline they are still currently covering COVID-19 vaccines for pregnant women.

Dr. Kimberly Fortner, president-elect of the Infectious Diseases Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology, said during the maternal-fetal medicine briefing that she hopes medical groups’ joint messaging will bolster insurers.
“Hopefully by us linking arms, that can then help develop consistency so that insurers will continue to pay for the vaccine,” she said.
Exacerbating disparities
Dr. Ayanna Bennett, director of the District of Columbia Department of Health, said the federal government’s new stance has upended “a system that’s been stable for a very long time.”
Bennett said her agency used federal pandemic aid to shore up vaccine outreach efforts to communities of color. Now that flow of money is ending.
The changes in federal guidance and funding will “almost certainly exacerbate” maternal health disparities, said Marie Thoma, a perinatal epidemiologist and an associate professor in the University of Maryland Department of Family Science who researches pregnancy and COVID-19.
Black and Indigenous women died at higher rates. The virus exacerbated existing racial disparities in maternal health — and created new ones: Latina mothers, who generally see low rates of maternal mortality, saw deaths surge to 28 per 100,000 in 2021. Their rate was about 12 per 100,000 in 2018, according to federal data.
“We are going in with some exposure already that we didn’t have during the start of the pandemic. So, there will be some protection, but now that will erode,” said Thoma. “If we’re not getting vaccines, or if people are hesitant to take them, we could see some increase.”
Silverman said the administration’s efforts to strip mentions of race from government policies makes it difficult for institutions to reach populations at greatest risk. He called the dismissal of decades of data “saddening and infuriating.”
“The politicization of the vaccine process, or access to it, is what concerns me the most,” said Dr. Yvette Martas, a Connecticut OB-GYN who chairs the board of directors of the Hispanic Health Council.
Many women “are trying to navigate an economic system that’s not always in their favor in terms of also providing access to the kind of educational material that they need,” she said.
Not just COVID-19
In June, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee, replacing them with some members who are vaccine skeptics.
The change is creating chaos. Some states have vaccine laws, such as mandates for kids and coverage statutes, that are specifically tied to the committee’s decisions.




The politicization of the vaccine process, or access to it, is what concerns me the most.


– Dr. Yvette Martas, a Connecticut OB-GYN who chairs the board of directors of the Hispanic Health Council



The Vaccine Integrity Project at the University of Minnesota called on frontline health workers, health officials and professional societies to “counter the spread of inaccurate and confusing vaccine information.”
At a news briefing this month held by the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, representatives from Alabama, Connecticut and Washington, D.C., said they will continue to recommend vaccines.
Alabama’s state health officer, Dr. Scott Harris, said clinicians will be instrumental in getting correct vaccination information to patients.
“We don’t think that we necessarily have the same authoritative voice that we might have had a decade ago in trying to guide people in what to do, but we do believe that people trust their health care providers in most cases and are certainly willing to listen to them,” he said at the briefing.
Bennett said she is hopeful that strong, consistent messaging from respected medical organizations will help combat confusion.
“Having established groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics or the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology make very firm recommendations that keep us essentially not changed from where we have been, I think, should reassure families,” she said.

On Tuesday, the ACLU of Montana told Missoula County District Court Judge Shane Vannatta that the state’s motor vehicle application leaves only two choices, “male” and “female,” forcing nonbinary or transgender residents to lie on forms in order to get a driver’s license. Furthermore, attorneys for ACLU argued that Montana statute doesn’t even require the information for licensing drivers, so the requirement just creates a hurdle and an opportunity to discriminate.
Meanwhile, attorneys for the State of Montana argued that the driver’s license application form specifically says there are no legal consequences for answering the question incorrectly, therefore the state doesn’t even have the power to discriminate based on gender or sex. Instead, attorneys for the state say that the case of plaintiff M.B. is really a straightforward case of a resident not completing an application.
Vannatta is hearing the case as the ACLU has appealed the Human Rights Commission decision that overturned a hearing officer’s finding that the state had discriminated. The commission said it overturned the officer’s decision because it believed the Montana Department of Motor Vehicles had correctly determined the form was not filled out properly. In Montana, those decisions can be appealed to the district court.
The ACLU says that form and the decision violate the Montana Constitution’s equal protection provision.
The case stems from “M.B.,” the unnamed Montanan the ACLU is representing. M.B. identifies as nonbinary, and when it came it to filling out forms for a driver’s license, the choices were “male” and “female.” M.B. disclosed an “NB” — presumably for nonbinary — but state officials claim that by not completing the form, they were within their authority to not issue a license. Attorneys for the State of Montana argued in court that the form also includes a disclaimer that says residents cannot be punished for checking the incorrect “sex” form.
Alex Rate, legal director for the ACLU of Montana, said that it boils down to equal protection of the laws: A cisgender person can get a license, but a nonbinary person cannot — even though the courts in Montana have repeatedly recognized that the binary male or female designations are insufficient.
“It’s impossible to discriminate based on gender and not violate the Montana Human Rights Act,” Rate said. “It simply cannot be the case that these laws violate the constitution, but can be allowed under state law.”
Rate also said a close reading of Montana state laws shows that gender identification is not required as information that needs to be collected for a driver’s license.
“What the state is saying, is that you have to be assigned male or female at birth in order to be eligible for a driver’s license,” Rate said. “And the state is arguing that because the person is neither, that the Montana Human Rights Act does not protect that person? That’s absurd.”
But Assistant Attorney General Alwyn Lansing said the case has been incorrectly characterized. Instead, it boils down to a person not filling out the forms, meaning the state could not issue a driver’s license, Lansing argued.
Lansing pointed out that the state specifically outlines that there is no penalty for answering the “gender question” incorrectly on the driver’s license application.
“It is impossible for the state to discriminate based on sex because there is no penalty for answering incorrectly,” she said. “The Montana Department of Motor Vehicles couldn’t process the application because M.B. didn’t complete the form.”
As an analogy, Lansing said that other government agencies, like the Transportation Security Administration, won’t process forms unless they’re completed, so an agency like the Montana Department of Motor Vehicles should have the same flexibility.
“Forms are a part of life, and failure to fill them out means that you risk not getting the benefits,” Lansing said.
“If you argue that the boxes do not matter, why include it?” Vannatta asked. “How does sex qualify a person to drive a vehicle?”
Lansing answered that decision was a philosophical one as well as the prerogative of the Legislature.
That was a theme that Rate continued through closing arguments.
“Why put it on an application if it serves no purpose,” Rate asked. “Why erect that hurdle?”
He also pointed out that his client, M.B., also wrote “NB” on the form, but it was not an option and neither box was checked .
“The MVD could have changed the system. It had options available for eliminating the prompt,” Rate said. “Remember that sex is not statutorily required for a driver’s license.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/GettyImages-1488675709-1024x662.jpg,,,2025-08-19 13:57:59.248503

Ron DeSantis and Attorney General James Uthmeier announced Tuesday that the state is suing two textbook publishers, alleging they’ve overcharged schools and Florida’s taxpayers.
The lawsuit, filed in the state Circuit Court in Tallahassee, accuses McGraw Hill and Savvas Learning Co. of “systematically overcharging Florida school districts for instructional materials.”
The governor listed examples in Osceola County, where he alleges overcharging has amounted to more than $279,000, and in Miami-Dade, where a book was sold at a discount but at a higher price in nine other counties.
“This is a clear indication that Florida law was not being followed,” DeSantis said during a news conference at Voyager K-8 school in St. Cloud. 
DeSantis alleged at least 5,900 instances of overcharges, saying civil penalties could amount to as much as $60.5 million between both publishers. 
Florida law requires textbook publishers to charge the lowest price offered to any state or district to every other district in the state.
The state, which intervened in the lawsuit after a whistleblower filed an initial suit, claims the book publishers “withheld cost reductions required by statute.”

The state is seeking up to three times the damages caused plus civil penalties to deter future violations. 
“These two companies, McGraw Hill and Savvas, they got discounts as they cut deals in other places, and they saved money,” Uthmeier said. “Unfortunately for them, Florida law requires the lowest price to be given to our school systems. They did not do that so we have sued them and we will hold them accountable.”
The governor and other lawmakers are pushing to eliminate property taxes in the state. Foregoing that tax revenue would increase the strain on local governments to fund schools, among other public services.
“Every taxpayer dollar matters, and we will not allow publishers to exploit these taxpayer dollars. I, in conjunction with the attorney general and the governor, will hold every one of these publishers accountable on both content and cost,” Education Commissioner Anastasios Kamoutsas said. 
“If you want to provide these textbooks in Florida, you’re going to follow our laws, you’re going to respect our parents, you’re going to treat every school district equally,” he added. 
Kamoutsas’ reference to content alongside costs refers to a Florida law that limits what content can be included in school library materials, and which has been subject to several lawsuits.
When asked by a reporter about a judge’s ruling last week striking down part of the school library book ban law, DeSantis said, “More often than not we get it rectified on appeal, so I absolutely anticipate that that will be rectified on appeal.”

To read more about the project, click here.

Though I imagine I’ll never return, more often than not, my brain drains back to Mississippi. My whole adult life has been a journey up and down the Hudson River, from New York City to the Adirondacks, but inevitably, I find my thoughts leaking toward another river.
I grew up fearing being left behind in the Rapture, but in earnest, it feels like I’m the one who left everyone behind. I’m not proud of this, but I’m certainly not ashamed. I have roots in the Northeast now, and a life that isn’t easily transplanted elsewhere, especially to the Red Clay Hills of Neshoba County. Life took me from Mississippi, and life keeps me away.
I left Mississippi for New York in 2015, and I estimate that I’ve returned only 11 times. My sporadic trips home have been mostly because I’m consistently broke, but now it’s a combination of that and concerns for my safety.
My mother, also limited by finances and Mississippi’s minimum wage, has visited me twice in 10 years, once in the spring of 2016 and then when I graduated from Yale Divinity School in 2023.
I haven’t been back since I came out as a trans woman and began medically transitioning in the winter of 2024. I try not to be overwhelmed with guilt or grief for the imagined, shared life I don’t experience with my mother. Rather, I’ve learned to cherish what we do have.

It’s strange to be who I am, mostly for her but also for me. She has learned to love me regardless of whether or not she understands what I’m doing. In her mind, if you go to college, you become a nurse or a lawyer. You settle down, probably in Jackson, maybe Oxford, most likely in my hometown of Philadelphia, and commute by car more than an hour to work. You probably see your mom weekly. She sees her grandkids as often as possible.
That is not how life turned out. We do talk on the phone. Sometimes we get into once-a-week phone call sprees, other times, I drop off for weeks, maybe a month, when I’m depressed.
When I come home, she picks me up from the airport and drives me back a few weeks later. We crack the windows, smoke cheap Mississippi cigarettes and try to cram 10 years of a strange-to-us mother-daughter relationship into a 90-minute ride to the airport in Jackson. Usually, we talk about suffering, death, sin, God, the end of the world, and what the hell I am doing with my life.
You go to college to get a job, to make more money than your parents and to buy a strange suburban-but-rural McMansion just beyond city limits where you start a family around the age of 25 at the latest.
According to my mother, I went to the University of Mississippi and got brainwashed. She tells me often that it’s like she doesn’t know who I am, and she’s mostly right. She hasn’t met anyone I’ve dated in person since high school. She hasn’t seen me in person since transitioning, and I changed my name to Romy. I explain my relationship with my family to friends, peers, new partners and congregations, always with an articulate sense of heartbreak that I’ve learned to intellectualize and package up in a story of “working-class origins,” single motherhood, a white Christian nationalist rural community and my stumbling through adulthood “refusing not to live by my values.”
I originally left Mississippi to be an AmeriCorps Vista volunteer in the Capital Region of New York. I’d never been there. I took a Greyhound from Memphis to New York City to Albany, New York  with two large suitcases and a backpack. Several of my friends from college had moved to New York City, and their couches and shared beds provided a safe launching pad for more of us. I had also fallen in love with a fashion student turned designer that I met on a trip to the city the year prior. Though that romance flamed and flickered for many years and ultimately flamed out, my reason for staying in the North was the life I was increasingly stumbling into.
I went there because, at the time, I had an insatiable desire to live out my values and politics. After all, I was maybe one of two socialist public policy majors at the Trent Lott Leadership Institute at the University of Mississippi, and I didn’t want to be a lawyer, a lobbyist or a policy wonk.
I wanted to be poor and engage in building sustainable autonomous communities. I wanted to learn how to be a person who had no work/life distinction, but a vocation and calling.
Through AmeriCorps, I luckily found a small group of activists, urban homestead types, organizers and ex-social workers living together helping others at the margins and themselves start businesses and worker-cooperatives while struggling through mental health crises, and taking on an impossible but seemingly always plausible dream of a directly democratic community owned, operated and governed only by those who live there.
This was my first “job” out of college. It was my dream come true, and the most difficult thing I’d ever done. I burnt out pretty hard after two years, and probably made somewhere between $25,000  and $30,000 during that whole time. Since then, the most I’ve made in a year is my current PhD stipend of about $34,000.
I was, however, helped along by friends, colleagues and the activist communities that I was stumbling into. Through them, I was encouraged to go to Union Theological Seminary, land a job at a prestigious artist residency in the mountains, go to Yale Divinity School, discern that I was called to be a priest and come to know myself as a trans woman.
My life outside of Mississippi has been sustained solely by relationships that transgress the boundaries between work and life, co-workers and friends. I regularly reflect on and often worry about how fragile this all is, and if my own vocational and intellectual pursuits have been worth what I’ve left behind or never had.
I’m not sure I’ll ever know. However, I’ve managed to find profound meaning in it all so far, and it keeps me digging myself into this hole in which I will hopefully find what I am  looking for, or dig my own damn grave.

The Trump administration is once again pressuring liberal cities and states to cooperate with deportation efforts, despite previous setbacks in court.
Attorney General Pam Bondi sent letters last week telling sanctuary states, cities and counties that “you better be abiding by our federal policies and with our federal law enforcement, because if you aren’t, we’re going to come after you,” she said in a Fox News interview. She demanded the areas answer her by Tuesday.
Cities and states with so-called sanctuary policies generally refuse to assist with immigration raids or accede to requests for local jails to hold prisoners for deportation. Those that responded to Stateline’s questions about the letters said they were not inclined to change their positions about cooperation with immigration authorities.

“It’s the tactic of a bully. And the only way to deal with a bully is to let them know that they’re not going to intimidate you,” Rhode Island Democratic Attorney General Peter Neronha said in a statement.
The Trump administration is attempting to force more cooperation with immigration arrests. But it suffered a serious court reversal on July 25, when a federal judge dismissed a sanctuary policies case against Illinois, Chicago and Cook County.
The state and local policies reflect a “decision to not participate in enforcing civil immigration law — a decision protected by the Tenth Amendment,” Judge Lindsay Jenkins wrote in an order now under appeal.
Bondi’s letters follow the Justice Department’s Aug. 5 release of a list of sanctuary jurisdictions including 12 states, the District of Columbia, four counties and 18 cities. That’s fewer jurisdictions than the 14 states and almost 500 counties and cities that appeared on an earlier list, which the agency withdrew after criticism that it included conservative counties that were fully cooperating with immigration enforcement.
The states on the new list are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington state. The list also includes some counties and cities in those states as well as in Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New Mexico.










It's the tactic of a bully. And the only way to deal with a bully is to let them know that they're not going to intimidate you.


– Rhode Island Democratic Attorney General Peter Neronha


Other federal courts have issued injunctions to at least temporarily stop Trump administration from withholding unrelated federal funding from governments that don’t cooperate on immigration. Cities, counties and states have filed lawsuits challenging Trump’s executive orders targeting sanctuary policies, including a February order that federal payments to states and localities must not “by design or effect, facilitate the subsidization or promotion of illegal immigration, or abet so-called ‘sanctuary’ policies that seek to shield illegal aliens from deportation.”
“The executive orders are directing agencies to basically take a maximalist approach to putting pressure on local governments to cooperate with immigration [enforcement], even though they’re not required to do so by federal law,” said Jonathan Miller, one of the attorneys working on the California case for the Public Rights Project, a California-based group promoting civil rights protections for states and cities.
One city on the administration’s list was Rochester, New York, which disciplined some police officers for helping federal agents make a March arrest in the city. The city already faces a lawsuit brought by the Trump administration that prominently mentions the arrest of three men from Guatemala; one of whom has since pleaded guilty to re-entering the United States after a previous deportation.

A spokesperson for the city, Barbara Pierce, said in a statement to The Guardian that, “Nothing in Attorney General Bondi’s letter is new and none of it has legal merit.”
“The letter reiterates many of the frivolous arguments that the federal government has already made in its pending suit against the city of Rochester,” she added. “These same arguments were levied against the city of Chicago and were dismissed by the federal district court for the eastern district of Illinois nearly a month ago.”
Ally Sullivan, a spokesperson for Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis, said in a statement that Colorado “is not a sanctuary state. The Governor continues to be frustrated by this mistaken and incorrect label.” In a televised interview earlier this year, Polis pointed out that Colorado fully cooperates with federal authorities on criminal matters. Immigration, he said, is a civil matter.
“In Colorado, we are improving public safety, apprehending dangerous criminals, cooperating with federal law enforcement on criminal investigations, and keeping our communities safe,” Sullivan said.
Nevertheless, Colorado faces a federal lawsuit brought by the administration over its alleged sanctuary policies. Polis signed a measure in May that limits local law enforcement’s communication with federal immigration authorities and restricts where federal authorities can operate within schools, child care facilities, hospitals and libraries without a judicial warrant.

Connecticut Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont in a statement said the state’s Trust Act, which the Trump administration has targeted as a sanctuary policy, was passed with bipartisan support and helps ensure local police concentrate on serious crimes. The Trust Act, passed in 2013 and expanded in 2019, limits information sharing and compliance with requests to detain immigrants for federal immigration authorities.
“Nothing about this makes Connecticut a sanctuary in any legal or practical sense — it makes our state one that upholds the Constitution, respects the rule of law, and prioritizes the safety and well-being of our communities,” Lamont said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-19 17:01:24+00:00,CT Mirror,CT delegation seeks millions in earmarks amid funding uncertainty,Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/19/ct-federal-earmarks/,Dozens of CT cities and towns could get a boost for local projects. But they could get left out if Congress passes a short-term funding bill.,"Connecticut’s congressional delegation has requested tens of millions of dollars in federal funding to support projects in their districts and statewide that range from infrastructure initiatives to local museums to affordable housing development.
Dozens of towns and cities could see investments flow into their communities through funding for nearly 170 projects that are currently included in bills to fund the federal government. As things stand, lawmakers are hoping to secure at least $177 million with the possibility of more funding and requests from the Senate tucked into legislation.
Lawmakers are trying to secure money for these projects and groups — formerly known as earmarks — through the annual appropriations process. But if Congress cannot pass spending bills for fiscal year 2026, towns and cities across Connecticut may not get access to those funds.
When Congress returns to Washington next month, lawmakers will face a quick deadline of Sept. 30 or face a partial government shutdown. They’re trying to pass full-year funding bills but appear to be more on track to once again approve a short-term bill known as a continuing resolution. The latter would keep things running for a certain amount of time at current levels and might not attach local project funding to it.
The uncertain fate of earmarks comes amid the termination and delays of various federal grants and funding by the Trump administration. In some capacities, states and localities that rely on federal dollars will need to make up that funding to keep certain programs running and address those gaps through state budgeting.
That also comes on top of a recently passed rescissions package proposed by the administration that clawed back millions of dollars of international aid and public broadcasting funds that had been appropriated by Congress.
Some Democratic appropriators are wondering whether they can “trust” any funding agreements negotiated with the majority party because the administration could once again decide to withhold funding that Congress approves.
“Of course those projects are really important to our districts and to our states. But it’s not reason alone to support a bill,” U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy told reporters at the Capitol last month before the month-long recess. The Connecticut senator is the ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security.
He has been the lone vote on some funding bills in his committee. Before lawmakers went on the August recess, he was one of only nine Senate Democrats who opposed passage of the first few funding bills. While leadership is pushing for a bipartisan process, Murphy has been wary, given the current state of federal funding.
“I don’t know that any guarantee that the president makes is something you can take to the bank,” Murphy said. “I don’t think the bills we’re voting on are actually what’s going to happen,” referring to Trump’s push for a rescissions package that cut congressionally appropriated funds.
Possible funding for local projects across CT
Since the revival of earmarks in a limited capacity in 2021, Connecticut and other states have seen a windfall from federal funding bills. But those requests for fiscal year 2025 ultimately went nowhere as lawmakers passed short-term funding patches to keep the government running.
On the House side, nearly all project requests were added into the respective funding bills. Each member didn’t get the exact amounts they requested, which typically happens especially since those funds cannot exceed 1% of total discretionary spending.
Across the five-member delegation, they sought a total of $67 million for nearly 70 recipients. Connecticut’s biggest cities historically benefit greatly, but the funding requests reach all corners of the state.
Some of the projects included in the bills are familiar names that have received federal funding in the past through this process. Others are hoping for a better outcome this time since fiscal year 2025 requests ultimately didn’t go anywhere. And many of the hopeful recipients have received earmarked state funding included in Connecticut’s budget.
Nearly $24 million would go toward housing-related projects, with the vast majority for affordable housing development in places like North Stonington, Madison, Norwalk, Goshen, Hartford, Warren, New Haven and Waterbury.
Universities across Connecticut would also get a sizable boost from the funding bills: Central Connecticut State University for the Central Workforce and Innovation Hub, Wesleyan University’s financial aid program to support formerly incarcerated students, University of New Haven’s de-escalation training center, and Albertus Magnus College’s Cyber Lab.
Senate earmarks, meanwhile, are requested jointly by Connecticut’s Democratic senators. So far, Murphy and U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., have almost 100 funding requests included in spending bills.
Unlike their House counterparts, senators don’t have a cap on the number of requests, so they typically bring in much more funding for their states. Some Senate requests also overlap with requests made by a member of the House delegation.
The Senate Appropriations Committee has yet to post the data for congressionally directed spending in three more bills, so Connecticut’s requests and funding may go up. The two senators made another two dozen requests under the Financial Services and General Government, Energy & Water, and Homeland Security bills. Not all of those are guaranteed to make it into the three bills, or the full amounts.
One local recipient is no longer under consideration after Connecticut’s senators asked appropriators to pull it.
The request changed amid a federal investigation looking into state Sen. Douglas McCrory’s involvement with entities that receive state and federal funding and his relationship with a woman who runs some of those groups. Grand jury subpoenas are seeking, among other things, “all documents concerning any personal or non-professional relationship between” McCrory and Sonserae Cicero-Hamlin.
SHEBA Resource Center, a nonprofit run by Cicero-Hamlin, has sought federal funding through the earmarks process a couple of times. The group ultimately didn’t get any funding last year because Congress passed a short-term bill that didn’t include any congressionally directed spending.
She again asked Connecticut’s senators to make a request of $3.5 million for fiscal year 2026, the current appropriations process playing out in Congress. That money would have been used to help SHEBA convert a Hartford church she bought for $10 into new offices.
Cicero-Hamlin and McCrory met with Murphy last year to talk about funding opportunities in North Hartford. It is typical for federal lawmakers to meet with local stakeholders on such issues, especially since they use that information to help inform them on funding requests.
The senators have asked the Senate Appropriations Committee to no longer consider the $3.5 million request, Murphy’s office said last week.
“When we’re being asked for money for specific local organizations, obviously we try to get a sense of how well they’re thought of in the neighborhood or the city,” Murphy said last week. “We rely on local people to make sure we’re dealing with folks who have the best interest of the community in mind.”
Earmarks uncertain as Congress faces tight funding deadline
Earmarks can be mutually advantageous for members of Congress and the people they represent. Lawmakers can steer federal dollars into their states and districts, while constituents see an influx of money for local groups and projects. And politically, they are a way for members to tout the money they are bringing home, especially during an election year.
Many see them as direct ways of reaching the needs of communities that they know best, as well as wielding more influence during the appropriations process. Others have a negative connotation, viewing them as extraneous measures for pet projects that balloon congressional spending.
But earmarks, now known as community project funding in the House and as congressionally-directed spending in the Senate, faced a 10-year ban and were revived in 2021 with more limits and new rules.
Lawmakers and their immediate families must certify they have no financial ties to their requests. State, local and tribal governments as well as nonprofit entities can receive funding, but for-profits are ineligible. House members can request up to 15 projects, but there is no cap on the number for senators.
Connecticut’s appropriators and the rest of the delegation will return next month with a tall order of funding the government at a time when things are politically fraught in Congress.
While the Senate passed its first bipartisan funding package, the process has so far been markedly different in the lower chamber.
U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, who is the ranking member of the House Appropriations Committee, has slammed the various GOP-led spending bills during markup hearings last month.
“Republicans have put forward yet another bill that favors billionaires and corporations,” DeLauro said at last month’s hearing on the fiscal year 2026 Financial Services and General Government funding bill. “Yet another bill that does not fight waste, fraud and abuse but embraces it.”
With the government funding process still playing out, that has left the fate of local and state funding in limbo.
If they ultimately get attached to some kind of funding legislation, here are some of the highest-funded requests made by each member of Connecticut’s delegation:
U.S. Sens. Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal
Two of the largest Senate requests made jointly by Murphy and Blumenthal came in the funding bill for Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies.
That includes $23 million for the submarine Pier 8 replacement at SUBASE New London in Groton. The bill also includes $7 million for a project to modernize an aviation support facility for the CT Army National Guard.
U.S. Rep. John Larson, D-1st District
In his Hartford-based district, Larson is seeking $3.1 million for Bristol’s Fire and Police Department’s CPAT and ASHER Training Facility as well as $2 million for trail improvements for Hockanum Linear Park in East Hartford.
U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-2nd District
Two of the largest projects in Courtney’s eastern Connecticut district are about $2 million each slated for the Connecticut Department of Housing to go toward housing upgrades for Country Place Apartments in Colchester as well as money for the town of Mansfield for the second phase of a bike and pedestrian connection project.
U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-3rd District
The Borough of Naugatuck would get about $2.5 million to help with a Connectivity & Transit Oriented Development Project. Another $2.2 million would go to Southern Connecticut State University in New Haven to convert a vacant building into a community and workforce development hub.
U.S. Rep. Jim Himes, D-4th District
In the southwestern corner of the state, Himes is seeking $2 million for Stamford’s Housing Authority and Charter Oak Communities with its redevelopment and construction of new units. Another $1.2 million would go toward safety improvements for bikers and pedestrians on Washington Boulevard in Stamford.
U.S. Rep. Jahana Hayes, D-5th District
Hayes has asked for $1.5 million for Southbury Public Library and nearly $1.1 million for the replacement of Toro Field Siphon and help with sewer service around Torrington, Harwinton and Litchfield.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025_0118_SR_PeoplesMarch_990-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-19 13:57:59.248503

The Indiana Department of Health noted the number is higher than the state’s average of about two unsafe-sleep deaths per week.
“I can’t stress enough how important it is to place babies in a safe sleep environment,” State Health Commissioner Dr. Lindsay Weaver said in a Monday news release. “These tragic deaths are preventable and can have a profound impact on communities.”
State health officials reminded families of the “ABCs” of safe sleep: infants should sleep “Alone,” on their “Back,” and in a “Crib” free of blankets, pillows, bumper pads or stuffed animals.
Other precautions include having a breastfeeding and safe sleep plan. IDOH is additionally working with the Department of Child Services and other partners across the state to increase awareness about safe sleep, officials said.
Unsafe practices such as bed-sharing with adults or placing babies on their stomachs increase the risk of suffocation, according to the health department.
IDOH data shows that suffocation caused by unsafe sleep environments is the third leading cause of death for all Indiana infants. Between 2015-2019, 36% of unsafe sleep deaths in Indiana occurred during naptime.
The new warning follows the health department’s announcement in June that Indiana’s infant death rate in 2024 might have reached a historic low of 6.3 deaths per 1,000 live births, a drop from 6.6 the year before. That figure would mark the lowest rate since the state began keeping records in 1900. The data is provisional and a final analysis of the 2024 numbers is expected later this year.

The News Guild of Maine, which is affiliated with the Communications Workers of America,  already represents about 150 workers at the Trust’s papers and aims to include the 50 or so remaining non-union jobs at the Sun Journal in Lewiston, The Times Record in Brunswick and the Trust’s 17 weekly publications. Workers at the daily Kennebec Journal are represented by a separate branch of the CWA and are in the process of merging with the guild.
“More than 70% of those [50 non-union] workers have signed union authorization cards,” said Megan Gray, president of the News Guild of Maine.
On Monday, the guild filed a petition with the National Labor Relations Board seeking voluntary union recognition for those workers. The guild has marked the effort as a drive for “One Big Union.”
The nonprofit Trust is the state’s largest network of independent news and media outlets. It’s a subsidiary of the Colorado-based National Trust for Local News. Management at the Trust has yet to respond to union demands. Messages seeking comment were not immediately returned.
Speakers at the union rally expressed concerns about huge pay disparities between publications within the Trust, lack of job security and dwindling local content as papers are forced to work with fewer reporters and share non-local stories.

Paul Bagnall, an experienced reporter at The Times Record, said as a non-union worker he makes $18 per hour while starting reporters at the Press Herald earn a minimum of $28.75 per hour.
“With the cost of living going up, my paycheck has already stretched to a breaking point,” Bagnall said. “I am currently priced out of potential sources of information — going out to events, restaurants and cafes due to the cost of living — and it’s still rising.” 
Joe Lawlor, a longtime Press Herald reporter, called Bagnall’s pay shameful. 
“We can do better,” Lawlor said.
Sophie Burchell, a non-union reporter at the Trust’s southern Maine community news division, said her job is unfairly seen as a stepping stone, rather than a sustainable career.
“I want it to be seen as a place people can grow and thrive,” Burchell said. “I want to see my peers and their talents thrive in Maine journalism.” 
Kendra Caruso, an education writer at the Sun Journal, said the Trust isn’t living up to its own journalism mission.
“Its stated goal is to prevent news deserts across the nation. However, changes the company implemented early this year, including staff layoffs, have only increased the risk of more news deserts in Maine and decreased the amount of local news coming out of our newsrooms across the state,” Caruso said.
Gray said there was no way for the Trust to continue to support local journalism without first supporting its local journalists. 
“We’re expanding our union because we know that we must invest in our workers in order to invest in the future of journalism,” she said.

(Source: ACLU of Florida lawsuit exhibit)A three-judge panel of federal judges has upheld the constitutionality of a Florida Senate map created in 2022 that a group of voters had claimed was racially gerrymandered.
The case revolved around the design of Senate District 16 during the 2022 redistricting process, encompassing parts of Pinellas County and jumping across Tampa Bay into Hillsborough County. The seat is now held by Democratic Sen. Darryl Rouson of St. Petersburg.
Three plaintiffs testified in June that the Legislature’s plan to connect Black populations from parts of Hillsborough and Pinellas counties into SD 16 violated their equal-protection rights. They claimed it unjustifiably packed Black voters into District 16 and removed them from nearby District 18 in Pinellas, reducing their influence there.
They also alleged that the drawing of the district hurt their representation in Tallahassee.
The plaintiffs were represented in court by the ACLU of Florida and the Civil Rights & Racial Justice at New York University. The defendants were Florida Secretary of State Cord Byrd and Senate President Ben Albritton.
‘Race did not predominate’
“After a careful review of the evidence and the benefit of a four-day bench trial, we find that race did not predominate in the legislature’s motivations in drawing Senate District 16,” reads the opinion, issued Monday by U.S. Circuit Court Judge Andrew L. Brasher, U.S. Senior District Judge Charlene Edwards Honeywell, and U.S. District Judge Thomas P. Barber.
“The plaintiffs have not met their burden, whether through direct or circumstantial evidence, to prove that racial considerations subordinated race-neutral criteria. Though the legislature certainly considered racial demographics to confirm that District 16 complied with tier-one requirements, it did not subordinate race-neutral considerations to race-based objectives. The Senate never set racial targets or quotas.”
The main witness in the four-day trial was Jay Ferrin, who served as staff director of the Florida Senate Committee on Reapportionment in the fall of 2021, when the district’s lines were created. He discussed in lengthy testimony how he and his staff went about drawing up the Senate districts that year and the guidelines they followed.
He also testified that GOP legislators never asked him to draw up a Senate map that would have placed a district solely in Hillsborough County while ensuring that parts of south Pinellas County would not suffer from “diminishment.”
Under the Fair Districts Amendments “non-diminishment standard” placed by the voters into the state Constitution in 2010, districts cannot be drawn in a manner that “diminishes” the ability of minority voters to elect their preferred candidate of choice.
Other witnesses included two political scientists, a pollster, and a statistics professor, all of whom discussed different aspects of the redistricting process.
Attorneys for the plaintiffs said that before the trial they had intended to depose two GOP state lawmakers: Former Sen. Ray Rodrigues, who chaired the Committee on Reapportionment in 2021-2022, and Danny Burgess, who was the chair of the Select Subcommittee on Legislative Reapportionment at that time. However, both asserted legislative privilege, which shielded them from having to testify.
Former Orange County Democratic Sen. Randolph Bracy was also scheduled to appear for the plaintiffs, but failed to show up on two consecutive days. Instead, plaintiffs’ attorneys showed video clips from a 2021 committee hearing featuring Bracy. In one clip, he asked Ferrin why the proposed seat stretched across the two counties.
Ferrin replied that it was to comply with the Fair Districts amendment in the Florida Constitution, specifically the “Tier 1” standards that provide protections for racial and language minorities. Bracy asked Ferrin whether there was a way to comply with the Tier 1 standards and keep the counties separate.
Another video exchange showed Burgess telling Bracy that Senate staff had said that keeping the counties separate wasn’t possible, because it would lead to a “significant number of voters who would be disenfranchised.”
Before those clips were shown, Nicholas Warren, the attorney for the ACLU of Florida, asserted those clips would prove that  “race predominated in the drawing of the district.”
At the end of the day, however, the three-judge panel ruled otherwise.
The ACLU of Florida and the Florida Department of State did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tuesday morning.

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota State University is working to get back about $66 million in federal funding it lost when the Trump administration canceled a grant program it said was a “climate slush fund.”
The U.S. Department of Agriculture awarded South Dakota’s largest university $86 million in 2023 to research the impact of bison and cattle ranchers’ land management practices on soil health, and to open markets for farmers and ranchers using those practices. It was the largest research grant in South Dakota higher education history.
The grant came from the Partners for Climate-Smart Commodities program. Since 2022 during the Biden administration, the USDA had awarded 141 projects across the country a total of $3 billion. In April, the Trump administration terminated the grants and renamed the program Advancing Markets for Producers, saying “select projects may continue if it is demonstrated that a significant amount of the federal funds awarded will go to farmers.”



Brooke Rollins, head of the USDA, said at the time that the Biden-era version of the program “was largely built to advance the green new scam,” a reference to policies undertaken by Biden to address climate change.
SDSU had already spent about $20 million when the climate-smart grants were terminated. The university lost an additional $1.4 million in other grant funding. Two other South Dakota institutions also lost grant funding: the University of South Dakota lost $223,892, and South Dakota Mines lost $1.3 million.
The new program requires at least 65% of funding to go toward producer incentives, instead of 35% under the earlier version of the program. Kristi Cammack, assistant dean for SDSU agriculture West River operations, said the university renamed the project from “The Grass is Greener on the Other Side: Developing Climate-Smart Beef and Bison Commodities” to “Producers first: incentivizing land management and advancing markets for US beef and bison operations,” and shifted some funding originally intended for research toward producer incentives.
“We learned quite a bit over the two years we’ve been working on this, so we’ve been able to make educated shifts from research to producers while still being able to answer research questions,” Cammack said.
SDSU resubmitted its research proposal at the end of June with the hopes of regaining the award by the end of the summer.
“Producers are at the crux of the whole project,” Cammack said.
The five-year program encourages bison and cattle producers to implement conservation land management and grazing practices. They collect soil samples measuring microbes and other indicators of soil health and carbon sequestration as a result of the changes. The program also has a goal of introducing those producers to new markets with customers interested in eco-friendly practices.
More than 100 producers, primarily raising cattle, were participating in the project at the time of termination. More were preparing to enroll this year. SDSU had eight faculty members working on the project, along with four other staff members and several graduate students, Cammack said.
If re-awarded the funding later this summer, Cammack said the team will have a “busy fall” collecting soil samples before the ground freezes.
The grant cancellation is “interruptive,” she added, but her group is “nimble” and “research projects never go perfectly.”
The grant cancellation comes during a period of broader concern about university research funding. Federal funding for science is the lowest in years due to cuts made by the Trump administration and has been declining for decades as a share of gross domestic product.
President Donald Trump proposed “draconian cuts” this spring, said Daniel Scholl, vice president of research and economic development at South Dakota State, to federal research funding agencies such as the USDA, National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation – the three largest funding agencies from which SDSU receives research grants.
Scholl said he hopes Congress will resist the cuts, but is “uncertain where things will land.”
“We’re optimistic based on the efforts members of Congress are putting out to restore research funding and preserve the prowess of U.S. research and enterprise that’s largely driven by universities,” Scholl said.
If the university isn’t able to reinstate the remainder of its grant for the bison and cattle research project, Cammack said her team plans to apply for other grants and work with other partners to continue the program.

Emily O’Brien, R-Grand Forks, is leaving her legislative seat to become second-in-command at the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services.
O’Brien starts her new job as deputy commissioner of the department Wednesday. According to a Tuesday announcement from the agency, she will serve as a liaison between Health and Human Services and the Legislature, and oversee a funding and performance tracking system.
O’Brien’s resignation from the Legislature takes effect Tuesday, according to a Monday letter she sent to Legislative Council and legislative leaders.
“This role will allow me to continue serving our state, but in a different capacity — one that complements the work we have done together in the Legislature to strengthen the health, well-being, and future of North Dakotans,” O’Brien wrote in the letter.
O’Brien was first elected to represent District 42 in the North Dakota House in 2016, winning her bids for reelection in 2020 and 2024.
She served on the Human Resources Division of the House Appropriations Committee, which works on the Department of Health and Human Services budget, during the 2023 and 2025 legislative sessions.
O’Brien also chaired the Legislative Audit and Fiscal Review Committee over the 2023-2025 interim session, and served as its vice chair for the 2021-2023 and 2025-2027 interim sessions.
During the 2023-2025 interim, she served on the Health Care and Health Services committees.
“We are thrilled to welcome Emily as our new deputy,” Pat Traynor, interim commissioner, said in the Tuesday announcement. “She brings a proven track record of leadership, deep experience in public service, and a strong commitment to using data to guide decisions.”
The North Dakota Constitution forbids members of the Legislature from holding a full-time appointed position at the state level.
It’ll be up to the District 42 Republican Party to fill O’Brien’s seat, Legislative Council Director John Bjornson said in an email.
Once the district leaders receive an official letter from Legislative Management notifying them of the vacancy, they will have three weeks to name a temporary replacement. That replacement will serve until the 2026 general election, during which voters will elect someone to serve the final two years of O’Brien’s term, Bjornson said.",https://northdakotamonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_4332edit-1024x686.jpg,,,2025-08-19 12:58:56.139882

Feb. 5, 2025 | Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceAfter months of infighting and barbs thrown at the opposite respective chambers of the Michigan Legislature, the state’s House of Representatives appears poised to release the rest of its budget plan as soon as next week.
The announcement came Tuesday from state Rep. Ann Bollin (R-Brighton), chair of the House Appropriations Committee, who said the lower chamber’s plan would be “responsible” and embrace national Republican talking points like eliminating waste and reallocating resources – likely through cuts that legislative Democrats would outright oppose.
“As we wrap up our review of the state’s finances, one thing has become clear: Michigan taxpayers deserve better than the wasteful habits that have taken root in state government,” Bollin said in a statement. “Departments are sitting on slush funds created by phantom jobs that never get filled, and they’re rolling over hundreds of millions of dollars in work projects year after year. These dollars were meant to serve the people, not to be stashed away by bureaucrats. We’re putting a stop to that.” SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The budget negotiations this year hit a brick wall due to inaction from the House on its full budget, releasing and passing only a K-12 and higher education funding plan, and the Senate’s unwillingness to release a fully fleshed out road funding plan, although the Senate did pass a full government budget, including education funding, in May.
Congressional Republicans and President Donald Trump also did the Michigan Legislature no favors when they passed and Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which will likely blow a $1 billion hole in the state’s budget.
Lawmakers had a July 1 deadline to get their respective – and complete – plans passed and moved to the negotiating table with Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, but the chambers blew past that deadline and have been pointing fingers on which chamber was to blame. 
Some of the House’s logic on waiting was to see what fallout the federal budget might create for Michgian, although members of the Democratic-led Senate said their plan accounted for the steep cuts that were likely under Trump this year. 
‘I can’t punch air’: budget chasm continues as Michigan Legislature fails to hold session

The war of words between the two chambers worsened last week without any real sign of movement on the full House budget, but Bollin on Tuesday signaled that the first phase of the process may conclude soon.
Bollin noted the House Republican belief that Senate Democrats rushed their budget, coming up with a plan to spend $86 billion, which Bollin claimed was far more than the state can afford without raising taxes. The forthcoming House budget, Bollin said, took months to “carefully review every line of the budget.”
“We did the hard work of going through this budget line by line,” Bollin said. “That extra time allowed us to root out waste, fraud, and abuse, and to make smarter investments in the things that matter most to people across Michigan.”
Bollin said the House plan prioritizes $3.1 billion annually to repair the local roads in the worst condition, while also creating the Public Safety and Violence Prevention Trust Fund to send state dollars directly to local communities for public safety programs.
“It ends unfair taxes on tips, overtime pay, and retirement income,” she added. “We’re boosting education funding with more flexibility so schools can shrink class sizes, strengthen mental health services, and invest in the programs their kids need most. And we are making the necessary adjustments to ensure Medicaid remains available for every qualified Michigan resident who needs it.”
Bollin said the House’s approach would make a difference to tax payers in the long run.
“Every dollar we cut from bureaucracy and waste is a dollar we can put toward the real priorities of Michigan families,” she said. “You’re going to see a budget that respects taxpayers and focuses on fixing roads, keeping our communities safe, making life more affordable, and ensuring every child has the opportunity to succeed.”
In response to Bollin’s announcement, Tracy Wimmer, spokesperson for the House Democratic Caucus, said, “we would have loved to have read this in June.”
Messages seeking comment from Senate Democrats were not immediately returned.
Communication breakdown: No end to budget impasse in sight as leaders spend day throwing jabs

The mention of the roads plan was a signal that the House may be ready to move on with its budget plan without seeing the Senate’s roads plan first, as the upper chamber has yet to release its approach to funding roads in the coming fiscal year and beyond. Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks said last week that the Senate needed to see the House’s full budget before it could start nailing down a funding fix to the looming road repair cliff. The House moving its plan forward could mean the Senate’s roads plan might be imminent, as well.
Meanwhile, Whitmer has been playing harder ball to get both sides to an agreement on roads, noting in a recent press conference that no state budget plan was complete without funding for roads.
On Tuesday, the governor’s office released the results of a constituent survey on roads, which showed residents wanted a comprehensive and bipartisan plan. The continued kicks in the rear from the executive office could also help break the gridlock.
“A majority of Michiganders want safe, reliable roads so they can go to work, drop their kids off at school, and run errands without blowing a tire or cracking an axle,” Whitmer said in a statement. “While people acknowledged the progress we’ve made over the last five years, they also shared hundreds of stories about how much poor road conditions cost them and how much safer they would feel if we kept our foot on the accelerator. We’ve fixed a lot of major roads since I took office, but our work is not over.”
Among several questions, the one geared toward the Legislature’s role in moving a roads plan forward saw 72% of participants say a bipartisan deal was very important to them, while 17% said it was somewhat important and another 3% saying it was not important at all.
Whitmer’s office did not immediately respond to questions from Michigan Advance on the number of residents polled in the governor’s survey and in what areas of the state residents were polled.
In another new poll conducted by Glengariff Group, Michigan residents of all political strips were frustrated that the Legislature failed to pass and complete a negotiated schools budget by the July 1 deadline.
Of the participants in the Glengariff poll, 83% said they support the Legislature’s self-imposed July 1 statutory deadline and 89% said that a budget must be completed now before school starts after Labor Day. Another 74% of participants said voters would choose to have public school funding fleshed out before a roads funding plan, and 89% of participants ranked school funding as their top priority for the Legislature.
While the blame game continues, nearly two-thirds of participants in the Glengariff poll said they would blame everyone – the House, the Senate and the governor – if the crisis veers into a government shutdown.
A total of 600 likely Michigan voters were polled by Glengariff on behalf of The K-12 Alliance of Michigan, with a relatively equal number of Democrats and Republicans but fewer independent voters. The poll had a 4% margin of error with 95% confidence level.
Robert McCann, the alliance’s executive director, said the voters’ message to the Legislature was clear.
“Do your job and pass a school budget immediately that puts every single dollar where it belongs – investing in our  K-12 classrooms and kids,” McCann said in a statement. “This stalemate exists because too many in Lansing still view the School Aid Fund as a piggy bank to raid for other projects. Voters could not disagree more. Public school funding must be treated as the top priority inside the Capitol – just as it clearly is for families across Michigan. Anything less ignores the clear will of Michigan voters.”

Jana Hughes)LINCOLN, Nebraska — Donated medicine collected by Iowa’s SafeNetRx nonprofit is finally flowing back across its border with Nebraska in the nation’s first multistate prescription drug donation program, years in the making.
SafeNetRx CEO Jon Rosmann confirmed the Nebraska-Iowa partnership has been operational since July 1. The initial two-year contract between the nonprofit and Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services, at $475,000 per year, follows Nebraska laws passed in 2024 and 2025 that allow unexpired, pharmacist-inspected medicine to flow back to Nebraska patients.
The program serves patients at or below 200% of the federal poverty line. For a family of four, that would be an annual household income up to $64,300.
“It’s all systems go,” Rosmann told the Nebraska Examiner.
Overwhelming legislative approval
Nebraska State Sen. Jana Hughes of Seward began eyeing the partnership with SafeNetRx in late 2023, her freshman year, including an October tour of the nonprofit’s facility. She led legislation that passed in April 2024, 47-0, to authorize the program that September before being blocked by a decade-old federal law.

Those congressional guidelines were meant to replace a patchwork of state laws regarding the chain of custody of pharmaceutical meds and were phased in over a decade. It was unclear what the guidelines meant for drug donation programs.
Hughes had earned overwhelming legislative approval this March, 46-0, to get the partnership around that final roadblock while also adding language that Nebraska DHHS and the Nebraska governor could access the donated medicine during or in preparation for a governor-declared state of emergency, such as during a pandemic or natural disaster.
Before, medicine could flow only from the Cornhusker State to the Hawkeye State, but now the floodgates have opened the other direction.
Upon learning of the signed contract, Hughes told the Examiner:  “Super pumped to hear this!!!!”
‘A long time coming’
While federal regulations initially blocked the partnership, Gov. Jim Pillen’s mid-March signature cleared the way for the program to begin as soon as March 12.

Yet the partnership waited in the wings partly because Pillen had already asked lawmakers to defund the program two months prior — one of many “last in, first out” cuts his administration proposed to close a major projected deficit. The budget-writing Appropriations Committee initially agreed.
Lawmakers also accepted a recommendation from the governor’s team to reword the authorizing language around the spending.
Rather than requiring DHHS to identify a nonprofit to carry out what would effectively be a defunded program at the time, the committee forbade DHHS from absorbing the cost of the program through other state dollars.
Despite every member of the Appropriations Committee having voted for Hughes’ program, some more than once, some said they still had questions on the funding and how the program would work.
Those changes left Hughes “incredibly disappointed” but determined to fight for the program.

Hughes worked to correct some of that “misinformation,” including one that Iowa wasn’t putting in any state dollars to SafeNetRx while it had just put in $600,000 in its most recent budget. The committee voted 6-1 to restore funding but left DHHS the flexibility to choose whether to start or maintain the program.
State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha cast the lone “no” vote as an effort to push the committee to restore the original language around the spending, which the committee ultimately adopted with her support.
Rosmann said at the time that for every dollar SafeNetRx received, patients and clinics received $20 in donated medicine.
“I feel like this is a long time coming!!!” Hughes said in a text. “Very excited to get this up and going.”
A commitment to safety
SafeNetRx pioneered the prescription drug donation model in 2007 and had grown to receive medicine from pharmacists and patients nationwide.
Since its inception, SafeNetRx has received donated medicine or medical supplies from 250 health care facilities nationwide, worth $155 million. This has helped more than 160,000 underserved patients receive free medication, according to SafeNetRx.
Until now, medicine could not be sent to patients beyond Iowa’s borders, and Nebraska is the first state SafeNetRx is partnering with.

SafeNetRx is already working with four Nebraska sites, Rosmann said, and when the program was delayed for a year from getting started — facing federal but also Nebraska funding roadblocks — Rosmann said SafeNetRx instead took that time to ramp up donations
Between July 1, 2024, and June 30, 2025, Rosmann said his nonprofit gathered $28 million in donated medicine.
“All of that is available to Nebraskans now,” Rosmann said.
Before medicine is ready for redistribution, a licensed Iowa pharmacist inspects each donated drug, ensuring it is labeled correctly and usable — meaning not expired, not tampered with, not requiring refrigeration and not a controlled substance.
Rosmann said those patient safety and medication integrity standards help separate SafeNetRx from other similar organizations or nonprofits.
Nebraska pharmacists are able to access SafeNetRx inventory in real time to order meds for patients. Medicine is returned via courier, such as the United Parcel Service or Spee-Dee Delivery Service.
‘It’s time to get cracking’
Rosmann said the focus now is on education and enrollment, a task SafeNetRx is subcontracting with the Nebraska Pharmacists Association to fulfill, including recruiting participating clinics and pharmacies.
There also is an emphasis on “safety net” providers, Rosmann said — federally qualified health centers, free clinics and community mental health centers — “those organizations that are on the front line of taking care of our most vulnerable patients.”

(Photo by Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent)Missouri will need a new attorney general for the third time in six years as Andrew Bailey announced on Monday that he plans to step down to become co-deputy director of the FBI.
“My life has been defined by a call to service, and I am once again answering that call, this time at the national level,” Bailey said in a news release announcing his departure. “But wherever I am called, Missouri is and always will be home.”
Bailey was appointed attorney general in 2022 after Eric Schmitt was elected to the U.S. Senate. Schmitt got the job in 2018, replacing another Republican who won a Senate seat, Josh Hawley.
Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe will name his replacement at 10 a.m. Tuesday. The new attorney general will then serve until Bailey’s current term expires in 2028. Bailey said his last day in office will be Sept. 8.
Bailey had never run for public office before former Missouri Gov. Mike Parson tapped him to replace Schmitt in 2022. At the time, he was serving as Parson’s general counsel. He previously worked as an assistant prosecuting attorney in Warren County and as an assistant attorney general.
Weeks after being elected to full four-year term last year, Bailey was vying to be President Donald Trump’s new attorney general or FBI director. He will now join the FBI as it faces a torrent of criticism from across the political spectrum over the Trump administration’s refusal to release government files on the late sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein.
His short stint as Missouri’s attorney general was largely defined by confrontation — lawsuits against the federal government, investigations of health care providers and public fights with other statewide elected Republicans.
Bailey’s most high-profile cases since becoming attorney general included twice suing to block federal student loan forgiveness and carrying forward an unsuccessful lawsuit alleging the Biden administration was colluding with social media companies to censor conservative speech.
His office is also involved in four different lawsuits regarding medical records of transgender children — part of his effort to end gender-affirming care in Missouri.
The attorney general’s office under Bailey helped force St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner out of office and is pursuing felony charges against St. Louis County Executive Sam Page.
Bailey has also been unflinchingly loyal to Trump, including publicly endorsing the lie that the 2020 presidential election was stolen and unsuccessfully attempting to intervene in the criminal case against him in New York that resulted in 34 felony convictions.
But Bailey’s tenure as attorney general has also been marked by accusations of corruption, incompetence and grandstanding, with his critics alleging he’s more interested in scoring appearances on Fox News than effectively running the sprawling office or winning in the courtroom.
Among the many lawsuits Bailey inherited from his predecessor was a case against Missouri school districts that implemented mask mandates during the COVID-19 pandemic. After a judge ruled in support of the school boards, Bailey’s office missed its deadline to appeal.
Last summer, he narrowly avoided being questioned under oath about his contact with a defendant in his own case against Jackson County. One of Bailey’s deputies lost his license because of the meetings, according to a filing from the county’s attorneys.
Bailey was also the focus of a formal complaint about the behavior of his office after he falsely blamed the Hazelwood School District’s diversity, equity and inclusion program for the off-campus assault of a student.
He’s also faced criticism over his contributions to his campaign.
Bailey recused himself from a gambling lawsuit filed against the Missouri State Highway Patrol after PACs connected to the lobbyist of the companies suing the state wrote checks to the committee supporting his campaign.
He raised eyebrows after accepting $50,000 in campaign donations from Doe Run, a St. Louis-based company being sued by thousands of Peruvians over allegations of lead smelter poisoning in their mining town in the Andes. A few months before the donation, Bailey filed a brief asking the federal court to move the lawsuit out of Missouri.

(Photo courtesy Carson National Forest)A wildfire in Northern New Mexico near the Colorado border is almost completely contained, and the officials in charge of the fire reported this week that all oil and gas wells in the roughly 5,000-acre wildfire perimeter have been turned back on. 
The Middle Mesa Fire, which lightning ignited Aug. 1, burned through an area of the Carson National Forest, coming within a mile of the Colorado border. By Aug. 8, the blaze threatened 45 oil wells, according to internal incident reports, including 34 with associated infrastructure. 
Crews turned all of them off while firefighters fought the blaze and none were destroyed, according to Earl Hidayetoglu, a spokesperson for Carson National Forest. “
“Those were switched back on last week,” Hidayetoglu told Source on Monday regarding the wells. “And no infrastructure was damaged.”
The blaze is now 92% contained. As a result, a lower-capacity management team took control of the fire, with members undertaking repair and soil stabilization work, according to the latest update. 
Another team will soon do burned-area analysis, as well, to analyze areas of high flood and erosion risk due to high wildfire intensity, according to the latest update. 
A peak of more than 470 personnel from across the country was assigned to the blaze on Aug. 11. According to official estimates from the National Interagency Fire Center, fighting the fire is expected to cost taxpayers at least $10.5 million.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/775774216-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-08-19 12:58:56.139882

Wingate granted a preliminary injunction in the case on Monday, which prevents the law from being enforced until there’s a final ruling.","The state law that bans diversity, equity and inclusion programs in Mississippi public schools and universities has been blocked for the foreseeable future. 
U.S. District Judge Henry T. Wingate granted a preliminary injunction in the case on Monday, which prevents the law from being enforced until there’s a final ruling. Wingate previously granted a temporary restraining order in late June, which expired Monday.
“(The law), if it lives down to the fears it has generated, has a mouthful of sharp teeth which could inflict deep bites,” Wingate wrote in his order.
Joshua Tom, legal director at the American Civil Liberties Union of Mississippi and one of the lawyers in the case, said in a statement that he was “pleased” with Wingate’s ruling.
“The State’s attempt to impose its preferred views — and ban opposing views — on Mississippi’s public education system is not only bad policy, it’s illegal, as the court has preliminarily found today,” he said. 
Lawyers for the plaintiffs, including professors, parents and students, and lawyers from the state attorney general’s office met in court in early August to make their cases for and against the preliminary injunction. 
The plaintiffs’ attorneys argued that House Bill 1193 violates the First and Fourteenth amendments to the U.S. Constitution by prohibiting discussions about race, sex, gender identity and sexual orientation in classrooms, and that the law was dangerously vague, potentially opening the gates to a flood of complaints against educators and students. 
They said the law would ban discussions and books about the Civil War, women’s rights and slavery, and other topics that are essential to understanding the country’s history. 
Witnesses called to the stand testified that the law was having a “chilling” effect, just weeks before classes were set to start at colleges across the state. Professors from the University of Mississippi said the policy was preventing them from finalizing their syllabi. 
A Jackson Public Schools parent said the law made her scared for her children, worried that if they shared too much about their home life, they would be punished in some way — the process for “curing” violations was unclear to witnesses.
Attorneys from the state attorney general’s office, whose argument centered around the plaintiffs’ “overwrought” reading of the statute and public employees’ lack of First Amendment rights, did not present enough evidence to counteract the plaintiffs’ claims, Wingate said. He wrote in his order that the witnesses’ testimonies were enough to justify a preliminary injunction.
“It is an enormous relief that the court has sided with academic freedom, free speech, and due process in its recent decision,” said Deanna Kreisel in a statement. Kreisel is an associate English professor at the University of Mississippi and a member of the United Campus Workers, one of the plaintiffs in this case. 
“The fight is not over, but at least for the time being, the students of Mississippi can continue to learn in an environment free of ideological constraints and partisan censorship,” Kreisel said.
Wingate’s ruling preventing state officials from enforcing the law will be in effect until the overall litigation is concluded. Attorneys for the plaintiffs and the state defendants will now move to discovery, where they collect evidence before a bench trial. 
After Wingate conducts the trial, he will issue a final ruling. An aggrieved party can appeal Wingate’s ruling to the conservative U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals.

Attorney General Pam Bondi sent letters last week telling sanctuary states, cities and counties that “you better be abiding by our federal policies and with our federal law enforcement, because if you aren’t, we’re going to come after you,” she said in a Fox News interview. She demanded the areas answer her by Tuesday.
Cities and states with so-called sanctuary policies generally refuse to assist with immigration raids or accede to requests for local jails to hold prisoners for deportation. Those that responded to Stateline’s questions about the letters said they were not inclined to change their positions about cooperation with immigration authorities.
“It’s the tactic of a bully. And the only way to deal with a bully is to let them know that they’re not going to intimidate you,” Rhode Island Democratic Attorney General Peter Neronha said in a statement.
The Trump administration is attempting to force more cooperation with immigration arrests. But it suffered a serious court reversal on July 25, when a federal judge dismissed a sanctuary policies case against Illinois, Chicago and Cook County.
The state and local policies reflect a “decision to not participate in enforcing civil immigration law — a decision protected by the Tenth Amendment,” Judge Lindsay Jenkins wrote in an order now under appeal.
Bondi’s letters follow the Justice Department’s Aug. 5 release of a list of sanctuary jurisdictions including 12 states, the District of Columbia, four counties and 18 cities. That’s fewer jurisdictions than the 14 states and almost 500 counties and cities that appeared on an earlier list, which the agency withdrew after criticism that it included conservative counties that were fully cooperating with immigration enforcement.
The states on the new list are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington state. The list also includes some counties and cities in those states as well as in Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New Mexico.
Other federal courts have issued injunctions to at least temporarily stop Trump administration from withholding unrelated federal funding from governments that don’t cooperate on immigration. Cities, counties and states have filed lawsuits challenging Trump’s executive orders targeting sanctuary policies, including a February order that federal payments to states and localities must not “by design or effect, facilitate the subsidization or promotion of illegal immigration, or abet so-called ‘sanctuary’ policies that seek to shield illegal aliens from deportation.”
“The executive orders are directing agencies to basically take a maximalist approach to putting pressure on local governments to cooperate with immigration [enforcement], even though they’re not required to do so by federal law,” said Jonathan Miller, one of the attorneys working on the California case for the Public Rights Project, a California-based group promoting civil rights protections for states and cities.
One city on the administration’s list was Rochester, New York, which disciplined some police officers for helping federal agents make a March arrest in the city. The city already faces a lawsuit brought by the Trump administration that prominently mentions the arrest of three men from Guatemala; one of whom has since pleaded guilty to re-entering the United States after a previous deportation.
A spokesperson for the city, Barbara Pierce, said in a statement to The Guardian that, “Nothing in Attorney General Bondi’s letter is new and none of it has legal merit.”
“The letter reiterates many of the frivolous arguments that the federal government has already made in its pending suit against the city of Rochester,” she added. “These same arguments were levied against the city of Chicago and were dismissed by the federal district court for the eastern district of Illinois nearly a month ago.”
Ally Sullivan, a spokesperson for Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis, said in a statement that Colorado “is not a sanctuary state. The Governor continues to be frustrated by this mistaken and incorrect label.” In a televised interview earlier this year, Polis pointed out that Colorado fully cooperates with federal authorities on criminal matters. Immigration, he said, is a civil matter.
“In Colorado, we are improving public safety, apprehending dangerous criminals, cooperating with federal law enforcement on criminal investigations, and keeping our communities safe,” Sullivan said.
Nevertheless, Colorado faces a federal lawsuit brought by the administration over its alleged sanctuary policies. Polis signed a measure in May that limits local law enforcement’s communication with federal immigration authorities and restricts where federal authorities can operate within schools, child care facilities, hospitals and libraries without a judicial warrant.
Connecticut Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont in a statement said the state’s Trust Act, which the Trump administration has targeted as a sanctuary policy, was passed with bipartisan support and helps ensure local police concentrate on serious crimes. The Trust Act, passed in 2013 and expanded in 2019, limits information sharing and compliance with requests to detain immigrants for federal immigration authorities.
“Nothing about this makes Connecticut a sanctuary in any legal or practical sense — it makes our state one that upholds the Constitution, respects the rule of law, and prioritizes the safety and well-being of our communities,” Lamont said.

The attorneys general and governors of 19 states are suing federal energy officials over a new policy meant to cut funding for staff who work on sustainable energy and energy efficiency projects across the country.
The states filed their  lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Energy and its leader, Chris Wright, on Friday in U.S. District Court in Eugene, Oregon. States argue that a new rule mandating that “indirect” and “fringe” costs for State Energy Program projects — such as staff salaries, health insurance and pensions — cannot exceed 10% of overall project costs is arbitrary, against the law, and will lead to needless job losses and project terminations. Officials from the U.S. Department of Energy did not respond to a request for comment by Monday evening.
The federal grants help state energy agencies pay for the design, development and execution of renewable energy projects and energy efficiency programs. The grants fund electric vehicles for state and local governments and public transit, state-sponsored home weatherization programs, energy affordability programs for low-income residents, emergency preparedness and state energy planning.
Last year, Oregon received about $786,000 in federal grants through the program, according to Oregon Democratic Attorney General Dan Rayfield’s office. Most of the money paid for on-the-ground project costs, but nearly half — about $333,000 — went to indirect and fringe costs, such as project staff salaries, as well as health and retirement benefits.
“Oregonians count on these programs to keep our homes energy-efficient, our air clean and our bills manageable,” Rayfield said in a statement. “This cap strips away the resources we need to keep that work going — and the people and expertise behind it. We can’t meet Oregon’s energy needs if the federal government pulls critical infrastructure that supports the people and expertise behind this work midstream.”
Other federal agencies have recently attempted to impose similar overhead caps on federally funded projects at colleges that receive grants from the National Institute of Health, National Science Foundation and Department of Defense. All were blocked in court.
Rayfield is joined in the latest suit by the attorneys general of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Washington, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia, as well as Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, all Democrats.
No more negotiation
Typically, states negotiate with the U.S. Department of Energy to land on a percentage of project costs that can be spent on staff and benefits. The minimum is 15% and the maximum in some states, depending on the year and the project, can be as high as 45%.
The Colorado Energy Office last year negotiated with the federal energy department a deal that allows indirect costs to be no more than 43.6% of the project budget. In April, the office submitted its annual application for State Energy Program grants, but in May, learned that Wright and other agency officials had decided to cap overhead costs on projects.
By July, state energy officials in Colorado and several other states learned their applications had been rejected and were told to submit revised budgets with a 10% cap on indirect and fringe costs.
Colorado’s energy agency stands to lose about $367,000 in expected funding if the 10% cap on indirect and fringe funding isn’t lifted, which would lead to staffing cuts across several teams, according to the lawsuit.
Minnesota stands to lose about $290,000 in the next year if the cap is not lifted.
“To cover this shortfall, Minnesota will need to reduce staff paid by these funds and use available funds from other programs more quickly than otherwise planned, leading to budget constraints that will impact the state’s ability to meet its statutory energy efficiency and renewable energy objectives,” the suit reads.
Kentucky stands to lose $230,000 per year, according to the lawsuit. That’s money the state sends to electric cooperatives and to non-profits helping Kentuckians improve home and business energy efficiency and affordability. The state also sends State Energy Program funds to universities that provide technical assistance and expertise for sustainable energy projects and initiatives, such as community microgrids and nuclear energy development.
“This will impair the Commonwealth’s ability to support essential employees’ direct costs and may result in increasing costs should the state move to alternative employment arrangements,” the suit reads.

Mike Kehoe announced Tuesday that Catherine Hanaway will replace Andrew Bailey as the state’s next attorney general.
Bailey, 44, resigned Monday after a little more than two years on the job to become co-deputy director of the FBI. 
Hanaway, 61, will be the fourth person to serve as Missouri attorney general since 2018, with her three predecessors leaving the job early for positions in Washington, D.C.  She will be the first woman to ever hold the job. 
She can serve out Bailey’s term, which runs until the end of 2028, and on Tuesday told reporters she plans to seek a full term of her own in three years.
“My game plan, for sure, is to serve the next three years,” she said, “and then if Missourians will vote for me and believe I earned a full term, then I’d like to serve a full term.”
Andrew Bailey stepping down as Missouri attorney general for job in Trump administration

A former federal prosecutor, Hanaway was the first and only woman to ever serve as speaker of the Missouri House of Representatives. She twice ran unsuccessfully for statewide office, losing to Democrat Robin Carnahan for secretary of state in 2004 and finishing fourth in the Republican primary for governor in 2016. 
After she left public life, Hanaway focused on her law practice and eventually became a partner at the Husch Blackwell. In 2018, she garnered headlines after joining the legal team representing the campaign committee of the man who beat her in the ugly 2016 GOP primary, Eric Greitens.  
Her highest profile client in recent years has been Grain Belt Express, a planned transmission line designed to transport electricity generated by wind farms in Kansas across four states, including Missouri.
In the works for more than a decade, the transmission line has drawn fierce criticism from GOP officials and agriculture groups like the Missouri Farm Bureau over the company’s use of eminent domain to take land or easements from unwilling landowners and compensate them.  
Those critics include Bailey, who has used the attorney general’s office to target the project. 
Grain Belt Express filed a lawsuit against the attorney general’s office last month over a demand to hand over documents, and Hanaway is the company’s lead counsel. 
“Grain Belt Express seeks to bring an end to the (attorney general’s) unlawful and politically motivated investigation,” Hanaway said in a statement last month. 
Hanaway said Tuesday that the attorney general’s investigation into Grain Belt will continue and she will recuse herself.
“The team that is there, the great team that is there, will be able to go forward without my input,” she said. “There’s a great team on it, and they’ll continue to do their work.”
Speaking to reporters after Kehoe announced her appointment, Hanaway emphasized her rural roots, noting that the dorm she moved into when she attended the University of Missouri was bigger than her hometown in Nebraska.
“I’m humbled beyond belief to accept this appointment,” she said.
She ticked through what she sees as the role of the attorney general’s office, saying the most important job is “to protect Missourians from anyone who would do violence against them, who would rip them off in financial schemes, who would abuse them by providing terrible care and getting paid by Medicaid and anyone who would try to invade their constitutional rights.”
Fighting crime, she said, will “remain job one,” noting her previous work as a U.S. attorney.
She quoted the late Kit Bond, Missouri’s former governor and U.S. Senator, who she says taught her that “people don’t care how much you know until they know how much you care.”
“I promise to you that as attorney general, I will work as hard as I can,” she said. “I will be innovative. I will adapt to changing times. But more than anything else, I’ll show Missourians just how much I care.”

Gabe Vasquez, center, gathered leaders of health, housing and food nonprofits to discuss how recently enacted federal cuts will affect New Mexicans, along with how the spending bill will increase prices on health insurance, housing, energy costs and nutrition. (Photo by Patrick Lohmann / Source NM)Cuts to the country’s food assistance programs in the recently enacted Congressional spending bill will leave food banks and other charities across the state with less food to feed longer lines of hungry people, leaders warned Monday at a roundtable with U.S. Rep Gabe Vasquez. 
The federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which gives low-income families money to spend on groceries, currently provides nine times as many meals across the state and country as the entire nationwide network of food charities, Jason Riggs, community initiatives manager at the Roadrunner Food Bank, told Vasquez and other nonprofit leaders at the roundtable.
In New Mexico, more than 500 shelters, pantries, schools and hot-meal sites comprise the state’s “food bank,” he said, and that whole network provides only a fraction of what SNAP delivers for families.
“There’s no way we can just suddenly multiply everything we do times nine to make that happen. We couldn’t do that in 10 years,” Riggs said. “No business can grow nine times. So any thoughts that, ‘Well, charity will take care of this,’ are very misguided.”
New Mexico officials say federal cuts will probably deepen hunger for children, seniors

Vasquez, a New Mexico Democrat who represents the state’s 2nd Congressional District in the southern portion of the state, gathered leaders of various nonprofits handling housing, healthcare and nutrition at the food bank’s headquarters to elicit testimony about how the cuts will affect New Mexicans, along with how the spending bill will increase prices on health insurance, housing, energy costs and nutrition. 
Regarding SNAP, Vasquez told Source New Mexico that the upcoming Farm Bill presents Democrats with an opportunity to undo some, but not all, of what the “Big, Beautiful Bill” will do. The Farm Bill sets SNAP funding levels and other food-related policies.
“Republicans are going to propose a skinny Farm Bill, which is a watered-down version of the Farm Bill. They’re going to want to have some bipartisan support for that, and we’re not going to give it to them unless we get some concessions back on the priorities that we have,” he said.

While he doesn’t think Democrats have enough leverage to make Republicans completely reverse their SNAP cuts or other policies they just enacted in the spending bill, he said one concession he’ll push for relates to states like New Mexico that are deemed to have high SNAP “error rates.” 
The bill currently penalizes states that are found to over- or under-pay SNAP recipients at high rates by making them share a portion of the costs the federal government currently pays to SNAP recipients. In New Mexico, the federal government currently shoulders 100% of the more than $1 billion in annual spending to SNAP recipients. 
But under the bill, New Mexico will have to share 15% of the total SNAP spending New Mexicans receive because of its high error rate. New Mexico’s rate is 14.6%; the national average is 9.83%. 
Vasquez said he hopes to push Republicans to change both the way the error rate penalty is calculated and give states longer grace periods to bring their rates down to avoid the penalty. 
“I think those are common-sense proposals that Republicans should accept, but I don’t expect to reverse a lot of that stuff, considering what it represents to the President’s overall agenda,” he said, which is “to cut Medicaid and to cut SNAP and to give taxes to the rich. Otherwise you won’t be able to pay for those tax cuts.”
States with rates above 10% incur the 15% fee, the highest penalty, which amounts to about $173 million, according to a presentation Monday from the Legislative Finance Committee to an interim legislative committee. 
NM lawmakers presented with tough choices amid federal cuts to Medicaid, SNAP 

Even though New Mexico faces a big error rate penalty, LFC analyst Austin Davidson also noted Monday that a provision in the bill allows states with high rates to wait longer before paying the penalty. Assuming the state’s rate stays high, New Mexico won’t pay the penalty until October 2028 at the earliest, Davidson said. 
Nonprofit leaders at the roundtable later Monday said that the state’s error rate often comes from systemic problems at the state level, not fraud at the individual level, and mistakes are often quickly caught and corrected. 
According to a presentation from state Health Care Authority officials to the same legislative committee, analysts attribute 35% of the state’s error rate to “agency-caused” miscalculations of benefits or use of outdated information. 
To bring down the rate in New Mexico, Health Care Authority officials recommended increasing caseworker training at the authority’s Income Support Division, along with improving information technology system changes to ensure quality control. 
The error rate cost is among hundreds of millions of dollars the state is anticipating losing in SNAP funding in the state with the highest rate of SNAP recipients.  
More than 450,000 New Mexicans use SNAP assistance, which is more than one-fifth of the population. All of them could see reductions in the amount of assistance, according to the Health Care Authority presentation. In addition, about 40,000 New Mexicans will likely lose their SNAP benefits completely due to new work requirements or their immigration status.
As for retailers, about 1,700 gas stations, groceries, convenience stores and farmers’ markets statewide stand to lose about $1.3 billion in SNAP revenue. 
Ari Herring, executive director of Rio Grande Food Bank, warned at the roundtable that all the cuts and costs facing the state will coalesce into a much bleaker food system for New Mexicans. 
“We’re gonna see much, much longer lines. We’re gonna see people highly stressed about affordability, and we are gonna have less resources to answer that need,” she said. “It really is a perfect storm.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_0575-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-19 11:57:08.697250

Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee is dispatching National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., this week to join the president’s law enforcement takeover in the nation’s capital.
Acting on orders from President Donald Trump, the governor granted a request to help the District of Columbia National Guard with a “security mission,” spokesperson Elizabeth Johnson said.
Tennessee will join several other Republican-controlled states and send 160 Guard troops this week to D.C. “to assist as long as needed,” according to Johnson. They will work with local and federal law enforcement agencies on monument security, community safety patrols, federal facilities protection and traffic control, she said.
The Tennessee Guard deployment will be funded and regulated by the federal government.
At least four other Republican governors are sending nearly 1,000 National Guard troops to D.C. after Trump activated 800 D.C. soldiers.
Trump ordered the federal takeover of Washington, D.C., law enforcement despite opposition from local officials who said crime is down some 30%. 
Following a legal challenge by D.C. officials, the Trump administration backed off appointing a federal official to head the department and agreed to leave the city’s police chief in command. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, though, told local police to work with federal officers on immigration enforcement even if city laws are conflicting.
Lee also said he would deploy National Guard troops to provide logistical help with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers in Tennessee so they can spend more time on deportation.
Democratic state Rep. John Ray Clemmons of Nashville accused the governor of “uprooting” Guard personnel from their families to distract people from Trump’s “refusal to release the Epstein files,” a reference to the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking investigation and whether Trump is mentioned in the documents. 
Clemmons pointed out violent crime in D.C. decreased by 26% this year while overall crime is down by 7%.
“If Trump was serious about addressing crime in D.C., all he and Congress have to do is better support and fund D.C. police, as they have the power to do, rather than militarize one of the most beautiful cities in America,” Clemmons said.

(Photo by Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor) Attorneys for the state of North Dakota have asked a judge to dismiss a lawsuit that accuses the North Dakota Beef Commission of unlawfully favoring big cattle associations.
The lawsuit, filed in July, says the commission’s appointment process is unconstitutional and must be changed.  
In a court filing this month, the state denied those accusations and countered that the plaintiffs — a group of independent ranchers — haven’t made a clear case for why they think the commission is breaking the law.
Attorneys for North Dakota also said that the ranchers can’t bring the lawsuit because their window of time to do so has already expired. North Dakota law says that generally, legal action against the state must be taken within three years after an alleged harm occurs.
The lawsuit claims that Gov. Kelly Armstrong and private associations wield too much power over who serves on the North Dakota Beef Commission’s board.
Under North Dakota’s Beef Commission Act, which dates back to 2009, members of the commission’s board are mostly nominated by private organizations and then selected by the governor, according to the plaintiffs’ complaint. Anyone can submit nominations for a select few seats, though the group of cattle producers bringing the lawsuit say the governor only picks members and affiliates of the Stockmen’s Association for these positions.
The plaintiffs allege that independent ranchers like themselves get no representation on the board.
They want a state district court judge to rule the Beef Commission Act unconstitutional and to strike it down. The plaintiffs also offer that, as an alternative, the court could bar the governor from selecting future commission members solely from a candidate pool picked by private associations.
Ranchers sue to revamp North Dakota Beef Commission appointment process

The main job of the Beef Commission is to decide how to use the state’s checkoff money. Checkoffs are funds the state raises through a small fee ranchers pay on cattle sales that is used to market the cattle industry. The money is used to help the industry by promoting beef consumption, as well as supporting research and education.
For each head of cattle sold, beef producers pay $1 to the state and $1 to the federal government in checkoffs. The Beef Commission pulled in about $1.67 million in revenue from checkoffs last year, according to its 2024 annual report.
In order to serve on the Beef Commission, the Beef Commission Act says beef producers cannot have requested refunds on their state checkoffs within the last three years. The plaintiffs in their complaint say this eligibility requirement is unlawfully discriminatory, and ask for the courts to suspend it. 
A representative of the Beef Commission last month said the agency does not comment on pending litigation.
The plaintiffs include the Ranchers Rights Initiative and three of its directors: Kenneth Graner, Jeremy Maher and Michael Heaton. The Ranchers Rights Initiative describes itself as a group for independent North Dakota ranchers who don’t belong to any of the leading professional associations for cattle producers.
The case has been assigned to South Central Judicial District Judge Jackson Lofgren.
The North Dakota state Legislature earlier this year considered legislation to have board members elected rather than appointed, though the bill died in the House.
The Beef Commission opposed the legislation. In testimony submitted on the bill, the commission said the appointment process supports a fair and impartial board. They also claimed that changing the current process would be expensive and could leave the commission vulnerable to political polarization.

The district also had problems with cash handling procedures and hadn’t created policies on retaining electronic records, the Aug. 18 audit report said.
But overall, the audit “has found the district to be well managed with only minor issues that need to be addressed,” the auditor’s office wrote in a news release.
The audit rated Independence schools “good” in the areas audited, the second-highest rating out of four options.
“I believe it’s extremely important that we give taxpayers and parents a better understanding of how effective and efficient their public schools are with the tax dollars they are given,” Missouri Auditor Scott Fitzpatrick said in the news release. “I think they can be confident the Independence School District is operationally sound and well run.”
Interim Superintendent Cindy Grant said she was “ecstatic about the outcome” and “very proud to be only the third district in the past decade to earn a rating of ‘good’ on the state audit.”
She noted Independence had only three concerns listed, fewer than the two other districts that earned a “good” rating, and said the results reflect well on district staff, who have “done an outstanding job.”
“We’re committed to being responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars,” she said. “We appreciate the thorough examination of our processes and district spending.”
But in the release, Fitzpatrick criticized the district for spending money on a November 2024 lawsuit attempting to overturn a requirement for a public vote on the four-day school week. The district argues that there is no rational basis for the law to apply to only certain districts.
“This decision has massive implications for families who rely on the district to provide an education for their children,” he wrote. “Attempting to deny them an opportunity to have their voices heard at the ballot box is a concerning decision.”
Grant said the four-day school week has helped improve the district’s teacher retention rate as well as the average years of experience that teachers hold.
“We’re going to focus on doing what’s right for kids and our families and appreciating the support our community gives us,” she said.
Fitzpatrick said when he launched the audit that it wasn’t prompted by specific concerns but rather is part of his mission to audit more school districts, even if they aren’t accused of wrongdoing. He selected Independence in part because it’s a large district that switched to a four-day school week.
The audit includes the district’s responses to the noted issues, which promise to resolve the problems and note that some solutions are already in progress.
“This time of year, the start of the school year, it’s just making sure everyone knows the processes and procedures and the expectations,” Grant said.
Grant currently leads the district while the board begins a search for its next superintendent.
 What the audit found

The audit’s findings are divided into three sections. Areas in which there are no recommendations for improvements are not included in a state audit.
 Cash handling

Auditors reviewed six schools and found that staff members didn’t always follow district policies.
For example, money collected from things such as activity fees and event admissions should be deposited quickly with the proper paperwork and procedures. Not doing so “increases the risk of loss, theft, or misuse of funds,” the audit report said. That didn’t always happen.
The audit also found small discrepancies in the $200 change fund that each school is supposed to maintain.
In the report, the district said it has implemented a new system called MySchoolBucks and strengthened its procedures for handling cash.
 Sunshine Law violations in board meetings

Under the state’s open meeting law, known as the Missouri Sunshine Law, school boards are supposed to hold most of their conversations in public. The only exceptions are specific topics such as legal or personnel issues that need to remain private.
Meeting minutes show closed meeting topics that should have been discussed in public, the audit report said.
In one meeting, the board discussed the four-day school week, watched a presentation that included data from a survey and discussed doing more surveys. In other meetings, the board discussed putting the operational tax levy on the ballot and talked about course credits and class rank for transfer students.
The audit doesn’t note exactly when those meetings happened, but says the board held 27 closed meetings from July 1, 2022, through June 30, 2024.
“Discussion of unallowable topics in closed meetings reduces public transparency,” the audit report says. “The Superintendent indicated the Board discussed these topics before realizing the Sunshine Law did not allow these discussions in closed meetings.”
Board and community members had previously raised concerns that the board wasn’t using closed sessions appropriately and needed more guidance.
A Beacon analysis from late 2022 found that board members had always voted unanimously in public sessions for at least 10 years until June 2022, when board member Anthony Mondaine broke that trend. That raised concerns that members were either rubber-stamping proposals or holding substantive discussions behind the scenes.
In February 2023, Mondaine suggested that the board should have an attorney present during all of its closed session meetings. During public comment at that meeting, former Independence City Councilmember Marcie Gragg said it could help the board avoid having conversations that should have been in open session.
“There have been at least a couple of cases where citizens were directed to address this board in closed session when their issues did not meet the legal requirements,” she said. “Legal counsel could have advised this board that this was not appropriate.”
During public comment at the same meeting, parent Wendy Baird described a time she had been directed to a closed session meeting to share her concerns with virtual schooling in the district, a topic she didn’t believe should have been handled in closed session.
“If our board leadership cannot distinguish between what is appropriate for closed or open session under Missouri state law, then yes, you do need legal guidance,” she said. Baird was later elected to the school board.
In the audit report, the school district pledged to review closed session agenda items more closely and steer unplanned conversations away from items that should be public.
 Electronic records

The final item noted in the audit is that the district should have a policy for retaining electronic records, including text messages and emails.
The law “​​provides that all records made or received by an official in the course of his/her public duties are public property and are not to be disposed of except as provided by law,” the audit says.
In the report, the district committed to working with legal counsel to develop the proper procedures.
 Why the Independence School District audit happened

School districts routinely do financial audits. An audit from the state is different. It looks beyond finances and may come in response to specific concerns raised by citizens or the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education.
For example, in March the auditor’s office launched an investigation — which could turn into a full audit — after a whistleblower raised concerns about potential inappropriate spending and other problems with money management in the Hickman Mills School District in Kansas City.
During the past year, Fitzpatrick’s office published audits of the Kingston K-14 School District in Washington County, southwest of St. Louis; the Francis Howell R-III School District in St. Charles County; and St. Louis Public Schools.
The Kingston audit came in response to a formal citizen petition. Fitzpatrick used his power to audit districts at his discretion for the other two audits, but he launched both with a sense that there were specific problems or allegations to investigate.
Independence’s audit is unusual in that Fitzpatrick said he wasn’t responding to complaints or requests from the public.
Rather, he wants to use his office to audit more school districts that aren’t suspected of wrongdoing.
For his first foray into that type of audit, Fitzpatrick said he chose Independence to balance out audits on the eastern side of the state, because its four-day school week schedule makes it interesting and because it’s a large district.
Fitzpatrick initially said he wanted to investigate schools teaching about sexuality, gender or “critical race theory” — which has become a catchall term for race- or diversity-related concepts that some parents or politicians may find objectionable.
Those topics aren’t mentioned in the Independence School District audit.
When the audit was announced in spring 2024, then-Superintendent Dale Herl told The Beacon he felt targeted by the state, especially on the heels of the new state law that would require Independence to seek voter approval for the four-day week schedule.
The law, focused on districts in charter counties and larger cities, came shortly after Independence had adopted the schedule. Rural districts have been using the four-day week schedule for more than a decade.

Heather’s daughter had been scheduled for a consultation about puberty-blocking medication at the Yale Gender Program this month — until Yale New Haven Health announced a decision in late July to end medication-based gender affirming care for patients under 19.
[Yale New Haven Health to cut youth gender-affirming care services]
The decision, which came a day after Connecticut Children’s Hospital closed down its gender-affirming program altogether, left Heather’s family scrambling for another option, bumping into long waitlists at other local clinics providing gender-affirming care.
Heather eventually found a physician who could see her 11-year-old daughter in September at Boston Medical Center. On top of traveling there for all in-person appointments, they’ll have to cross state lines into Massachusetts for any telehealth visits.
That’s their plan for now. A plan Heather hopes will remain in place amid a national wave of backlash against transgender rights. A plan that doesn’t feel 100 percent reliable amid the family’s growing sense that states like Connecticut and cities like New Haven, while pitched by politicians as “safe harbors” are ​far from immune to the ramifications of that backlash. 
“Just like what transpired in Connecticut, there’s a risk that can also happen in Boston too,” said Heather.
Heather asked for her last name and her daughter’s name not to be included in this story to protect the family’s privacy.
Heather’s family is not alone. According to Trans Haven organizer Kirill Staklo, he and fellow organizers have heard from numerous transgender youth and families impacted by Yale New Haven Health (YNHH)’s decision. Some families are turning to other programs within Connecticut, Staklo said, while others — like Heather’s family — are searching for gender-affirming care out of state. 
Alyssa-Marie Cajigas, an organizer with the New Haven Pride Center and the Children of Marsha P. Johnson, said that she and her colleagues have been helping trans youth navigate the fallout of YNHH and Connecticut Children’s policy change. She said that she and other organizers are working to find other local sources of gender-affirming health care for youth in the New Haven area.
Staklo argued that YNHH could have held out for longer. ​“It’s absolutely shameful,” he said, ​“that these institutions, especially an institution like [YNHH] that holds the amount of power and resources that it does, would squander an opportunity to stand up for trans people — instead caving to what amounts to political bullying, and is selling out some of its more vulnerable patients.”
“It sets a massive precedent of health care discrimination,” he added. ​“The rationale behind this is completely unscientific. There’s nothing to do with health care.” 
When asked for comment, hospital spokesperson Mark D’Antonio wrote in a statement, ​“We have been carefully monitoring federal executive orders and administrative actions relating to gender-affirming care for patients under age 19.” 
The decision to stop prescribing gender-affirming medication to youth came ​“after a thorough assessment of the current environment,”​ he wrote.“This decision was not made lightly. We are aware of the profound impact that this decision will have on the patients treated in this program, as well as their families.”
D’Antonio wrote that the hospital is ​“committed to offering transitional support” for patients losing access to medication, adding that ​“our providers will continue to provide mental health and other health care services to these patients in a compassionate care environment.”
“She likes seeing herself in this way”
According to Heather, her 11-year-old daughter has known for nearly as long as she can remember that she didn’t want to be a boy. (Her daughter did not want to be directly interviewed for this article.)
Heather recalled that her daughter started experiencing sudden, repetitive tics around the age of 3. Heather took her to the doctor to get assessed for Tourette’s Syndrome, but the pediatrician ruled that out, suggesting instead that the tics were a manifestation of anxiety.
Heather recalled her kid being ​“shy, reserved, held back” and ​“very much on edge” before coming out publicly as a girl. 
By the time her daughter was 5, she would erupt into emotion at seemingly ordinary moments, such as bath time. Her tantrums weren’t the typical outbursts of a 5‑year-old. Over time, they escalated into attempts at self-harm. She’d deliberately bang her head against the wall and start pulling out her hair, telling her parents that she hated herself. ​“You know I’m a girl!” she would say.
“My ex-husband and I, we had no experience with trans kids prior to this,” Heather said. ​“We really did not know what we were dealing with at all.”
Heather found a bundle of dresses through her local Buy Nothing Facebook group in her daughter’s size. Her daughter treated them at first like a ​“secret stash” to try on at home. She would offer a quiet invitation — ​“Do you want to see my dresses?” — only to the people she trusted most.
At the age of 6, her daughter started publicly identifying and presenting as a girl. Heather watched her live with a new sense of freedom, a new ability to enjoy her own childhood. ​“After she transitioned, she just became this very confident, outgoing, very kind and joyous and generally happy kid,” Heather said.
Recently, while sitting through her sister’s softball tryouts, the 11-year-old started taking selfies on her mom’s phone, playing around with the filters and showing her mom with pride. 
“It occurred to me, she likes what she sees looking back at her,” Heather said. ​“She likes seeing herself in this way. She’s proud of it. It makes her happy.”
As Heather’s daughter eventually learned more about puberty, she expressed an intense aversion to the prospect of her shoulders broadening, an Adam’s apple emerging, facial hair starting to appear. Her daughter takes voice lessons; she loves to sing soprano, and dreads the idea of her voice dropping to a low register. 
So the family made plans for Heather’s daughter to begin taking a puberty blocker when her body starts to undergo those changes, planning to do so through the Yale Gender Program. 
Puberty blockers can be prescribed as part of the ​“reversible stage” of pediatric gender-affirming care, according to a technical report issued by the American Academy of Pediatrics. The medication delays the onset of puberty without spurring a medical gender transition; it is not a form of feminizing or masculinizing hormone therapy.
In other contexts, puberty blockers are prescribed for purposes unrelated to gender identity. Some kids who begin to undergo early-onset puberty as young as 6 or 7 years old, for example, take the medication until they reach a more developmentally typical age for puberty. 
Without access to puberty-blocking medication, ​“my biggest concern is she’d have to go through a male puberty when she knows in her heart that she’s not a male,” Heather said. ​“Puberty’s already a very intense time, a very formative time in one’s life.” 
If her daughter loses the ability to take her medication as planned, ​“she’s going to be dealing with some very heavy struggles in terms of how she identifies and how she looks,” Heather said. Her daughter would face an ​“internal struggle,” including the potential for serious mental health setbacks, if her body were to change in a way that ​“she is very repulsed by.”
Heather has tried to protect her daughter from the harshest anti-trans rhetoric that makes the news, but her daughter has become aware of the political push to prevent her from having the option of gender-affirming care. 
Shortly before YNHH’s policy change was announced, Heather recalled her daughter anxiously asking if she’d still be able to take puberty blockers. 
“Are you sure?” her daughter had pressed.
The letter
Heather’s daughter, her family, and her doctor planned an August appointment to evaluate her daughter’s readiness for the medication. But in late July, Heather found a letter in the mail from YNHH.
Inside, a letter signed by Clifford W. Bogue, chief of pediatrics of the Yale New Haven Health system, and Beth Heinz, senior vice president of Women’s & Children’s Services for Yale New Haven Health, announced that the Yale Gender Program would ​“eliminate the medication treatment component of the gender-affirming program for patients under age 19.” The health system would help patients form a ​“transition plan.” 
In other words, Heather’s daughter would not be able to obtain puberty-blocking medication through Yale after all.
The announcement was not exactly a surprise. It came one day after Connecticut Children’s Hospital announced it would shut down its gender-affirming care program entirely, during a wave of political backlash against rights for trans people, and especially trans youth. 
Shortly after taking office for his second term, President Donald Trump signed an executive order attempting to defund gender-affirming care for patients under the age of 19, among several anti-trans directives. YNHH’s letter alluded to those executive orders, citing political climate as the reason behind the change.
On top of reckoning with the policy change, the manner in which that change was communicated angered families and advocates.
The letters’ envelopes were addressed to the patients, regardless of whether they were minors, rather than to their parents. In some cases, the envelope printed their legal names instead of their chosen names.
Melissa Combs, whose 16-year-old son received hormone replacement therapy from the Yale Gender Program prior to the policy change, recalled hearing from parents whose kids opened the letters. ​“In one case, an 8‑year-old thought it was a gift and was really excited about it,” she said. ​“In another case, there was a teen on the younger side that was at home, and the parents were not… They opened it and they got the news at a time when they were home alone” for what was ​“a really fearful moment” about the future of their health care.
The use of legal names, rather than chosen names, was particularly hurtful to some patients. ​“It is well known that honoring a person’s wishes by using their chosen name is one of the ways that you can say to a trans person that you are worthy of dignity, and you are worthy of life-saving medical care, and you are worthy of a future,” Combs said. She stressed that she does not blame the staff at the Yale Gender Program itself for this communication error.
The use of some kids’ prior names was in some ways ​“one of the hardest things we grappled with” while working with youth and their families, said organizer Cajigas, because it invoked a message of denial and rejection.
Heather, meanwhile, was able to intercept the letter before her daughter could read it. ​“It couldn’t have been handled more insensitively if they tried,” she said.
In a follow-up letter sent out to families — addressed this time to both the kids and their parents — Bogue and Heinz apologized for the way the announcement had been mailed out and indicated that patients’ chosen names would be used in future communications.
A sense of security shattered
Heather waited several days before telling her daughter about the contents of the letter. ​“I don’t want her to feel like the rug’s been pulled out from underneath her,” she said. 
When she did sit down to deliver the news — before the family had found an alternative source of gender-affirming care — Heather tried to convey it all in a way that was both honest and age-appropriate. 
She recalled that her daughter was ​“upset and disheartened.” While her daughter had been aware of the possibility that her medication access could fall through, it still came as a shock that it could happen in Connecticut — a place that had once felt distant from the kind of pushback unfolding in red states like Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Tennessee.
Heather reached out to as many medical providers as possible, uncertain if any would be able to take her daughter. ​“This is very specialized medicine,” she said. ​“Many clinics, including several local ones, have long wait lists.” 
Her family is glad to have an option in Boston Medical Center for now. But after two major Connecticut providers of gender-affirming care have closed their programs, Heather worries that any source of health care for her daughter may not be permanently available.
The options that remain available will still face political hostility toward gender-affirming care, especially for youth.
Meanwhile, her daughter is growing up — and the masculine changes she’s dreaded for so long may soon start to take shape. ​“We’re racing against the clock,” said Heather.
“That security and that safety that we thought we had” in Connecticut — ​“that’s very much been shattered,” said Heather. ​“We’re still kind of in this strange space of piecing together a solution, and crossing our fingers to hope that doesn’t fall through.”

John Rivers, John Bailey, David Middleton, Leroy Major and Buck Godfrey – all teammates from the 1955 Cannon Street YMCA Little League All-Star team – left Charleston, South Carolina, on a bus on Aug. 18, 2025.
After a stop at the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York, for a couple days – where their story is included in an exhibit on Black baseball that opened in 2024 – they’ll head to Williamsport, Pennsylvania.
There, they’ll be recognized before the Little League World Series championship game on August 24, 2025 – 70 years after the players, then 11 and 12 years old, watched the championship game from the bleachers, wondering why they weren’t on the field living out their own dreams instead of watching other boys live out theirs.
When the Cannon Street team registered for a baseball tournament in Charleston in July 1955, it put the team and the forces of integration on a collision course with segregation, bigotry and the Southern way of life.
White teams refused to take the field with the Cannon Street team, who represented the first Black Little League in South Carolina. The team won two tournaments by forfeit. They were supposed to then go to a regional tournament in Rome, Georgia, where, if they won, they’d advance to the Little League World Series.
But Little League officials ruled the team ineligible for the regional tournament because it had advanced by winning on forfeit and not on the field, as the rules stipulated.
A 4-team Black league is born
The Civil Rights Movement is often told in terms of court decisions, bus boycotts and racist demagogues. It’s rarely told from the point of view of children, who suffered in ways that left physical and emotional scars.
When I was a journalism professor at the College of Charleston, I learned how the presence of a single Black all-star team was enough to cause one of the biggest crises in Little League history. In 2022, I wrote the book “Stolen Dreams: The 1955 Cannon Street All-Stars and Little League Baseball’s Civil War.”
The team’s story begins in 1953. Robert Morrison, president of the Cannon Street YMCA, petitioned Little League Baseball to create a league for Black teams, and Little League Baseball granted the charter. Dozens of Black 11- and 12-year-old boys were selected for the four-team league before the 1954 season.
They played on a diamond of grass and gravel at Harmon Field in Charleston, a city with a long history of racial strife. In 1861, the Civil War began in Charleston harbor, where hundreds of thousands of slaves had been brought to the U.S. from the 1600s to the 1800s. The field also wasn’t far from Emanuel AME church, where nine Black parishioners were murdered during a prayer meeting in 2015.
Little League Baseball barred first-year leagues from the postseason tournaments. At some point during the 1955 season, the best players were selected for the league’s All-Star team. Cannon Street YMCA officials then registered the team for the Charleston city tournament, which included all-star teams from the city’s all-white leagues.
Little League Baseball officially prohibited racial discrimination. But in South Carolina, racial discrimination was still legal.
Dixie fights back
The U.S. Supreme Court had ruled a year earlier that segregation in schools was unconstitutional in the landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision, paving the way for racial integration.
Few states resisted integration as fiercely as South Carolina, and no politician fought harder against racial equality than the state’s junior U.S. senator, Strom Thurmond.
So when the Cannon Street YMCA All-Stars registered for Charleston’s citywide tournament in July 1955, all the white teams withdrew. The Cannon Street team won by forfeit and advanced to the state tournament.
Danny Jones, the state’s director of Little League Baseball, petitioned the organization to create a segregated state tournament. Little League Baseball’s president, Peter McGovern, denied Jones’ request. He said that any team that refused to play the Cannon Street team would be banned from the organization.
Thurmond let it be known to Jones that an integrated tournament could not be permitted. In the end, Jones urged all the white teams to withdraw from the state tournament. He then resigned from Little League Baseball, created the Little Boys League and wrote the league’s charter, which prohibited Black players.
The Little Boys League – which was rebranded as Dixie Youth Baseball – soon replaced Little League in other Southern states; within six years, there were 390 such leagues spanning most of the former Confederacy. It would be decades before Little League Baseball returned to South Carolina.
Having won the South Carolina tournament by forfeit, the Cannon Street YMCA All-Stars prepared for the regional tournament in Rome, Georgia, where the state’s governor, Marvin Griffin, objected to integration. If youth baseball could be integrated, so, too, could schools, swimming pools and municipal parks, he said.
Let them play!
Little League rules said that teams could advance only by playing and winning, so the Cannon Street’s state championship was ruled invalid because it had come by forfeit.
McGovern decided against making an exception for the Cannon Street YMCA All-Stars.
Most white-owned newspapers, whether in the South or North, had long stayed silent on the topic of racial discrimination. But the story of the Cannon Street All-Stars broke through. Editors and reporters may have wanted to avoid the topic of racism, but boys being denied the opportunity to play in a baseball tournament was too objectionable to ignore.
On July 31, 1955, New York Daily News columnist Dick Young asked Brooklyn Dodgers star Jackie Robinson, who had broken Major League Baseball’s color barrier eight years earlier, about the white teams that had quit the tournament rather than play against a Black team.
“How stupid can they be?” Robinson said. “I had to laugh when I read the story.”
Perhaps pressured by criticism, McGovern, Little League’s president, invited the team to be Little League’s guests for the championship game. So the team boarded a bus for Williamsport. They arrived the night before the championship game, which pitted Morrisville, Pennsylvania, against Delaware Township, New Jersey, an integrated team.
The Cannon Street YMCA All-Stars and their coaches were introduced before the game, and the players recall hearing a loud voice from the bleachers.
“Let them play!” it boomed.
Others in the crowd joined in, the players said.
“Let them play! Let them play!”
John Rivers, who played second base for the team, told me he can still “hear it now.”
After their brief moment on the field, the Cannon Street All-Stars returned to their seats and watched other boys live out their dreams. A photograph of the team in the stands reveals the disappointment on their faces.
On the following day – Aug. 28, 1955 – the team boarded its bus to return to Charleston. It was the same date that Emmett Till, not much older than the players on the team, was brutally murdered in Money, Mississippi, for reportedly whistling at a white woman.
The boys and girls who play in the 2025 tournament will forever remember the experience. The surviving members of the Cannon Street All-Stars, who are all in their early 80s, never forgot what they were denied.
Rivers, who went on to become a successful architect, says this is the moral of their story.
“It’s a tragedy to take dreams away from a youngster,” Rivers told The Washington Post in 2022. “I knew it then. I know it now, and I’ve seen to it that no one takes dreams away from me again.”
Now there are some on the political right who want to bury America’s ugly racial history.
America has never fully reckoned with slavery or the decades of segregation, Rivers recently told me. “It just decided to move on from that ugly period in its history without any kind of therapy,” he said. “And now they are trying to sweep it all under the rug again.”

Article Summary

Beekeepers face steep startup costs and significant bee colony losses – often exceeding 50% annually.
Illinois has more than 5,400 registered beekeepers, with nearly 9 in 10 managing 10 hives or fewer.
Strong mentorship, close monitoring and local associations are key to successful beekeeping.
Beekeeping doesn’t replace native pollinator conservation but can foster awareness.

This summary was written by the reporter and editors who worked on this story.

SPRINGFIELD — Luke Harvey established the Riverview Road Apiary in 2014, perched along the Illinois River in Chillicothe, just across from the home where he grew up north of Peoria. Surrounded by birdsong on the back porch of the house, Harvey recently reflected on his history with bees.
“The love of beekeeping is also about the love of being outside, being closer to nature and being close to the world that we just aren’t really involved in.”
It’s an idyllic scene, one that can make it easy to overlook how challenging beekeeping can be for Harvey and the more than 5,400 other registered beekeepers across Illinois. Nearly 89% of them are hobbyists managing 10 colonies or fewer, according to the fiscal year 2025 Apiary Inspection Annual Report from the Illinois Department of Agriculture released in July.

Losses
Bee loss is a persistent issue throughout the state. It’s not uncommon for beekeepers to lose over half of their colonies each year — primarily during winter — due to disease, competition, poor nutrition or limited resources. That’s a trend mirrored across much of the Midwest and the country.
One long-standing threat is the varroa mite, which feeds on a bee’s hemolymph — a fluid similar to blood — and fat body, a key part of the bee’s immune system. These mites can weaken bees and act as vectors of viruses that can spread rapidly through a hive and beyond.
Many beekeepers indicated that it is difficult to keep colonies healthy. The IDOA’s FY25 report suggests a rise in varroa mite levels in the state, though it cautions that this may partly be because of environmental variables or when and where inspections occurred.
Pollinator expert Brittany Buckles said many of the biological challenges in Illinois are recurring and somewhat predictable but not always completely avoidable or easy to manage.
Buckles has worked with bees for about a decade and holds a master’s degree in entomology, specializing in pollinators. Now based primarily in northern Illinois, she teaches classes through the Chicago Honey Co-Op in addition to her other pollinator-related work.
She reports an annual colony loss rate of around 40% in the hives she’s involved with — lower than many in the state — and partly attributes that to precise, timely treatment and close hive monitoring.
Buckles emphasized the importance of reliable information, recommending the University of Minnesota’s Beekeeping in Northern Climates guide.

Cost
Beyond biology, there are financial hurdles as well. Newcomers often face startup costs between $600 and over $1,000 for a hive and the required equipment.
“Life is already expensive enough,” Harvey said, adding that beekeeping is complex and many first-timers face difficulties managing hives. “People get frustrated.”
Harvey is what the beekeeping community calls a “sideliner,” someone between a hobbyist and a full-time professional. A former engineer and project manager, he has been able to devote more time to the apiary since taking early retirement from Caterpillar Inc. last year.
Even for seasoned beekeepers, scaling up can be a challenge. Harvey has considered expanding beyond 100 hives but said doing so alone would be difficult. Hiring would be costly, especially given how hive numbers can fluctuate.
“I know it’s possible,” he said. “I just haven’t been able to do it yet.”
About 10 miles away, the Urban Acres Gardens project in Peoria also incorporates beekeeping into its broader mission. Founded in 2018, the initiative focuses on providing fresh and affordable produce sourced from local gardens in Peoria’s North Valley.
Andres Diaz, owner of Urban Acres Gardens, has kept bees for six years and acknowledged the steep startup cost. However, he said he has recouped the initial investment through honey sales at the North Valley Farmers Market, where Urban Acres’ produce is sold.
“(Beekeeping) has been both beneficial for our plants and our production,” Diaz said. “It pays for itself after a couple of years if you’re selling the honey.”

He reinvests most of the proceeds into better beekeeping equipment and said the practice also supports a deeper purpose.
“We reap the benefits of being in a community (where) we can do things more naturally and be more connected with our food sources,” he said.
Diaz has seen that first-hand. His teenage son helps bottle honey and wants to start working the hives, while his youngest daughter enjoys taste-testing.
Community
Diaz and others emphasized the value of mentorship in beekeeping. Buckles recommended that aspiring beekeepers shadow an experienced local mentor for a season before starting.
“Just like in any other trade, your mentor and the quality of your mentor can make or break you,” she said.
Many beekeepers credited the longevity of their apiaries to local clubs. Twenty-five local groups are affiliated with the Illinois State Beekeepers Association, offering education and a sense of community

Harvey is now the communications officer with the Heart of Illinois Beekeepers Association, which he said was key to sustaining his decadelong experience with bees.
“I can’t emphasize enough how important a well-run local association is,” he said. “That’s how you get new beekeepers, how you educate new beekeepers and how you educate the public.”
Other pollinators
While honeybees usually get the spotlight in discussions around pollination, promoting nonhoneybee pollinators is crucial for biodiversity and for preserving endangered species like the rusty-patched bumble bee – one of 400 to 500 native bee species in Illinois. Those species are often overshadowed by the honey bee, known as apis mellifera, which was originally imported from Europe in the 17th century.
Since 2021, the Illinois Farm Bureau’s pollinator conservation grant program has committed $145,000 to 55 projects across 28 counties. Most of the support has gone toward pollinator plots – planted areas with species like milkweed, which monarch butterflies rely on for their reproductive cycles.
“It’s kind of a passion project for people,” said Bena Pegg, environmental program manager at the Farm Bureau. “There’s a lot of diversity in the way that individual counties are doing that work.”
Buckles suggested there is currently a lack of substantial data on competition between honey bees and native pollinators in the Midwest. Still, she encouraged maintaining native plants — such as milkweed, New England aster, monarda fistulosa (bee balm) and native goldenrod species — to help support vulnerable pollinators.
“As beekeepers, we all are connected to the environment. We’re not trying to do harm,” she said, adding that more research could spark valuable conversations around conservation in the context of beekeeping.
While keeping honeybees may not directly support native species, Buckles said she believes it can have benefits. The activity connects people to the natural world and deepens their understanding of food systems.
“There is a lot of beauty to beekeeping,” she said. “However, just putting a beehive in your yard isn’t going to help conservation necessarily.”

Looking out at the Illinois River from the back porch of his family home late one afternoon, Harvey reflected on the personal significance of beekeeping.
“It’s a calming experience,” he said. “You get to go through the hives and get away from the screen or being indoors.”
Harvey also values the community around it. In February 2024, he and his mentor Steve Schmidt launched the Beekeeping Buddies podcast, which surpassed 2,600 listens in its first year.
“Which for two guys out in the Midwest is not bad,” he said with a smile.
Harvey acknowledged the concerns about competition between honeybees and native species but stressed the importance of conservation of all pollinators.
“We need to push to be understanding of what our pollinator loss is, and we need to be doing better by them,” he said.

NorthWestern Energy is a monopoly utility that operates in Montana, South Dakota and Nebraska and serves 787,000 customers. It counts 413,400 electric and 214,500 natural gas customers in Montana.
Black Hills is based in South Dakota and serves 1.35 million natural gas and electric utility customers in eight states, the news release said. It operates in Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota and Wyoming.
The announcement from NorthWestern Energy said the boards of directors of both companies unanimously approved the deal. It said a discussion about terms of a merger started in March.
It said the merger requires additional approvals from regulators in the three states in which both companies operate, Montana, Nebraska and South Dakota.
The combined company would serve approximately 2.1 million customers across eight contiguous states, the news release said — Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Wyoming.
If the deal is completed, Black Hills CEO Linn Evans will retire, and NorthWestern Energy CEO Brian Bird will lead the new company, the news release said.
“Our merger with Black Hills will create a premier regional regulated utility company with a larger, more resilient platform consistent with mid-cap peers,” Bird said in a statement. “Together, we will be better positioned to meet rising demand, accelerate investment in energy and grid infrastructure, and support customers and communities through a rapidly evolving energy landscape.
“NorthWestern and Black Hills are best-in-class operators, and we are confident that our closely aligned cultures and skilled workforces will enable us to successfully bring the companies together. We will remain a trusted energy partner to our customers and look forward to building a brighter future for the people, businesses, and communities we are privileged to serve.”
The news release said the combined company would support an increase in earnings per share of 5% to 7%. It said the merger would create “strong and predictable earnings and cash flows” and offer more efficient access to capital and “an enhanced ability to invest in critical infrastructure.”
The news release said if completed, Black Hills shareholders will own approximately 56% of the new utility, and NorthWestern shareholders will own 44% of the combined company.
“We are excited to bring our two highly complementary companies together to create significant long-term value for customers, employees, shareholders, and the communities we serve,” said Black Hills President and CEO Evans in a statement. “Our future success will be driven equally by the people, assets, and capabilities of both organizations.
“The combined company will have greater scale and financial strength to consistently deliver for customers across our service territories and invest at the pace and scale that today’s energy transformation demands. Our vision is to be the energy partner of choice for our customers, communities, and investors, and this merger will accelerate our ability to achieve this goal.”

(Photo by Jacques Julien/Getty Images)No responsible parent would let their child sign a contract to buy a house or car. Yet today, minors enter into binding agreements with just a few taps in an app store.
In this application-driven digital landscape, regulating what our children download has never been more important.
According to a 2023 Gallup poll, U.S. teens spend nearly five hours a day on their phones, underscoring the need and urgency for parental oversight.
Screentime is skyrocketing across the country. Now, more than ever, something needs to be done to counter this trend.
A survey provided by South Carolina Public Radio found that 83% of teachers in the state reported phone usage as a distraction in class, a figure recorded before the state’s recent classroom phone restrictions.
Despite this, parents currently have no meaningful way to control what their children download from app stores, making it clear that stronger safeguards and accountability are urgently needed.
The App Store Accountability Act (ASAA), introduced by Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Rep. John James (R-Michigan), would require minors to receive parental consent prior to downloading any application from app marketplaces.
This piece of legislation marks a pivotal step toward restoring parental control in the digital age and ensuring tech giants are held accountable for the content they allow children to view.
Importantly, South Carolina doesn’t have to wait on Washington to act.
Rep. Brandon Guffey of York County has introduced legislation in the South Carolina General Assembly modeled after the ASAA, demonstrating a willingness to lead on this issue.
This legislation can empower South Carolina parents with direct oversight of what their children download, making our state one of the first to put families — not tech companies — in the driver’s seat when it comes to digital safety.
Not only would the ASAA require parental verification for minors attempting to download an app, but it would also make sure app age ratings accurately match the content and in-app experiences.
As of now, Google and Apple app ratings simply act as guidelines, ignoring the drastic repercussions of age ratings that are far too low. Through required download permission and accurate content rating, we can create a safer digital environment for our children.
Parents across the country have voiced strong support for the ASAA.
According to a national poll conducted by the Digital Childhood Alliance, 88% of U.S. parents support requiring children to gain their approval before downloading an app. This broad support emphasizes a growing consensus around the need for greater regulation of app store platforms.
Holding app marketplaces accountable for the content they provide in their app stores is not just a parental concern, it’s a bipartisan one.
Support spans the political spectrum, with 86% of Republican parents and 80% of Democratic parents in favor of holding app stores accountable, according to the poll released in May.
The momentum is already building, with Texas, Utah, and Louisiana leading the way by passing legislation which places power into the hands of parents.
South Carolina could join this growing list of states standing up for children and families.
The App Store Accountability Act respects our First Amendment rights as well.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that requiring age verification in the attempt to shield minors from inappropriate content, such as pornography, is not a violation of our constitutional rights. By promoting digital child safety, the ASAA respects the rights of both parents and children while keeping app stores in check.
South Carolina can lead by example.

(Photo illustration by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Heading into the respiratory illness season, states and clinicians are working to encourage pregnant patients to get COVID-19 vaccinations, even though the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services no longer recommends that they should.
Along with being older and having an underlying health condition, pregnancy itself is a risk factor. Pregnant women are more vulnerable to developing severe illness from COVID-19. They’re also at high risk for complications, including preterm labor and stillbirth. The vast majority of medical experts say getting the shot is safe and effective — much safer than having the illness.
But HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced in May that the agency would no longer recommend that pregnant women get the vaccine. Before testifying before Congress in June, Kennedy circulated a document on Capitol Hill claiming higher rates of fetal loss after vaccination. But the authors of those studies told Politico that their work had been misinterpreted.
Experts say the federal shift puts the onus on state health agencies to ramp up vaccine guidance and outreach. Clinicians and public health organizations are trying to dispel misinformation and make sure information reaches low-income people and people of color, who had higher maternal death rates during the pandemic. During the first two years of the pandemic, the virus contributed to a quarter of maternal deaths, according to federal data.
“We are severely disappointed,” said Dr. Neil Silverman, a professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California, Los Angeles David Geffen School of Medicine. He has studied vaccines and pregnancy for the past 15 years and specializes in high-risk pregnancies.
Silverman called the federal shift a “public health tragedy on a grand scale.”

Vaccinations against COVID-19 help prevent severe illness in pregnant people as well as their newborns, who are too young to get vaccinated, Silverman said. In what’s called passive immunity, vaccinated mothers pass on antibodies to their babies through the placenta and through breast milk.
“State public health agencies are probably going to have to implement vaccine guidance that differs from the federal recommendations. And that’s going to be an interesting can of worms,” said OB-GYN Dr. Mark Turrentine, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas.
Turrentine serves on a board of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists that focuses on immunization and infectious diseases. He said his recent pregnant patients who had COVID-19 hadn’t gotten the vaccine.
“The change in guidance on the federal level just really makes a lot of confusion, and it makes it very challenging to try to explain to individuals why all of a sudden the difference,” Turrentine said.
A slew of public health organizations have been making a concerted effort to dispel vaccine myths. They include the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit organization of maternal-fetal experts. At a news briefing the society held this month, clinicians stressed the safety and long-standing science behind COVID-19 vaccines, as well as the shots for RSV and the flu. Cases of RSV and the flu tend to peak in the winter months, while in recent years COVID-19 cases have spiked in the summer and the winter.
Dr. Brenna Hughes, an OB-GYN who chairs the organization’s infectious diseases and emerging threats committee, pointed to survey data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing that less than a third of eligible pregnant patients received COVID-19 shots, and only 38% received RSV shots for the 2023 to 2024 season. Less than half — 47% — received flu shots, and 59% received TDAP (whooping cough) vaccines.
CDC data shows that for last year’s and this year’s season, only between 12% and 14% of pregnant patients got the COVID-19 vaccine.
“The complications from the infection are so much greater than the complications and the very few and typically minor adverse events that might occur from the vaccine,” said microbiologist Sabra Klein, a professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
In June, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and 30 other professional health organizations signed a letter urging insurers to continue covering the COVID-19 shot for pregnant women, and have continued to urge coverage since then.
CVS Caremark, one of the nation’s three major pharmacy benefit managers, told Stateline it will continue covering the vaccine for pregnant women. The Arizona, California and North Carolina state Medicaid agencies also told Stateline they are still currently covering COVID-19 vaccines for pregnant women.

Dr. Kimberly Fortner, president-elect of the Infectious Diseases Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology, said during the maternal-fetal medicine briefing that she hopes medical groups’ joint messaging will bolster insurers.
“Hopefully by us linking arms, that can then help develop consistency so that insurers will continue to pay for the vaccine,” she said.
Exacerbating disparities
Dr. Ayanna Bennett, director of the District of Columbia Department of Health, said the federal government’s new stance has upended “a system that’s been stable for a very long time.”
Bennett said her agency used federal pandemic aid to shore up vaccine outreach efforts to communities of color. Now that flow of money is ending.
The changes in federal guidance and funding will “almost certainly exacerbate” maternal health disparities, said Marie Thoma, a perinatal epidemiologist and an associate professor in the University of Maryland Department of Family Science who researches pregnancy and COVID-19.
Black and Indigenous women died at higher rates. The virus exacerbated existing racial disparities in maternal health — and created new ones: Latina mothers, who generally see low rates of maternal mortality, saw deaths surge to 28 per 100,000 in 2021. Their rate was about 12 per 100,000 in 2018, according to federal data.
“We are going in with some exposure already that we didn’t have during the start of the pandemic. So, there will be some protection, but now that will erode,” said Thoma. “If we’re not getting vaccines, or if people are hesitant to take them, we could see some increase.”
Silverman said the administration’s efforts to strip mentions of race from government policies makes it difficult for institutions to reach populations at greatest risk. He called the dismissal of decades of data “saddening and infuriating.”
“The politicization of the vaccine process, or access to it, is what concerns me the most,” said Dr. Yvette Martas, a Connecticut OB-GYN who chairs the board of directors of the Hispanic Health Council.
Many women “are trying to navigate an economic system that’s not always in their favor in terms of also providing access to the kind of educational material that they need,” she said.
Not just COVID-19
In June, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee, replacing them with some members who are vaccine skeptics.
The change is creating chaos. Some states have vaccine laws, such as mandates for kids and coverage statutes, that are specifically tied to the committee’s decisions.










The politicization of the vaccine process, or access to it, is what concerns me the most.


– Dr. Yvette Martas, a Connecticut OB-GYN who chairs the board of directors of the Hispanic Health Council


The Vaccine Integrity Project at the University of Minnesota called on frontline health workers, health officials and professional societies to “counter the spread of inaccurate and confusing vaccine information.”
At a news briefing this month held by the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, representatives from Alabama, Connecticut and Washington, D.C., said they will continue to recommend vaccines.
Alabama’s state health officer, Dr. Scott Harris, said clinicians will be instrumental in getting correct vaccination information to patients.
“We don’t think that we necessarily have the same authoritative voice that we might have had a decade ago in trying to guide people in what to do, but we do believe that people trust their health care providers in most cases and are certainly willing to listen to them,” he said at the briefing.
Bennett said she is hopeful that strong, consistent messaging from respected medical organizations will help combat confusion.
“Having established groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics or the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology make very firm recommendations that keep us essentially not changed from where we have been, I think, should reassure families,” she said.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)JUNCTION CITY — In 2021, employees at the county-owned Geary Community Hospital wondered every week if they would get a paycheck.
The downhill spiral of the facility was coming to a critical point.
Layoffs of certified nursing assistants. Staff hoarding supplies because they weren’t sure when, or even if, new ones would arrive. Increasing numbers of contract employees as local people left for more stable jobs. Broken equipment.
Even today, three years after Topeka-based Stormont Vail Health took over and began turning around the failing hospital, staff still hoard supplies, said Kourtney Brown, a nursing manager at the renamed Stormont Vail Health Flint Hills campus.
“It’s just one of those things where, every day, not knowing if the lights were going to be turned on — we were worried about our electricity bills,” she said. “We were worried about our food bills.”
The worries were legitimate. Geary County Commissioner Trish Giordano said the hospital at one point had two days of operating cash on hand.
“Our doors were ready to close,” she said. “I took office in January of 2021, and it was obvious that we had to do something.”

County decisions
Pinpointing exactly how the hospital got into such bad financial straits is difficult, Giordano said. A 15-member Board of Trustees ran the facility but had somehow missed red flags as the hospital began floundering, she said. 
County officials fielded constant constituent complaints about the hospital, and the situation was critical by 2020, Giordano said.
Giordano believed the county’s lack of a finance officer contributed to problems because commissioners didn’t have good oversight of how the money collected from a six-mill tax levy was being used.
“We had deferred maintenance of $20 million, operating in the red all the time. It was just a bad situation,” she said.
A long-time community member, Giordano served as a police officer in Junction City for 28 years. She campaigned for county commissioner on two issues: addressing the hospital’s poor performance and hiring a first-ever county finance officer. 
One thing affected the other, Giordano said. 
When the county hired an experienced finance director in 2021, she helped the commission revamp the budget and use a $32 million bond to save the hospital “with no impact to our taxpayers,” Giordano said.
The county is using the six-mill levy that was already in place to repay the bond debt.
“If we had had a finance person before, they would have seen those red flags years ago and would have saved us a lot of money,” Giordano said.
As county officials scrambled in 2021 to resuscitate the hospital, commissioners spoke with one organization interested in taking over. They wanted to eliminate services, such as inpatient care and delivering babies, Giordano said, leaving only clinics and an emergency room.
“Our community deserves better than that,” she said. “We deliver 300 babies a year here.”
At the end of 2021, Giordano and a governing board member reached out to Stormont Vail’s CEO. The hospital system was in the midst of dealing with COVID-19 but indicated interest in talking with them, Giordano said.
The idea of taking over a hospital in Junction city wasn’t in Stormont’s long-term plan, said Anita Fry, vice president for marketing and communications, and it’s the first hospital Stormont has acquired. But the process has been successful in ways Stormont didn’t expect, including how the Flint Hills campus blends with Stormont services offered in nearby Manhattan, she said.
“The synergy between Manhattan and Junction City can just continue to grow,” Fry said. “Having this whole operation gives us a different perspective now. We understand some of the smaller hospitals that feed into us in Topeka. It gives us a nice perspective to be able to think with a different lens.”

Logistics
The rebuilding process has not been an easy one, but Tracy Duran, Flint Hills campus administrator, lights up when she talks about where the hospital is now.
A 19-year Stormont employee, Duran joined the Junction City operation as director of nursing before becoming the administrator.
Stormont began managing the hospital in July 2022 and took full ownership on Jan. 1, 2023, she said. One of the first steps was putting an electronic medical record system into place.
“We had to get all of the policies and education to staff,” she said. “They learned like 13 different processes and new applications in that six months, so they were really drinking from a fire hose.”
Brown, the nursing manager, said it was difficult to keep up with all the changes at first but seeing the infusion of energy and money into the hospital made up for it.
“It was not Stormont coming in and just taking over and changing everything about us,” she said. “We still got to be us in our community. But then we had a different name, and then we started getting a different reputation. You don’t realize how bad your reputation was until it starts getting better.”
Employees welcomed the stability Stormont brought, Brown said. 
“None of us knew how to accept things,” she said. “I remember something broke and Tracy was like, ‘OK. We’ll just call Topeka and see if they have one or we’ll just buy one.’ ”
Brown shook her head at the memory, still amazed at the idea they didn’t have to make do anymore. On another occasion, a Topeka unit got new recliners and she asked for their old ones. 
“They’re like, ‘You’re not going to like them,’ ” Brown said. “Excuse me. A patient’s using a trash can for a footstool. I got them and they’re beautiful. Just to be able to have supplies for our patients, be able to have equipment that works, that’s trustworthy … to be able to start slowly hiring different staff and these different specialties and these different services that we could provide to our community — you started to see our community coming more and trusting us more.”

Proof in the numbers
Duran said that when Stormont came in, the hospital was losing $1 million to $1.5 million per month. Now the hospital is in the black.
“Over these last six months, it’s a baby profit, but it’s a profit,” Duran said. “It’s a positive sign.”
They did not expect to see positive revenue that quickly, she said.
“I think we’ve gained a lot of respect back from the community,” Duran said. “They’re coming. You can see that in our emergency room numbers. They’re growing every month.”
When Stormont Vail took over, there were 175 employees, Fry said. Today, there are 250 plus an additional 85 contract employees who work mostly in nutritional services or on an as-needed basis.
One of the first moves was to stabilize the emergency department staff by hiring new physicians and stopping the use of traveling doctors and nurses. They also hired physicians for the hospitalist program, which had been run by one doctor, Duran said.
Jimmy Jenkins was in primary care — though Duran pauses to say he first started at Geary Community Hospital doing lawn care — but when he saw that primary care doctors were stressed by running a clinic all day and then taking calls in their off hours, he started the hospitalist program.
“He was really doing it 24/7 and was worn out with that,” she said. “We hired two internist-trained physicians and now Dr. Jenkins is back in our rural health clinic,” she said.
Challenges remain, but Duran said she believes those are no longer about stabilizing the hospital as much as they are the standard difficulties facing most medical facilities.
“The landscape of how we’re going to be reimbursed is going to be huge for us,” she said. “We have a high volume of self-pay (patients) and a high volume of marketplace insurances.”
Staffing is always a challenge, she said. 
“We are really in a pattern of growing, and how do we grow and be a western hub for a hospital?” she said. “To do that, it’s going to take a lot of recruitment, a lot of marketing of what we need, and making sure that we’re balancing that with community resources.”

Keeping care local
Cindy Samuelson, spokesperson for the Kansas Hospital Association, said she appreciates the collaboration that saved Junction City’s hospital.
Times may be difficult for hospitals with financial and workforce issues — 67% of Kansas hospitals are running in the red — but the Flint Hills campus is an example of how community care can survive, she said.
“There’s a lot happening to help keep health care local, and a number of things happening in regards to the model of care being provided,” Samuelson said. “Our state is unique in that we have many independent hospitals. Many states have a lot more systems, where all their hospitals in their state are connected to some big system.”
Partnerships, whether through mergers or collaborations, throughout the Kansas medical system strengthens care and opportunities, she said.
Samuelson listed multiple examples of how communities are addressing medical needs, including two struggling critical access hospitals in Harper and Anthony that merged together to create the Patterson Health Center, a public-private partnership. 
“We are trying to sustain health care in our state close to home,” she said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/P7101311b-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-08-19 09:56:30.923973

Voters in Dearborn, Michigan, will select their mayor, their clerk and all seven members of the City Council this November — and they will also get a say on whether to revamp the city charter to add two council seats and divide the city into wards for the first time.
The ballot measure is the result of a major effort by activists and election officials in Dearborn, a city of more than 100,000 people just west of Detroit. Voter approval of the measure would help fix what organizers say is a longstanding problem: unequal representation of the city’s residents.
A ward is a designated geographic area all represented by the same council member, who lives in that district and is voted on by the members within that ward. The most common alternative — and what Dearborn has now — is at-large representation, where the entire city selects all council members without regard to where they live. That method has led to years of unbalanced distribution of council members in Dearborn organizers say. Local advocates have tried in the past to fix the issue, but this would be the first time the question comes directly before voters.
Voters in Detroit overwhelmingly approved a similar referendum in 2009 to switch from at-large representation on their City Council to a mostly district-based system, to address similar concerns about whether neighborhoods had sufficient representation. Since 2013, Detroit has seven districts and just two at-large seats. Several of the state’s other largest cities, including Grand Rapids and Warren, also have wards for their legislative bodies.
The Dearborn ballot measure comes from local activist group Dearborn Wants Wards, whose name says it all: In a city of more than 100,000, organizers want their representatives to come from all parts of the city. The alternative, members of the organization say, is that political power is concentrated with people from the wealthier western part of the city, where six of the seven current council members come from. The southern and eastern portions of the city are highly industrialized, whereas the western part tends to have larger homes, nicer parks, and other amenities.
“There are big disparities in different parts of the city,” Wahbeh Nuseibeh, an east side resident who is operational data lead for Dearborn Wants Wards. In his part of the city, flooding is a constant worry — even a light storm can send water into basements, while in the south end, industrial pollution leads to high rates of serious health problems like cancer and lung diseases.
Those issues just don’t exist in the same way on the west side, Nuseibeh said.
The initiative doesn’t specify where the ward lines would be; that would be up to a redistricting commission. But organizers say they want three wards on the west end, three on the east end and one that encompasses both the east and south ends of the city. Changes would take effect in 2029.
Getting the measure on the ballot was not easy. To put an issue on the ballot, the city requires signatures on petitions from 5% of its more than 77,000 registered voters, or more than 3,850 signatures. Dearborn Wants Wards organizers first submitted more than 6,200 signatures, but 2,800 of those were rejected.
That left them a few hundred signatures short. Organizers attributed that largely to an error by the clerk’s office in misidentifying signatures as duplicates. “In Muslim and Arab communities such as ours, it’s common for names with similar spellings to be falsely tagged as duplicates,” Mona Mawari, lead organizer for the campaign, said in a July statement.
George Darany, the city clerk, said city employees spent more than 500 total hours working to verify every signature, putting other projects on hold to try to get organizers an answer quickly.
“It was tough to hear that they thought we perhaps were not doing our jobs properly,” he said of Mawari’s group, “but we knew we were, and we were confident in it.”
Organizers eventually submitted nearly 1,800 additional signatures, enough to clear the threshold. Darany’s office then submitted the filings to the governor’s office for approval, as required for any change to a city charter. On Monday, organizers confirmed the city would put the question on the ballot.
For Nuseibeh, it’s the first step toward making council members accountable to Dearborn’s many neighborhoods.
As clerk, Darany said he would stay neutral on the ballot question itself. But he told Votebeat that he values that the process gives voters a stronger voice, rather than leaving decisions solely to the clerk or city government.
“If Dearborn residents want the change, we’ll implement it,” Darany said.
Dearborn Wants Wards “should be commended for the work that they did, because it was a huge job” to gather signatures, he said. “This is democracy at work right there.”

(Courtesy of Sioux Falls School District)A plan to remove an expectation of student growth from South Dakota’s rules governing teacher evaluation rules stalled Monday.
Student growth is one performance outcome among many used to track student achievement. It’s also part of the mix of factors used to measure teacher quality.
The South Dakota Board of Education Standards voted to rescind a previous decision to hold a public hearing on the effort to remove student growth from teacher evaluations. The rules will continue as they exist for now.
That’s primarily because state Department of Education Secretary Joseph Graves said some state Board of Education Standards members shared concerns after the group approved the department’s plan in May. He also expected the initiative to fail a legislative committee hearing required for the change, since the committee rejected a similar proposal last year.
The revision would have removed a requirement that teacher performance evaluations use “student learning objectives,” which are student educational growth goals. The objectives are set by the teacher and school administration. The standard is beneficial for some school districts, but not for others, Graves said.
Board plans hearing on removal of student growth goals from SD teacher evaluation requirements

Graves previously told the board that the specific student growth piece of the evaluation has become “increasingly trite and meaningless” with some teachers or schools setting low standards they can easily meet.
Department officials plan to review the rules and bring the topic back to the board later in the year. That will allow the department to educate the board about why the state tied student achievement to teacher evaluation and what other options there are.
Board president Steve Perkins was the sole vote against the effort at the board’s May meeting, saying he wanted another option presented and more time to study the issue. On Monday, he said he’d welcome a review of the policy.
“There is a problem, and this evaluation system is kind of broken for many districts,” Perkins said. “If we’re going to adopt a rule on it, we kind of need to understand it.”

The Trump administration is once again pressuring liberal cities and states, like Philadelphia, to cooperate with deportation efforts, despite previous setbacks in court.
Attorney General Pam Bondi sent letters last week telling sanctuary states, cities and counties that “you better be abiding by our federal policies and with our federal law enforcement, because if you aren’t, we’re going to come after you,” she said in a Fox News interview. She demanded the areas answer her by Tuesday.
Cities and states with so-called sanctuary policies generally refuse to assist with immigration raids or accede to requests for local jails to hold prisoners for deportation. Those that responded to Stateline’s questions about the letters said they were not inclined to change their positions about cooperation with immigration authorities.
“It’s the tactic of a bully. And the only way to deal with a bully is to let them know that they’re not going to intimidate you,” Rhode Island Democratic Attorney General Peter Neronha said in a statement.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The Trump administration is attempting to force more cooperation with immigration arrests. But it suffered a serious court reversal on July 25, when a federal judge dismissed a sanctuary policies case against Illinois, Chicago and Cook County.
The state and local policies reflect a “decision to not participate in enforcing civil immigration law — a decision protected by the Tenth Amendment,” Judge Lindsay Jenkins wrote in an order now under appeal.
Bondi’s letters follow the Justice Department’s Aug. 5 release of a list of sanctuary jurisdictions including 12 states, the District of Columbia, four counties and 18 cities. That’s fewer jurisdictions than the 14 states and almost 500 counties and cities that appeared on an earlier list, which the agency withdrew after criticism that it included conservative counties that were fully cooperating with immigration enforcement.
The states on the new list are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington state. The list also includes some counties and cities in those states as well as in Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New Mexico.










It's the tactic of a bully. And the only way to deal with a bully is to let them know that they're not going to intimidate you. 


– Rhode Island Democratic Attorney General Peter Neronha


Other federal courts have issued injunctions to at least temporarily stop Trump administration from withholding unrelated federal funding from governments that don’t cooperate on immigration. Cities, counties and states have filed lawsuits challenging Trump’s executive orders targeting sanctuary policies, including a February order that federal payments to states and localities must not “by design or effect, facilitate the subsidization or promotion of illegal immigration, or abet so-called ‘sanctuary’ policies that seek to shield illegal aliens from deportation.”
“The executive orders are directing agencies to basically take a maximalist approach to putting pressure on local governments to cooperate with immigration [enforcement], even though they’re not required to do so by federal law,” said Jonathan Miller, one of the attorneys working on the California case for the Public Rights Project, a California-based group promoting civil rights protections for states and cities.
One city on the administration’s list was Rochester, New York, which disciplined some police officers for helping federal agents make a March arrest in the city. The city already faces a lawsuit brought by the Trump administration that prominently mentions the arrest of three men from Guatemala; one of whom has since pleaded guilty to re-entering the United States after a previous deportation.
Homeland Security’s list of ‘sanctuary cities’ pulled down after sheriffs object

A spokesperson for the city, Barbara Pierce, said in a statement to The Guardian that, “Nothing in Attorney General Bondi’s letter is new and none of it has legal merit.”
“The letter reiterates many of the frivolous arguments that the federal government has already made in its pending suit against the city of Rochester,” she added. “These same arguments were levied against the city of Chicago and were dismissed by the federal district court for the eastern district of Illinois nearly a month ago.”
Ally Sullivan, a spokesperson for Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis, said in a statement that Colorado “is not a sanctuary state. The Governor continues to be frustrated by this mistaken and incorrect label.” In a televised interview earlier this year, Polis pointed out that Colorado fully cooperates with federal authorities on criminal matters. Immigration, he said, is a civil matter.
“In Colorado, we are improving public safety, apprehending dangerous criminals, cooperating with federal law enforcement on criminal investigations, and keeping our communities safe,” Sullivan said.
Nevertheless, Colorado faces a federal lawsuit brought by the administration over its alleged sanctuary policies. Polis signed a measure in May that limits local law enforcement’s communication with federal immigration authorities and restricts where federal authorities can operate within schools, child care facilities, hospitals and libraries without a judicial warrant.
ICE has a new courthouse tactic: Get immigrants’ cases tossed, then arrest them outside

Connecticut Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont in a statement said the state’s Trust Act, which the Trump administration has targeted as a sanctuary policy, was passed with bipartisan support and helps ensure local police concentrate on serious crimes. The Trust Act, passed in 2013 and expanded in 2019, limits information sharing and compliance with requests to detain immigrants for federal immigration authorities.
“Nothing about this makes Connecticut a sanctuary in any legal or practical sense — it makes our state one that upholds the Constitution, respects the rule of law, and prioritizes the safety and well-being of our communities,” Lamont said.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)The Alaska State Legislature is planning a brief session without taking any action on Tuesday, and legislative leaders say they’ve already completed their intended work for the special session, which ends on Aug. 31.
Gov. Mike Dunleavy called the 30-day session, which began on Aug. 2, for legislators to address his education policy priorities and to create a new Alaska Department of Agriculture. The Legislature convened — one senator flying back from U.S. National Guard duty in Poland — and within hours voted to override two of the governor’s vetoes. Lawmakers then adjourned until Tuesday. 
Legislators voted to leave the session open and not officially close out the special session to prevent Dunleavy from calling them into another one. 
On Tuesday, just “a handful” of legislators are expected to be present for what’s known as a “technical session,” said House Speaker Rep. Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham, reached by phone Monday in his district. 
Edgmon said he was planning to fly back to Juneau to facilitate proceedings in the House on Tuesday, but said it will be brief. 
He said the Legislature’s votes to override two of the governor’s vetoes, including restoring $51 million for K-12 schools, was a success – and their only goal for the special session. 
“But the specter of the governor calling us right back in seems to be very prominent,” Edgmon said. “And we had to do what we had to do in terms of allowing members to go back home, go back to their districts, not being Juneau, drawing per diem, costing the state money — with the stated intention, of course, of looking at the governor’s bills, continuing to consider the governor’s bills and the subject matter next session, as we started to do last session.”
The governor introduced three bills on Aug. 2, related to education policy, and Edgmon said they have been referred to related committees. 
Edgmon said he’s had no communication from the governor’s office since the veto override votes. 
“I wish we had a better relationship with the governor, to where we could plan things out, work jointly in terms of any outcomes for a special session. The governor is acting unilaterally, which, of course, is his prerogative, should he choose. But that does not bode well in terms of any kind of a positive result for special session,” he said. 
Jeff Turner, the governor’s communications director, said by email Monday, “lawmakers should not need an incentive to improve public education policy,” and that it was the Legislature’s decision to not take up the governor’s bills during this special session. 
Turner pointed to the governor’s comments on an Anchorage-based commercial radio show on Aug. 14, where Dunleavy criticized the Legislature’s veto override restoring school funding, and said additional funding is “not going to change the performance outcomes.”
The House and Senate are scheduled to gavel in at 10 a.m. on Tuesday. 
A new joint legislative education funding task force is scheduled to hold its first meeting on Aug 25, where its six members are expected to examine how the state funds schools, as well as Dunleavy’s educational policy items.

Nestled in Missouri’s Bootheel is the small town of Kennett, the Dunklin County seat. With just over 10,000 residents, it’s a close-knit community where good-natured teasing is a common show of affection.
Once a sprawling swampland, it has since been transformed into an expanse of flat, fertile fields where agriculture stands as the backbone of the region’s economy.
Kennett’s houses don’t get much taller than one story, and as visitors stroll down the main street, they’re welcomed by a mix of restaurants, boutiques and a cozy hair salon. These buildings are dwarfed in size by a silent, boarded-up hospital, its vacancy a remembrance of what the community has lost.
It’s the kind of community where if something tragic happens, everyone finds out.
Bobbi Bibbs found this out the hard way. She discovered she had cancer in her colon in December 2023, which then metastasized to her liver, making it a stage four diagnosis.
Bibbs isn’t alone. Dunklin County is among the 10 counties with the highest rates of that type of cancer in the state. This isn’t just a statistic, Bibbs said she can see it and almost can’t fathom it.
“There are so many (cases) where we are from,” Bibbs said. “Like, it’s got to be coming from somewhere.”
Bibbs is surrounded by people who understand her struggles, many of whom work in the agriculture industry. In Dunklin County, there are hundreds of thousands of acres of crops — and most of that land is blanketed by pesticides.
Estimates suggest that thousands of kilograms of pesticides are sprayed over Missouri cropland each year. In some places, wastewater sludge containing “forever chemicals” — per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances — is applied on farmland as fertilizer.
Multiple scientific studies have explored a connection between pesticide use and cancer,  pointing to a silent public health crisis hitting rural communities particularly hard.
The University of Missouri, in partnership with Investigate Midwest, conducted a county-by-county analysis of cancer rates and pesticide use, using the most recently available data for pesticides that are repeatedly cited in research as likely to be associated with cancer risk.
The six counties with the highest use of these pesticides per square mile are all located in the Bootheel, including Dunklin. Four of those counties are in the top 15 for overall cancer rates in Missouri. All counties with the highest rates of cancer are rural.
So in Kennett, there are high rates of chemical usage, high rates of cancer — and the nearest trauma center in the state is more than an hour and a half away.
In other words, it’s a typical rural town in Missouri.
 Green hills and kilograms of chemicals

While Missouri has its share of rolling hills covered in trees and wild foliage, much of the land is well developed to suit the needs of farmers and their crops. There are about 27 million acres of Missouri farmland being cultivated and nearly 88,000 farms, according to the Rural Farm & Finance Policy Analysis Center.
The biggest business in the state is agriculture, employing about 460,000 statewide, according to the Missouri Department of Agriculture. Soybeans, corn and wheat are some of the crops that color most of the state’s landscape.
Farming is a dangerous job that requires a good deal of heavy equipment and specialized tools. Those tools include chemicals.
Isain Zapata is a data scientist who researched the relationship between pesticides and the incidence of cancer. He looked at the complex mixtures of pesticides tailored to specific crops that are sprayed in different regions.
“When we look at those pesticides, it’s not just one — it’s all a cocktail,” Zapata said. “It’s the whole rainbow of different colors.”
He found that these colorful combinations are strongly linked to certain cancer rates across the nation.
“Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and leukemias are very intimately associated with pesticide use,” Zapata said. “But we also saw that the overall pesticide use has an effect on all the other non-obvious cancers.”
Other research shows an association between certain pesticides and an increased risk of brain, prostate, breast, kidney and colon cancers.
Pesticides are a classification of substances used to protect crops. This includes killing weeds, insects or even strengthening wood to prevent pests from harming the plant. Farmers typically apply pesticides to crops using methods such as aerial spraying or ground-based equipment.
Serious risks are posed by pesticides because they can harm both human health and the environment. Exposure may lead to short-term or long-term health problems, while also contaminating soil and water, which may disrupt ecosystems and affect wildlife.
But pesticides do what they do best. Zapata emphasizes that without pesticides, agriculture-based economies and the communities tied to them would suffer.
“I am not in favor or against pesticides,” Zapata said. “I know we need them. I don’t like them, but I know why they have to be there.”
He said rural agricultural areas are home to an intense combination of factors that multiply the risk level.
Farmers are under pressure to maintain or increase their productivity, and that comes at the cost of using compounds that carry health risks, Zapata said. Rural areas are often underserved by health care facilities, meaning there are often too few health providers and resources in theose areas to monitor and manage the added risk of using pesticides.
“It’s just the perfect storm,” Zapata said. “You combine several factors (heavy pesticide usage, poor regulation and monitoring, socioeconomic disparities), you’ve made it worse.”
 The million-acre highway

Mike Milam is a local expert in pesticide application. Based in Kennett, he is a field specialist in agriculture and environment for MU Extension, serving Dunklin, New Madrid and Pemiscot counties.
“I’ve had people tell me, especially the ones who don’t like chemicals at all (that) our bodies weren’t designed to breathe these chemicals,” Milam said. “And they’re right about that.”
The herbicide Roundup is the target of thousands of lawsuits claiming it causes cancer, putting it in the spotlight. Milam listed other chemicals that have caused concern, including paraquat, vydate and dicamba.
Farmers and the workers hired to harvest crops frequently interact with chemicals. From mixing to pouring to spraying, they are there for all of it. They also encounter other farmers’ chemicals when a substance sprayed in one area drifts somewhere it was not intended to be.
“I have known a situation (where) people out in the fields got sprayed, or they sprayed next to them, and then it drifted over. And things like that,” Milam said. “Matter of fact, when I was in graduate school, I was in a field down in Louisiana, and they were spraying right next to us. We actually had to leave the field.”
Direct drift occurs when an applicator applies a pesticide and the wind blows it elsewhere, making monitoring weather conditions an integral part of the process. The stronger the wind, the stronger the potential is for drift.
That said, farmers have a limited window to seed and fertilize their fields during planting season. Fluctuating weather conditions can make this even more difficult. This spring alone, the Bootheel faced tornadoes, dust storms and historic flooding, all of which have the potential to hinder field work.
“We go out here, we can plant a crop, it looks beautiful, a flood wipes it out and we gotta start back over,” said state Sen. Jason Bean, a Holcomb Republican and a fifth-generation Bootheel farmer.
Milam said that some farmers end up spraying their crops when conditions aren’t ideal.
“The farmers aren’t paying attention or just decide to go ahead and (apply) anyway because they need to get it done,” Milam said. “They are under a lot of stress, they’re trying to get the crops in.”
Jason Mayer, a fourth-generation Bootheel farmer and one of the directors for the Missouri Soybean Association, believes that, nine times out of 10, farmers are doing the right thing. In his mind, it is the “bad actors” going against best practices. Bean compares this to speeding on the highway.
In his analogy, like drivers on the road minding the speed limit, most farmers follow the rules. Just as there will always be that driver blowing past everyone else in the left lane, there will be farmers who break the rules.
Agricultural regulators — such as the Missouri Department of Agriculture or EPA — serve as the cop on the side of the road in the metaphor. They step in when misuse is suspected. Environmental Protection Agency inspectors can show up at any time and ask to see a farmer’s records, Milam said.
With millions of acres of farmland in Missouri, that’s one big highway to watch. So if agencies don’t catch someone breaking the rules, it can fall to local farmers to report their neighbors to the state pesticide control office.
Bean emphasized that proper pesticide application isn’t just about compliance, it’s also in the farmer’s best interest. Misuse wastes costly chemicals, reduces crop effectiveness and decreases consumer trust in locally grown produce.
“I’d say we’re great stewards of the land,” Bean said. “We’re going to continue that, because in the big picture, farmers want to produce for the world the safest, abundant product.”
Milam said the key is to use the chemicals appropriately to minimize exposure. He said wearing personal protective equipment during application is a best practice. So doing things like wearing long pants, long-sleeved shirts, masks and goggles is essential for safe use.
Bean does not believe pesticides cause or increase the risk of cancer. Mayer echoes this sentiment, emphasizing his lifelong experience around crops and chemical applications.
“I’m 42 — knock on wood — today,” Mayer said. “I’m still relatively young, perfectly healthy, and I’ve been on the farm since I was 14.”
 Waiting on a waiting room

 The building formerly known as the Twin Rivers Regional Medical Center is seen vacant with its windows boarded up on May 21 at 1st Street in Kennett. After the hospital shut down in 2018, the city of Kennett has been without an around-the-clock health care option) Michael Baniewicz for Investigate Midwest).
Striking up a conversation about health care in Kennett is bound to lead to one topic: the hospital.
Kennett doesn’t have one anymore; Twin Rivers Regional Medical Center closed its doors in 2018.
For quick stitch-ups or infection treatment, St. Bernards Urgent Care is open every day. It closes at 7:30 p.m., meaning that Kennett residents have to go elsewhere for their nighttime care.
There are various options in nearby counties, or even in neighboring states, but if someone needs emergency care, for example, it’s a trek.
While there’s a Mercy Hospital located in nearby Dexter with a rotation of specialty doctors, the closest Missouri trauma center to Kennett is in Cape Girardeau, about an hour and a half away.
“(If) I have a heart attack at eight o’clock at night, or stroke, and if (the urgent care) was still open, they could give me that little fancy pill and help get me to the hospital to help,” said Cheryl Bruce, the executive director of the Dunklin/Stoddard Caring Council, an organization based in Kennett offering an assistive services program to Dunklin County residents with cancer.
Kennett’s old hospital building is still standing on the town’s main drag. The windows are boarded up, and walking through the halls requires ducking wires and tiptoeing over glass shards.
The current owner is in a zoning battle to turn the hospital into something. They haven’t been able to find buyers yet because they need various approvals from the city to do any work to make the building sellable.
Kennett isn’t alone in facing minimal health care access. Since 2014, 21 hospitals have shut down statewide, including 12 in rural areas, according to the Missouri Hospital Association.
Additionally, the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform’s 2023-2024 report found 26 rural hospitals in Missouri are at risk of closure due to financial strain — nine of them are at an “immediate risk.”
The Twin Rivers CEO said in a 2018 statement that the hospital’s closure was part of an effort to consolidate operations with Poplar Bluff Regional Medical Center, “as health care delivery evolves and medical innovation makes inpatient services less needed,.”  KFVS12 TV reported at the time.
It was a palpable loss for Kennett — people miss the hospital, Bruce said.
“When the hospital closed, all anybody has ever talked about is, ‘Are we going to get another one?’ ” Bruce said.
From 2020 to 2024, the Caring Council’s cancer assistive services program spent $22,650 helping over 400 people with transportation. For cancer care, folks in Kennett often travel an hour to Jonesboro, Arkansas, or an hour-and-a-half to Cape Girardeau in Missouri. Whatever kind of cancer care you need,, Bruce said, you’ve got to drive to get it.
The lack of health care providers also means early detection of medical issues, including cancer, can be harder to get.
Some health care transportation programs are available in rural areas, but Bruce said she sees a need in her community for more robust services.
“I’m not asking for a bus system like in St. Louis or Kansas City or Jeff City,” Bruce said. “I’m just asking for access to care, whatever that means.”
 Sprayed on all sides

Wherever you go in Kennett, there will be someone who’s called it home their whole life. Kennett’s City Clerk Jan McElwrath is one of those people. Aside from a brief stint at the University of Missouri, she’s spent nearly all of her 68 years in town.
She came back for a classic reason: love. She got married, raised a family and built a life rooted in the same streets where she grew up.
Over the decades, she’s seen businesses open and close, celebrated countless community milestones and weathered natural disasters. Through it all, McElwrath has observed one constant: despite differing beliefs and opinions, the people of Kennett always find a way to come together.
“Our strength is our people, hands down,” she said.
This is especially important when considering the unique challenges of rural living.
An index created by the CDC shows that Dunklin is the county in Missouri least prepared to deal with economic or environmental challenges. According to Feeding America, over 20% of Dunklin County is food insecure, despite the fact that the region is covered in farmland. Milam said that this is largely because the farms in Dunklin are agronomic, which is when crops aren’t always grown for direct human consumption.
“It would help a lot of people if they had fresh vegetables,” he explained.
As manufacturing jobs moved out of many places in the Bootheel, Kennett felt the economic sting. Though Cim-Tek Filtration’s arrival two years ago brought back some manufacturing jobs, Kennett lost its Emerson Motor Company plant in 2006.
One industry that remains is agriculture.
The land is dotted with cotton, soybean and rice row crop operations. McElwrath calls the rows of cotton ready for picking “southern snow,” but to get that snow, farmers usually have to give plants a nudge with defoliants.
Defoliation is a natural process, though it can be artificially induced when chemicals are applied to the plants to get them to open up, making the white cotton easier to harvest.
McElwrath said it’s hard to notice farmers defoliating at first. But then, suddenly, your sinuses sting, your eyes burn, maybe a headache creeps in. It always seems to hit around the same time every year, right when the county fair is going on — with the dust, the dry soil, the demolition derby — everything blending together.
It’s not just that the defoliants make things happen quicker; they help make the cotton a higher grade — that means there is less debris affecting the final product. The grade determines the value.
Many residents of Kennett recognize the need for defoliants and other agricultural chemicals. For some of them, that’s what puts food on the table. But then the time of year creeps around again, and they all experience that familiar sensation.
“We’re surrounded by agriculture,” McElwrath said. “We recognize (chemicals) as a risk, but our economy here is very dependent on agriculture.”

From CalMatters homelessness reporter Marisa Kendall:
Homelessness continues to be a major issue in California, but some places are reporting decreases in their populations.
Santa Cruz County is the latest: It counted 1,473 people this year, down 20% from 2024. But despite that sign of progress, the number of “chronically homeless” people increased — suggesting the county still struggles to house that high-needs population. That category refers to people who have been homeless a year or more and have a disability.
Homelessness dropped 4% in Los Angeles County from last year, marking the second year in a row the county saw a decline. Contra Costa County saw a 26% decrease. Santa Clara County, meanwhile, saw an 8% increase from 2023 (Santa Clara County counts every other year).
Those numbers come from “point-in-time” counts conducted at the start of the year. Results have been rolling in all summer. Experts caution that those counts are estimates, at best, and likely undercount homeless populations. 
Gov. Gavin Newsom was quick to take credit last month as early reports came in showing decreases that his office said happened through his “support of local government efforts and state investments.” He bragged again on Monday, saying California is “reversing decades of inaction on homelessness.”
But the California State Association of Counties was just as quick to accuse Newsom of derailing that progress by slashing state funding in upcoming budget cycles. Though Newsom has poured money into the homelessness crisis, it’s been in one-time grants instead of ongoing funding, which counties complain makes it difficult to build the types of long-term programs that will create meaningful change for the state’s more than 187,000 unhoused people. 
Newsom allocated $1 billion in Homeless Housing, Assistance and Prevention funds last year, but cut that to $0 this year, while signaling an intent to allocate $500 million next year.

An election in a hurry

The state Legislature on Monday unveiled the bill package it must pass to advance Newsom’s plan to redraw California’s congressional maps in response to Texas’ mid-cycle redistricting effort. The three bills relate to the new electoral boundaries; amending the state constitution to sidestep California’s independent redistricting commission through the end of 2030; and appropriating funds for the special election. 
Besides Democratic legislators scrambling to meet the proposed Nov. 4 date for the special election, state voting officials are hustling too, writes CalMatters’ Maya C. Miller. Described as a “Herculean effort” by one county registrar of voters, counties face hurdles including securing vendors to print ballots, booking sites for voting centers and hiring and training staff.
Because some counties are holding off-year elections this fall, adding the redistricting question to their existing ballot wouldn’t be a huge logistical lift, according to the governor. But the special election is still likely to cost most counties a lot of money up front, which the state has pledged to cover. Estimates from county officials range around the tens of millions of dollars, and Assembly Republicans estimate it would cost taxpayers more than $235 million total.

CA’s 39th lawsuit against Trump

From CalMatters reporters Cayla Mihalovich and Mikhail Zinshteyn:
Attorney General Rob Bonta on Monday filed California’s 39th lawsuit against President Donald Trump’s administration, challenging new immigration enforcement requirements it placed on federal funding for crime victims. 
States were set to receive $1.2 billion in federal crime victim funding this year with California expected to claim $165 million. But last month, the U.S. Justice Department’s Office of Victims for Crime announced that states must agree to support and assist the Department of Homeland Security with federal immigration enforcement in order to access those funds. 
The potential cut could be the second significant hit this year from the Trump administration to California programs that support crime victims. Earlier this year, the U.S. Justice Department slashed grants for violence prevention and victim service programs that were initially valued at $811 million. In California alone, the department cut just over $80 million.

Bonta, at a press conference Monday: “Congress has never put civil immigration enforcement conditions on this funding because it has nothing to do with immigration. This is a brazen abuse of the president’s power.”

Jonathan M. Storm, 78, an influential television critic for The Philadelphia Inquirer and former Rutland Herald reporter and editor, died August 4, 2025, in Red Bank, NJ, peacefully, of complications from treatment of metastasized melanoma, with which he had lived gracefully, enthusiastically, and appreciatively for almost six years.
He was a very funny man; a kind, sardonic curmudgeon; bon vivant; gambler; devoted husband; generous mentor; and a man who loved life, his family, and his many friends.
Storm became a television critic at The Philadelphia Inquirer in the late 1980s. It was the dawn of reality TV and shortly before the arrival of landmark shows like “The Simpsons,” “Seinfeld,” “Northern Exposure,” “Law & Order”and, eventually,“Survivor,” “The Wire,” “The Sopranos,” and “The West Wing,”to name a few. Storm was there for all of this, espousing, with a sharp sense of humor, the belief that the art form of television deserved serious thought and criticism.
“I think he accepted a responsibility to write about television in an elevated way,” said his fellow television critic David Walker of the New Orleans Times-Picayune.
Storm played a leading role in the Television Critics Association and in its biannual TV Tour in Los Angeles and was noted for a combination of playfulness and journalistic rigor. As a reporter, said Walker, “He was the perfect combination of sweet and sharp as a knife,” one who prided himself on asking the intentionally provocative but humorous question.
Pop culture writer Will Harris recalls that at a celebrity press conference Storm asked a panel of Kardashians: “Who are you, and why should I care about you?”
He once asked rocker Jon Bon Jovi, who had recently begun television roles: “What makes you think you can act?”
While he leveled his incisive gaze on the industry on behalf of his readers, he also mentored younger TV writers and other young people who relied upon him for wisdom and fun counsel.
Storm’s journalistic roots were at the Rutland Herald in Vermont in the 1970s, then considered one of America’s best small-town papers. He lived in the hills and covered selectmen’s and school board meetings and an early campaign of an upstart named Bernie Sanders. In the newsroom, as everywhere in his career, they called him “Stormy,” and he became city editor. Rutland was also where he met his future wife, Kathleen Pottick, whom he loved deeply from the start. He said that the Herald was where he learned the role of the hard-nosed journalist.
He moved to the Detroit Free Press when Pottick was earning her PhD at the University of Michigan. In Detroit, he rose to become Associate Sunday Editor, and also found time to become The Anonymous Gourmet, reviewing restaurants for the newspaper, incognito.
From the Free Press he went to The Inquirer when Pottick began teaching at Rutgers. He held a variety of editing jobs, including editing TV critics, before landing the TV critic job.
He was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize with reporter Stephen Seplow for a year-long series about the effects of television on culture.
His farewell column in The Inquirer ended: “It was a tremendous pleasure serving you.”

California counties are scrambling to prepare for Gov. Gavin Newsom’s special election on redrawing congressional districts for the 2026 midterm. The effort will cost tens of millions of dollars.


Calling a statewide special election sounds simple in theory. But executing one with fewer than 75 days notice? As one California county election official put it, that’s a “herculean” effort. 
California voting officials are scrambling behind the scenes to prepare for the special election Gov. Gavin Newsom wants this November on his proposal to redraw the state’s congressional districts. But to do so, Newsom needs voters to approve a ballot initiative in an off-year special election that the state has yet to officially approve and schedule. 
Democrats want the proposed California maps to offset President Donald Trump and Republicans’ efforts to stack the next congressional election in the GOP’s favor by squeezing more Republican seats out of red states like Texas, Florida and Missouri.
Newsom only released his proposed maps late last week, and state lawmakers — who just returned from a month-long summer recess — are staring down a hard deadline of Friday to greenlight the ballot language before voters in time for a Nov. 4 election.  
County election officials are hustling as if the election is happening so they can make sure they lock down everything from vendors to print their ballots, locations for voting centers and election workers to staff those polling places come Nov. 4. They’ve pushed hard for the state to cover the hefty costs of an unplanned special election, and some have noted that without additional appropriations, they might need to cut back on vital public safety and social services. 
“It’s difficult for us, just in a regular election, being a smaller rural county,” said Juan Pablo Cervantes, the registrar of voters for Humboldt County, which has just over 85,000 registered voters. Usually Cervantes and his staff have at least five months of lead time to find voting sites, hire staff and procure all the machines, pens and ballots for a statewide election. 
“That’s usually a Herculean effort on its own,” Cervantes said.
A mad dash to find ballots and vote centers
One of the biggest challenges for counties is lining up vendors to print enough ballots – including one absentee ballot for every registered voter in the state, as well as a sufficient number to keep onsite for on-site voting at polling stations. California’s secretary of state has only approved seven vendors to print ballots, not including Orange County, which operates its own printing facility.
The other two logistical hurdles are securing enough sites to serve as vote centers, and hiring and training staff to work them. 
Soon after Newsom declared on July 31 that he would call a special election, Orange County Registrar of Voters Bob Page gathered his staff for an emergency planning meeting. He instructed them to identify which supplies they needed to order as soon as possible, prioritizing products like ballot paper, ballot envelopes and toner for their ballot printers – which might not arrive in time to meet deadlines if they waited for official confirmation of a special election. 
Should the governor end up abandoning his plan, Orange County would also be able to use those materials in next year’s June primary election, minimizing potential waste of taxpayer dollars. 
“I had to make a decision that I couldn’t wait until Aug. 22 to make sure that I could pull this off,” Page said. “I don’t want to be in a position where my county fails in some way to conduct a free and fair election.”
The county also started emailing people with past experience as election workers to gauge potential interest in working at a vote center during the special election. 
California’s last special election
California last had a short-notice, off-year statewide special election in September 2021 when Newsom defeated an attempt to recall him from office.
But because the recall campaign was triggered by a signature drive rather than ordered by the state Legislature, Page said counties had plenty of early warning signs to help them prepare. 
“We knew when there were enough signatures to require the recall election,” Page said. “We were very involved when the legislature was pitching ideas of trying to shorten the timeline and have the recall election in August of that year rather than September.”
Even then, when the Legislature was hashing out the fine print about when the election would take place, county registrars brought their vendors to testify that they didn’t have enough paper stock to print ballots in time for an August recall election. The date was ultimately set for Sept. 14. 
How much will it cost?
The Legislature and the Department of Finance have yet to release official cost estimates for the statewide special election, but experts say that given inflation, the Nov. 4 special election will almost certainly surpass the recall’s price tag. 
During that 2021 effort, the state sent counties more than $240 million and an additional $35 million to the secretary of state’s office to administer the election. In the end, the contest cost less than planned — about $200 million in all, with the counties’ costs totaling just over $174 million. 
Newsom has repeatedly promised the state will cover the steep cost counties will incur to administer an unplanned statewide off-year election. Yet in the absence of official statewide numbers, county officials and even Assembly Republicans have released their own estimates. The GOP caucus’s budget analysis projected the statewide contest would cost taxpayers $235.5 million.

Page estimated Orange County’s costs will land somewhere between $11.2 million to $12.7 million depending on whether the ballot and county voter information guide will fit in the same envelope or need to be sent separately. Riverside County’s registrar projected upwards of $15 million in costs, and Fresno County was bracing for at least $4 million in unbudgeted expenses.
The counties have implored state leaders to provide them money up front rather than reimburse them after the election. 
“The additional expenses tied to a statewide special election would fall almost entirely on counties — imposing a significant and unfunded financial burden on already strained local budgets,” wrote the California State Association of Counties, which represents county supervisors, in partnership with its subsidiary organization that represents clerks and registrars. 
H.D. Palmer, spokesman for the Department of Finance, said that the legislation will provide the money to counties in advance, as it did in 2021 before the gubernatorial recall election, although the department has yet to determine the precise amount.. 
“The state of California is going to pay for it,” Newsom said at a press conference last week, dismissing concerns from county registrars about how they’d afford to administer the election as “deeply disingenuous.”
“There’s no price tag for democracy,” Newsom said.
The governor has also stated that unlike during the recall election, several counties already plan to hold local off-year elections and can add the redistricting question to the existing ballot. As of Monday, only 21 counties are listed as having elections scheduled for Nov. 4, according to the Secretary of State’s website. 
But Cervantes, who estimates his county will incur at least $700,000 in additional costs, emphasized that it makes a “massive difference” whether the state pays upfront or requires counties to submit expenses for reimbursement. His vendors won’t allow him to defer payment until he receives the state’s check in the mail.
Cervantes noted that counties pay for elections administration from the same pot of money that funds sheriff’s departments, county jails and the district attorney’s offices, as well as some local wildfire prevention efforts. That’s why it’s so important for the state to cover the costs, he argued.
“You’re talking about taking deputies off the street. You’re talking about reducing social services. Like, it’s a zero-sum game,” Cervantes said. “If I have to spend that money, then other departments won’t be able to.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/110524_Election-Fresno_LV_CM_15.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-19 08:56:32.581170

The first time I got on a plane was for a flight from Delhi, India to JFK Airport in New York. I came to the United States as a student, first to the University of Illinois, and after earning my master’s degree, to California, where I’ve lived ever since. I’ve built businesses, hired people and created a life here.
My story is the story of countless others who came to America to study, work and build. My roommate in graduate school, Arvind Krishna, is now the CEO of IBM. Millions of others have come to California and gone on to create lives and opportunities.
To be sure, international students aren’t the only — or biggest — immigrant community. Earlier this summer, I attended my niece’s graduation from UC San Diego and visited Chicano Park, where large murals adorn an outdoor cathedral to community activism, celebrating millions of immigrants whose labor and creativity built California.
That’s what makes today’s news so hard to watch. As the founder of a college counseling service, I have a front-row seat to a wave of recent federal policies reshaping education. 
Recently the Supreme Court let the U.S Department of Education lay off thousands of employees, causing delays in processing financial aid, slowing civil rights investigations and presenting challenges for communities.
That’s just the latest blow. There have been cuts to research funding, a wave of new visa hurdles and efforts to dismantle diversity and inclusion initiatives that help underrepresented students. And, of course, recent ICE raids have disrupted long-settled immigrant communities in cities like Los Angeles.
I’ve seen the ripple effects in my work. Some international students are afraid to apply to college, afraid to leave for a distant campus or afraid to come to the U.S. at all.
Many of the students I counsel are immigrants or the children of immigrants. One college-bound student’s mother is from Vietnam and worked in a nail salon in Oakland. The student, while still in high school, handled the family’s taxes, filled out forms and held down a job. 
She also earned a full scholarship. After she finishes her education, I’m confident she’ll make a remarkable contribution to the world.
One student, whose parents emigrated from India, went to UC Berkeley on a scholarship after developing an app to detect “forever chemicals” in their community’s water supply. Another student, whose parents came from Mexico to build a life in Southern California, is now in a nursing program at Cal State Fullerton. 
There are thousands of these stories across the state. Each young person holds the potential to shape our future, to become the next great leader, innovator or healer. 
International students not only bring skill and ambition — they bring real dollars to California.
The roughly 141,000 international students in California spent $6.4 billion in 2023, supporting 55,000 jobs, according to the NAFSA Association of International Educators. At public universities like UC and CSU, these students’ higher tuition helps fund financial aid and services for residents.
More broadly, immigrant households contribute $715 billion, or about a third of the state’s gross domestic product. Undocumented Californians alone pay about $8.5 billion a year in state and local taxes.
Much of the commentary about recent policy changes rightly focuses on the cruelty, but these measures harm all of us. 
California’s strength comes from its immigrant communities. Our leadership in science, technology, agriculture, and the arts depends on students, scholars, and workers from around the world.
To protestors fighting to preserve immigrant rights and opportunity, your fight is our fight. To those who think this doesn’t affect you, I promise it will. It touches your economy and your children’s future. And to leaders advancing these policies in Washington and elsewhere — stop before California and America lose the very strengths that built them.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/050625-TurnitinAICollege-JAH-CM-02.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-19 08:56:32.581170

California and 20 other states are suing the Trump administration over new, immigration-related conditions on grants for crime victims. 


Attorney General Rob Bonta on Monday filed California’s 39th lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging new immigration enforcement requirements it placed on federal funding for crime victims. 
States were set to receive more than $1.2 billion in federal crime victim funding this year, with California expected to claim $165 million. But last month, the U.S. Justice Department’s Office of Victims for Crime announced that states must agree to support and assist the Department of Homeland Security with federal immigration enforcement in order to access those funds. 
Some states view that condition as unworkable and the potential loss of funding could be the second significant hit this year from the Trump administration to California programs that support crime victims. Earlier this year, the U.S. Justice Department slashed grants for violence prevention and victim service programs that were initially valued at $811 million. In California alone, the department cut just over $80 million.
“Congress has never put civil immigration enforcement conditions on this funding because it has nothing to do with immigration. This is a brazen abuse of the president’s power,” Bonta said at a Monday press conference about the latest lawsuit.
California and 20 other states are suing the Trump administration over the potential cut in the U.S. District Court for Rhode Island. The states want the courts to prevent the Department of Justice from implementing the new rules. 
The contested funding for crime victims supports expenses such as emergency shelter, sexual assault medical support, compensation for lost wages and funeral expenses.
The lawsuit says the Trump administration is violating the U.S. Constitution by going around Congress on how a program it created should be funded. The lawsuit also alleges that the Trump administration violated the Administrative Procedure Act, a law that is the subject of most of the lawsuits California has filed against the White House. The act says that a federal agency needs to follow procedures and explain its rationale for changing a policy.
The states allege that the Department of Justice “arbitrarily relied on immigration-related factors that Congress did not authorize it to rely on in allocating federal grant monies to support victims.”
Rhode Island’s attorney general, Peter Neronha, said during the press conference that the Department of Justice’s new rules go against his values. He gave the example of a child who’s the victim of sexual assault being interviewed at a child advocacy center. “One question that should not be asked is whether that child is in this country lawfully or unlawfully,” he said.The crime act fund was signed by President Ronald Reagan in 1984. The law emerged after a report from Reagan’s 1982 Task Force on Victims of Crime said that the “neglect of crime victims is a national disgrace,” according to Monday’s lawsuit. Among the report’s recommendations was to “enact legislation to provide federal funding to assist state crime victim compensation programs.” 
In May, California filed two other lawsuits against the Trump administration for tying immigration enforcement to transportation and counter-terrorism funding, affecting billions of dollars in federal support.

Delaware Governor Matt Meyer has officially lifted the state’s drought watch, nearly 10 months after it was first declared in response to widespread dry conditions and below-average rainfall in 2024.
The decision follows a recommendation from the state’s Water Supply Coordinating Council (WSCC) and the Governor’s Drought Response Committee, which confirmed that water conditions—including precipitation, soil moisture, streamflow, and groundwater levels—have returned to normal for this time of year, especially in northern areas like New Castle County.

“Lifting the drought watch is welcome news after nearly a year of dry conditions, and I want to thank every Delawarean who did their part to conserve water,” Governor Meyer said in a statement. “While water conditions have improved, we should carry forward the lesson that water is one of our most precious natural resources, and it’s up to all of us to use it wisely.”
The drought watch was originally issued in late October 2024 by then-Governor John Carney, after a six-month stretch of lower-than-average precipitation left the state’s reservoirs depleted. The dry spell lingered well into 2025, with below-normal rainfall continuing through the first half of the year.
A turning point came in early summer when Delaware began experiencing frequent thunderstorms and sustained nightly rainfall. July brought 5.2 inches of rain—about an inch above the state’s seasonal average—helping recharge water systems statewide.
Secretary of Natural Resources and Environmental Control Greg Patterson, who chairs the WSCC, said conditions steadily improved with the increased rainfall. “While water conservation is always a good practice, we are finally out of the indicators of a possible drought,” he said.
The Department of Agriculture also welcomed the announcement, noting that recent rains arrived at a crucial time for Delaware’s farmers. “Recent rainfall events have helped recharge the soil and groundwater reserves we rely on for agriculture,” said Secretary Don Clifton. “That has put our farmers in a much better position as we head into the height of the growing season.”
During the drought watch, state agencies worked together to improve how Delaware monitors water conditions. The result was a new online platform—Delaware’s Drought Resources and Awareness website—which provides near real-time updates on rainfall, groundwater levels, and other drought-related data. The site also links to resources from the U.S. Drought Monitor and Delaware Geological Survey.
Officials emphasized that even with the drought watch lifted, water conservation remains important. Residents can learn more about responsible water use and drought preparedness by visiting de.gov/drought or the EPA’s WaterSense program.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/drought.jpg,,,2025-08-19 12:58:56.139882

Blake Moore, R-Utah, speaks during a forum hosted by the Sutherland Institute, a conservative think tank, at the University of Utah's Hinckley Institute of Politics in Salt Lake City on Aug. 18, 2025. (Katie McKellar/Utah News Dispatch)Rep. Blake Moore, R-Utah, on Monday repeatedly pushed back on criticisms that the “big, beautiful” law will benefit billionaires more than low- and middle-income earners — and he predicted fewer Americans will lose health care coverage than has been estimated. 
“There’s a lot out there, that … this is just tax breaks for the billionaires on the backs of the working class. And it’s fundamentally false,” Moore said during a forum hosted by the Sutherland Institute, a conservative think tank, at the University of Utah’s Hinckley Institute of Politics in Salt Lake City on Monday. “It’s a good line to be able to spew, but it’s not accurate.”
On cuts to Medicaid due to new work requirements and other provisions impacting the Affordable Care Act, Moore said criticisms are “overblown” and defended the moves by saying that Republicans want to “keep that culture of work associated with our social programs.” 
He also said estimates that more than 10 million Americans are at risk of losing health care coverage over the next 10 years are “faulty.” 
“I don’t think those numbers are going to be even close to that,” Moore said. 
He argued that “a very small portion of the population” falls into “able-bodied, no-dependent” demographics that are at risk of losing health care coverage due to the new federal work requirements. Even still, he said, “they can all work to become eligible.”


Moore — who is also a member of U.S. House GOP leadership as vice chair of the House Republican Conference — spent the majority of Monday’s hourlong forum defending Congress’ passage of the megalaw while also arguing that Republicans are confident the U.S. economy will grow faster than the Congressional Budget Office predicted when it estimated the bill would add a cumulative $4.1 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. 
The CBO assumed a 1.8% growth rate for those estimates, but Moore said Republicans in Washington, D.C. are confident the economy will see a growth rate closer to 2.6% annually. 
The CBO estimates are widely accepted as the most official projections of the megalaw’s impacts, and Moore said that’s “totally fair, but we think that those aren’t necessarily accurate” based on economic growth trends since 2017. 
According to a June 2026 post about the economic impact from the “big, beautiful” law, the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan, Washington-based policy group, wrote President Donald Trump’s administration has “claimed the combined policies would lead to much stronger economic growth of about 3 percent per year, versus 1.8 percent under the baseline, sufficient to offset the fiscal cost of the bill.”
“Economic forecasters do not see such a sustained economic boom on the horizon but instead expect an economic slowdown this year, due in part to the administration’s tariffs, and then a return to something like baseline growth thereafter,” wrote William McBride, chief economist at the Tax Foundation. “While the tariff proposals continue to evolve, our estimates indicate they would generally offset much of the economic and fiscal impacts of OBBB while they are in place.”
Moore says ‘big, beautiful’ law isn’t just for billionaires. Here’s what the numbers say
Critics of the megabill, including Democrats, have blasted it as a tax and spending package that will disproportionately benefit the rich while also cutting resources for the poor. 
Moore, pushing back on that criticism, focused on the tax cut provisions of the bill. He argued that billionaires can’t take advantage of the bill’s child tax credit or standard deduction benefits because those benefits are capped at certain income levels. 
“The vast majority of the provisions of this tax bill go to benefit middle- and low-income Americans, from the child tax credit to the standard deduction,” he said.

Taking the new law as a whole, however, CBO estimates also factor in other impacts from the bill, including cuts to Medicaid and and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. They concluded the bill, taken holistically, will shift resources away from the poor and toward middle- and higher-income earners.
In an Aug. 11 letter, CBO Director Phillip Swagel wrote that as a result of the megalaw, “U.S. households, on average, will see an increase in the resources available to them over the 2026-2034 period.” However, he added: “The changes in resources will not be evenly distributed among households.”
“The agency estimates that, in general, resources will decrease for households toward the bottom of the income distribution, whereas resources will increase for households in the middle and toward the top of the income distribution,” Swagel wrote. 
The CBO estimated resources (including federal taxes and cash transfers, federal and state in-kind transfers, state fiscal response, and other revenues including federal spending on defense, border security and infrastructure) will, on average, increase for Americans with higher incomes but decrease for low-income households. 
“Resources for households in the lowest decile (tenth) of the income distribution will decrease by about $1,200 per year (in 2025 dollars), on average,” the letter says, adding that amounts to 3.1% of their income.

That bracket includes Americans making about $24,000 a year or less. 
“Those projected decreases are mainly attributable to reductions in in-kind transfers, such as Medicaid and SNAP,” Swagel wrote. “After those decreases, households in the lowest decile will receive about $6,000 in transfers, net of federal taxes paid, each year of the projection period.”
Middle-income households, however, in the fifth and sixth deciles — or those making up to $85,660 and $107,911, respectively — “will see their resources increase by $800 (or 0.8 percent of projected income) and $1,200 (or 1.0 percent of projected income), respectively,” Swagel wrote. 
As for Americans in the highest decile, or those making more than $692,582 a year? 
“Resources will increase, on average, over the projection period by about $13,600 annually,” Swagel wrote, amounting to 2.7% of their projected income, mainly due to tax cuts. He also noted that after those resource increases, the federal taxes paid by those high-income households, net of transfers, will be about $190,000 a year. 
In a separate analysis, the Joint Committee on Taxation also estimated the effects of the tax provisions in the megalaw. That analysis shows that taxpayers making less than $15,000 will see a 9.3% increase in federal taxes in 2027, and by 2033, that increase will hit 56.1%. Those making $15,000 to $30,000, however, are slated to get a 21.5% tax cut in 2027, but by 2023, they will see a 4.6% increase. 
Other tax brackets, including those making $30,000 and up, will see tax cuts. As a matter of percentage, the biggest cumulative cut of 8.9% by the year 2033 will go to those making $50,000 to $60,000. 
While high-income earners will see the biggest returns in a total number of dollars, their tax cut as a percentage isn’t the highest. For example, those making $500,000 to $1 million will get a 7.9% tax reduction in 2033, while those making $1 million and up will see a 6% cut.

A message was sent to Tuberville on Monday seeking comment.

Advocates expressed their concerns with cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in the bill. Advocates also warned the bill would hurt those living in poverty throughout the state, particularly children, who rely on the programs.
The legislation allows subsidies to expire at the end of the year that were made available in President Joe Biden’s administration for people who purchase Affordable Care Act plans through the health care exchange market.
The budget reconciliation bill also reduces funding for the SNAP program by shifting a larger burden of the administrative cost to the state. It will also force the state to provide a greater share of the benefits. The legislation imposes a penalty if the error rate, the frequency that the state makes a mistake by providing food benefits to those who do not qualify, reaches 6%. The error rate for Alabama, one of the lowest in the country, is 7%.
“I don’t know anyone whose life got better because they lost access to health insurance,” said Tabitha Isner, vice chair of the Alabama Democratic Party, who attended the event. “Similarly, losing access to SNAP means losing access to food, having a tighter family budget and that is always going to negatively impact people. Often, we are talking about children who are losing their access to food.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20250818_123838-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-08-19 08:56:32.581170

(Photo provided by David Pascoe campaign)Longtime solicitor David Pascoe officially launched his bid for South Carolina attorney general Monday with a pledge to root out Statehouse corruption.
He’ll make his pitch from the Statehouse lobby Tuesday as part of his two-day campaign swing through the state.
As the First Circuit solicitor, Pascoe is the chief prosecutor for Calhoun, Dorchester and Orangeburg counties. He’s running to be the state’s top prosecutor in a race that is wide open for the first time in 16 years.
Republican Alan Wilson, first elected attorney general in 2010, is running for governor.
Elected as a Democrat for two decades, Pascoe switched to the Republican Party in April as he publicly mulled a bid for attorney general. This week’s announcement makes him the second candidate to officially enter the race to replace Wilson in 2026.
State Sen. Stephen Goldfinch, R-Murrells Inlet, was the first to get in the running last month. Other Republicans publicly considering a run include David Stumbo, the Eighth Circuit solicitor (for Abbeville, Greenwood, Laurens and Newberry counties), and attorney Henry McMaster Jr. The governor’s son told the SC Daily Gazette he’ll make a final decision later this fall.
When Pascoe switched parties, Democratic Party Chair Christale Spain accused him of doing so solely to help his chances for attorney general in a state ruled by Republicans. South Carolina hasn’t elected a Democrat as attorney general in 35 years. And no Democrat has won any statewide office since 2006.

But Pascoe, first elected solicitor in 2004, said the Democratic Party deserted him by taking positions opposite from his own.
In his campaign video, he paints himself as a tough-on-crime prosecutor who supports the death penalty.
“I’ve put monsters behind bars — murderers, wife beaters, child molesters, drug dealers, and illegal immigrants,” he said in the video.
Investigating corruption
Pascoe has built a reputation for prosecuting misbehaving politicians since 2014, when Wilson handed him an ethics investigation into the then-House speaker.
Against Wilson’s wishes, Pascoe expanded the case into the largest Statehouse corruption investigation since the FBI’s Operation Lost Trust — the 1990s case that resulted in the convictions of 17 legislators and seven lobbyists.
When Pascoe sought to broaden the probe, Wilson tried unsuccessfully to fire him, arguing Pascoe didn’t have the authority to open a state grand jury to investigate further.
The state Supreme Court sided with Pascoe in 2016, allowing his investigation to continue. But five years later, ruling on a former legislator’s appeal of his conviction, justices determined Pascoe had indeed overstepped his authority. Wilson then gave the case to another solicitor to complete the prosecution.
“If we’re going to clean up Columbia for good, I need the full authority to finish what I started,” Pascoe said in his campaign video.
The investigation ultimately brought down a GOP powerbroker and six Republican legislators. One went to prison for less than six months. Others resigned as part of plea deals, received probation and paid fines.
SC Legislature reaches compromise tweaking how it selects judges

Judicial reform
More recently, Pascoe has testified at the Statehouse and stood with solicitors of both parties to push for changes in how the state selects judges.
South Carolina is one of two states where nearly all judges are elected by legislators.
Pascoe pushed to remove legislators who are also lawyers from the panel that screens judicial candidates, arguing they have too much influence over the judges who later oversee their cases.
The compromise ultimately approved by the Legislature last year set term limits for members of the screening panel, rather than outright barring lawyer-legislators from participating.
The law also gave the governor appointees on the panel, instead of continuing to let legislative leaders make all the picks.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/CCC-DavidPascoe-Summerville-41-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-08-19 08:56:32.581170

Northern Russia; 3. Southwestern North America and Central America; 4. Middle East/North Africa/PanEurasia. (Map from ""Unprecedented continental drying, shrinking freshwater availability, and increasing land contributions to sea level rise,"" Science Advances, July, 2025.Nevada, the driest state in the union, is only getting drier as the region’s supply of groundwater quickly disappears. 
The American Southwest – including Arizona, New Mexico, and portions of Nevada, Colorado, Utah and California – is linked to one of four continental-scale “mega-drying” regions worldwide that have undergone unprecedented rates of drying, according to a recent study in Science Advances.
The loss of freshwater from the regions is the result of two key factors: severe droughts and groundwater overuse.
Two decades of satellite observations revealed that as the dry areas of the world become drier and surface water in rivers and lakes declines, communities are becoming more reliant on groundwater, leading to rapid depletion of freshwater. 
The lower Colorado River Basin – which supplies water for Nevada, Arizona, and California – has lost groundwater equivalent to Lake Mead’s full storage capacity in the last 20 years, or about 28 million acre-feet of water. An acre-foot of water is enough to supply roughly two urban households with indoor and outdoor water needs for a year.
“All the drying is happening in the Southwest. Three quarters of the country is getting a little bit wetter, but the southwestern quadrant of the country is getting a lot drier,” said Jay Fagmiglietti, the study co-author and Global Futures Professor at Arizona State’s School of Sustainability.
Even areas in the U.S. that are experiencing more precipitation are not keeping pace with the rate of rapid drying, leading to a net loss of freshwater, according to the study. The areas experiencing drying have increased, while the areas experiencing wetting have decreased.
Globally, drying land is expanding by about two times the size of California every year, according to the study. 
The four “mega drying” regions globally are Alaska and Northern Canada, Northern Russia, Middle-East North Africa, and Southwestern North America and Central America.
The research is especially revealing for Nevada, where about half the state’s countries rely on groundwater for more than 80% of their water supply, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. In 2015 Esmeralda, Eureka, Lincoln, Mineral and Nye counties received more than 95% of their water from groundwater.
Throughout several parts of Nevada, significantly more groundwater is extracted than is returned to aquifers each year, leading to declining water levels. About 20% of Nevada’s groundwater basins are currently over-pumped, according to the Nevada Division of Water Resources. 
Despite the state’s dependence on groundwater, Nevada lacks detailed data on available groundwater. Water managers in Nevada currently rely on water budget estimates developed 50 to 70 years ago, raising major concerns about the accuracy of groundwater availability, according to the Nevada state agency. 
The consequences of groundwater depletion in the Southwest include reduced irrigation water supply and threats to agricultural productivity, reduced capacity for climate adaptation, and damage to groundwater dependent ecosystems.
Most of Nevada’s rivers, streams, and lakes are groundwater dependent. Groundwater also plays a crucial role in supporting the state’s unique ecosystems. There are 242 wetland-dependent species recorded by Nevada Division of Natural Heritage – 143 of which can only be found in Nevada.
A growing awareness of ground water as a critical natural resource has raised several research questions: How much ground water do we have? Are we running out? Where are ground-water resources most stressed by human development? 
Fagmiglietti said the study was conceived to answer some of those questions and prepare water managers for a drier future.
About 75% of the world’s population lives in the 101 countries that make up the four mega-drying regions, according to the study.
Researchers used satellites to measure changes in gravity to detect weight loss or gain in regions, indicating groundwater depletion or prolonged drought.
The research team said global drying is not slowing down. Their data indicates groundwater was lost three times faster over the last decade than in the prior one.
The loss of groundwater is also contributing more to global sea level rise than melting glaciers and ice caps, according to the study. Increased runoff from groundwater pumping and glacier melting contributes to the ocean’s water levels, exacerbating sea level rise.
“Drying continents themselves are now contributing, they’re the largest contributor to sea level rise, ahead of either the Greenland or the Antarctic ice sheet,” Fagmiglietti said. 
“We pump groundwater for irrigation. And a lot of that, you know, doesn’t make it back into the ground. It evaporates, or it runs off and ultimately ends up in the ocean,” he said.
The study also points to a tipping point during the “mega El-Niño” years around 2014 to 2015 when equatorial waters in the Pacific were 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius above average. During that period climate extremes began to accelerate, leading to more groundwater usage to cover the lack of rainfall.
Fagmiglietti emphasized the critical importance of groundwater in drying regions and the need for better management and protection. Groundwater is often unprotected and unmonitored, Fagmiglietti said, making it at risk in many regions around the world. States need to recognize the importance of groundwater and enforce effective management policies.
“Communities that depend on groundwater entirely, again, need to understand that that groundwater is disappearing rapidly. They need to understand what their supply looks like and need to prioritize how they’re going to use it and try to sustain it,” he said. 
Last week, federal officials announced they would continue water allocation cuts on the Colorado River for the fifth consecutive year following a persistent drought that has shrunken Lake Mead, the river’s largest reservoir. Persistent drought like the one impacting the reservoir will only put more pressure on groundwater, said Fagmiglietti.
“No one ever talks about the groundwater, especially when it comes to the Colorado River. Discussion is always about the reservoirs and the river itself, but really thinking holistically about how much water you have in the region is really, really important, and in particular with the increased stress that will happen on groundwater,” Fagmiglietti said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Image-8-18-25-at-7.01 PM-e1755570504945-1024x568.jpeg,,,2025-08-19 08:56:32.581170
,California,2025-08-19 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,How will California’s congressional gerrymander attempt play out in the long run?,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/08/california-congressional-gerrymander-long-term/,"Newsom’s three-bill package is almost certain to pass, placing the gerrymander on a Nov. 4 special election ballot. Since no one can predict how all of this will turn out, the situation invites exploring potential scenarios.","Gov. Gavin Newsom and his fellow Democrats in the Legislature are steering California onto a unique political course with an unpredictable outcome.
By gerrymandering the state’s 52 congressional districts to produce at least five more Democratic members, they claim to be protecting democracy from President Donald Trump’s power grab. Trump is pressing Texas and other red states to rearrange their congressional districts to protect the paper-thin Republican congressional majority in next year’s elections.
“Wake up, America,” Newsom said Thursday at a Los Angeles rally launching the campaign for the redistricting effort. “Wake up to what Donald Trump is doing. Wake up to his assault. Wake up to the assault on institutions and knowledge and history. Wake up to his war on science, public health, his war against the American people.”.
Newsom’s three-bill package is almost certain to pass this week, placing the gerrymander on a Nov. 4 special election ballot. If approved by voters, the new maps would be in place for three election cycles but the state’s independent redistricting commission would redraw them again after the 2030 census — or at least Newsom promises it would.
Since no one can predict how all of this will turn out, the situation invites exploring potential scenarios.
For example, Newsom says California’s gerrymander would occur only if Texas does it first, but that’s not what Assembly Constitutional Amendment 8 actually says. The proposal would become operative, ACA 8 says, “only if Texas, Florida, or another state adopts a new congressional district map that takes effect after August 1, 2025, and before January 1, 2031, and such redistricting is not required by a federal court order.”
In other words, if the Texas or another red-state gerrymander does not occur for whatever reason, California’s could still be activated if any other state, including another blue state such as Illinois, also rearranges its districts. It’s a loophole big enough to drive a semi-truck through.
Let’s assume that the gerrymander is activated for the 2026, 2028 and 2030 election cycles, and gives Democrats at least 48 of the state’s 52 congressional seats. Would Democrats actually be willing to shift redistricting back to the independent commission after the 2030 census?
Due to relatively stagnant population growth, California is destined to lose as many as four seats after the census. Democrats who win gerrymandered districts in 2026 would be reluctant to give them up. There could be immense pressure to protect them by returning to redistricting via the Legislature, the system in place for many decades prior to creation of the commission process in 2008.
Were the House as closely divided in 2030 as it is now, Democrats also would have every reason to offset the shrinkage of California’s congressional delegation by once again minimizing Republican seats.
The precedent for such a bait-and-switch maneuver is what happened after voters agreed to raise state taxes 2012. Although the ballot measure said the new taxes would be temporary, another union-sponsored ballot measure four years later kept the higher income taxes in effect for an additional 12 years until 2030 and the same interests are planning to seek another extension.
Finally, although it appears certain that the package, which also includes Assembly Bill 604 to detail the new districts and Senate Bill 280 to call the special election, will gain legislative approval this week, voter endorsement is decidedly uncertain. Polling shows lukewarm support at best and Republicans will mount a well-financed drive for rejection, given that House control may be at stake.
Rejection would be a black eye for Newsom, who obviously sees the maneuver as improving his national political standing and probably his chances of becoming the Democratic candidate for president in 2028.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/081425_Redistricting-Rally_TS_CM_07.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-19 08:56:32.581170

Alabama officials are considering ways to spend the share of federal mental health funding meant ot partially offset Medicaid cuts passed by the Republican-controlled Congress this year. (Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)A new $50 billion rural health fund, part of the federal budget reconciliation law known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), could help soften the impacts of upcoming Medicaid budget cuts if used strategically, state officials said Friday at the Alabama Department of Mental Health (ADMH) board meeting.
The law, signed by President Donald Trump on July 4, includes a new “rural health transformation program” that provides $50 billion in grants for states over five years, from fiscal year 2026 through 2030. According to a brief from KFF, a national health policy research organization, the fund could partially offset just over a third (37%) of the estimated federal Medicaid spending cuts in rural areas, which are projected to be $137 billion over ten years.
David White, senior policy advisor to Gov. Kay Ivey and a representative for the governor at the meeting, said that with rural population continuing to decline, a focus for the grant should be on how rural communities can use consolidation and technology, such as telehealth, to provide efficient and quality care. The goal, he said, should be to invest in sustainable solutions that make rural health care more accessible in the long term, rather than simply delaying financial struggles with temporary funding.
“If you don’t invest in something to make yourself more viable down the road, why are we spending the money? You’re delaying doomsday, which is something but isn’t enough,” White said.

The fund is divided into two parts. Half ($25 billion) will be distributed equally among states that apply for the grant and are approved. The other half ($25 billion) will be distributed at the discretion of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) administrator, a post currently held by Dr. Mehmet Oz.
States are required to apply. Funds awarded must be used for at least three specific purposes from a list of options, including providing payments to health care providers; recruiting and retaining clinical workforce talent; assisting rural communities in right-sizing their health care delivery systems and supporting access to mental health and substance use disorder treatment.
The fund is temporary, while many of the broader cuts to health spending in the new law are not, raising concerns about long-term sustainability. The KFF brief states that “new legislation would be required to provide additional support to rural areas after the funds dry up.”
Kimberly Boswell, ADMH commissioner, after saying at the board meeting that the program outlines in the bill are “one of the more well-written sections of the bill, that is clear about what the expectations are,” said the temporary nature of the program is also a concern.
“The big concern to me … is just what happens after five years,” Boswell said.
The KFF brief notes that the law does not define “rural” and that non-rural areas could potentially receive funding. The law also does not require CMS to publish information about how the funds are distributed, although it could choose to do so.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/medicaidsign-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-08-19 08:56:32.581170

(Photo: Michael Lyle/Nevada Current)If people experiencing homelessness don’t have a place to go while recovering from an illness or after medical treatment, more often than not it will lead to wounds that never heal or them reentering a costly cycle of emergency room visits, said Arcelia Barajas, the Neighborhood Services Director with the City of Las Vegas.
That is if they receive medical treatment in the first place. 
The City of Las Vegas is expanding its Recuperative Care Center, located near downtown within the Corridor of Hope where homeless services are located, to offer medical respite care to unhoused people who are injured or dealing with an illness not deemed serious enough for a hospital stay.
“Folks being discharged from the hospital that have nowhere to go often have recurrences quickly because they aren’t able to recuperate,” Barajas said.  
If they get a new infection on an open wound, it would likely lead to “another trip back into the emergency room to get mended and released.” 
“Oftentimes it turns into a cycle where they have that continued intake into the hospital to get things addressed,” she said. At the care center “they are able to fully recover and prevent recurrence from happening.” 
City officials broke ground on the new facility Monday. 
When the Recuperative Care Center reopens later in 2026, it is expected to nearly double its current capacity with 76 beds and a second floor mental health unit. 
Las Vegas City Councilwoman Shondra Summers-Armstrong said on Monday the expanded center “fills a hole that exists in our social safety net.”
“Homelessness itself causes and exacerbates existing medical conditions and it makes adherence to treatment very difficult,” she said 
The center connects unhoused people to primary medical care and behavioral health that “decreases hospitalization utilization thus improving efficiency and reducing costs to our health care system,” Summers-Armstrong said.
State lawmakers passed legislation earlier this year that enables the city to seek a waiver form to expand Medicaid to pay for medical respite care for unhoused people. The waiver approval process usually takes two years, city officials said.
However, the tax and spending bill signed into law by President Donald Trump last month  makes major cuts to the social safety net, including Medicaid, starting in 2027.
Barajas wasn’t sure how the scope of those cuts would impact efforts to expand Medicaid to cover respite treatment. 
“We are waiting to see what the direction is from the state on the Medicaid side,” she said.
The city first began offering medical respite care in 2020 amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Using funds from the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, the city was able to expand to a 40-bed facility.
The city contracts with the federally qualified health center, Hope Christian Health Center, to operate services.  
City officials told state lawmakers earlier this year that the facility served 1,115 patients, with the majority referred by hospitals.
While the new building is being constructed, medical respite services are temporarily being offered at the Health and Wellness Center within the Homeless Courtyard Resource Center.
The center has only 19 beds and is typically at capacity, Barajas said. 
“What we are doing is working hard to get people into housing quickly once they are ready to be released so we can bring in new folks,” Barajas said. 
In addition to expanding capacity for medical respite care, the city wanted to build a new center to provide mental health services. Barajas said they still aren’t sure how many beds the mental health unit will have when completed.
Mayor Shelley Berkley said she “can’t imagine anything worse” for people who are unhoused than not having a place to heal after an illness. 
“We will do everything we can to ensure those who are unhoused and have medical issues have a place to recuperate,” she said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_0055-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-19 08:56:32.581170

(Photos by Parker Michels-Boyce and Mechelle Hankerson for the Virginia Mercury)Democrat Abigail Spanberger holds a 7-point lead over Republican Winsome Earle-Sears in the race for Virginia governor, according to a new Roanoke College Poll that shows the contest tightening since the spring.
The survey, released by the college’s Institute for Policy and Opinion Research Tuesday morning, found Spanberger supported by 46% of likely voters compared with 39% for Earle-Sears. Fourteen percent remain undecided, and 1% said they would back someone else. The numbers mark a closer race than in May, when Roanoke’s poll showed Spanberger ahead 43%-26%.
“Many Republicans seem to have ‘come home’ to Earle-Sears since the May poll, but Spanberger’s voters are slightly more enthusiastic about voting and more certain of their vote,” said Harry Wilson, interim director for the Institute for Policy and Opinion Research at Roanoke College.
The poll of 702 Virginia residents was conducted between Aug. 11 and Aug. 15 and has a margin of error of 4.30% among all respondents, or 4.39% among likely voters. Most registered voters reported being very likely (83%) or somewhat likely (12%) to cast a ballot in November.
The survey also tested the races for lieutenant governor and attorney general. 
Democrat Ghazala Hashmi, a state senator from Richmond, held a narrow lead over Republican John Reid, 38% to 35%, while Democrat Jay Jones edged Republican incumbent Attorney General Jason Miyares, 41% to 38%. 
“The races for lieutenant governor and attorney general are both within the poll’s margin of error, suggesting the election is far from over,” Wilson said. He noted that the poll was weighted to reflect the 2021 Virginia exit poll, “which was a good year for Republicans.”










As has been true for many years now, Republicans and Democrats appear to be living on different planets in terms of how they view politics, elected officials, and candidates.


– Harry Wilson, interim director for the Institute for Policy and Opinion Research, Roanoke College


Three out of four likely voters (76%) said they are very certain of their choice for governor, and 21% are somewhat certain. Half of likely voters described themselves as very enthusiastic about casting a ballot, while 34% were somewhat enthusiastic.
Inflation topped the list of campaign concerns, with 54% of likely voters naming it the most important issue. Crime followed at 11%, abortion at 7%, jobs at 6%, and gun control at 4%.
The poll showed a mixed picture of how Virginians view their leaders. Sixty percent of respondents said the country is on the wrong track, but 52% said the commonwealth is headed in the right direction — both more positive than Roanoke’s May survey.
President Donald Trump’s job approval rating improved to 41%, while Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s approval climbed to 50%, closer to his average throughout his term. Youngkin’s favorability stood at 50% favorable and 42% unfavorable, while Trump’s favorability rose by eight points but remained underwater at 41% favorable and 57% unfavorable.
Spanberger registered a 44% favorable and 38% unfavorable rating, slightly better than in May. Earle-Sears’s numbers also ticked up to 36% favorable and 43% unfavorable, with about 1 in 5 Virginians offering no opinion of either candidate.
The poll also asked Virginians about Trump’s performance on specific issues. His approval stood at 43% on the economy, 42% on foreign policy, and 43% on immigration — all close to his overall approval rating. 
A plurality of likely voters (45%) said Trump has done worse than they expected in his second term, while 28% said he exceeded expectations and 27% said he performed as expected.
Respondents favored Democrats on health care, education, Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, and the environment. Republicans held the edge on immigration, the national debt and deficit, and, to a smaller extent, inflation and taxes.
“With regard to President Trump, respondents appear to steadfastly like or dislike him, regardless of the issue,” Wilson said. 
“They differentiate, however, between the parties when it comes to handling specific issues. As has been true for many years now, Republicans and Democrats appear to be living on different planets in terms of how they view politics, elected officials, and candidates.”

When Delawareans need a break from the daily grind, many are turning to the peaceful trails and pastoral beauty of Brandywine Creek State Park.
According to a new survey conducted by A Mission for Michael, Brandywine Creek State Park in Wilmington has been named the most relaxing location in the state for nature therapy.
The survey, which gathered responses from over 3,000 residents, asked locals to name their favorite places to find solitude, calm, and connection with nature.
Brandywine topped the list, praised for its shaded walking paths, old stone walls, and tranquil river views. Despite being close to the city, the park offers a surprising sense of escape, with many respondents describing it as feeling “more Vermont than Delaware.”

Second on the list was Trap Pond State Park in Laurel, home to one of the northernmost bald cypress swamps in the U.S. Survey participants highlighted the quiet magic of early morning canoe trips, where mist rises off the mirror-like water and cypress knees protrude from the surface like fingers of an ancient forest.
Bombay Hook National Wildlife Refuge in Smyrna rounded out the top three, appreciated for its sweeping wetlands, birdwatching opportunities, and open skies.
The results reflect a growing trend toward nature-based stress relief.
With modern life often described as hectic and overwhelming, more people are finding that a walk in the woods—or a moment by still water—can offer much-needed calm.

Attorney General Matt Platkin is among the plaintiffs on lawsuits challenging Trump on everything from his executive order on birthright citizenship to funding conditions for transportation grants to data on food stamp recipients.
The newest lawsuit seeks to block a Trump administration move stripping more than $1 billion in federal aid from states that shield undocumented immigrants from detention and deportation. The funds are intended for victims and survivors of crime, to pay for medical and burial expenses, advocacy services, emergency shelters, and more.
Platkin, who has been criticized by New Jersey Republicans for his lawsuits against the Trump administration, said Monday the claims in the latest complaint against the White House show the administration doesn’t really care about the public safety of people who are victims and survivors of sexual violence, domestic violence, gun violence, sexual abuse, and more.
“They try to find political pawns to force states and cities to change their policies in ways that they can’t win through the political process,” he said.
The complaint, filed in federal court in Rhode Island, argues that the administration’s move to block funds approved as part of the Victims of Crime Act “runs headlong into two basic principles of American governance: separation of powers and federalism.”
The Victims of Crime Act was enacted in 1984 under President Ronald Reagan after a presidential task force concluded that the criminal justice system was wrongfully neglecting crime victims, according to the complaint.
California Attorney General Rob Bonta, who also joined Monday’s lawsuit, said the 1984 law was an effort to help states support survivors and witnesses of crime by providing resources to help those in need recover.
“These are individuals who’ve survived traumatic, tragic, dangerous circumstances and deserve every opportunity to move forward regardless of where they’re from,” Bonta said. “It builds trust between the community and law enforcement that’s vital to protecting our public safety, so that when someone does experience or witness a crime, they feel safe to report it to law enforcement without fear of deportation.”
Congress has mandated that victim assistance grants distributed pursuant to the law be based on fixed statutory formulas. Since 2020, New Jersey has received $29 million in these funds, the complaint says. Last year, the funds were used to support about 433,000 victims, it says.
“These are not just dollars. They are shelters, they are hotlines, they are funding for rape kits, they are funding for new locks on broken doors, and they are medical expenses,” Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings said.
The Trump administration has made it a priority to detain and deport millions of undocumented immigrants, and has threatened to withhold other federal grants to try to force states to withdraw any orders that provide sanctuary to undocumented immigrants. New Jersey’s Immigrant Trust Directive, unveiled in 2018, restricts cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration agents.

Making work is stimulating and filled with wonder. I wish this for others.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  John R. Killacky: We need to support artists in Vermont.","This commentary is by John R. Killacky, of South Burlington. He was the previous executive director of Flynn Center for the Performing Arts and he is a former state representative and the author of “because art: commentary, critique, & conversation.”


In 1973, I left Chicago on a one-way ticket to New York to pursue my dream of becoming a dancer. Part-time jobs and unemployment subsidized my performing career. In between tours, I finished my college degree in psychology. 
After I stopped performing, I managed two dance companies in New York, worked at contemporary art centers in Minneapolis and San Francisco with stints in philanthropy and ran the Flynn Center in Burlington. After retiring from the Flynn in 2018, I served two terms in the Vermont House of Representatives. As I moved through the world, I was blessed to have my husband willing to relocate. 
All the while, I never stopped writing personal essays and making films. Complications from a spinal surgery left me paraplegic nearly three decades ago — and yet, my art background served me. While kinesthetic connections in my legs were lost, I learned how to walk again in front of mirrors, just like I did in dance class.
Now retired from day jobs, what a joy it is to wake up every morning and imagine, “What can I make today?” 
I finished my 21st short film and have a print on view at T.W. Wood Gallery in Montpelier with an installation opening next month at Burlington City Arts Gallery. Videos of mine were broadcast this summer on Vermont Public and Maine Public. While tremendously validating, there is little financial reward. Even with grants, commissions, royalties, publishing and broadcast fees, breaking even remains aspirational.
Last year, Vermont Arts Council awarded creation grants of up to $5,000 to 22 artists, which cover a portion of their estimated expenses. Winners are only eligible to apply again after a five-year waiting period. So, few can realistically pursue an artistic career full-time locally. 
National opportunities are ever slimmer. Federal arts and humanities grants that had already been awarded were clawed back and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting just announced it will be closing after losing its funding. Art-making in America remains avocational.

In our fractious times, further capitalizing the arts seems prudent as culture demonstrably builds community and creativity sparks innovation — necessary components for a path forward. Science, technology, engineering and mathematics, or STEM, curriculum is enhanced when you add the ‘a’ for art to provide STEAM problem-solving in our schools. 
Making work is stimulating and filled with wonder. I wish this for others.
Artists are often among the first responders in political protests with potent iconography. The Civil Rights, Queer Liberation, Reproductive Freedom for All and Black Lives Matter movements are pertinent examples featured in the multidisciplinary exhibition, “It often rhymes” at The Current in Stowe. 
These kinds of voices are essential to democracy. In our current Trumpian apocalypse, clarion dissenters are even more necessary, along with soothsayers offering hope.
Artifacts from every epoch are indicators of the vibrancy of that society. It is the disruptors that are often remembered. In art (as in politics), change happens from the fringe. What will our legacies be? For an emboldened and transformed future, invest more deeply in artists. They begin, and begin again.

Santiago/Getty Images)Private equity shops have earned outsize returns on investments in health care, telecommunications and housing — with mixed results for consumers. 
Now, they may be running the same playbook on the once-sleepy utility business, with BlackRock’s proposed takeover of the parent company of Duluth-based Minnesota Power as a key test case. Public filings in the hotly contested matter show ratepayer advocates, labor unions, environmental groups and major customers of Minnesota Power on different sides of the issue. 
At the heart of the matter is a simple question: Is it a good or bad thing for the world’s largest asset manager to have a controlling stake in a regional utility?
A private equity buyout of the electric utility serving large swathes of northern Minnesota could weaken its finances and jeopardize its compliance with Minnesota’s carbon-free power standard — while raising rates and reducing reliability for more than 150,000 customers, administrative law judge Megan J. McKenzie said on July 15. McKenzie’s lengthy report called on the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission — or the PUC — to reject the proposed deal.
Private equity giant BlackRock, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Minnesota Power’s parent company clapped back on Aug. 4 in a detailed rebuttal. They called the judge’s nonbinding report “not an accurate or balanced summary or analysis of the record” and said it “does not even attempt to provide a meaningful discussion of the evidence, arguments, and counterarguments.” 
The dueling filings represent the latest volleys in a bitterly contested proceeding before the PUC. The saga dates back to last May, when the Canadian pension group and an infrastructure investment firm then in the process of merging with BlackRock announced an agreement to buy Allete, a publicly traded company that owns Minnesota Power, a smaller Wisconsin utility and other energy assets. The commission has veto power over public utility mergers in Minnesota.
If the proposed deal closes, BlackRock-controlled Global Infrastructure Partners would own 60% of Allete and the pension board 40%, the Minnesota Department of Commerce said in a filing last August.
“The private equity industry has cultivated a reputation for being a very extractive actor in the marketplace,” said Karlee Weinmann, research and communications manager for the Energy and Policy Institute, a utility watchdog that is not directly involved in the proceeding.
“We know that the playbook is to quote-unquote streamline these companies…so this is a fearsome prospect for workers and consumers,” Weinmann added.
Advocates: Deep pockets allow for energy transition
Labor unions, clean energy groups and Allete argue that deep-pocketed owners enable rather than curtail the massive investments in new energy generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure Minnesota Power needs to meet a state mandate to produce 100% of its electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040.
“This transaction will not impact our ability to meet Minnesota’s carbon-free goals. On the contrary, this is why the acquisition is needed,” Minnesota Power spokesperson Amy Rutledge said in an email. “Advancing the clean-energy future requires significant investment and the long-term, experienced investors we have chosen as partners will give us the access to capital needed for this energy transition.”
St. Paul-based nonprofit Fresh Energy agreed in an Aug. 4 filing and an Aug. 6 blog post, saying in the latter that the merger “would significantly mitigate risk to the transition to clean energy in Minnesota — an outcome that is in direct alignment with Fresh Energy’s mission.”  
In the Aug. 6 post, Fresh Energy said risks to Minnesota Power’s transition have increased since January as congressional Republicans and the Trump administration unwound federal support for renewable energy and slapped tariffs on imported cars, energy equipment, raw materials and more. Trump’s tariffs disproportionately impacted the utility’s base of large industrial customers, including two taconite mines idled this year, Fresh Energy said.
Allete’s latest earnings report showed electricity sales to taconite customers fell to 28% of total sales in the second quarter of 2025, from 35% a year earlier.
Telling regulators one thing, investors another
The company’s insistence that it needs private capital partners to finance its transition plan clashes with recent statements to federal securities regulators that it can get adequate funding from public markets, said Brian Edstrom, senior regulatory advocate for the Citizens Utility Board of Minnesota. 
CUB Minnesota opposes the deal as an official participant in the PUC proceedings.
“What irks me is when (utilities) tell the commission one thing and investors another…that’s exactly what happened here,” Edstrom said.
Allete rejected two previous buyout offers from GIP and its Canadian partner before accepting a third, higher offer, Edstrom noted. That means the new owners “will essentially start in the red and they’ll have to make up that premium before they start earning a return,” he said.
Weinmann said confidential or redacted PUC filings obscure critical information about how the new owners plan to do that. But in general, “utilities make money when they build things and customers subsidize those costs,” she said.
Public utility commissions set customers’ rates based on utilities’ operating expenses plus a fair rate of return on investment, or profit margin. Though the tightly regulated system keeps customer costs in check, critics say it encourages utilities to spend more on capital projects.

The coming AI cash wave
Edstrom said the massive energy needs of artificial intelligence data centers represent a generational opportunity for well-capitalized infrastructure investors like BlackRock. Data centers’ share of U.S. electricity consumption could nearly triple between 2023 and 2028, the U.S. Department of Energy said in December in one of its final reports of the Biden era.
The AI-energy opportunity may be even greater in states with ambitious clean energy goals that require replacing fossil-fueled power plants with carbon-free generation and building new batteries, substations and transmission lines to serve them, Edstrom said. 
Earlier this year, private equity firm Blackstone — no relation to BlackRock — said it would buy the largest investor-owned utility in New Mexico, where Blackstone already has big infrastructure investment plans and which requires all utilities to be carbon-free by 2050. That utility’s parent company, TXNM Power, also serves parts of Texas, a fast-growing data center market.
“It’s no secret that Blackrock (and) GIP see a big opportunity in investing in the confluence of AI and data centers and energy because they all require each other and require a lot of money,” Edstrom said.
BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said as much in a CNBC interview last month.
“Infrastructure is just at the beginning of a golden age,” he said, moving his hand up and to the right. Fink’s interviewer called the Global Infrastructure Partners acquisition “a hell of a (well) timed deal” and remarked later in the conversation that investments in digitization, power grids and decarbonization “all go together.” 
Minnesota has recently attracted a flurry of large-scale data center proposals amid power grid congestion in bigger IT markets like northern Virginia. 
Data centers proposed in Xcel and Great River Energy territory as of January would, if built, consume about 2.3 million homes’ worth of power. A secretive LLC’s proposal for a “light industrial” development on 210 acres in Hermantown — an area served by Minnesota Power — “carries some hallmarks of a data center,” the Star Tribune reported in May. 
An IT facility that large could consume several hundred megawatts of power at full capacity, potentially offsetting a longer-term decline in electricity demand from the taconite industry. Minnesota Power’s peak load is about 1,625 megawatts.
Risk to ratepayers: overbuilding
It’s fine to build new infrastructure to serve big power loads, Edstrom said, but “where it gets tricky is where (private equity owners) start putting pressure on the utility to invest in more than is truly necessary” by overbuilding new assets or by spending more to build their own generation than they would to purchase power from independent power plant owners or other utilities.
Douglas Jester, a Michigan-based energy analyst and expert witness who testified in the Allete merger proceeding on behalf of CUB Minnesota, said in an interview that private equity buyers may see smaller utilities as ripe for higher returns.
Jester was a close observer of and expert witness in proceedings involving Upper Peninsula Power Company, a small Michigan utility that has passed between two private owners since the early 2010s. 
UPPCO’s first private owner, Balfour Beatty Infrastructure Partners, petitioned Michigan regulators for a rate increase soon after the transaction closed, citing unexpectedly high pension costs, increased staffing needs and the fact that “it was now a small, higher-risk, utility,” Jester told the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission.
“UPPCO’s original statement that there would not be rate increases as result of the transaction was not (true),” Jester told the Reformer. The under-examined pension issue, in particular, “added up to a significant addition to rates…and those things take a long time to fade.”
Jester said UPPCO has also asked Michigan regulators to approve rate increases related to system investments under its second owner, Axium Infrastructure. Those proceedings have been typical of the push and pull between utilities, regulators and other stakeholders.
“Like all utilities, they always ask for increased return on equity and we always argue against it,” he said.
But in Jester’s view, the Axium-controlled UPPCO is ahead of schedule in complying with a state carbon-free power mandate similar to Minnesota’s and does not appear to be overspending to justify its returns.
“There are issues with private equity ownership of any utility, but new (UPPCO) leadership is very responsive to public policy,” he said. 
Jester said the divergence shows how important it is for state regulators to scrutinize proposed utility mergers.
A July 11 settlement between the Minnesota Department of Commerce and Minnesota Power could help move the BlackRock-Allete deal forward. Reversing its prior opposition to the deal, the department said the agreement would allow the merger to proceed “in a way that protects the public interest.”
The settlement rebutted some concerns McKenzie would raise four days later. 
It delivers “immediate ratepayer benefits” by prohibiting Minnesota Power from requesting a rate increase until next November and reducing its authorized return on equity from 9.78% to 9.65%. 
It shores up the utility’s energy transition plan by requiring buyers to provide “sufficient equity capital” to finance nearly $5 billion in planned infrastructure investments while contributing $50 million to develop cutting-edge “clean firm” technologies like long-duration batteries. 
And it would impose “significant financial penalties” for any decline in service quality while strengthening corporate governance and worker protections, the department said.
In a subsequent announcement, Allete reiterated that following the transaction, it “will remain locally managed and operated in Duluth and will continue to be regulated by the PUC, ensuring local oversight and control of rates and energy planning.”
It’s unclear when the PUC will hold a final vote on the merger, which federal energy regulators have already approved. If it does get the green light, Jester said it will set up an important test case for private utility investors looking to follow in BlackRock’s footsteps — one he’s not sure will pan out as anticipated.
“I see quite a bit of pressure on regulators to recognize that over the last 20 years or so, utilities have been receiving authorized returns on equity that are materially higher than in competitive sectors with otherwise comparable risks,” he said. If regulators crack down on those elevated rates of return, he added, “that’s not an environment where I would expect private equity to thrive.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2165923397.jpg,,,2025-08-19 07:57:03.971241

(Niki Kelly/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Testimony on Monday set the stage for an interim committee to find a balance between growing medical debt weighing down Hoosiers and allowing hospitals and other health care providers to collect what’s owed.
Organizations representing Hoosier consumers, as well as those handling collections, came to the Indiana Statehouse to have their say before the Interim Study Committee on Courts and the Judiciary.
The group of legislators, the chief justice and several lay members used Senate Bill 317 as a general guide for discussion, which narrowly died earlier this year. It would have limited some medical liens on a primary residence and wage garnishment.
Sam Snideman, of the United Way of Central Indiana, said Indiana is 11th highest in the country for residents with medical debt in collections.
“We need coordinated solutions that address the high costs of health care and patients’ ability to pay, while also protecting patients who do have medical debt from burdens like adverse credit events, wage garnishment and liens that make it challenging for them to break out of the cycle of financial instability,” he said.
Erin Macey, director of the Indiana Community Action Poverty Institute, said both the insured and uninsured grapple with medical bills they can’t afford.
She said Indiana law protects about $217 a week from wage garnishment, which hasn’t been increased since 2009. Since then, though, costs for rent, food and car payments have risen steeply.
“This isn’t just dollars and cents. It’s human impact,” Macey said. “Improving our exemption laws will help the unfortunate many who are taken to court over medical debt keep their heads above water while they’re paying off their bills.”

But several Hoosiers pushed back, noting many protections already exist in state and federal law for consumers.
Joseph Walterman, an attorney from Greenwood, said limiting garnishments and liens could impact local governments, which pay for ambulance services in many communities. And he said changes could hurt rural areas with few providers.
“There is no question that medical debt is an issue,” he said. “The issue though also is if the bill were passed as proposed, you are demanding that certain facilities give treatment without the real prospects of payment.”
Walterman agrees with attempts to push more Hoosiers to payment plans, but said if you take away the enforcement mechanism at the end, then payment plans won’t work.
Heather Gilb, a debt collector from New Castle, said Hoosiers have 240 days to apply for assistance, set up payment plans or pay off the bill. And medical debt doesn’t hit a person’s credit rating until at least one year after date of service.
Also, medical debt under $500 is not reported to credit agencies at all.
She said in three decades, she has never seen someone lose their home over medical debt.
“Most respectfully, the narrative of families being put out of their homes for hospital bills is simply not reality,” Gilb said.
She stressed that the existing process is deliberate and filled with safeguards, and litigation is the exception to the rule.
“At some point personal responsibility must come into play,” Gilb said. “Consumers have to open the letters, they have to answer the calls, they have to fill out the applications, they need to engage in the process. When individuals ignore repeated outreach, decline to apply for available assistance or refuse reasonable payment plans — even when they have the ability to pay — it forces providers and agencies to consider litigation as a last resort.”
The committee will meet again Sept. 9. They can issue recommendations for the 2026 session, or they can simply disseminate information gathered during the meetings to the full General Assembly.

More than 1,000 National Guard soldiers from multiple states have been directed to the nation’s capital since Trump declared a “crime emergency” there, despite its violent crime rate reaching a 30-year low.
“We are a nation of law and order. Our capital is a reflection of our nation’s respect, beauty, and standards,” Landry wrote Monday in a social media post. “We cannot allow our cities to be overcome by violence and lawlessness. I am proud to support this mission to return safety and sanity to Washington DC and cities all across our country, including right here in Louisiana.”
The governor did not indicate how long Louisiana’s guard members will be deployed. The part-time soldiers typically hold separate full-time jobs they must leave behind when on assignment.

Mike DeWine will send 150 members his state’s National Guard; South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster approved 200 members; and West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey will send up to 400 National Guard members.
In addition to deploying the National Guard to Washington, Trump has leaned on the district’s Home Rule Act to have the 3,400-person Metropolitan Police Force assist in immigration enforcement.

July 31, 2025 | Photo By Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceThe constitutional amendment to implement a new tax on wealthy Michiganders is still aiming for the 2026 ballot after facing some initial setbacks and new attacks, with its signature collection driving kicking off on Friday.
Members of Invest in MI Kids said it started collecting signatures last week using the 100-word summary that was approved June 27 by the Michigan Board of State Canvassers. That has opened up further complications for the effort, as the board on July 10 walked back the approval for the previous 100-word summary and then deadlocked on a revised summary at their July 31 meeting.
Initiative officials said Friday that the effort which resulted in the board deadlocking was just one part of well-funded right-wing attacks against the proposal, which is estimated to generate nearly $1 billion annually.
But those attacks keep coming. The Coalition to Stop the Business and Family Tax Hike, an organization opposed to the Invest in MI Kids initiative, issued a cease and desist motion to prevent the group from collecting its signatures.
Jase Bolger, CEO of West Michigan Policy Forum and a former Republican Michigan House speaker, said in a statement that the amendment would hurt small businesses – even though the initiative was aimed at the wealthiest Michiganders.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“I applaud the move today by the Coalition to Stop the Business and Family Tax Hike,” Bolger said. “They filed a cease and desist motion to stop the signature gathering for an unapproved ballot initiative. Because, the proponents of this devastating proposal are using language that is misleading. Voters should not be fooled.”
In response, Imani Foster, a spokesperson for the Invest MI Kids initiative, told Michigan Advance that the coalition is focused on the task at hand.
“While we’re busy engaging Michiganders, together with our thousands of volunteers, we won’t be distracted by meaningless letters from big money Washington lawyers,” Foster said.
The group also noted its belief that the board had no authority under Michigan law to rescind its prior approval of the petition summary language.

But Democratic critics and data experts warn it could allow the federal government to vacuum up vast quantities of information on Americans for unclear purposes.
Some Democratic election officials and opponents of the effort fear President Donald Trump wants to build a federal database of voters to target political opponents or cherry-pick rare examples of noncitizen voters to fuel a sense of crisis. Republican election officials allied with the president counter that he’s helping states to maintain accurate voter rolls.
The Trump administration has rolled out changes to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, tool at the same time the U.S. Department of Justice is asking states for copies of their voter rolls. The timing, combined with questions about what happens to voter data uploaded to the program, has alarmed critics.
Trump wants Congress to pass a national proof of citizenship voter registration requirement and in March tried to unilaterally impose one for federal elections through executive order. But with the legislation stalled and the order halted by the courts, the citizenship data tool may offer a backdoor way to accomplish the same goal.
SAVE was originally intended to help state and local officials verify the immigration status of individual noncitizens seeking government benefits. But U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, this spring refashioned it into a platform that can scan states’ voter rolls if election officials upload the data.
The changes to SAVE, rolled out over just a few months and with little public debate, are “tinkering with sort of the bones of democracy,” said John Davisson, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington, D.C.-based research and advocacy group that argues privacy is a fundamental right.
“You’re talking about the voting process and who will be eligible to vote,” Davisson said. “And to take a system that is not designed for use in that process and repurpose it, really on the fly, without a formal comment process, without formal rulemaking, without congressional intervention — that’s pretty anomalous and pretty alarming.”
Previously, SAVE could only search one name at a time. Now it can conduct bulk searches, allowing state officials to potentially feed into it information on millions of registered voters. SAVE checks that information against a series of federal databases and reports back whether it can verify someone’s immigration status.
Since May, it also can draw upon Social Security data, transforming the program into a tool that can confirm citizenship because Social Security records for many, but not all, Americans include the information. NPR reported earlier on changes to SAVE.
“It is incredible what has been done, really since March,” Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray, a Republican who supports proof of citizenship requirements and the SAVE tool, told a gathering of state secretaries of state in Biloxi, Mississippi, last week.
Individuals registering to vote in federal elections must already sign a statement affirming they are citizens under penalty of perjury, and those who cast a ballot face criminal penalties and deportation. One study of the 2016 election placed the prevalence of noncitizen voting at 0.0001% of votes cast.
But as Trump has spread falsehoods about elections, Republicans have made purging noncitizens from voter rolls a central focus.

Democratic concerns were on display last week at the National Association of Secretaries of State conference, held at the Beau Rivage casino-resort in Biloxi. In interviews on the sidelines of the conference, Democratic secretaries of state voiced deep reservations — or outright opposition — about plugging their voter data into SAVE.
Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said Aug. 6 that the federal government appeared to be trying to take over election administration. She formally rejected the Justice Department’s voter roll request two days later.
Bellows said the Department of Homeland Security told her in a recent phone call that it planned to retain SAVE data for 10 years for “audit purposes only.”
“Just like the [Justice Department] is asking us to hand over an electronic file of all the voters in our state, it seems like the Department of Homeland Security is through this backdoor system also asking us to share voter information about every voter in our state,” Bellows said.
At least one state appears to have granted the federal government sweeping authority over any voter data it provides to SAVE.
Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales announced in July he had reached an agreement with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to access the newly expanded system for voter list maintenance. Indiana’s agreement allows the federal agency to use information the state provides for any purpose permitted by law, including criminal prosecutions.
Morales, a Republican, said in a news release that SAVE represented “another step in safeguarding the rights” of eligible voters. His office didn’t respond to Stateline’s questions.
The Trump administration has ramped up efforts to encourage state election officials to use the expanded program. The White House hosted a bipartisan “fly in” event for state secretaries of state on July 29. Multiple secretaries of state told Stateline that USCIS Director Joseph Edlow, who was confirmed on July 15, spoke at the event.
“The president is very much keyed in on voter list maintenance,” Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, a Republican, said in an interview — echoing other GOP secretaries of state who released statements praising the Trump administration after the meeting.










When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances.


– Minnesota Democratic Secretary of State Steve Simon


Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, a Democrat who attended the meeting, said he questioned how the federal government would handle voter information provided to SAVE. He added that the Justice Department’s request for his state’s voter rolls raised his level of concern about how data would be used.
“When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances,” Simon told Stateline.
The White House referred questions about SAVE and the event to the Department of Homeland Security and USCIS.
In response to questions from Stateline, USCIS didn’t directly answer whether the agency would share voter roll data with other parts of the federal government but confirmed it disposes of records after 10 years.
“The SAVE application is a critical tool for state and local governments to access information to safeguard the integrity of elections across the country. It’s no wonder many states have quickly adopted it, and we continue to promote the tool to other states and counties not using SAVE,” USCIS spokesperson Matthew Tragesser said in a statement.
“We look forward to continued optimization efforts and implementing more updates to SAVE.”
GOP pressure
Some Republican election officials and Trump allies have long wanted the federal government to take an expanded role in searching state voter rolls for noncitizens.
Last summer the Trump-aligned litigation group America First Legal, co-founded by Trump adviser Stephen Miller, encouraged states to submit to the Department of Homeland Security the names of individuals for citizenship or immigration status verification.
Some states did just that. Texas, for example, asked USCIS to verify the citizenship of some voters in September, and Indiana asked the agency to verify 585,774 voters in October. The same month, 16 Republican state attorneys general signed a letter criticizing Homeland Security, then under the Biden administration, for failing to work with states on verification.
After Trump took office, GOP state officials kept up the pressure. Twenty-one Republican secretaries of state urged Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in February to prioritize SAVE improvements.
On April 16, Indiana sued the department in federal court for not responding to its verification request last fall. USCIS announced an overhaul of SAVE less than a week later.
As the agency continues to remake SAVE, the tool will soon allow searches using the last four digits of a Social Security number, multiple state secretaries of state told Stateline. The agency confirmed the feature is under development and will be available soon but didn’t provide an exact date.
The change would mark another significant expansion of the program because most states collect the last four digits when individuals without a driver’s license register to vote.
Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican, said SAVE represents a better way to verify citizenship than a state law requiring voters to produce documents. “I think there’s a real opportunity for us to do a lot of this through just sharing of information and I think that’s what we’re seeing happen,” McGrane said in an interview.
Unreliable data?
But some voting rights advocates and experts on government data caution against an overreliance on Social Security data.
The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, a progressive policy nonprofit, has noted that Social Security only began tracking the citizenship status of all applicants in 1978 — meaning the database doesn’t include comprehensive citizenship information for older Americans. Additionally, Social Security may not always have up-to-date information on the status of naturalized U.S. citizens.
The nonpartisan Institute for Responsive Government also warned in May that since SAVE hasn’t used Social Security numbers to verify citizenship in the past, its accuracy and effectiveness are unknown. The success of the expanded SAVE program may also partially depend on whether it has adequate staff and resources, it said.
A 2017 Government Accountability Office report found that between fiscal years 2012 and 2016, about 16% of the nearly 90 million SAVE searches required additional verification, which the institute says often translates into federal workers manually checking files. Now that SAVE allows bulk searches, the need for manual checking could rise dramatically.
Nick Doctor, director of implementation at the Institute for Responsive Government, said in an interview that a tool confirming the eligibility of registered voters in a way that doesn’t burden individuals can be a good thing. But he emphasized that it depends in large measure on SAVE’s implementation.
“The changes that have been made to SAVE happened very quickly and, to my knowledge, we haven’t seen releases on the level of accuracy of that information,” Doctor said.
During interviews, Republican secretaries of state stressed that voters aren’t kicked off the rolls because SAVE can’t verify their citizenship. Instead, an inability to verify would likely trigger a follow-up process with the voter.
“Just because we get something back from the SAVE database, it’s not a cut and dry, especially on those they’re not sure about,” Hoskins, the Missouri secretary of state, said.
Still, Arizona illustrates why some Democrats worry about any large-scale effort to ask voters — especially longtime, older residents — to prove their citizenship. After the state discovered errors in how it tracked voter citizenship dating back years, election officials are contacting some 200,000 voters seeking proof of citizenship documentation.
Some have been casting ballots for decades without incident and many feel targeted, Arizona Democratic Secretary of State Adrian Fontes said during a presentation at the state secretaries of state conference. “They feel insulted when they get that letter,” Fontes said.
Charles Stewart III, a professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies elections, said Arizona may actually point to the potential usefulness of SAVE. If Arizona runs its voter roll through the program, a list of 200,000 voters needing citizenship verification would perhaps drop into the hundreds, he suggested.
“There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside,” Stewart said.
Connecticut Democratic Secretary of State Stephanie Thomas told Stateline that every secretary wants tools to keep voter lists as clean as possible. But the details are important.
When she hears of something new, Thomas said she asks whether it’s the best option available and whether “the i’s are dotted, the t’s crossed.” She said she’s asked USCIS a series of questions about SAVE and is waiting on some responses.
“When it comes to voter lists,” Thomas said, “I don’t want Connecticut voters to be a guinea pig.”

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma City)OKLAHOMA CITY — A once neglected stretch of roadway in the heart of Oklahoma City is in the midst of a new renaissance thanks to a unique public-private partnership that has helped revitalize the area.
Once a blighted part of town located along Northwest 16th Street, the Plaza District has become known for its public art, locally owned businesses and events that draw thousands of visitors each year.
Supporters say the district’s transformation is part of a larger scale shift in Oklahoma City, which has been jumpstarted by Oklahoma City’s Commercial District Revitalization Program. Through a city sales tax, general funds are allocated each year by the council to promote revitalization across the city, said Donna Cervantes, a planner for the program.
The Plaza District, which is one of more than a dozen Oklahoma City areas participating, was one of the first to receive funding. It initially received a $40,000 investment.
While the district’s share of funding from the city has dropped to about $18,000 amid an increase in participating neighborhoods, Cervantes said the Plaza District now has other ways of receiving support through sponsorships and grants. The Commercial District Revitalization Program aims to give its participating communities a starting point and lead them toward other sources of funding.
Cervantes said a lot of the districts, including the Plaza, use their funds to hold public events, keep sidewalks clean, add vegetation, and pay their staff.
“The whole goal is economic development,” she said.

Randy Marks, program planner for the Oklahoma City Office of Arts and Cultural Affairs, said he spent most of his life in central Oklahoma. In the 1970s and 1980s, Oklahoma’s poor quality of life deterred businesses, he said.
In the years since the neighborhood received its first investment from the city, thousands of people have flocked to the Plaza District, bringing with them internationally known artists, further raising the area’s profile. In all, the Plaza District’s website says over $17 million has been invested into the area.
“Having great art and engaging festivals means more people want to come and enjoy the district,” Marks said. “It’s a major cultural event for the city and money follows.”
Cayla Lewis, associate planner for the Commercial District Revitalization Program and former executive director of the Plaza District, said in 2017 the district had a budget of about $160,000, which was generated from a number of different sources.
Rachael Crawford, the district’s current executive director, said the area is now known for its public art, local businesses and its events that are funded through partnerships and donations.
Crawford, who has led the organization for over three years, said event costs can range from $500 to $30,000 and corporate partnerships have been critical to keeping the momentum going.
One of the district’s keystone annual events, Plaza Fest, highlights local food and drink along with artists and musicians. It has connected thousands of visitors with local businesses, she said.
The Plaza Walls Festival, a celebration of street mural art, has brought international attention to the area. While Plaza Walls, the private organization behind the festival, does not receive direct city funding, it secures financial support through donors, gallery sales, and festival application fees.
Amanda Martinez, owner of Dig It! since 2017, said Skate the Plaza, another popular district event, brings a significant boost in sales for her business, which sells jewelry, art, T-shirts and vintage clothing.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)You can’t know what you don’t measure, and you can’t accurately track progress if the tool keeps changing.
Yet, Oklahoma leaders at the Education Department want to change testing requirements again and are proposing using tools that are not designed to measure whether students have mastered the state content standards.
Oklahoma state Superintendent Ryan Walters announced plans earlier this month to eliminate end-of-year standards-based assessments in grades 3–8 for reading and math. The plan, which requires the U.S. Department of Education to waive federal law, proposes replacing Oklahoma’s custom-built single statewide test administered every spring with a variety of district-procured instructional tests administered multiple times a year.
Walters is billing this move as “giving power” back to school districts, but in reality, it’s just more misguided testing.
It’s also an attempt to obscure declining student achievement under the guise of district flexibility.
The Nation’s Report Card shows Oklahoma students saw severe declines in achievement across the board in 2024. Eighth grade students scored at an all-time low in reading and math. Fourth grade students scored at an all-time low in reading and nearly as bad in math. They scored worse than their 2005 peers.
But that’s not the only issue with this plan.
I’m concerned that instead of testing just once, students will be subjected to high-stakes testing three times during the year, reducing valuable instructional time and causing disruption.
Current state tests are designed with input from Oklahoma educators and aligned to state content standards that are developed by Oklahomans. Selecting an alternate product eliminates local educator involvement and oversight.
In addition, accurate comparisons between districts goes out the window. With districts choosing different tests measuring whether students have mastered the standards, it becomes extremely difficult to know if students have been fairly tested on their mastery.
Walters’ plan also puts an additional burden on local districts. Districts will have to pay for their new tests. They’ll be responsible for working directly with the testing vendor to procure and pay, manage administration logistics, train staff, score their assessment and report results to parents and the state Department of Education.
Student transfers will disrupt a district’s ability to measure performance and growth. That information will be impossible to understand if a student transfers to a school with different tests and expectations.
Despite the concerns about instructional assessments, they are an important part of teaching and learning when used appropriately.
The annual standards-based state assessment serves as the high-level, external check on local practices for improving student outcomes. The rigorous expectations and administration of the state assessment are imperative to keep the promise of equity.
State assessment results provide objective, comparable information on performance for state leaders to make decisions on resource allocation, support, and policy.
Instructional assessments — or benchmarks as described in Walters’ plan — play a different but important role: guiding day-to-day instruction and helping teachers support learning. While invaluable for helping students improve, these tools cannot replace the high-level check that state assessments provide. Together, state and instructional assessments form a complete system for both supporting and evaluating student success.
Annual standards-based state assessments test what academic standards a student learned. Instructional assessments test how well they are learning the foundational skills and what support is needed before the school year ends.
Rather than tinkering with the tools that measure student outcomes, I believe Oklahoma students would be better served if officials focused on improving student outcomes with impactful early literacy and math policy.
Simply changing the measurement tools won’t produce better outcomes.
Students don’t need new tests. They need continued, consistent academic support that helps them meet and exceed expectations in the classroom and beyond.
Lowering expectations or replacing tests is not going to help students achieve that goal. Only the hard work of committed educators and supportive policymakers can do that.

Nearly 50 years into his news career, columnist Kerry Drake writes that 24/7 coverage of the president is too much to bear. 
The post One sure way to deal with Trump overload: Turn off the TV appeared first on WyoFile .","I admit that I was incredibly naive, but when Donald Trump got clobbered by Joe Biden in 2020, I was sure we’d see a lot less of him. After a disastrous first term lowlighted by his mismanagement of the COVID-19 pandemic, I expected Trump would return to his first passion: cheating at golf.

Opinion

Trump could have hit the links daily and worked as a greeter at Mar-a-Lago, where his MAGA fans would treasure every moment and the rest of us could get a break from his 24/7 presence on television news.
I need that break for my mental health. I’m tapping out — sort of. I am no longer fixated on TV news shows from dinner until after midnight. About a month ago I self-imposed a limit of two hours, which would probably still be an overload for the average viewer.
I didn’t take my decision lightly. Next year will mark the 50th year since beginning my journalism career as a newspaper reporter in Cheyenne. I’m a newsman, and I considered myself one of the last holdouts who could watch coverage of every breaking event, especially if it involved politics, and crave more.
National TV news has always been a conduit for print reporters and editors to learn what interests people and develop local stories. I will never completely shut that off.
But I can no longer take watching the president’s orange-tinged body and hearing his condescending voice spew lies every day. Trump has shown he has no interest in governing or empathy for people trapped in poverty by his policies.
I’m still following the news every day, of course, by reading accounts from reputable news sources in print and online. If I see headlines scrolling across my laptop screen or phone, I check them out. I’m not living in a news moratorium cave, just being selective.
I’ve been a political junkie since I was a teen, and watching TV news has been an essential part of my daily routine since the days of Richard Nixon. I’d race home when school ended and watch the Watergate hearings, eager to digest every detail about the White House’s greatest cover-up.
How quaint that sounds now, after watching a never-ending cycle of news about Trump’s abominable behavior, including inciting a deadly riot at the U.S. Capitol, paying hush money to a porn star and being convicted of 34 felonies. It makes Watergate look about as serious a crime as jaywalking.


Trump is back with his “Revenge Tour ‘25,” where he taunts opponents he thinks have slighted him in any way. He’s been shredding the national psyche since 2015, when as a candidate he infamously disparaged Mexican immigrants, insulted then-Sen. John McCain and mocked a disabled journalist.
Does anyone really want to watch Trump hurl childish insults at Rosie O’Donnell and threaten to revoke her citizenship? She’s already moved to Ireland to get away from him, but Trump won’t shut up.
Television news executives must love him for boosting ratings, but the nation is paying a steep price for letting Trump’s midnight Truth Social rants and continuous distortion of facts go largely unchecked and lead broadcasts.
Only a few months into Trump’s second term, I’d watched enough of his unbearably terrible Cabinet picks cause chaos in virtually every federal department. His administration’s total lack of respect for the rule of law is clear and frightening for our democracy.
It was difficult to watch the news after Trump turned over much of the federal government to his “first buddy,” Elon Musk. While the president was playing golf and charging Americans millions of dollars for his travel, security and lavish lifestyle, Musk ran the “Department of Government Efficiency.” Its job was supposedly to root out waste, fraud and abuse. 
Musk’s real mission was to use a team of unqualified young goons with nicknames like “Big Balls” to shut down the U.S. Department of Education, the U.S. Agency for International Development, and other critical agencies. 
The marauders allegedly took control of a massive amount of Americans’ most sensitive data and terminated or threatened to fire tens of thousands of federal employees, making their lives a living hell. The latter plunged me into a deep depression, because I know these workers didn’t deserve it.
But it was watching hooded ICE agents snatch immigrants off the streets who were here legally that was my breaking point. I am so ashamed and livid that this is happening in America. It breaks my heart, and it’s fully Trump’s fault. I will read dozens of articles about the issue, but I cannot watch those tragic incidents shown on a loop for hours on TV news.
I’m not the only one who can’t take it anymore. Last December, before Trump was inaugurated, a poll by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that about two-thirds of American adults have recently felt the need to limit media consumption about politics and government because of overload. 
I suspect the number of disaffected viewers is considerably higher now. I have several friends who either stopped or limited their TV news coverage to improve their mental health. It’s difficult to sleep at night after watching a stream of video violence from Ukraine and Gaza. 
One friend told me he’ll watch the local TV news or scan news sites on his phone, but prefers to reserve an hour before he goes to bed to watch comedy clips from talk shows. It satisfies his need to stay up with political events but puts a welcome humorous spin on it.
I dream about Trump being so obsessed with burying the Jeffrey Epstein scandal he decides to resign, then signs a massive contract to host a renewed version of “The Apprentice.” The contestants would be staff members tainted by the illegal and immoral things they did in his administration.
If Trump still needed more money, he could use the commercials to hustle anything he can stamp his name on: Trump’s top-secret records, Trump’s bleach, Trump’s judges.
The ratings would be huge and give his acolytes a place where they could worship him. Heck, I could watch that all day.

States and clinicians are working on getting correct information on vaccines to vulnerable groups amid shifting federal guidance. (Photo illustration by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Heading into the respiratory illness season, states and clinicians are working to encourage pregnant patients to get COVID-19 vaccinations, even though the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services no longer recommends that they should.
Along with being older and having an underlying health condition, pregnancy itself is a risk factor. Pregnant women are more vulnerable to developing severe illness from COVID-19. They’re also at high risk for complications, including preterm labor and stillbirth. The vast majority of medical experts say getting the shot is safe and effective — much safer than having the illness.
But HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced in May that the agency would no longer recommend that pregnant women get the vaccine. Before testifying before Congress in June, Kennedy circulated a document on Capitol Hill claiming higher rates of fetal loss after vaccination. But the authors of those studies told Politico that their work had been misinterpreted.
Experts say the federal shift puts the onus on state health agencies to ramp up vaccine guidance and outreach. Clinicians and public health organizations are trying to dispel misinformation and make sure information reaches low-income people and people of color, who had higher maternal death rates during the pandemic. During the first two years of the pandemic, the virus contributed to a quarter of maternal deaths, according to federal data.
“We are severely disappointed,” said Dr. Neil Silverman, a professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California, Los Angeles David Geffen School of Medicine. He has studied vaccines and pregnancy for the past 15 years and specializes in high-risk pregnancies.
Silverman called the federal shift a “public health tragedy on a grand scale.”
RFK Jr. ends COVID vaccine recommendation for healthy children, pregnant people

Vaccinations against COVID-19 help prevent severe illness in pregnant people as well as their newborns, who are too young to get vaccinated, Silverman said. In what’s called passive immunity, vaccinated mothers pass on antibodies to their babies through the placenta and through breast milk.
“State public health agencies are probably going to have to implement vaccine guidance that differs from the federal recommendations. And that’s going to be an interesting can of worms,” said OB-GYN Dr. Mark Turrentine, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas.
Turrentine serves on a board of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists that focuses on immunization and infectious diseases. He said his recent pregnant patients who had COVID-19 hadn’t gotten the vaccine.
“The change in guidance on the federal level just really makes a lot of confusion, and it makes it very challenging to try to explain to individuals why all of a sudden the difference,” Turrentine said.


Wisconsin keeps recommendation
Wisconsin Department of Health Services recommendations continue to include pregnant people among those recommended to get the COVID-19 vaccine.
“Vaccination either before conception or early during pregnancy is the best way to reduce maternal and fetal complications,” DHS says on its COVID-19 vaccine web page for parents.
Erik Gunn


A slew of public health organizations have been making a concerted effort to dispel vaccine myths. They include the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit organization of maternal-fetal experts. At a news briefing the society held this month, clinicians stressed the safety and long-standing science behind COVID-19 vaccines, as well as the shots for RSV and the flu. Cases of RSV and the flu tend to peak in the winter months, while in recent years COVID-19 cases have spiked in the summer and the winter.
Dr. Brenna Hughes, an OB-GYN who chairs the organization’s infectious diseases and emerging threats committee, pointed to survey data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing that less than a third of eligible pregnant patients received COVID-19 shots, and only 38% received RSV shots for the 2023 to 2024 season. Less than half — 47% — received flu shots, and 59% received TDAP (whooping cough) vaccines.
CDC data shows that for last year’s and this year’s season, only between 12% and 14% of pregnant patients got the COVID-19 vaccine.
“The complications from the infection are so much greater than the complications and the very few and typically minor adverse events that might occur from the vaccine,” said microbiologist Sabra Klein, a professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
In June, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and 30 other professional health organizations signed a letter urging insurers to continue covering the COVID-19 shot for pregnant women, and have continued to urge coverage since then.
CVS Caremark, one of the nation’s three major pharmacy benefit managers, told Stateline it will continue covering the vaccine for pregnant women. The Arizona, California and North Carolina state Medicaid agencies also told Stateline they are still currently covering COVID-19 vaccines for pregnant women.
Doulas, midwives and lawmakers challenge erasure of Black women in maternal health care

Dr. Kimberly Fortner, president-elect of the Infectious Diseases Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology, said during the maternal-fetal medicine briefing that she hopes medical groups’ joint messaging will bolster insurers.
“Hopefully by us linking arms, that can then help develop consistency so that insurers will continue to pay for the vaccine,” she said.
Exacerbating disparities
Dr. Ayanna Bennett, director of the District of Columbia Department of Health, said the federal government’s new stance has upended “a system that’s been stable for a very long time.”
Bennett said her agency used federal pandemic aid to shore up vaccine outreach efforts to communities of color. Now that flow of money is ending.
The changes in federal guidance and funding will “almost certainly exacerbate” maternal health disparities, said Marie Thoma, a perinatal epidemiologist and an associate professor in the University of Maryland Department of Family Science who researches pregnancy and COVID-19.
Black and Indigenous women died at higher rates. The virus exacerbated existing racial disparities in maternal health — and created new ones: Latina mothers, who generally see low rates of maternal mortality, saw deaths surge to 28 per 100,000 in 2021. Their rate was about 12 per 100,000 in 2018, according to federal data.
“We are going in with some exposure already that we didn’t have during the start of the pandemic. So, there will be some protection, but now that will erode,” said Thoma. “If we’re not getting vaccines, or if people are hesitant to take them, we could see some increase.”
Silverman said the administration’s efforts to strip mentions of race from government policies makes it difficult for institutions to reach populations at greatest risk. He called the dismissal of decades of data “saddening and infuriating.”
“The politicization of the vaccine process, or access to it, is what concerns me the most,” said Dr. Yvette Martas, a Connecticut OB-GYN who chairs the board of directors of the Hispanic Health Council.
Many women “are trying to navigate an economic system that’s not always in their favor in terms of also providing access to the kind of educational material that they need,” she said.
Not just COVID-19
In June, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee, replacing them with some members who are vaccine skeptics.
The change is creating chaos. Some states have vaccine laws, such as mandates for kids and coverage statutes, that are specifically tied to the committee’s decisions.










The politicization of the vaccine process, or access to it, is what concerns me the most.


– Dr. Yvette Martas, a Connecticut OB-GYN who chairs the board of directors of the Hispanic Health Council


The Vaccine Integrity Project at the University of Minnesota called on frontline health workers, health officials and professional societies to “counter the spread of inaccurate and confusing vaccine information.”
At a news briefing this month held by the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, representatives from Alabama, Connecticut and Washington, D.C., said they will continue to recommend vaccines.
Alabama’s state health officer, Dr. Scott Harris, said clinicians will be instrumental in getting correct vaccination information to patients.
“We don’t think that we necessarily have the same authoritative voice that we might have had a decade ago in trying to guide people in what to do, but we do believe that people trust their health care providers in most cases and are certainly willing to listen to them,” he said at the briefing.
Bennett said she is hopeful that strong, consistent messaging from respected medical organizations will help combat confusion.
“Having established groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics or the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology make very firm recommendations that keep us essentially not changed from where we have been, I think, should reassure families,” she said.

Jana Hughes)LINCOLN — Donated medicine collected by Iowa’s SafeNetRx nonprofit is finally flowing back across its border with Nebraska in the nation’s first multi-state prescription drug donation program, years in the making.
SafeNetRx CEO Jon Rosmann confirmed the Nebraska-Iowa partnership has been operational since July 1. The initial two-year contract between the nonprofit and Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services, at $475,000 per year, follows Nebraska laws passed in 2024 and 2025 that allow unexpired, pharmacist-inspected medicine to flow back to Nebraska patients.
The program serves patients at or below 200% of the federal poverty line. For a family of four, that would be an annual household income up to $64,300.
“It’s all systems go,” Rosmann told the Nebraska Examiner.
Overwhelming legislative approval
Nebraska State Sen. Jana Hughes of Seward began eyeing the partnership with SafeNetRx in late 2023, her freshman year, including an October tour of the nonprofit’s facility. She passed legislation in April 2024, 47-0, to authorize the program that September before being blocked by a decade-old federal law.

Those congressional guidelines were meant to replace a patchwork of state laws regarding the chain of custody of pharmaceutical meds and were phased in over a decade. It was unclear what the guidelines meant for drug donation programs.
Hughes had earned overwhelming legislative approval this March, 46-0, to get the partnership around that final roadblock while also adding language that Nebraska DHHS and the Nebraska governor could access the donated medicine during or in preparation for a governor-declared state of emergency, such as during a pandemic or natural disaster.
Before, medicine could flow only from the Cornhusker State to the Hawkeye State, but now the floodgates have opened the other direction.
Upon learning of the signed contract, Hughes told the Examiner:  “Super pumped to hear this!!!!”
‘A long time coming’
While federal regulations initially blocked the partnership, Gov. Jim Pillen’s mid-March signature cleared the way for the program to begin as soon as March 12.

Yet the partnership waited in the wings partly because Pillen had already asked lawmakers to defund the program two months prior — one of many “last in, first out” cuts his administration proposed to close a major projected deficit. The budget-writing Appropriations Committee initially agreed.
Lawmakers also accepted a recommendation from the governor’s team to reword the authorizing language around the spending.
Rather than requiring DHHS to identify a nonprofit to carry out what would effectively be a defunded program at the time, the committee forbade DHHS from absorbing the cost of the program through other state dollars.
Despite every member of the Appropriations Committee having voted for Hughes’ program, some more than once, some said they still had questions on the funding and how the program would work.
Those changes left Hughes “incredibly disappointed” but determined to fight for the program.

Hughes worked to correct some of that “misinformation,” including one that Iowa wasn’t putting in any state dollars to SafeNetRx while it had just put in $600,000 in its most recent budget. The committee voted 6-1 to restore funding but left DHHS the flexibility to choose whether to start or maintain the program.
State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha cast the lone “no” vote as an effort to push the committee to restore the original language around the spending, which the committee ultimately adopted with her support.
Rosmann said at the time that for every dollar SafeNetRx received, patients and clinics received $20 in donated medicine.
“I feel like this is a long time coming!!!” Hughes said in a text. “Very excited to get this up and going.”
A commitment to safety
SafeNetRx pioneered the prescription drug donation model in 2007 and had grown to receive medicine from pharmacists and patients nationwide.
Since its inception, SafeNetRx has received donated medicine or medical supplies from 250 health care facilities nationwide, worth $155 million. This has helped more than 160,000 underserved patients receive free medication, according to SafeNetRx.
Until now, medicine could not be sent to patients beyond Iowa’s borders, and Nebraska is the first state SafeNetRx is partnering with.

SafeNetRx is already working with four Nebraska sites, Rosmann said, and when the program was delayed for a year from getting started — facing federal but also Nebraska funding roadblocks — Rosmann said SafeNetRx instead took that time to ramp up donations
Between July 1, 2024, and June 30, 2025, Rosmann said his nonprofit gathered $28 million in donated medicine.
“All of that is available to Nebraskans now,” Rosmann said.
Before medicine is ready for redistribution, a licensed Iowa pharmacist inspects each donated drug, ensuring it is labeled correctly and usable — meaning not expired, not tampered with, not requiring refrigeration and not a controlled substance.
Rosmann said those patient safety and medication integrity standards help separate SafeNetRx from other similar organizations or nonprofits.
Nebraska pharmacists are able to access SafeNetRx inventory in real time to order meds for patients. Medicine is returned via courier, such as the United Parcel Service or Spee-Dee Delivery Service.
‘It’s time to get cracking’
Rosmann said the focus now is on education and enrollment, a task SafeNetRx is subcontracting with the Nebraska Pharmacists Association to fulfill, including recruiting participating clinics and pharmacies. 
There also is an emphasis on “safety net” providers, Rosmann said — federally qualified health centers, free clinics and community mental health centers — “those organizations that are on the front line of taking care of our most vulnerable patients.”

Haley Pertzborn, the CEO of the Pharmacists Association, said of the partnership: “We are feeling super excited for this to be able to finally hit the ground and start helping Nebraskans!” 
Pertzborn is an Iowa native who previously volunteered for SafeNetRx. She helped Hughes get the Nebraska-Iowa partnership off the ground that both have noted could provide cost savings and shore up health care gaps.

“It’s time to get cracking,” Rosmann said. “We’ve got a huge inventory of medicine, and now we need to get it to the patients that need it.”

On Aug. 7. 2015, former President Barack Obama signed the Sawtooth National Recreation Area and Jerry Peak Wilderness Additions Act, which was sponsored by U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, into law.
The law designated three new wilderness areas for permanent protection in central Idaho:

The Hemingway-Boulders Wilderness
The White Clouds Wilderness, which has since been renamed the Cecil D. Andrus-White Clouds Wilderness
The Jim McClure-Jerry Peak Wilderness

Together, the wilderness areas are often lumped together in conversation as the Boulder-White Clouds, for short.
In an opinion piece written last month, Simpson called the 2015 law “one of the most meaningful land management bills in Idaho’s history.”
“The Boulder-White Clouds, with their beautiful high peaks, spectacular alpine lakes, and breathtaking country ready for recreation, represent some of the very best of our great state,” Simpson wrote. “For decades, however, they were at the center of crafting a compromise over how best to preserve this area.”
Together, the three wilderness areas include more than 275,000 acres of public land in central Idaho, including high peaks, mountain lakes, wild rivers and diverse wildlife habitat.
A designation to the National Wilderness Preservation System offers the highest level of protection for federal lands in their natural, untrammeled condition. Wilderness protection generally prevents development and motorized use, limits human activities and emphasizes the natural character and preservation of the land.
 Procting the Boulder-White Clouds took years of effort and compromise

Protecting the Boulder-White Clouds was far from an overnight success.

Rick Johnson, who served as the Idaho Conservation League’s executive director for 24 years, pushed for more than 20 years to win protections for the Boulder-White Clouds.
To do so, Johnson said he totally rewrote the script for environmental action and conservation. He went from fighting against proposals and developments he viewed as detrimental to the environment to fighting for something even bigger.
“When you are fighting things all the time you can develop a mindset of defensiveness and even anger that is off-putting,” Johnson said. “But to protect wilderness, you have to proactively pass a law, which means going to Congress to get a majority vote out of Congress. … So to do it, to pass a wilderness bill, you have to do all kinds of things that are counter to being an angry, defensive, stereotypical environmentalist. You have to make new friends, you have got to get out of the office, you have to be going out and talking to people.”
Johnson and others knew the fight for the Boulder-White Clouds was worth it. 
Before the wilderness designation, Johnson said it was the single biggest unprotected roadless area in the Lower 48. The area also already had established an important history of rallying Idahoans. In the late 1960s, conservationists and the public banded together to fight a proposed ASARCO mine at the base Castle Peak, the highest point in the White Cloud Mountains. 
To win support for the wilderness designation, Johnson found a champion for the cause in Congress in the form of Simpson. Johnson then set out across the state seeking to create a political environment where protecting the Boulder-White Clouds had so much public support it seemed almost inevitable. 
Johnson spoke to 35 Rotary clubs and countless chambers of commerce.
He helped arrange for Simpson to be flown over the Boulder-White Clouds to get a bird’s eye view of the beautiful mountains and crystal clear lakes. Then Johnson accompanied Simpson on a hike to Castle Peak and learned how serious Simpson had become about the issue.
“It was very surprising that (Simpson) never gave up,” Johnson said. “He is a bona fide hero in this.”
Simpson could not be reached for comment.
Simpson’s first several proposals failed.
But eventually, Johnson got a phone call in 2015 telling him to get to the Oval Office to meet Obama and watch the Sawtooth National Recreation Area and Jerry Peak Wilderness Additions Act into law.

 Conservationists believes Boulder-White Clouds lessons apply to today’s public lands fight

Johnson retired after leading the Idaho Conservation League from late 1994 to 2019. But he says the lessons learned during the decades of fighting to protect the Boulder-White Clouds are relevant to today.
Earlier this year, U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, led an unsuccessful effort in Congress to make millions of acres of public land, including in Idaho, available to be sold off. 
“What I am thinking about now are the threats public lands face and some of the lessons of the Boulder-White Clouds are good things to be paying attention to right now,” Johnson said.  “Public land protection and, frankly, a love of Idaho transcends partisan politics. When people are sufficiently motivated and organized and focused on protecting their backyard, they can do amazing things.”
Johnson said the way to move forward is being willing to work hard and work together regardless of personal political views, recognizing the value of fighting for something versus fighting against it and understanding the importance of telling a story about why specific places matter and need protection.
“Management of these lands can change based on what this government of the people, by the people and for the people determines,” Johnson said. “It is an incredibly inspiring thing to be a part of something where a bunch of people decided this place, with Castle Peak at its center, is sufficiently important that we are going to work our tails off and do something about it.”

Louisiana has been hit by more than 100 twisters since 2023, many of which have occurred at night and sometimes during hurricanes. Though most of those tornadoes caused relatively little damage, two people were killed last May by high winds and severe weather across the state. The West Bank of New Orleans and the community of Arabi in St. Bernard Parish were both struck by tornadoes twice in 2022, the second of which killed one.
Currently, no parish in the state has a comprehensive outdoor warning system, commonly known as a siren system, to warn people to retreat indoors if a storm is approaching or other public emergency is taking place. Siren systems are common across “Tornado Alley” — Texas, Oklahoma, Nebraska and South Dakota — but in recent years, tornadoes have been shifting eastward, leading local emergency management officials to question whether it’s worth installing sirens in Louisiana next.

Collin Arnold, the director of homeland security and emergency preparedness for New Orleans, said he has been “brought around” to the idea of installing a siren system as the technology has progressed in the last several years.
“We typically associate outdoor warning systems with just sirens or tones, but they’re advanced to the point now where you can actually verbalize messages through them,” he said.
In New Orleans, a siren system could also be used to alert people in situations ranging from imminent coastal flooding to active shooter threats, Arnold said. He pointed to recent natural disasters in the state, such as the Arabi tornado in 2022 — the strongest in the state’s history — as well as the mass floods in Texas that killed at least 136 in early July.
“I have thought since that it is worth looking into,” he said.
Arnold said he has been in talks with several national outdoor warning system manufacturers and estimates the cost of installing a comprehensive siren system across Orleans Parish to be around $10 million.
Installing sirens on telephone poles or street lights, which already have a power supply connected, could minimize the cost, according to Arnold, who said he is asking potential siren contractors to look into the possibility of using existing infrastructure as a cost-saving measure.
Ryan Dean is the founding partner and chief revenue officer at the outdoor warning systems company OmniWarn, one of the vendors Arnold said he contacted. Dean said the siren itself typically affects the total cost more than where it is installed.
“Sometimes we’ll start with sirens at all of the parks, and then we’ll put them at all the schools, and slowly expand it out like that,” he said. “However…when I show [city officials] the price tag to do it all at once, they’re pleasantly surprised with how inexpensive it is.”
Dean said OmniWarn charges between $30,000 to $50,000 per siren, each of which is designed to last decades. OmniWarn recently installed 30 sirens for $1.3 million in the east Texas city of Pasadena.
Whether or not the city moves forward with installing sirens, Arnold said New Orleans residents should make sure they are subscribed to NOLA Ready text message alerts to get up-to-date information on any public emergency, from tornadoes to acts of terrorism.
How effective are sirens?
Debra Campbell, chairperson for A Community Voice, a local nonprofit for social and economic justice, has been calling on New Orleans to install an outdoor warning system since 2017.
Campbell said city officials who claim text message and social media alerts are enough of a warning fail to recognize that many people do not have access to a cell phone. Campbell’s son, who has autism, would be far more likely to listen to a siren than a text alert, she said.
“My son will probably not pay attention to an alert on the phone, but if you give him a deafening siren, then he’ll be aware that something is going on in the area,” she said.
The city of Dallas is home to a comprehensive outdoor warning system that has been periodically expanded and updated over the years.
John Patterson has managed the Dallas siren system for nearly 10 years. He called it “just one tool in our warning toolbox, if you will.”
Patterson noted that outdoor warning systems can be used for a variety of public emergencies, from hail, high winds and other extreme weather, to chemical spills involving toxic fumes. When the sirens are activated, the office also posts alerts on social media.
“If people hear it, they can’t assume that it’s a tornado issue,” he said. “It could be anything else. That’s why we tell people, when you hear it, go inside and turn on local radio and television news and find out what the situation is.”
The sirens are tested once per month, weather permitting, to avoid confusing the public. Patterson said the city still occasionally gets calls from people who aren’t sure whether the test is real.
Still, sirens have their limitations, said Samantha Montano, associate professor of emergency management at the Massachusetts Maritime Academy, who began studying disaster relief after visiting New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.
“Sirens don’t do as much as people think they do,” she said. “They tend to be more expensive and not quite as effective as the public thinks they are.”
Montano pointed out how sirens can generally only be heard when outside, and sometimes can’t be heard over the loud sounds of a storm. She said focusing on more fundamental issues, such as the lack of tornado shelters across New Orleans, would be a more effective preparation tactic.
A statewide question
Although nuclear power plants and universities across the state have used localized outdoor warning systems over the years, Orleans Parish would be the state’s first parishwide public siren system.
It’s up to parishes as to whether or not to invest in such a system, said Mike Steele, communications director with the Governor’s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, though the state can assist with obtaining federal funding.
In the aftermath of the Arabi tornado, the state legislature put together a task force in 2023 for emergency managers across the state to discuss future tornado preparedness. There, members of the public shared their desire for the city to invest in an outdoor warning system, Arnold said.
In Lafayette Parish, emergency management officials are sticking with a text message notification system as the primary tool to notify residents about tornadoes and other emergencies, given cost constraints.
“If we had all the money we wanted, yes, obviously we’d have sirens,” said Chad Sonnier, the parish’s top emergency management official. “However when you have limited funds, you try and get the most bang for your buck, and we think the system we have now is the way to go.”
Last June, a tornado hit Youngsville, a city of 19,000 people located in the southern part of Lafayette Parish, damaging trees, trailers and power lines.
Scott Gilbeaux, who lost his trailer home in the Youngsville twister, said he only learned about the tornado when he heard a loud sound similar to a train whistle close to midnight — a tell-tale sign of an impending tornado — and turned on the TV to see that one was on the way.
“Thank god I was awake,” Gilbeaux said. “We don’t have [sirens] back here — we’re in the country.”
Gilbeaux has since managed to get back on his feet with the help of family and friends. He said that with or without a siren system, at the end of the day, there is little that can be done ahead of a devastating natural disaster.
“I’m not prepared,” he said. “What’s going to happen is going to happen.”
In New Orleans, a “robust” public education program, including social media posts and coverage from news outlets, would be needed if the city were to install and periodically test an outdoor warning system, Arnold said.
Regardless of the views of the public or disaster relief officials, Arnold said the decision-making power on whether or not to invest in an outdoor warning system lies elsewhere. Arnold said he has spoken to Mayor LaToya Cantrell and other city leaders about installing sirens and that the response has been positive. In a statement, the Mayor’s Office said the city is looking into the “feasibility, value and potential deployment of such a system.”
“Ultimately it will be the elected leadership of the city — the mayor and the city council — that will determine from the will of the voters what direction we want to go with this,” Arnold said.

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska’s first tax receipts of the new fiscal year saw overall revenues jump by about $20 million, though it’s not yet clear whether that means the state’s budget is back on track. 
The state Department of Revenue released Nebraska’s July tax receipts Friday, showing a net gain of 4.8% compared to what Nebraska’s Economic Forecasting Advisory Board had predicted in April. That jump equates to roughly $20 million in extra tax revenues flowing into the state’s coffers.

July was the first month of the fiscal year, which spans from July 1, 2025 to June 30, 2026. Nebraska ended its last fiscal year with net tax receipts down about $86 million from forecasts, leading to a new projected state budget deficit of roughly $95 million. 
The latest report came as a relief to State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood, chair of the Nebraska Legislature’s Appropriations Committee. He viewed the increase as a potential sign that Nebraska’s financial status is recovering after several bad months, though he acknowledged that only time will tell. 
However, the extra $20 million in tax revenues doesn’t necessarily mean the deficit will decrease by the same amount, according to Legislative Fiscal Analyst Keisha Patent. 
“It certainly could (reduce the deficit),” Patent said. “I don’t know that that’s a certainty.”

The forecasting board will consider multiple factors at its next meeting in October, Patent said. Nebraska’s receipts for July are among those factors, she said, along with August and September’s receipts, and the impacts of the federal budget reconciliation bill. 
The higher receipts were largely due to a rise in sales and use tax revenues, which came in about 30% above forecasts, equating to a net gain of more than $67 million. Patent had no immediate explanation for this growth, as she said July doesn’t normally see high sales tax returns.
Clements said high sales tax revenue is likely a signal that Nebraska’s economy is flourishing. 
“It means people are spending, and they have money to spend,” Clements said. 
All other categories of tax revenues were below forecasts, including individual and corporate income taxes. Individual income tax receipts were down about 15%, equating to a $13 million loss. Corporate income tax receipts were down just over 1%, equating to a $316,000 loss. 
Patent said she’s received questions about why Nebraska’s income tax revenues have been down, considering the growth of the state’s overall economy. After several months of low revenues, many state officials expected Nebraska’s tax receipts would level off and eventually rise again. 
But Patent said that likely won’t happen for several more years, when the state’s phased decrease to income tax rates finally hits 3.99% in 2027. For now, she said any growth in Nebraska’s economy will likely be offset by the rate reductions.

We are the circle. That’s what life is all about. We take care of one another. So when we have someone in trouble, that’s when the rest of us have to step in.


– Elmer Crow, Nez Perce tribal elder


The Nez Perce Tribe first presented its extinction findings for Snake River salmon and steelhead in 2021 at a Northwest Power and Conservation Council meeting. The opening slide featured this call by Nez Perce elder Elmer Crow for human solidarity with the salmon, fellow makers of the circle, who are in trouble and need our care.
Mr. Crow died in 2013 while rescuing a grandson in the Snake River at Buffalo Eddy. One obituary reported that in the 1970s, while between jobs, he, his wife Lynda and their first two boys, “lived off the land for four months throughout Nez Perce Country, from the Blue Mountains to the South Fork of the Salmon River.” The western parts of the Crow family’s traverse, from the Blue Mountains to the Snake River, are locales in this four-part story.

Jay Hesse leads the extinction science the Nez Perce Tribe presented in 2021, and its updates since, including one this summer. Jay is the director of Biological Services for the Nez Perce Department of Fisheries Resources Management. Since 2021, he has also conducted an experiment – at once professional, personal, and public. It is as scientifically probing and plainly said or shown as he can get. It is: How can he better communicate the increasing extinction risk to Snake River salmon and steelhead, and the consequences?  
Jay’s work is featured in this story. And, with Elmer Crow, one of its inspirations: those who are stepping in.   
 Maps are salmon storytellers

The best way to observe Snake River salmon and steelhead extinction, to observe its dire motion, is by map. Salmon extinction is a geographic event, place by place in time. As will be salmon recovery, should it occur.

This map shows the entire natal, reproductive habitat of Snake River spring and summer Chinook salmon, across the Salmon, Clearwater, Grand Ronde, Imnaha and Tucannon River watersheds. The largest part is now in central Idaho, with most of northeast Oregon and a piece of southeast Washington included.  
Anyone who has driven from anywhere to La Grande, Lewiston, Stanley or Salmon has been on this map. Many are on it often, by visit or residence. Distinct local populations of salmon and steelhead have ocean-provisioned its places and creatures for many thousands of years. When you cross through, or stop to linger, you intersect with one or more of these populations, bred by and to the same waters and lands that now draw you.  And, you intersect with one or more active trajectories of population extirpation. The endpoint of population extirpations is species extinction.    
My presumptuous wish is that each time you drive, walk, bike, or float on this map’s terrain, you think of the local salmon there with you, whose thousands of years’ provisioning to the land, water and life around you is being dismantled in a relative instant.          
The map’s colors are the species’ seven major population groups, which track with watersheds. The names are the 43 geographic populations into which the species has been scientifically sorted by differences in behavior, life history and genetics. Endangered Species Act-listed, and non-listed Clearwater River populations, are both included; I focus here on those listed. These populations – at once local and connected, homebodies and explorers, mountaineers and mariners – are the species: Snake River spring and summer Chinook salmon, the highest-spawning salmon on earth.     
Snake River steelhead trout are a different fish than salmon, with different relations to their habitats, so the population boundaries differ some. But on this same base map, there are 26 local populations of Snake River steelhead – the highest-spawning steelhead on earth.
With an active map, you could zoom in on headwater laboratories where differences within and between each population come into being. In a wider view, you could watch lights flicker and go out as populations disappear.     
Over 30 populations of Snake River Chinook are already extirpated (locally extinct), by the actions of non-Indigenous homo sapiens. Extirpations have continued since Endangered Species Act listings 33 years ago, and more populations are on the way now.

I think of Stanley, Idaho – home to a self-chosen few people, hub of a geography loved and hard-used by thousands of Idahoans. Stanley’s local Chinook salmon is the Valley Creek population. How near are Valley Creek’s unique salmon to extirpation?  
How near are lower Middle Fork Salmon Chinook, and the seven other populations in the wild Middle Fork Salmon River? How near are B run steelhead, a creature found on earth only in the Clearwater River and lower parts of the Salmon River?
Each population in its geography tells stories, which by the nature of salmon weave fish, rivers, places, peoples, and time. In three parts and a coda, I will follow a salmon thread out from some rate-of-extinction science by the Nez Perce Tribe and Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife.  
Geographically, I will begin in southeast Washington, then move to northeast Oregon watersheds that descend a wizardry of mountains, valleys and basalt canyons to the Snake River. I will do no justice at all to these waters and lands, or their histories of people and fish. 
I will report and reflect on a few conversations, out of many that could be had, with a few local people about their past and present bonds with these fish, and what salmon extinction would mean.

 Roots in the Grand Ronde: Two stories

“I am descended on my father’s side from Walla Walla and Yakama people, here since time immemorial,” Bobby Fossek tells me.

Most of their winter villages were on the mid-Columbia and lower Snake Rivers, from which they came up and over each year into the Grand Ronde and Wallowa valleys.
“The Grande Ronde was our Garden of Eden. And not just ours; there was enough to share.”  
The Walla Walla, Nez Perce, Cayuse and Umatilla tribes long preceded the existence of Oregon in the Grande Ronde and Imnaha country. In the Cayuse/Nez Perce language, the Grand Ronde was Qapqa’pnim We’ele, “Cottonwood Stream.” Tribal bands moved in seasonal patterns of hunting, fishing, and gathering; assembly, trading and cultural practices; and wintering. The many-fingered Grande Ronde Valley was one of earth’s most bountiful salmon nurseries.
Then came conquest, death and dispossession by soldiers, settlers and state. Despite strong arguments by Cayuse and Nez Perce people, no reservation was established in the Grande Ronde or its tributaries, and salmon nurseries became irrigated croplands. (In 1873, President Ulysses S. Grant issued an executive order setting aside a portion of the Wallowa Valley as a reservation for the Nez Perce. Two years later, he rescinded it.  The forced removal of Nez Perce people from Wallowa country that followed led into the Nez Perce War of 1877, an event that still resounds.)      
From the Umatilla Reservation, Fossek’s family kept their Grande Ronde connection alive on fishing trips into the early 1960s. Those ended after The Dalles Dam, John Day Dam and the lower Snake dams were built. Too few salmon remained for the work, time and expense.

“Our family stopped coming back when the fish stopped coming back,” he said. “The waterways had been engineered, and we had less and less access.”  
Mr. Fossek and his own family now live in Cove, on Catherine Creek in the upper Grande Ronde. They are among the tribal people re-establishing in the Grande Ronde.  
“We do a lot of driving to the Umatilla Reservation and back,” he says wryly.
Fossek is a conscious restorer and adapter of native rivers, fish, culture, ways and skills at work in a landscape from which his family and many others were removed, and which the United States’ settlement has profoundly altered. Among his projects, he manages an 80-acre restoration on tributaries of Catherine Creek, on land owned by the Episcopal Diocese of Eastern Oregon.

Joe McCormack lives 12 miles outside the small town of Joseph. He is descended from the Joseph band of the Nez Perce, with homelands mainly in the Wallowa, Joseph Creek and Imnaha country. 
When his mother needed to move in 1979, and decided on Joseph, he returned to help her, and stayed. He worked as a fish technician for the Nez Perce Tribe, has a small cattle ranch in the Imnaha, and is a long-time leader to restore lands, waters, fish and tribal use in northeast Oregon while building native and non-native community.  
Mr. McCormack capsuled some recent history in the Wallowa Valley. 
“Taz Conner was Nez Perce and a navy veteran,” McCormack began. “He worked for the Forest Service here, back when logging and milling collapsed. Wallowa County was a natural resource community. Four or five mills were lost, leaving towns in shambles. It really hurt.
“The county and the Nez Perce Tribe created a salmon habitat recovery plan then, to address the Endangered Species Act listings. It was the first of its kind, by a tribe and a county, in the nation. Taz and some community members in the town of Wallowa started a Friendship Feast, which was first held in the high school, and now is on our own grounds.”
Mr. Conner helped create the Wallowa/Nez Perce Tribe Interpretive Center – now the Nez Perce Wallowa Homeland – to build Nez Perce presence and seek reconciliation with non-tribal people. 
“When Taz got sick, I took over for him, and over 20 years a group of us guided the Homeland into the community and region,” McCormack said.  
The Homeland now owns 320 acres in Wallowa, with a mile and a half of Wallowa River frontage plus newly restored side-channels.  
“We call it our home. It’s a center for the Chief Joseph Band descendants, whatever reservations they were scattered to,” McCormack said. “We hold a pow-wow, the Tamkaliks Celebration and Friendship Feast, on the third weekend of July. We focus on protecting and securing tribal resources, like salmon. We teach the youth what the elders would have taught them, the skills and resources, in the old days during the winters. Winter was the communal time, in the deep canyons along the rivers. That’s gone now.”  
When Fossek and McCormack talk about their peoples’ past, it is present.










The Grande Ronde Valley was our Eden. Everything was there for the people. The Grande Ronde had everything. The camas root was in abundance. When the seasons came there, the people from here went over to the Grande Ronde Valley and dug the camas. Catherine Creek was a main source of salmon and steelhead. There were fishing sites all along Catherine Creek. The Grande Ronde River was one of the main sources from Hilgard to Perry. On down where Elgin is was a main crossroads for the people to travel from Walla Walla over into Wallowa country.

 The extinction emergency in Washington’s Tucannon River

Now to some extinction science, and the Tucannon River. Jay Hesse recalls conversations within Nez Perce Fisheries in 2020: “We knew that NOAA Fisheries [the federal agency with main jurisdiction over salmon] uses a metric in its planning called ‘quasi-extinction threshold.’ But management is our focus, actions to help fish that are not doing well. And we had grown very concerned about the Tucannon population.”  
The 60-mile long Tucannon River slides from the south into the reservoir behind Lower Monumental Dam on the lower Snake River. (The Palouse River enters from the north some six miles further downstream. This three-river area will be active tribally, ecologically and popularly if the lower Snake River is restored to free flow.)

Tucannon Chinook are Washington’s only remaining Snake River Chinook salmon population. An Asotin Creek population is already extirpated.  
They face six dams and reservoirs when they go to sea, and six when they return. All other Snake River salmon and steelhead, in Oregon and Idaho, face eight dams and 320 miles of continuous reservoir when they go out to and come back from the Pacific Ocean. (The journey outbound kills far more of both fish than the return trip, but that is not well understood, perhaps because the out-bound young are largely invisible, and the big inbound adults unforgettably the opposite.)
In 2019 just eight wild-origin Chinook spawned in the Tucannon; in 2020, seventeen; and, from 2017 forward, fewer than 50 each year.     
Thus the Tucannon population has dropped below what NOAA Fisheries calls a “quasi-extinction threshold” for Snake River Chinook: fewer than 50 adult fish in a population returning from the ocean for four consecutive years. 
Below that floor, the population’s continued existence can no longer be scientifically assumed or predicted. It is a critical condition signal, flashing red and near black, a population emergency. I will return to this threshold in Part Two.    
On the Tucannon River, the Nez Perce Tribe, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation and the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife are responding with a translocation project. 
Starting this year and likely for years to come, marked Tucannon-origin, hatchery-born young salmon are being trucked downstream, past all the big dams, to Kalama Falls Hatchery, south of Longview, Washington, for next-spring release toward the Pacific Ocean from there.  
Any Tucannon-origin adults that then return to Kalama in after years will be captured, to maintain and build this rescue effort and, it is hoped, eventually return Chinook salmon to the Tucannon River. Any few salmon that might return to the Tucannon itself will also be collected into the project.
  The W.T. Wooten Wildlife Area, pictured, spans approximately 17,000 acres. About 17 miles of Washington’s Tucannon River are located within the area’s boundaries, and elevations range from 4,100 feet on Hopkins Ridge down to 1,800 feet on the lowest section of the Tucannon River, according to the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife’s website. (Alan L. Bauer/Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife)
“The plan is to create an interim living gene bank that is not associated with natural habitat,” Hesse says. “We are taking every Tucannon Chinook out of the river, their natural environment. A fish is at great risk when it can’t use its river. And this kind of action also badly strains tribal cultural and harvest connections to the river. But with so few fish, every action we could take now, including doing nothing, has large risks.”  
“Until the transforming action all Snake River salmon need” – he means restoring the lower Snake River’s 140 miles of reservoir to free flowing river again, by removing the earthen sections of four dams – “our collaborative analysis tells us this translocation, with a few other interim actions, will get us more Tucannon adults back” than the sporadic dribble of natural production left. “Our purpose is to keep the behaviors, patterns, and genetics of Tucannon spring Chinook in existence until more permanent remedies are enacted, which must occur soon.”     
Hesse calls the approach a “safety net offsite strategy,” whose high-risk choices tribal and state fish agencies now face as Snake River populations drop toward and to double digits. 
Some possible actions, tailored to the situation, include translocation, cryo-preservation, captive-rearing assist in part of the life-cycle, perhaps coupled with targeted predator control and replacement of marine-derived nutrients that salmon once provided at no cost every year. The approach is expressly experimental, population-specific, and interim.  
Dave Johnson, who just retired as head of Nez Perce Fisheries, puts the situation plainly: “Tucannon spring Chinook are the canary in the coal mine [for Snake River Chinook], and the canary is dying.” 
The three collaborators will try to hold on to Washington’s last Snake River salmon population, knowing the risk is high they will fail. Whatever the outcome, the more Washington people keep watch on this last-gasp, high-risk effort – so that its governor, senators, and Congresspeople are led to keep watch too – the better. 
The emergency Tucannon effort also presages the near future for salmon and salmon people in northeast Oregon and central Idaho.  
Thirty years ago, the fine Northwest-based writer Tim Egan memorably described his home region: “The Pacific Northwest is simply this: wherever the salmon can get to.”
Mr. Egan is not being literal, but he is being truthful to history, experience, and feeling. By his measure, a large chunk of southeast Washington, the Tucannon River watershed, is, for now, no longer in the Northwest.
Let us pray it is temporary, but let’s not look away.

Reset Louisiana, a collaboration between the Leaders for a Better Louisiana and the Public Affairs Research Council of Louisiana, calls the combined impact of the tax changes “slightly less progressive” than the system in place before but still “modestly progressive overall.”
The groups hired former state economist Greg Albrecht to calculate the impact of new tax rates the legislature approved during last November’s fiscal policy special session. He had previously analyzed a tax proposal Gov. Jeff Landry offered to lawmakers, who chose to dial back some of its key components. 
In the end, lawmakers placed a flat 3.5% income tax on all households, regardless of income, effective Jan. 1. It replaced a tiered tax bracket structure that ranged from 1.85% for income up to $12,500, 3.5% for income between $12,500 and $50,000 and 4.25% for all income above $50,000. For middle- and upper-income households, the change will result in a lower marginal tax rate, according to Albrecht’s analysis. Income taxes have effectively been eliminated for lower-income households.
The Reset analysis also found that while income tax reductions increase as income climbs, the percentage of tax liability reduction grows for lower-income filers. 
“In that sense, the new changes to the income tax appear to increase the progressivity of the state income tax compared to the prior system,” the Reset report said.
But in actual dollars, more than half of the total income tax reduction – about 52% according to Albrecht – will go to filers with income in the state’s top 10 percentile  because they tend to pay a larger dollar amount in income taxes. The adjusted annual gross income of households in that tier make $150,000 or more. 
The remaining 90% of households with adjusted gross income below that threshold will see about 48% of the tax cuts.   
Louisiana also updated its sales tax in November, increasing the rate from 4.45% to 5% at the start of this year through the end of 2030. Lawmakers also applied the state sales tax to digital products such as streamlining services, cable televisions subscriptions, satellite entertainment and computer software. An additional 5% sales tax was added to cable and satellite TV.
Albrecht’s analysis determined all Louisiana households should expect to pay more in sales taxes, with lower-income households seeing a bigger percentage increase because taxes account for a larger share of their income. Wealthier taxpayers will put out more actual dollars in sales taxes comparatively because they can afford to spend more on taxed goods and services.
When the income and sales tax changes are combined, most Louisiana households should expect an overall drop in tax liability, according to Reset’s calculations. Any increase in sales taxes is likely to be offset with a decrease in income taxes.
Albrecht also examined the distribution of state income and sales tax burden and found only slight changes from the prior framework but notable differences from what the Landry administration proposed.
The current sales and income tax structure will provide at least a 20% tax liability reduction to 721,000 Louisiana households, or 42% of total state taxpayers. The Landry plan would have provided reductions to nearly 1.08 million taxpayers.
Households with income between $50,000 and $200,000 will see their sales and income taxes decrease from 13% to 19%. Those making more than $200,000, a bracket with fewer than 100,000 taxpayers in Louisiana, should expect a 20% reduction.
A slight increase in taxes, less than $50 a year, is anticipated for those making less than $10,000, mainly because they don’t make enough money to see a benefit from the income tax changes and will pay more in sales taxes.

An immigrants rights group is accusing the Tennessee Department of Safety and Homeland Security of withholding public records tied to mass immigration sweeps in Nashville earlier this year. 
In a lawsuit filed Thursday in Davidson County Chancery Court, the Tennessee Immigrant & Refugee Rights Coalition says they have been denied video, data, call logs and other records connected to a joint operation by the Tennessee Highway Patrol, or THP, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement that resulted in the detention of nearly 200 people.
These records could “shed light on the THP’s dubious efforts to use its state powers to enforce federal civil immigration laws through stops, interrogations, and detentions of motorists on Tennessee roadways,” the lawsuit said. 
A spokesperson for the state’s Department of Safety and Homeland Security, which oversees the THP, did not respond Monday to a request for comment about the claims.
“It’s not only our legal right, but also our duty as an organization that prioritizes the rights of immigrants and refugees across the state of Tennessee that we hold leaders accountable when they harm our neighbors and then limit access to public records about their conduct,” a statement by Lisa Sherman Luna, executive director of the Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition, said.
‘Flood the zone’
The THP and federal immigration agents partnered in the so-called “Operation Flood the Zone” to make hundreds of traffic stops in heavily immigrant neighborhoods on the south side of Nashville beginning May 3. 
Within a week, THP reported it had stopped 588 vehicles and made 103 arrests of drivers or passengers for suspected immigration violations, the suit noted.  
State officials have failed to turn over any video footage of the traffic stops requested by the nonprofit group, provided heavily redacted call logs that would reveal the identities of those stopped and, in some instances, simply ceased responding to follow-up questions about the status of the group’s records request, the lawsuit alleges. Neither federal nor state agencies have given a full accounting of all individuals stopped or detained during the operation.
Among the footage being sought is of the May 8 or 9 detention of Juana Santizo-Tadeo. The footage was first requested by her attorney on June 11, the suit said.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement “dragnet” in Nashville results in detentions

Video of Santizo-Tadeo’s arrest and detention has not been provided even as she was scheduled for an immigration hearing Aug. 18 to assert “widespread” and “egregious” constitutional violations during the operation. The video, the suit said, serves as “important evidence” in a “critical immigration hearing.”
In July, the Department of Safety and Homeland Security notified the Tennessee Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights that it had located the relevant footage and requested a payment of $161 to produce it. 
On August 1, the department acknowledged receipt of payment for the footage but said it would take until Sept. 24 to either produce it or make a “determination of accessibility or availability.”
“The Department’s delay in producing this video footage from a single traffic stop, which is important to the detainee’s immigration proceedings, is unwarranted and consequently a willful violation” of the state’s public records act.
The lawsuit also claims the Department of Safety and Homeland Safety in one instance claimed it was withholding certain reports from its computer dispatched system at the request of Davidson County District Attorney Glenn Funk. 
But Funk said he was “invoking no such privilege over the records and to provide the records to the public,” an email from Funk, introduced in legal filings, showed. 
The department continues to withhold those reports, the lawsuit said.

(Photo by Liam Niemeyer/Kentucky Lantern)Mandates from President Donald Trump’s administration to retain aging coal plants could cause a massive spike in energy costs, according to an independent analysis commissioned by several environmental groups.
Orders from the U.S. Department of Energy to save coal plants from retirement could cost ratepayers more than $3 billion per year, according to a report from Grid Strategies, a power sector consulting firm. It was carried out on behalf of Earthjustice, Environmental Defense Fund, Natural Resources Defense Council and Sierra Club.
Under Trump, the agency has issued emergency orders to maintain operations at coal plants that were scheduled for retirement. While federal officials say the coal plants need to stay online to avoid blackouts, power plant owners and state regulators planned their closures because they were no longer economically viable or needed for reliability.
“DOE mandates override those well-informed decisions, inflating electric bills for homeowners and businesses and undermining the competitiveness of U.S. factories and data centers,” the Grid Strategies analysis found.
Across the country, coal plants have phased out as they’ve struggled to compete with cheaper renewables and natural gas. A 2023 analysis by Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan think tank, found that 99% of existing U.S. coal plants “are more expensive to run than replacement by local wind, solar, and energy storage resources.”
But Trump, who has pushed to unleash more fossil fuel development and to stymie wind and solar, has ordered a retiring coal plant in Michigan to stay online, along with an oil and gas plant in Pennsylvania.
“Based on the trend to date and indications that DOE has approached the owners of many retiring fossil power plants about potentially mandating their retention, DOE may attempt to mandate the retention of nearly all large fossil power plants slated for retirement between now and the end of 2028,” reads the Grid Strategies report.
The cost of keeping those plants online would be immense. By 2028, if Trump were to mandate the retention of all fossil fuel plants slated for retirement, the annual cost to ratepayers would be more than $3.1 billion, the analysis found.
The report also considers a number of aging plants that are not yet scheduled for retirement. It finds Trump’s actions could create a “perverse incentive,” causing plant owners to claim they’re planning to shut down, inducing the feds to step in and keep them open, with the cost borne by ratepayers.
Accounting for that possibility, the report found that ratepayer costs could reach $5.9 billion per year to keep the entire aging fossil fuel fleet online. California, Texas and Colorado would see the highest increases in electricity bills.

(Karen Pulfer Focht/Tennessee Lookout)Black neighborhoods in Memphis are rapidly changing before our eyes. What we are witnessing in Memphis is not accidental change but a continuation of America’s original design. Jim and Jane Crow never died, they just got law degrees, political consultants, and corporate contracts.
It’s one thing to watch neighborhoods change because people are moving in and moving out. It’s another thing entirely when the change comes from a bulldozer, a backroom deal, or a billionaire’s backhoe.
I call it a different kind of gentrification —not the kind that pushes poor and Black folks out with rising rent, but the kind that slowly strangles the quality of life for those who stay. You might still be able to keep your address… but you can’t keep your air clean, your streets safe, or your voice heard.



				Development of Elon Musk’s xAI in Memphis is one factor displacing the soul of Black Memphis and the real product isn’t just AI, it’s pollution. Turbines humming in Boxtown like mechanical overseers, pumping out emissions.  


And here’s the thing: nobody seriously believes these kinds of projects would ever be proposed, let alone pushed through, in the whiter or wealthier parts of Shelby County. You can’t point to a single example of turbines, jails or Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention centers being dropped into Germantown, Collierville, or East Memphis. The very thought would be laughed out of the room. But in poor and Black neighborhoods? Suddenly it’s “economic development” or “public safety.”
In Westwood and Whitehaven, Elon Musk’s xAI has rolled in under the cover of “innovation” and “job creation.” But the real product isn’t just AI, it’s pollution. Turbines humming in Boxtown like mechanical overseers, pumping out emissions in a neighborhood that already struggles to breathe. 
And for our trouble? A “25% community benefits agreement” that, while sounding meaningful, is still far too inadequate to meet the generational needs and repair historic harm to Black Memphians. Without transparency, enforceability, and proportional investment, the agreement risks functioning more as a public relations talking point than as a tool for real transformation.
In North Memphis, we’re staring down a proposal to build a new jail on land already soaked in the history of Black labor and disinvestment. The message is clear: instead of funding opportunity, fund containment. If you live here, the county would rather build a cell than a school, a guard tower than a grocery store.
And in Mason, Tennessee — just a short drive up the road — the approval has already been given for an ICE detention facility run by private prison company CoreCivic. 
This is happening in the same moment the Trump administration is literally asking the Supreme Court to allow racial profiling in ICE raids. That’s not just a warning sign, it’s a flashing red light that we are amid a renewed, state-sanctioned targeting of Black bodies, with all the echoes of Jim Crow and even antebellum control.

Taken together, these developments are not isolated events. They are part of a sweeping regional pattern of “gentrification by policy” a coordinated reshaping of our landscape that prioritizes profit, policing, and containment over public health, housing and human dignity. In one arc of influence, we see poor and Black Memphians hemmed in by pollution, our immigrant neighbors trapped in detention and our communities bracketed by new jails. Different stories. Same plot.
This is what happens when development is defined by those who will never live with the consequences, when the people who profit most never have to hear the turbines at night, never have to inhale the smog, never have to wonder if their child will come home to find their block turned into a construction site for cages.
So what do we do? We stop mistaking announcements for accountability. We stop letting ribbon cuttings become eulogies for our neighborhoods. We stop accepting “better than nothing” as a policy position.
If a project can’t pass the basic test — will this make life healthier, safer, and more whole for the people already here? — then it doesn’t deserve a permit, a handshake or a dime of public money.
The Bible talks about watchmen on the wall, people assigned to warn the city when danger is coming. I’m sounding that alarm now. Because once the air gets thick, the land gets claimed, and the cells get filled… it’s too late to say we didn’t see it coming.

(Delilah Brumer/Colorado Newsline)Colorado is facing a $1.2 billion tax revenue hit due to tax code changes in the recent federal Republican domestic policy law. Those changes hurt the state budget, but they also benefit certain taxpayers, with large corporations reaping much of the rewards.
Of the state revenue loss, about $326 million comes from individual income tax breaks, and about $825 million comes from corporate tax breaks, according to estimates from the governor’s Office of State Budgeting and Planning for the current fiscal year, which began July 1.
“It does benefit lots of different kinds of businesses, but the biggest windfall in terms of dollars is going to happen to the biggest corporations and the biggest businesses,” said Caroline Nutter, the legislative and policy manager at the Colorado Fiscal Institute.
Causes of the state tax revenue loss
As Colorado lawmakers prepare to head back to the Capitol for a special legislative session on Thursday, they’re tasked with addressing the nearly $800 million gap in the state budget, caused by the tax code changes and other provisions in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Before that law was passed and signed by President Donald Trump in July, the state budget was balanced.
In Colorado, the state tax code is linked to the federal tax code, through a policy known as rolling conformity. Colorado also uses federal taxable income to determine state taxes. These two factors make the state’s tax revenue especially susceptible to federal changes.

Colorado is one of four states that have this combination of policies.
“We have a double hit from the federal government, because we automatically take all of their tax changes, and we start with their income after all of their deductions,” Nutter said.
The tax code changes that have resulted in the biggest revenue losses are those affecting business depreciation and interest, standard and itemized income tax deductions, and qualified business income tax deductions, as well as the elimination of taxes on qualifying tips and overtime.
Impacts on businesses vary
Corporations with high revenues, and therefore substantial tax liabilities, are the businesses that benefit most from the tax code changes, Nutter said. Compared to large C corporations, S corporations, LLCs and sole proprietor businesses are unlikely to see as much benefit, she said.
Because Colorado bases its state taxes on federal taxable income, the state tax revenue is also reduced by federal deductions, including those that don’t bring benefits to Colorado, Nutter added.
“If you’re a corporation and you claim a federal deduction for a machine that you bought in Michigan, you are still able to reduce your Colorado taxable income, because we just automatically take federal taxable income and multiply our tax rate by that number,” Nutter said.
Hunter Nelson, the Colorado director of the nonprofit Small Business Majority, said the One Big Beautiful Bill Act “disproportionately helps the wealthiest businesses.” Small Business Majority advocates for its network of about 4,200 Colorado small businesses, which operate in several industries including food services and marketing.
“We’re continuing to see a lack of bottom-up tax relief benefits for small businesses,” Nelson said.
Beyond taxes, a major concern for Colorado small businesses is the federal law’s changes to Medicaid and enhanced premium tax credits for health insurance. The law cuts more than $1 trillion from Medicaid, a state-federal health insurance program for low-income people. 
The Medicaid cuts, which take effect in 2027, will put an estimated 377,000 Coloradans at risk of Medicaid disenrollment.
Nelson said that those cuts are “drastic and concerning” for low-income people who are self-employed, and for small business employees who do not receive health coverage through their jobs.
“We’re worried about the impact that this will have on our community, our small businesses in Colorado, especially in rural Colorado, and the ripple effects,” Nelson said.

(Photo by Gloria Rebecca Gomez | Arizona Mirror)Last week, Gov. Patrick Morrisey announced that West Virginia is now participating in Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s 287(g) program, which will allow the National Guard and local police to enforce certain immigration laws.
Fox News called this one of the most “wide-ranging agreements” a state has forged with ICE under President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown.
The 287(g) program was discontinued in 2012 after a Department of Justice investigation found widespread racial profiling and other discrimination against Latinos by an Arizona task force, Stateline reported.
Although West Virginia is nearly 1,500 miles away from the U.S. southern border, Morrisey said during a press conference that the state has “effectively become a border state.” He also blamed the people entering the country illegally for “unlimited amounts of fentanyl flooding into our state.”
The majority of fentanyl is smuggled into the country by people who can enter the U.S. legally, according to the American Immigration Council. 
Fewer than half of people arrested by ICE since Trump took office are actually convicted criminals and only 5% were arrested for drug crimes nationally. So either ICE is doing a terrible job, or immigrants aren’t the problem. 
The Deportation Data Project reported earlier this month that 1 in 5 ICE arrests are of Latinos with no criminal past or removal order. A substantial portion of ICE arrests this year were a result of illegal profiling. Basically, people are being arrested for having brown skin. 
If your argument for ICE is that people should enter the country legally, then shouldn’t ICE be only using legal methods to arrest people?
The legal route for ICE to make an arrest would be if a suspect was arrested first by local police and found to be in the country illegally. Raiding Japanese and Mexican restaurants or hanging out at Home Depot and Lowes is not the legal way. 
In July, a court in California ordered ICE to stop using these methods to arrest people in the Los Angeles area, and an appeals court upheld that order. Since then, street arrests went down by 83%.
ICE’s illegal profiling has also resulted in numerous U.S. citizens and legal immigrants being arrested. 
Morrisey’s move will result in your friends, neighbors and co-workers being profiled and arrested for not passing as white. In Alabama, a man was tackled at his worksite and ICE officers said his REAL ID was fake. It wasn’t. A man in California was detained for three days, despite being a legal citizen. A woman in Los Angeles was grabbed by ICE agents moments after her family dropped her off for work — witnesses said they never even asked to see her ID. 
West Virginia has a small number of immigrants — only about 2% of the population, but they also account for 18% of employees in farming, fishing and forestry occupations, and 11% in science occupations, such as microbiologists, biochemists and epidemiologists.
Immigrants contribute a lot to West Virginia. In 2023, they paid $450.3 million in taxes. And thanks to immigrants, our population loss was less severe than it would have been without them. 
As of 2018, about 52% of immigrants in the Mountain State had gone through the long process to become legal U.S. citizens. And about 42% of adult immigrants had a college degree or higher that same year — compared to 19.6% of West Virginians. 
There are many reasons people choose to migrate to the United States without going through the proper channels — crime, violence, war or simply to build a better life — but our immigration policy has made it harder and harder for people to immigrate here legally.
Immigrants aren’t the enemy that Trump’s administration is trying to paint them to be. Immigrants are not causing problems in West Virginia. Maybe it’s time Morrisey remembered that West Virginia was settled by immigrants and be grateful they still want to live here.

The Trump administration has threatened the city over its sanctuary policies. City officials say some officers violated the policy by assisting in the arrests. (Photo courtesy of City of Rochester)The Trump administration is once again pressuring liberal cities and states to cooperate with deportation efforts, despite previous setbacks in court.
Attorney General Pam Bondi sent letters last week telling sanctuary states, cities and counties that “you better be abiding by our federal policies and with our federal law enforcement, because if you aren’t, we’re going to come after you,” she said in a Fox News interview. She demanded the areas answer her by Tuesday.
Cities and states with so-called sanctuary policies generally refuse to assist with immigration raids or accede to requests for local jails to hold prisoners for deportation. Those that responded to Stateline’s questions about the letters said they were not inclined to change their positions about cooperation with immigration authorities.
“It’s the tactic of a bully. And the only way to deal with a bully is to let them know that they’re not going to intimidate you,” Rhode Island Democratic Attorney General Peter Neronha said in a statement.
The Trump administration is attempting to force more cooperation with immigration arrests. But it suffered a serious court reversal on July 25, when a federal judge dismissed a sanctuary policies case against Illinois, Chicago and Cook County.
The state and local policies reflect a “decision to not participate in enforcing civil immigration law — a decision protected by the Tenth Amendment,” Judge Lindsay Jenkins wrote in an order now under appeal.
Bondi’s letters follow the Justice Department’s Aug. 5 release of a list of sanctuary jurisdictions including 12 states, the District of Columbia, four counties and 18 cities. That’s fewer jurisdictions than the 14 states and almost 500 counties and cities that appeared on an earlier list, which the agency withdrew after criticism that it included conservative counties that were fully cooperating with immigration enforcement.
The states on the new list are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington state. The list also includes some counties and cities in those states as well as in Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New Mexico.












It's the tactic of a bully. And the only way to deal with a bully is to let them know that they're not going to intimidate you.


– Rhode Island Democratic Attorney General Peter Neronha




Other federal courts have issued injunctions to at least temporarily stop Trump administration from withholding unrelated federal funding from governments that don’t cooperate on immigration. Cities, counties and states have filed lawsuits challenging Trump’s executive orders targeting sanctuary policies, including a February order that federal payments to states and localities must not “by design or effect, facilitate the subsidization or promotion of illegal immigration, or abet so-called ‘sanctuary’ policies that seek to shield illegal aliens from deportation.”
“The executive orders are directing agencies to basically take a maximalist approach to putting pressure on local governments to cooperate with immigration [enforcement], even though they’re not required to do so by federal law,” said Jonathan Miller, one of the attorneys working on the California case for the Public Rights Project, a California-based group promoting civil rights protections for states and cities.
One city on the administration’s list was Rochester, New York, which disciplined some police officers for helping federal agents make a March arrest in the city. The city already faces a lawsuit brought by the Trump administration that prominently mentions the arrest of three men from Guatemala; one of whom has since pleaded guilty to re-entering the United States after a previous deportation.
A spokesperson for the city, Barbara Pierce, said in a statement to The Guardian that, “Nothing in Attorney General Bondi’s letter is new and none of it has legal merit.”
“The letter reiterates many of the frivolous arguments that the federal government has already made in its pending suit against the city of Rochester,” she added. “These same arguments were levied against the city of Chicago and were dismissed by the federal district court for the eastern district of Illinois nearly a month ago.”
Ally Sullivan, a spokesperson for Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis, said in a statement that Colorado “is not a sanctuary state. The Governor continues to be frustrated by this mistaken and incorrect label.” In a televised interview earlier this year, Polis pointed out that Colorado fully cooperates with federal authorities on criminal matters. Immigration, he said, is a civil matter.
“In Colorado, we are improving public safety, apprehending dangerous criminals, cooperating with federal law enforcement on criminal investigations, and keeping our communities safe,” Sullivan said.
Nevertheless, Colorado faces a federal lawsuit brought by the administration over its alleged sanctuary policies. Polis signed a measure in May that limits local law enforcement’s communication with federal immigration authorities and restricts where federal authorities can operate within schools, child care facilities, hospitals and libraries without a judicial warrant.
Connecticut Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont in a statement said the state’s Trust Act, which the Trump administration has targeted as a sanctuary policy, was passed with bipartisan support and helps ensure local police concentrate on serious crimes. The Trust Act, passed in 2013 and expanded in 2019, limits information sharing and compliance with requests to detain immigrants for federal immigration authorities.
“Nothing about this makes Connecticut a sanctuary in any legal or practical sense — it makes our state one that upholds the Constitution, respects the rule of law, and prioritizes the safety and well-being of our communities,” Lamont said.

Today she helps others enter recovery and works to reduce stigma around addiction. She wants to see pharmacy benefit managers and other companies held accountable for their role in the overdose crisis. (Sam Foree)UnitedHealth Group’s multibillion-dollar pharmacy benefit manager, Optum Rx, is suing five Kentucky counties in an attempt to force them out of national opioid litigation against the company.
Pharmacy benefit managers, often called PBMs, act as middlemen that negotiate prescription drug prices between drug companies, insurance plans and pharmacies. Some lawyers and advocates say PBMs helped fuel the overdose crisis by failing to restrict the flow of opioid prescriptions.
As governments begin exploring potential lawsuits against PBMs — a step that could represent the next wave in opioid-related litigation — Optum Rx is attempting to shut down those efforts, in some cases before they even fully take shape.
In June, Optum Rx sued Anderson, Boyd, Christian, Nicholas, and Oldham counties in Kentucky for allegedly making decisions about participating in the new wave of national opioid lawsuits behind closed doors, violating Kentucky’s open meetings law. Optum Rx is asking courts to effectively force those counties to make their decisions again, this time in open meetings, potentially with the hope that some won’t bother because of the administrative burden. The result could be fewer claims against the company and possibly less money for it to pay in a future settlement.
But legal experts call Optum’s case “hypertechnical” and “frivolous,” and addiction recovery advocates say it could set a dangerous precedent for companies to evade accountability for their role in fueling the overdose crisis.
  Christine Minhee says Optum’s suit reminds her of an adage among lawyers: “If the facts are on your side, pound the facts. If the law is on your side, pound the law. If neither is on your side, pound the table.” (Christine Minhee)
Christine Minhee — an attorney, national expert on opioid litigation and founder of OpioidSettlementTracker.com — said Optum’s suit reminded her of an adage among lawyers: “If the facts are on your side, pound the facts. If the law is on your side, pound the law. If neither is on your side, pound the table.”
“Right now, what we’re seeing is it pounding the table,” Minhee said of Optum Rx. The company is “desperately” trying “to find some kind of foothold” to get cases against it thrown out.
Minhee said these suits fit a pattern of Optum Rx using thin arguments to try to delay or evade opioid litigation nationwide.
Last year, Optum Rx, along with another PBM, asked a judge to throw out an opioid lawsuit filed by Los Angeles County, claiming during a December hearing that the county hadn’t shown harm. The judge appeared skeptical of the claims and ultimately rejected the companies’ request.
In April, the same companies tried to oust a federal judge overseeing national opioid litigation, claiming he was biased. Their argument was based partly on a Florida lawyer’s having said the judge was “plaintiff-oriented.” Their attempt failed.
Now, Optum Rx is working to keep five Kentucky counties out of that same sweeping opioid litigation.
That national legal undertaking began more than seven years ago, as jurisdictions saw overdose deaths climb. Many people who had become addicted to prescription painkillers were cut off by their doctors, and some transitioned to using deadlier heroin or fentanyl. Health care and public safety costs skyrocketed. Thousands of cities, counties, and states began suing health care companies for allegedly creating a public nuisance by aggressively marketing prescription painkillers and negligently distributing them.
Those cases were lassoed together into the giant multidistrict litigation, which has resulted in massive settlements. The first few waves of settlements involved opioid manufacturers, distributors and retail pharmacies, with companies such as Johnson & Johnson, CVS and Walgreens agreeing to pay state and local governments billions of dollars. The money is meant to be used for addiction treatment and prevention services — though its rollout has been controversial.
To add a new round of companies as defendants, jurisdictions must undertake a multistep process, said Peter Mougey, a Florida-based attorney who represents many local governments in the massive national litigation. The five Kentucky counties in question were in the early stages of that process, only having asked the judge to amend their complaint, he said. They hadn’t added Optum Rx yet.
If Optum Rx’s suits are successful, those counties would have the option of redoing the initial steps of the process in a public meeting, then continuing to add Optum Rx as a defendant, Mougey explained. The company may hope that some counties won’t undertake the extra administrative effort.
Optum Rx’s “goal is clearly just to wear down and tire out these small counties,” Mougey said. “They’re trying to have a chilling effect on the litigation.”
It’s not clear why Optum Rx targeted those five counties out of the many localities undertaking the process to add the company as a defendant. The Kentucky counties range from having fewer than 8,000 residents (Nicholas) to more than 70,000 (Christian). One is among the richest in Kentucky (Oldham), while others are poorer. Boyd County, in Appalachia, is one of the hardest hit, with a recent overdose rate twice the state average.
Optum Rx, in its filing against Boyd County, which was similar to claims against the other counties, said local authorities had taken official legal action by asking the judge to make a change in its case. The suit said such action must be done in a public meeting and that the county did not hold one.
Optum spokesperson Isaac Sorensen told KFF Health News that the company’s argument is not about “a technicality.”
It is “an important legal requirement designed to ensure accountability and transparency before a county takes legal action,” said the statement Sorensen provided. “We have found many counties ignored this requirement, alongside their duty to preserve relevant evidence, and Optum Rx will defend against these improper legal actions.”
The five Kentucky counties disagree with these assertions, according to court records. As of late July, all five had filed motions to dismiss Optum Rx’s claim.
Boyd County, like the others, argued in its motion to dismiss that asking a judge to amend its complaint was a routine, procedural step that did not require a public meeting. Optum Rx jumped the gun, the county argued, filing a case before any final action had been taken.
“No amended complaint has been filed. No new defendant, OptumRx included, has been added. No new lawsuit has been initiated,” Boyd County’s response said.
The county also pointed out that it held an open meeting in 2017 that kicked off its involvement in the national litigation and authorized future amendments to that litigation.
Hearings on the counties’ motions to dismiss Optum Rx’s suits are set for late August and early September, according to court records.
These cases are shaping up to be a Goliath-versus-David legal action. Although Oldham County is the wealthiest of the Kentucky counties that Optum Rx sued, its most recent budget is less than 0.1% of Optum Rx’s annual revenue, which the company reported as exceeding $133 billion in 2024.
  Oldham County Attorney D. Berry Baxter
Oldham County Attorney D. Berry Baxter told KFF Health News he’d seen the impact of the opioid epidemic as a prosecutor working on a growing number of drug-related cases over the years. Now, as settlement money is arriving from other companies, it has funded increased addiction treatment in local jails. More settlement money from additional companies could expand such services, Baxter said.
If Optum Rx succeeds in kicking Kentucky counties out of the national litigation, it would set “a really horrific precedent” for other PBMs and health care companies to do something similar, said Tara Hyde, CEO of the statewide nonprofit People Advocating Recovery.
Hyde said she’s been in recovery for more than a decade from an addiction that began with prescription painkillers for a broken leg. She wants to see PBMs and other companies held accountable and made to change their processes to prevent future crises.

“Recovery doesn’t just happen overnight,” she said. “Without these dollars that have been a direct result of people being misled, mistreated and taken advantage of, we will still be detrimentally impacted.”

BILOXI, Miss. — The Trump administration is developing a powerful data tool it claims will let states identify noncitizens registered to vote. But Democratic critics and data experts warn it could allow the federal government to vacuum up vast quantities of information on Americans for unclear purposes.
Some Democratic election officials and opponents of the effort fear President Donald Trump wants to build a federal database of voters to target political opponents or cherry-pick rare examples of noncitizen voters to fuel a sense of crisis. Republican election officials allied with the president counter that he’s helping states to maintain accurate voter rolls.
The Trump administration has rolled out changes to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, tool at the same time the U.S. Department of Justice is asking states for copies of their voter rolls. The timing, combined with questions about what happens to voter data uploaded to the program, has alarmed critics.
Trump wants Congress to pass a national proof of citizenship voter registration requirement and in March tried to unilaterally impose one for federal elections through executive order. But with the legislation stalled and the order halted by the courts, the citizenship data tool may offer a backdoor way to accomplish the same goal.

SAVE was originally intended to help state and local officials verify the immigration status of individual noncitizens seeking government benefits. But U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, this spring refashioned it into a platform that can scan states’ voter rolls if election officials upload the data.
The changes to SAVE, rolled out over just a few months and with little public debate, are “tinkering with sort of the bones of democracy,” said John Davisson, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington, D.C.-based research and advocacy group that argues privacy is a fundamental right.
“You’re talking about the voting process and who will be eligible to vote,” Davisson said. “And to take a system that is not designed for use in that process and repurpose it, really on the fly, without a formal comment process, without formal rulemaking, without congressional intervention — that’s pretty anomalous and pretty alarming.”
Previously, SAVE could only search one name at a time. Now it can conduct bulk searches, allowing state officials to potentially feed into it information on millions of registered voters. SAVE checks that information against a series of federal databases and reports back whether it can verify someone’s immigration status.
Since May, it also can draw upon Social Security data, transforming the program into a tool that can confirm citizenship because Social Security records for many, but not all, Americans include the information. NPR reported earlier on changes to SAVE.
“It is incredible what has been done, really since March,” Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray, a Republican who supports proof of citizenship requirements and the SAVE tool, told a gathering of state secretaries of state in Biloxi, Mississippi, recently.
Individuals registering to vote in federal elections must already sign a statement affirming they are citizens under penalty of perjury, and those who cast a ballot face criminal penalties and deportation. One study of the 2016 election placed the prevalence of noncitizen voting at 0.0001% of votes cast.
But as Trump has spread falsehoods about elections, Republicans have made purging noncitizens from voter rolls a central focus.

Democratic concerns were on display earlier this month at the National Association of Secretaries of State conference, held at the Beau Rivage casino-resort in Biloxi. In interviews on the sidelines of the conference, Democratic secretaries of state voiced deep reservations — or outright opposition — about plugging their voter data into SAVE.
Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said Aug. 6 that the federal government appeared to be trying to take over election administration. She formally rejected the Justice Department’s voter roll request two days later.
Bellows said the Department of Homeland Security told her in a recent phone call that it planned to retain SAVE data for 10 years for “audit purposes only.”
“Just like the [Justice Department] is asking us to hand over an electronic file of all the voters in our state, it seems like the Department of Homeland Security is through this backdoor system also asking us to share voter information about every voter in our state,” Bellows said.
At least one state appears to have granted the federal government sweeping authority over any voter data it provides to SAVE.
Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales announced in July he had reached an agreement with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to access the newly expanded system for voter list maintenance. Indiana’s agreement allows the federal agency to use information the state provides for any purpose permitted by law, including criminal prosecutions.
Morales, a Republican, said in a news release that SAVE represented “another step in safeguarding the rights” of eligible voters. His office didn’t respond to Stateline’s questions.
The Trump administration has ramped up efforts to encourage state election officials to use the expanded program. The White House hosted a bipartisan “fly in” event for state secretaries of state on July 29. Multiple secretaries of state told Stateline that USCIS Director Joseph Edlow, who was confirmed on July 15, spoke at the event.
“The president is very much keyed in on voter list maintenance,” Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, a Republican, said in an interview — echoing other GOP secretaries of state who released statements praising the Trump administration after the meeting.










When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances.


– Steve Simon, Minnesota Democratic secretary of state


Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, a Democrat who attended the meeting, said he questioned how the federal government would handle voter information provided to SAVE. He added that the Justice Department’s request for his state’s voter rolls raised his level of concern about how data would be used.
“When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances,” Simon told Stateline.
The White House referred questions about SAVE and the event to the Department of Homeland Security and USCIS.
In response to questions from Stateline, USCIS didn’t directly answer whether the agency would share voter roll data with other parts of the federal government but confirmed it disposes of records after 10 years.
“The SAVE application is a critical tool for state and local governments to access information to safeguard the integrity of elections across the country. It’s no wonder many states have quickly adopted it, and we continue to promote the tool to other states and counties not using SAVE,” USCIS spokesperson Matthew Tragesser said in a statement.
“We look forward to continued optimization efforts and implementing more updates to SAVE.”
 GOP pressure

Some Republican election officials and Trump allies have long wanted the federal government to take an expanded role in searching state voter rolls for noncitizens.
Last summer the Trump-aligned litigation group America First Legal, co-founded by Trump adviser Stephen Miller, encouraged states to submit to the Department of Homeland Security the names of individuals for citizenship or immigration status verification.
Some states did just that. Texas, for example, asked USCIS to verify the citizenship of some voters in September, and Indiana asked the agency to verify 585,774 voters in October. The same month, 16 Republican state attorneys general signed a letter criticizing Homeland Security, then under the Biden administration, for failing to work with states on verification.
Trump’s DOJ wants states to turn over voter lists, election info

 
After Trump took office, GOP state officials kept up the pressure. Twenty-one Republican secretaries of state urged Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in February to prioritize SAVE improvements.
On April 16, Indiana sued the department in federal court for not responding to its verification request last fall. USCIS announced an overhaul of SAVE less than a week later.
As the agency continues to remake SAVE, the tool will soon allow searches using the last four digits of a Social Security number, multiple state secretaries of state told Stateline. The agency confirmed the feature is under development and will be available soon but didn’t provide an exact date.
The change would mark another significant expansion of the program because most states collect the last four digits when individuals without a driver’s license register to vote.
Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican, said SAVE represents a better way to verify citizenship than a state law requiring voters to produce documents. “I think there’s a real opportunity for us to do a lot of this through just sharing of information and I think that’s what we’re seeing happen,” McGrane said in an interview.
 Unreliable data?

But some voting rights advocates and experts on government data caution against an overreliance on Social Security data.
The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, a progressive policy nonprofit, has noted that Social Security only began tracking the citizenship status of all applicants in 1978 — meaning the database doesn’t include comprehensive citizenship information for older Americans. Additionally, Social Security may not always have up-to-date information on the status of naturalized U.S. citizens.
The nonpartisan Institute for Responsive Government also warned in May that since SAVE hasn’t used Social Security numbers to verify citizenship in the past, its accuracy and effectiveness are unknown. The success of the expanded SAVE program may also partially depend on whether it has adequate staff and resources, it said.
A 2017 Government Accountability Office report found that between fiscal years 2012 and 2016, about 16% of the nearly 90 million SAVE searches required additional verification, which the institute says often translates into federal workers manually checking files. Now that SAVE allows bulk searches, the need for manual checking could rise dramatically.
Nick Doctor, director of implementation at the Institute for Responsive Government, said in an interview that a tool confirming the eligibility of registered voters in a way that doesn’t burden individuals can be a good thing. But he emphasized that it depends in large measure on SAVE’s implementation.
“The changes that have been made to SAVE happened very quickly and, to my knowledge, we haven’t seen releases on the level of accuracy of that information,” Doctor said.
During interviews, Republican secretaries of state stressed that voters aren’t kicked off the rolls because SAVE can’t verify their citizenship. Instead, an inability to verify would likely trigger a follow-up process with the voter.
“Just because we get something back from the SAVE database, it’s not a cut and dry, especially on those they’re not sure about,” Hoskins, the Missouri secretary of state, said.
Still, Arizona illustrates why some Democrats worry about any large-scale effort to ask voters — especially longtime, older residents — to prove their citizenship. After the state discovered errors in how it tracked voter citizenship dating back years, election officials are contacting some 200,000 voters seeking proof of citizenship documentation.
Some have been casting ballots for decades without incident and many feel targeted, Arizona Democratic Secretary of State Adrian Fontes said during a presentation at the state secretaries of state conference. “They feel insulted when they get that letter,” Fontes said.










There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside.


– Charles Stewart III, professor of political science at MIT



Charles Stewart III, a professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies elections, said Arizona may actually point to the potential usefulness of SAVE. If Arizona runs its voter roll through the program, a list of 200,000 voters needing citizenship verification would perhaps drop into the hundreds, he suggested.
“There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside,” Stewart said.
Connecticut Democratic Secretary of State Stephanie Thomas told Stateline that every secretary wants tools to keep voter lists as clean as possible. But the details are important.
When she hears of something new, Thomas said she asks whether it’s the best option available and whether “the i’s are dotted, the t’s crossed.” She said she’s asked USCIS a series of questions about SAVE and is waiting on some responses.
“When it comes to voter lists,” Thomas said, “I don’t want Connecticut voters to be a guinea pig.”

For nearly a decade, women have driven the growth in overall prime-age labor force participation – strengthening local economies and contributing billions to GDP. The McKinsey Global Institute estimates that continuing to advance women’s equality could add trillions to global GDP, boosting incomes and living standards worldwide – for men and women alike.
Yet right now this progress is threatened by a multigenerational caregiving crisis—spanning both child care and elder care.
Since January, over 200,000 women have exited the labor force. Experts attribute this largely to reduced workplace flexibility and persistently limited child care access. Misty Heggeness of the University of Kansas reports labor force participation for women ages 25–44 with children under five dropped from 69.7% to 66.9%.
At United WE, our research confirms the toll: women are three times more likely than men to leave the workforce due to child care challenges. Sixty percent of women entrepreneurs say this barrier makes running their businesses harder, and millions live in child care deserts.
But the caregiving squeeze doesn’t stop there. The recent AARP and National Alliance for Caregiving “Caregiving in the U.S. 2025” report finds that 63 million Americans—nearly one in four adults—now provide ongoing care for an adult or a child with a complex medical condition or disability, a staggering 45% increase since 2015.
Many juggle both roles: one in three caregivers, and almost half of those under 50 are part of the “sandwich generation,” caring for both kids and aging relatives.
This crisis disproportionately affects women, but its consequences are felt in every corner of our economy. A study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation found states lose an average of $1 billion in economic activity each and every year due to breakdowns in child care access.
One expert put it bluntly: “The economy’s basically telling half its talent to stay home.”
The good news is that solutions are within reach, and even in deeply divided times, Republicans and Democrats are making common cause to make child care more affordable and accessible.
In Kansas, bipartisan action under Gov. Laura Kelly’s leadership is poised to create more child care slots in the next two years than the state did in the last 15 – giving thousands of parents the ability to return to work or expand their businesses.
In Missouri, where more than 41% of counties do not have an accredited child care facility, legislation to help businesses offset the cost of child care won support from both parties. And a bipartisan commission appointed by Gov. Mike Kehoe is working on recommendations to streamline regulations so providers can open and operate more easily while protecting the health and safety of kids.
And at the federal level, despite a polarized Congress, progress has quietly continued. The recent tax bill tripled the employer-provided child care credit, offering new incentives for businesses to support working parents.
Now, parallel action is emerging for elder care—still slow, but gaining traction. Promising policy proposals include caregiver tax credits and support services, though much more is needed to meet the escalating demand.
At United WE, we believe the path forward lies in research, solutions and results. That’s our model for change—and it works.
Today, as we approach the 105th anniversary of the 19th Amendment granting women the right to participate in our democracy, the time is now to break down this barrier to women’s full participation in our economy.
Suffragist J. Ellen Foster told delegates at the 1892 Republican National Convention: “We are here to help you – and we are here to stay.”
Women have more than delivered on that promise. Today, for the sake of our economy and our communities, it’s time policymakers and employers to do their part as well.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/now-hiring-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-08-19 05:56:20.103520

(Courtesy photo)Advertisements promoting the abortion pill will be at gas stations across West Virginia and Kentucky over the next few weeks.
Mayday Health, a New York-based health education nonprofit, will run the ads at 104 rural gas stations through Sept. 7. The campaign started Aug. 11.
The advertisements say “Pregnant? Don’t want to be? Learn more at Mayday Health.”
Executive director Liv Raisner said it’s crucial to advertise at gas stations, which serve as community hubs in rural areas.
“Many rural counties in West Virginia and Kentucky have few or no OB-GYN providers. Some have lost their only hospitals, their only clinics,” Raisner said. “So routine education and preventative reproductive health information is much harder to access through traditional medical channels. And so that’s why we decided to advertise at gas stations.”
The organization started after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe V. Wade and the constitutional right to abortion in 2022. That’s when most abortions became illegal in Kentucky and West Virginia.
“We heard this sobering statistic that only 10% of Americans even knew what abortion pills were,” Raisner said. “And with clinics closed, reproductive options became very limited for women across the United States. We knew that a massive education campaign needed to be executed to inform people that they still have options.”
According to the Guttmacher Institute, in 2023, medication abortion accounted for 63% of all abortions in the United States, up from 53% in 2020.
Jewish woman’s challenge of Kentucky’s abortion ban gets green light from appeals court

Kentucky’s Republican-controlled legislature had enacted an abortion ban that was triggered into effect by the ruling. Another Kentucky lawprohibits abortion once cardiac activity is detected in an embryo, generally at about six weeks of pregnancy and often before a woman realizes she is pregnant. Challenges to the laws have been rejected on grounds the plaintiffs lacked the right to sue over the issue. However, an appeals court recently found a Jewish woman undergoing in vitro fertilization and challenging the law on religious grounds has standing to bring the suit. The case is pending in Jefferson Circuit Court.
In 2022, West Virginia lawmakers passed a law banning abortion with narrow exceptions. Earlier this summer, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the ban in a challenge brought by abortion pill manufacturer GenBioPro.
Despite abortion being illegal in West Virginia in most cases, Raisner said the organization does not fear legal repercussions from the campaign.
“We don’t have concerns about advertising because we don’t sell, distribute or package abortion pills,” they said. “We’re merely spreading First Amendment-protected free speech. So if anyone wants to come after us, what they’re coming after is the First Amendment.”
Earlier this year, Mayday Health launched a digital billboard and poster campaign in Tennessee and an aerial campaign above the Indy 500.
While abortion is mostly illegal in Kentucky and West Virginia, states with abortion bans may have trouble prosecuting out-of-state providers and entities mailing pills to people within their borders.
Since the Supreme Court struck down Roe V. Wade, 22 states and Washington D.C. have enacted shield laws that protect patients, providers and people assisting in abortion from the reach of states where it’s illegal, according to KFF. Some shield laws protect providers who send abortion pills to people in states with abortion bans.
Earlier this year, the West Virginia Senate passed a bill aimed at out-of-state providers that would have made it a felony to prescribe or distribute medications used for abortion to people in West Virginia unless the abortion is legal. The bill was not taken up by the House of Delegates.
West Virginia Attorney General J.B. McCuskey recently signed on to a letter urging Congress to ban shield laws, calling them “blatant attempts to interfere with states’ ability to enforce criminal laws within their borders.”
“People in [states with abortion bans] should be and are empowered to make their own decisions,” Raisner said.
The website directs people to sites where they can order abortion medication.
People who visit Mayday Health are also linked to a helpline where they can get free, private advice on state specific abortion laws, they said. The group encourages website visitors to reach out to a hotline where a group of doctors provide free advice.
Raisner said it’s also important for people to know that abortion pills are safe and effective. 
“There’s so much misinformation peddled by the anti-choice movement about the dangers of abortion pills, and it’s just not true,” Raisner said. “Abortion pills are so safe that they are even sold over the counter in some foreign countries.
“Clinics are closing across the country, but people everywhere still have the power to make the choices that are right for their reproductive health,” they said.

Consider this scenario, offered by Dr. Rhonda Schuhler, superintendent of Franklin County Schools: A school district wants to use federal Title I funds to hire a teacher to reduce class sizes and a certified tutor to help struggling students. But without knowing the state salary schedule, administrators don’t know if they can afford both.  
“We’re somewhat in a holding pattern with that, because we don’t have a full picture of what the state salary schedule will look like to know whether it’s feasible,” Schuhler said. “Those kinds of decisions are having to be made in our district and other districts across the state.” 
With traditional schools readying for their school year to begin, North Carolina’s public schools are operating without a full state budget, relying instead on a stopgap spending plan that state education officials say covers only immediate needs while leaving larger funding decisions unresolved.   
The “mini-budget” bill Gov. Josh Stein signed this month, House Bill 125, prevents disruptions in state operations after lawmakers failed to agree on a comprehensive 2025-26 budget before temporarily adjourning for the summer.
“This Band-Aid budget fails to invest in our teachers and students, fails to keep families safe, fails to value hardworking state employees, and fails to fully fund health care,” the governor said in a statement after signing the bill. 
It provides money for enrollment growth, step increases for teachers and instructional staff, and $9.4 million for a new statewide student information system. It also directs additional lottery funds toward school construction and allows Yancey County schools more flexibility in repairing storm-damaged facilities.   
But the temporary plan leaves out the kind of multi-year commitments districts count on to launch new programs, fill long-term positions, or undertake major building projects. 
“We’re still trying to determine if the language in House Bill 125 is the final adjustment to the base budget,” Elizabeth Yelverton, legislative liaison for Department of Public Instruction, told the State Board of Education on Aug.  6. “This is enough to keep the lights on, to keep us going, but we will still be advocating for the full amount of that funding.”    
The General Assembly adjourned in late July with no deal on the two-year spending plan, passing a resolution to meet only one day a month until the 2026 short session begins in April. Lawmakers have been deadlocked since early summer over teacher pay raises and other education priorities. That  means months could pass before districts have clarity on the state’s spending priorities for education.   
Some education groups are urging lawmakers to return to Raleigh to pass a full budget. They argue the state needs more than incremental fixes to address increasing enrollment, aging school facilities, and teacher workforce challenges. 
“Operating under a continuing budget means that our school districts across the state and our state educators are continuing to work under a budget that doesn’t reflect the current needs of right now,” said Tamika Walker Kelly  president of No rth Carolina Association of Educators.   
Rural and low-wealth districts could be affected the most. Without healthy fund balances or large tax bases, those districts have fewer options to bridge funding gaps. Still, Kelly said it’s a problem for all school districts whether they are urban or rural to be in “limbo” without a clear state budget.    
While most school districts have finalized their local budgets, they are still waiting to find out how much state funding they will receive.   
The mini-budget makes cuts, including eliminating $1.8 million in vacant positions at the Department of Public Instruction, ending funding for the STEM program Plasma Games and ending support services for parents of deaf or hard-of-hearing children. DPI leaders say they will work to reassign responsibilities from the eliminated positions but warn that the loss of program funding will be felt in schools.   
The budget also falls short of what DPI originally requested for its new student information system, awarding $9.4 million instead of the $17.5 million sought. Officials say the reduced allocation could slow the statewide rollout, which is intended to modernize how districts track and report student data.   
In the meantime, district leaders say they are making only the most important spending commitments.  
“Without an approved budget that lets us know how much ultimately each position is going to cost, districts may be limited in fully moving forward with the level of instructional support that would be most beneficial in meeting the needs of our students,” Schuhler said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/back-to-school-Photo-by-Nuria-Martinez-Keel.jpg,,,2025-08-19 05:56:20.103520

Last month marked the 60th anniversary that Medicare and Medicaid were signed into law to make health care accessible, especially for those who most need help: financially, physically, cognitively, emotionally, socially and supportively.
This month, I also met Diana Bennett, a 75-year-old Colorado native applying for Medicaid.
Diana moved to assisted living in the fall of 2019. She has Parkinson’s and uses a walker. She has shoulder-length curly gray hair. Permanent wrinkles. Sunken eyes. Deep dimples when she smiles. She makes eye contact in a way that would win a staring contest every day. Soon after moving in, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, priests were no longer allowed to come into the community to celebrate Mass. Diana, an extraordinary minister, filled the gap. She delivered communion, hosted community prayers, and cared for the community chapel. She still does.
Diana never married or had kids. She’s spent her life devoted to future generations. When she was in high school, she worked at an orphanage. Then, over the next 30-plus years she became a librarian, a teacher, and a principal. She worked at both Catholic schools and Denver public schools. She has sisters, nieces, nephews, and a close circle of friends. She had a home that she sold before moving into assisted living, which has given her an income to live on.
It hasn’t been enough.
After nearly six years paying privately at assisted living, the resources she carefully saved throughout life have been spent down, forcing her to apply to Medicaid so she can continue to live and receive supportive care as an elder.
Diana had her first interview for Medicaid recently. She has no idea when she’ll hear back — a week or six months. The process for Medicaid approval can take many months.
“That’s kind of scary,” she said. “Because I don’t know what will happen. The only income I will be getting is from Social Security. I don’t have any other savings or insurance. My sisters have families, and I can’t move in with them.”
“What will you do?” I asked. Every syllable of the question felt so heavy. I was sitting just inches from her.
“I’d have to live on the streets,” she said. Her gigantic eyes slowly started to fill with water as she stared into mine.
“This place has joked that they’d put a cot outside for me if I get kicked out. But truthfully, I’d have to go to a shelter or live on the streets. And I know I wouldn’t last longer than a week out there.” Diana held her gaze at me until I took a breath, had water in my eyes, and looked down at the floor to let my heart catch up.
How the hell is this possible, I thought to myself. How is anyone okay with this? A 75-year-old remarkably smart, kind, compassionate citizen who has given her life to others now in complete fear of living on the streets if her Medicaid is stripped away, leaving her without support!?
She broke the silence. “When I thought about moving in here, I thought I’d stare at a wall all day. I don’t. I still have a purpose in life so I can have meaning. We always tell younger generations to find their purpose. But we forget how important it also is for elders. I still have a voice. I cannot lose that.”
It wasn’t easy leaving Diana. Her hopes and fears, and the way she spoke with so much truth and compassion felt like it was tattooed onto my heart.
Diana is one of the 15 million people who if they were to lose their Medicaid, would lose life-sustaining support. Diana would be forced on the streets in Denver, at 75 years old.
Gov. Jared Polis has called a special session Thursday to address the impact that the federal government’s recent policy bill — H.R.1. — will have on Colorado’s budget, including Medicaid funding, and ultimately on the health of Coloradans in every corner of the state.
In addition to financing, the process for Medicaid approval can cause incredible stress and uncertainty for older adults, their families, and organizations caring for older adults who get put in difficult situations waiting for approval.
Right now, half of the people experiencing homelessness in this country are people aged 50 and older. This is before cuts to Medicaid.
How we treat elders is so often a mirror on the health of a country. If we cannot wake up to consequences of so many elders who face horrific decisions around housing and care, and even death on the streets, I don’t know what else will wake us up.

As students across Kentucky return to campus, our colleges and universities face difficult times. Higher education is viewed with a great deal of suspicion by those outside its inner sanctum, though recent data suggests a subtle shift toward a more positive view.
Institutions of learning are under mounting pressure to show their value to society, and, as the plummeting enrollment of most state institutions shows, most of higher education has failed to rise to this challenge.
As if this were not bad enough, the increasingly charged political environment we all inhabit sees college campuses as another front in the incessant culture wars.
In short, for the first time in history, the vast majority of colleges and universities are spiraling without real purpose. Once viewed as indispensable fixtures of society, increasingly it is easy to conceive of a time when many of our public universities simply do not exist. A fact that has been reflected in the now decades long budget crisis faced by public higher education in Kentucky and the very likely closure of some of our oldest private colleges in the coming decade.
If we really wish to solve the problems, instead of tinkering around the edges, we must confront that higher education issues are systemic rather than ephemeral demographic disruptions or ideological capture.











The end result of this factory model of education has been to encourage all institutions to focus ceaselessly on growing enrollment, providing hard technical skills to their students and standing out through the construction of ever more student amenities.


The greatest challenges lay in the way universities understand their purpose. As society has grown more corporate, more mass produced, universities have started to see themselves as companies that sell a product – jobs – and rely on consumers who want to buy their product for survival.
One of the chief consequences of this mindset is that for many university administrators, the goal of education —  employment — has become more important than the process by which people are educated. Jobs have become the end-all, be-all of a college degree, but the contents of a degree have become less important.
Academic rigor, broad-minded thinking and all the other old hallmarks of a college education have fallen by the wayside as long as a student can get a job when they graduate. This means that most institutions — even very prestigious ones — have spent huge amounts of effort greasing the wheels of their academic programs: ensuring that little is asked or expected of students as long as they pay their tuition on time and find gainful employment to pay off their student loans.
The sales pitch for a college degree in this country has become straightforward: “Come to our institution, you will get a job, and have to do minimal work.” That many more nobly-minded faculty and administrators have pushed against this general trend seems to have done little to diminish the ubiquity of such attitudes.
The end result of this factory model of education has been to encourage all institutions to focus ceaselessly on growing enrollment, providing hard technical skills to their students and standing out through the construction of ever more student amenities.
The near universal nature of these goals has started to blur the differences between once unique but now nearly identical universities. In the end, the traits that once separated such institutions as Indiana University and the University of Kentucky have started to be negligible. They only substantively depart from one another in location. This is because universities do not really need to be that different when the overarching goal — gainful employment — is shared by all institutions.
For some time, this model of education has worked. Maybe college was starting to feel sanitized, a bit corporate and unchallenging, but what did the average student care? The university sold a product the student wanted to buy. Everything else was just part of the cost of doing business.
However, in the last 10 years, universities have struggled to sell their product. The state of the economy has laid bare the sad reality that a college degree is no guarantee of a good job and that there are, in fact, easier ways to gain financial stability. As such, record numbers of students have started to turn their backs on college education. The cost of a diploma is steadily rising while the chance of a good job diminishes. Why should your average citizen go to college under such circumstances?
To add to this problem, the rise of artificial intelligence has called into question many programs designed for job training. The one thing AI does exceptionally well is produce content based upon data scraping and basic unchanging skill sets. In short, jobs are almost certainly about to change drastically. Contrary to the common view, knowing how to use AI will not be good enough to keep a job. Employment will instead hinge on being able to do non-skills-based work that AI is simply incapable of doing.
That many young people feel that higher education has nothing to offer them is far less concerning than the fact that universities seem to have no good answer to the challenge. Most admissions counselors and administrators protest that their institutions really do offer a chance at significantly better material well-being than not going to college. The idea that college may exist for some reason other than producing employees entirely eludes them. If one did not know better, they could conclude that college really serves no higher purpose — that teaching technical skills that lead to employment is the foundation of all learning. Nothing could be further from the truth.

The word education comes from Latin and means roughly “to lead forth.” This odd expression prompts an obvious question: which way is forth? How do we know what direction to go? Education, by its nature, is meant to equip students to answer this question. In other words, the point of education is to teach people to think for themselves and not how to write a good press release or balance a spreadsheet (though if you can think for yourself, such tasks are bound to become easier). This is the heart of what is called a liberal arts education, instead of the skills- based education that is more common today.
At first blush, a liberal arts education sounds very theoretical but it is actually a deeply practical thing. The word liberal refers to the ancient Roman word libertas, which means “free.” The very practical objective of a liberal arts education is to make people free — to teach students how to think for themselves and thus how to exercise their freedom. For true liberty is not just the ability to do whatever we want but instead being able to apply our judgment to situations so that we can determine the right course of action. Though this ability to make judgements is useful to any human being it is vitally important in a democratic nation like ours. After all, how can we be good citizens if we lack the ability to make sound, independent decisions about the world around us?
If a liberal arts education is more important than ever and the superficiality of modern higher education is destroying universities across the nation, then how do we bring liberal arts education back to Kentucky after decades of decline?
The first step is tackling the shortsighted administrators at Kentucky’s public universities. The vast majority of individuals who run our commonwealth’s institutions of higher education have been trained in the factory model of a university. They do not even contemplate teaching students how to think. They do not offer a robust answer to the challenges universities currently face. They do not, in fact, understand the purpose of an education. Instead, they mass produce students the way some factories make batteries or automobiles. In addition to this systemic misinterpretation of the purpose of college, our state schools are largely managed by massive, bloated bureaucratic apparatuses.











For too long general education has been viewed, by both students and administrators, as a nuisance that must be gotten out of the way. However, there is almost nothing as important as ensuring that students really do learn how to be well-rounded thinkers and not just hyper-focused specialists.


The Kentucky Council on Postsecondary Education could take drastic steps to trim unnecessary administrative bulk and pressure universities to promote new, dynamic, leaders who truly understand the rapidly changing realities of education.
Second, we need to restore academic rigor to our universities. It is no secret that Kentucky is struggling economically. Having a workforce who is thoughtful, well rounded and trained for hard work would do a great deal to change this sad reality. Our universities must take a deep dive into every single program they offer and ensure that professors are crafting courses that demand serious effort from students. More than this, we must guarantee that classes are not simply teaching skills that can be easily learned and quickly memorized. Not only are such topics of study at prime risk of being eliminated by artificial intelligence but they also do not really teach students the sort of independent judgment that is the hallmark of a good education.
In addition, universities must reform their general education curriculum. For too long general education has been viewed, by both students and administrators, as a nuisance that must be gotten out of the way. However, there is almost nothing as important as ensuring that students really do learn how to be well-rounded thinkers and not just hyper-focused specialists.
Third, we all need to do a better job of helping the next generation of young people understand that the sole purpose of education is not a job.
To be sure, employment is important to a good life. However, many students today have been taught since childhood that getting a good job is the same thing as living a good life. Nothing could be further from the truth. A nice job is no guarantor of happiness or moral virtue. So while preparation for employment is an important part of growing up, our students need to understand that they must look for more in their education. Especially as artificial intelligence shatters once stable career trajectories.
The ivy covered buildings and hazy lawns of America’s colleges and universities have become ground zero for the culture wars. To many conservatives these aged institutions are seen as bastions of progressive indoctrination — vicious hubs of Hamas loving, D.E.I. trained professors imparting their bile upon the next generation. On the flip side, most people on the left see the current social work of higher education as invaluable. They argue that colleges and universities play a decisive role in calling the nation to rise above many of its worst impulses — racism, sexism, and all other bigotry — and instead become a more inclusive home for all people.
As important as the debate is, it often obscures the deep, systemic lapses of our higher education system. If we wish to make Kentucky a true beacon of learning for the rest of the nation, if we wish to propel the commonwealth’s economy, if we wish to create an educational system we can be proud of, we must set these culture war issues aside and alter the philosophy of our universities from top to bottom.

Santiago/Getty Images)BILOXI, Miss. — The Trump administration is developing a powerful data tool it claims will let states identify noncitizens registered to vote. But Democratic critics and data experts warn it could allow the federal government to vacuum up vast quantities of information on Americans for unclear purposes.
Some Democratic election officials and opponents of the effort fear President Donald Trump wants to build a federal database of voters to target political opponents or cherry-pick rare examples of noncitizen voters to fuel a sense of crisis. Republican election officials allied with the president counter that he’s helping states to maintain accurate voter rolls.
The Trump administration has rolled out changes to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, tool at the same time the U.S. Department of Justice is asking states for copies of their voter rolls. The timing, combined with questions about what happens to voter data uploaded to the program, has alarmed critics.
Trump wants Congress to pass a national proof of citizenship voter registration requirement and in March tried to unilaterally impose one for federal elections through executive order. But with the legislation stalled and the order halted by the courts, the citizenship data tool may offer a backdoor way to accomplish the same goal.
SAVE was originally intended to help state and local officials verify the immigration status of individual noncitizens seeking government benefits. But U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, this spring refashioned it into a platform that can scan states’ voter rolls if election officials upload the data.
The changes to SAVE, rolled out over just a few months and with little public debate, are “tinkering with sort of the bones of democracy,” said John Davisson, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington, D.C.-based research and advocacy group that argues privacy is a fundamental right.
“You’re talking about the voting process and who will be eligible to vote,” Davisson said. “And to take a system that is not designed for use in that process and repurpose it, really on the fly, without a formal comment process, without formal rulemaking, without congressional intervention — that’s pretty anomalous and pretty alarming.”
Previously, SAVE could only search one name at a time. Now it can conduct bulk searches, allowing state officials to potentially feed into it information on millions of registered voters. SAVE checks that information against a series of federal databases and reports back whether it can verify someone’s immigration status.
Since May, it also can draw upon Social Security data, transforming the program into a tool that can confirm citizenship because Social Security records for many, but not all, Americans include the information. NPR reported earlier on changes to SAVE.
“It is incredible what has been done, really since March,” Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray, a Republican who supports proof of citizenship requirements and the SAVE tool, told a gathering of state secretaries of state in Biloxi, Mississippi, last week.
Individuals registering to vote in federal elections must already sign a statement affirming they are citizens under penalty of perjury, and those who cast a ballot face criminal penalties and deportation. One study of the 2016 election placed the prevalence of noncitizen voting at 0.0001% of votes cast.
But as Trump has spread falsehoods about elections, Republicans have made purging noncitizens from voter rolls a central focus.

Democratic concerns were on display last week at the National Association of Secretaries of State conference, held at the Beau Rivage casino-resort in Biloxi. In interviews on the sidelines of the conference, Democratic secretaries of state voiced deep reservations — or outright opposition — about plugging their voter data into SAVE.
Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said Aug. 6 that the federal government appeared to be trying to take over election administration. She formally rejected the Justice Department’s voter roll request two days later.
Bellows said the Department of Homeland Security told her in a recent phone call that it planned to retain SAVE data for 10 years for “audit purposes only.”
“Just like the [Justice Department] is asking us to hand over an electronic file of all the voters in our state, it seems like the Department of Homeland Security is through this backdoor system also asking us to share voter information about every voter in our state,” Bellows said.
At least one state appears to have granted the federal government sweeping authority over any voter data it provides to SAVE.
Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales announced in July he had reached an agreement with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to access the newly expanded system for voter list maintenance. Indiana’s agreement allows the federal agency to use information the state provides for any purpose permitted by law, including criminal prosecutions.
Morales, a Republican, said in a news release that SAVE represented “another step in safeguarding the rights” of eligible voters. His office didn’t respond to Stateline’s questions.
The Trump administration has ramped up efforts to encourage state election officials to use the expanded program. The White House hosted a bipartisan “fly in” event for state secretaries of state on July 29. Multiple secretaries of state told Stateline that USCIS Director Joseph Edlow, who was confirmed on July 15, spoke at the event.
“The president is very much keyed in on voter list maintenance,” Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, a Republican, said in an interview — echoing other GOP secretaries of state who released statements praising the Trump administration after the meeting.










When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances.


– Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon


Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, a Democrat who attended the meeting, said he questioned how the federal government would handle voter information provided to SAVE. He added that the Justice Department’s request for his state’s voter rolls raised his level of concern about how data would be used.
“When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances,” Simon told Stateline.
The White House referred questions about SAVE and the event to the Department of Homeland Security and USCIS.
In response to questions from Stateline, USCIS didn’t directly answer whether the agency would share voter roll data with other parts of the federal government but confirmed it disposes of records after 10 years.
“The SAVE application is a critical tool for state and local governments to access information to safeguard the integrity of elections across the country. It’s no wonder many states have quickly adopted it, and we continue to promote the tool to other states and counties not using SAVE,” USCIS spokesperson Matthew Tragesser said in a statement.
“We look forward to continued optimization efforts and implementing more updates to SAVE.”
GOP pressure
Some Republican election officials and Trump allies have long wanted the federal government to take an expanded role in searching state voter rolls for noncitizens.
Last summer the Trump-aligned litigation group America First Legal, co-founded by Trump adviser Stephen Miller, encouraged states to submit to the Department of Homeland Security the names of individuals for citizenship or immigration status verification.
Some states did just that. Texas, for example, asked USCIS to verify the citizenship of some voters in September, and Indiana asked the agency to verify 585,774 voters in October. The same month, 16 Republican state attorneys general signed a letter criticizing Homeland Security, then under the Biden administration, for failing to work with states on verification.
Trump’s DOJ wants states to turn over voter lists, election info

After Trump took office, GOP state officials kept up the pressure. Twenty-one Republican secretaries of state urged Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in February to prioritize SAVE improvements.
On April 16, Indiana sued the department in federal court for not responding to its verification request last fall. USCIS announced an overhaul of SAVE less than a week later.
As the agency continues to remake SAVE, the tool will soon allow searches using the last four digits of a Social Security number, multiple state secretaries of state told Stateline. The agency confirmed the feature is under development and will be available soon but didn’t provide an exact date.
The change would mark another significant expansion of the program because most states collect the last four digits when individuals without a driver’s license register to vote.
Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican, said SAVE represents a better way to verify citizenship than a state law requiring voters to produce documents. “I think there’s a real opportunity for us to do a lot of this through just sharing of information and I think that’s what we’re seeing happen,” McGrane said in an interview.
Unreliable data?
But some voting rights advocates and experts on government data caution against an over reliance on Social Security data.
The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, a progressive policy nonprofit, has noted that Social Security only began tracking the citizenship status of all applicants in 1978 — meaning the database doesn’t include comprehensive citizenship information for older Americans. Additionally, Social Security may not always have up-to-date information on the status of naturalized U.S. citizens.
The nonpartisan Institute for Responsive Government also warned in May that since SAVE hasn’t used Social Security numbers to verify citizenship in the past, its accuracy and effectiveness are unknown. The success of the expanded SAVE program may also partially depend on whether it has adequate staff and resources, it said.
A 2017 Government Accountability Office report found that between fiscal years 2012 and 2016, about 16% of the nearly 90 million SAVE searches required additional verification, which the institute says often translates into federal workers manually checking files. Now that SAVE allows bulk searches, the need for manual checking could rise dramatically.
Nick Doctor, director of implementation at the Institute for Responsive Government, said in an interview that a tool confirming the eligibility of registered voters in a way that doesn’t burden individuals can be a good thing. But he emphasized that it depends in large measure on SAVE’s implementation.
“The changes that have been made to SAVE happened very quickly and, to my knowledge, we haven’t seen releases on the level of accuracy of that information,” Doctor said.
During interviews, Republican secretaries of state stressed that voters aren’t kicked off the rolls because SAVE can’t verify their citizenship. Instead, an inability to verify would likely trigger a follow-up process with the voter.
“Just because we get something back from the SAVE database, it’s not a cut and dry, especially on those they’re not sure about,” Hoskins, the Missouri secretary of state, said.
Still, Arizona illustrates why some Democrats worry about any large-scale effort to ask voters — especially longtime, older residents — to prove their citizenship. After the state discovered errors in how it tracked voter citizenship dating back years, election officials are contacting some 200,000 voters seeking proof of citizenship documentation.
Some have been casting ballots for decades without incident and many feel targeted, Arizona Democratic Secretary of State Adrian Fontes said during a presentation at the state secretaries of state conference. “They feel insulted when they get that letter,” Fontes said.










There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside.


– Charles Steward III, MIT political science professor who studies elections


Charles Stewart III, a professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies elections, said Arizona may actually point to the potential usefulness of SAVE. If Arizona runs its voter roll through the program, a list of 200,000 voters needing citizenship verification would perhaps drop into the hundreds, he suggested.
“There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside,” Stewart said.
Connecticut Democratic Secretary of State Stephanie Thomas told Stateline that every secretary wants tools to keep voter lists as clean as possible. But the details are important.
When she hears of something new, Thomas said she asks whether it’s the best option available and whether “the i’s are dotted, the t’s crossed.” She said she’s asked USCIS a series of questions about SAVE and is waiting on some responses.
“When it comes to voter lists,” Thomas said, “I don’t want Connecticut voters to be a guinea pig.”

But policymakers face a complex web of obstacles in crafting regulations, given the challenges of the technology and broader legal, political and social environments.
Chatbots have proven both helpful and risky for users.
“It’s the very versatility and accessibility of these AI chatbots that make them both a really exciting technology, a very usable technology, but also present some very real risks to users,” said Kira Allmann, chief policy analyst for the Joint Commission on Technology and Science (JCOTS), on Monday.
That day, Allmann provided an overview of chatbots to JCOTS, covering types of bots and policy issues.With the assistance of artificial intelligence, chatbots communicate in a user’s language to help complete tasks such as searching the internet or creating content.
However, experts have identified significant policy concerns with their widespread adoption. In some cases, users have developed unintended emotional connections with chatbots and may share private information with them. 
AI poses threats of discrimination and violations of civil liberties, ACLU says

Developers have also created chatbots that can be used for malicious purposes, such as stealing personal information, and chatbots themselves are vulnerable to data leaks. Other concerns include how they determine their answers and their ability to influence society. 
“It seems like this is going to be really challenging to find legislation to put guardrails around this,” said Del. Anne Ferrell Tata, R-Virginia Beach. “It sounds like even when they know, they still are interacting and it just goes right over their head.”
In other states, Allman noted, policymakers have introduced or passed legislation requiring chatbot disclosures and age-appropriate design features.
Commission staff identified three types of bots, each with different ways of interacting with users. AI assistants help with a range of tasks, while AI companions are designed to provide emotional support or social interaction. AI agents, by contrast, are built to understand their surroundings, process information, and take actions based on either programmed directions or their experiences.
Allman noted that as more users turn to chatbots for mental health support — and as they are increasingly marketed as emotional support tools — no regulations currently exist in the healthcare system.
“They haven’t been vetted by clinical professionals,” Allman said. “They don’t necessarily follow any particular kind of rules or regulations associated with what we might consider the health space. They really are just technological tools, but people are leaning on them heavily as mental health support.”
Other areas the group discussed included protecting vulnerable populations seeking mental health support from chatbots, addressing implicit and explicit biases, and focusing on the dynamics and outcomes of chatbot use rather than just the technology itself.
Del. Cliff Hayes, D-Chesapeake, commission chair, said while he looks forward to continuing the conversation but emphasized that the overview served as a reminder for lawmakers to always consider the human element in AI interactions.
“This might be a reminder to us all that as we’re dealing with this technology that we always, always, always keep humans in the loop,” Hayes said. “That’s going to be very important when you’re talking about spaces that govern. But then, what do you do when there’s no governance in place and an individual is actually interacting?”
 VCCS chatbot efforts

Virginia’s Community Colleges (VCCS) have used chatbot technology for more than a year, assisting students with a wide range of inquiries, from financial aid to enrollment dates.
In a May 2024 announcement, VCCS noted that providing around-the-clock student support can be “challenging undertaking, especially when budgets are stressed and resources are limited.” With the chatbot handling routine questions, staff have been able to focus on more complex issues.
At Tidewater Community College, email volume dropped by 60% and calls by 30% after the chatbot launched, according to Holly Whistler, coordinator for the Online Virginia Network.
“This reduction happened because users found the answers they needed, and staff was able to address other pressing and complex issues much sooner,” Whistler said in a statement.
Trump’s AI Action Plan removes ‘red tape’ for AI developers and data centers, punishes states that act alone

VCCS said last spring that the chatbot — developed by Intrasee — interacts with users at least 500 times a day. When the bot cannot provide an answer, users can still leave an email or make a phone call.
 Government’s AI efforts

According to the Virginia Information Technologies Agency, artificial intelligence is already used by many state agencies to “process data, produce automated decisions, enhance customer services and increase government efficiency.” 
Virginia is also deploying AI to support its education, workforce, and transportation systems.
In July, Gov. Glenn Youngkin took two major steps on AI. First, he signed an executive order to streamline state regulations and guidance documents. Second, he launched the AI Career Launch Pad, a platform developed in partnership with Google to help Virginians pursue careers in artificial intelligence. The hub is housed on the Virginia Has Jobs website, originally created to help federal workers find employment opportunities in the commonwealth. 
According to the governor’s office, the AI site offers curated, no-cost and low-cost learning opportunities, ranging from beginner-friendly courses on AI fundamentals and practical workplace applications to boot camps and degree programs through Virginia’s community colleges and universities. Virginia Works – the state’s new workforce development agency – will also distribute disburse career certificate scholarships to expand access to AI training programs.
Earlier in the year, Virginia’s Department of Transportation announced plans to use AI to improve cost estimates and pavement management, citing a 68% nationwide increase in highway construction costs since 2020.

St. Mary’s and Frederick counties kick things off Wednesday for the state’s 890,000 students, followed by nine other jurisdictions on Monday, according to the state Department of Education’s school calendar. Calvert, Montgomery and Prince George’s counties begin on Tuesday, Aug. 26, followed by Allegany County on Aug. 27. The remaining nine counties start school the day after Labor Day.

The new year sees the arrival of 3,000 new teachers, as the state continues working to address a teacher shortage, the implementation of a new math policy, and ongoing fights with the federal government over funding, which has been in flux since the arrival of the Trump administration.
Despite the surge in new teachers, school system documents show that some of the largest jurisdictions — Baltimore City and Baltimore, Montgomery and Prince George’s counties — had roughly the same number of educators as in the last school year.
It’s unclear how many of those new teachers for this upcoming school year are former federal government employees who were either laid off by the Trump administration or decided to take buy outs.
Education officials continue to assess how to decrease the state’s teacher shortage, reduce chr0nic absenteeism and continue to assess the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future education reform plan.
Meanwhile, professional development on a math policy approved in March will begin this school year, said State Superintendent Carey Wright and state school board President Joshua Michael during a back-to-school briefing last week.
The push is on to increase math scores, which ranked near the bottom half in the nation based on test results released in January. While Maryland fourth-graders improved from 42nd in the nation in 2022 to 39th last year on the National Assessment of Educational Progress, known as the “nation’s report card,” eighth grade students fell from 38th to 42nd in the same period.
Part of the math policy requires schools with students in prekindergarten through first grade to create a “heterogeneous mathematics classroom,” which will be for students with different skillsets or backgrounds.
Small-group instruction will be offered for students in grades two through five. Some students can receive individualized instruction who need additional support. Math intervention courses will be provided for sixth through eighth grade students struggling in the subject.
The state will also change the current three-year sequence for middle and high school students taught Algebra I, Geometry and Algebra II. Instruction will be done in a two-year period of integrated Algebra with elements of statistics and geometry.
The full math policy is scheduled for implementation by 2028-29 school year.
‘Still waiting’
Wright said during last week’s news conference at the state Department of Education building in Baltimore that the state received nearly $399 million this year from the federal government, about 8.7% less than last year.
State education leaders to local education officials: Follow state law

The money, which had been briefly frozen by the U.S. Department of Education this summer, is used for various initiatives that include aid to low-income students, summer and after-school programs and instruction for non-English speaking students.
“The good news is that the money is here. The bad news is it is less than [the prior year],” Wright said.
Meanwhile, the state continues to wait on $232 million in pandemic recovery funds from the third, and final, iteration of the American Rescue Plan’s Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief, or ARP ESSER, program.
All states were promised that money under former President Joe Biden (D). But U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon told state education officials in a 5 p.m. Friday email on March 28 that the Biden promise was being canceled, and reimbursements to states would be made only under narrow provisions.
“We are still waiting,” Wright said.
Michael acknowledged it’s been frustrating trying to work with the current federal Department of Education, especially when less than 10% of state funding comes from the agency.
“In some ways, this is the most inefficient department of education we’ve ever engaged with, and so that level of uncertainty and policy turbulence has our team focused on determining whether that piece of the pie that is critical for serving specific student populations is going to come or not, instead of focusing on supporting the 1,400 schools that serve our 890,000 students,” he said. “We’ve spent more time talking about federal funding at the state Board of Education in the past eight months than we have in decades.”
Parental advice
Besides being one of the state’s top education leaders, Michael is also a public-school dad, whose 4 1/2-year-old daughter, Caroline, will begin prekindergarten this month at Commodore John Rogers Elementary/Middle School in Baltimore City.
“We couldn’t be more excited to live in a state that values and invests in early learning,” he said. “My daughter’s future and that of 40,000 4-year-olds across Maryland will be better because of it.”
Like all parents, Michael said he will begin a routine before that first day of school, when his daughter arrives at 7:45 a.m. for breakfast. Some of that routine includes reading books to your child, creating a space for your child to do work, attending a back-to-school events and even walking your child into the school building once or twice a week to have informal conversations with school staff.
“These are things that matter. They seem so simple,” Michael said. “But they are so important in helping our children, one, understand how important school is, and two, that we just build that connection between home and school at the start of year.”

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)State housing officials are taking a lesson from the past legislative session and starting sooner, rather than later, to work out affordable housing priorities with county leaders.
While Gov. Wes Moore (D) announced a broad overview of his housing priorities Saturday at the annual Maryland Association of Counties summer conference in Ocean City, county leaders were briefed earlier in the week during a lunch discussion hosted by Housing Secretary Jake Day.
“We’re sharing those with you now, in August, so we can have a robust conversation,” he told two dozen county planning officials the Hilton Ocean City Oceanfront, “so that we can get feedback over the coming months as we go into the next legislative session.”
The discussion included what Day called a “pre-decisional” outline of housing bills the Moore administration is considering for the 2026 legislative session, which includes vesting rights for developers, streamlining development approval and facilitating the development of new starter homes.
Moore hints at coming effort to spur affordable housing construction

It’s months earlier start on an affordable housing package than last year, when Day began pitching Moore’s 2025 housing legislation to county officials in December. That package, which aimed to tie housing development to areas with high job growth, immediately came under fire from MACo because it limited county government say over some housing decisions.
The bill did not get its first hearing until March, in the back half of Maryland’s 90-day legislative session. It was heavily rewritten, replacing the administration’s proposal with language that granted vesting rights for developers, among other measures. It ultimately died in the Senate Energy, Education and Environment Committee as time ran out on the session.
This year, the conversation is starting earlier.
“The key word is ‘pre-decisional,’” Day told county planning officials Thursday. “We wanted to start making time for direct conversations with planners and housing officials in our counties and in our municipalities as well as across the state … [We] expect this to be the start of that relationship building, a start in that conversation.”
The current bill outline revamps last year’s effort to impose “vesting rights” so that a housing developer with an approved project proposal would retain the right to develop the property.
It also includes language aimed at facilitating the development of smaller homes by limiting a county’s ability to set dimension and square footage requirements, along with other prohibitions on specific architectural design requirements. There would also be limitations on lot sizes greater than 5,000 square feet in areas served by public water and sewers.
The priorities also include working to simplify the process of splitting larger lots into smaller ones, and ensuring that townhomes can be built in all areas that allow single-family detached housing.
Day said the focus on prioritizing development of “starter homes” and smaller single-family housing options across Maryland is intentional.

“We have a generation of young people that can’t afford to buy a home of their own. We’ve got a generation of seniors and growing population of seniors that can’t leave the home that they’re in because they got no alternative option to go to,” Day said, noting that the Moore administration wants “essentially a focus on startups and to try to build more, smaller product across our jurisdictions.”
The administration proposal also attempts to address the process of vesting rights, a debate that contributed to the failure of a bill in the 2025 legislative session. Day says that some projects get stuck in the approval process if local jurisdictions change building or zoning rules before they break ground. Vesting would protect a developer against changes once a project is approved.
“We are a late-vesting state,” Day said. “Meaning you can change zoning, you can change your building rules — you can change really anything after somebody submits an application for approval, essentially to deny something that once complied with the law at the point of application.”
Day also said the administration is considering legislation that would require jurisdictions to allow third-party permit approval to help speed the process of project approval by counties.
“Third-party approval offers an opportunity to say ‘hey, we have limited staff resources, we have limited capacity, and developers want things approved faster,’” Day said, though he anticipates that provision to generate some “consternation” at the county level as discussions continue.
Christopher Heyn, director of planning and land management for Carroll County, said his county has already looked into third-party permitting, and he is not sure how effective the process would be.
“We did look at that over the last couple years, and there were other jurisdictions that had enabled that,” Heyn said, “but when you talk to them, they said nobody’s using it.
“So you spent all this time setting up a program to allow third-party reviews for the development review process, but no developer was using it,” he said.
Day assured local officials that everything is still under discussion, and that the Department of Housing and Community Development will be reaching out to hear how different jurisdictions feel about the proposed legislative priorities, looking for where the administration and local officials can find common ground.
Moore’s remodeled housing bill approved by House; still needs Senate consideration

With several months before the next session, there could be several changes to these priorities as the Moore administration works with county officials to try to tackle the state’s 96,000-unit housing shortage.
“This is really important, we think, to share this now, that we discuss the conceptual framework around state legislation,” Day said, “So we can get ourselves to a place where we have something that everyone’s excited about and feels … has a meaningful impact on our housing shortage.”
Officials from MACo did not make an appearance at the Thursday meeting. Some MACo officials earlier voiced frustration, believing that the association was deliberately excluded from the event in response to its opposition to Moore’s housing legislation last session, among other concerns.
Day and other housing officials insisted that the Thursday meeting was open for all who were interested, though they did concede that MACo officials were not among the “target audience” for the discussion. The invites went out to specifically county planners and similar officials.
That said, Michael Sanderson, executive director for MACo, said it’s a good sign that “the conversation is getting started” now rather than right before the start of the next session.
“It’s a good sign for an open opportunity for some collaboration at a couple levels here,” Sanderson said. “Next step is to move past bullet point into bill language … I think we start sharing ideas about specifics.”

(Photo illustration by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Heading into the respiratory illness season, states and clinicians are working to encourage pregnant patients to get COVID-19 vaccinations, even though the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services no longer recommends that they should.
Along with being older and having an underlying health condition, pregnancy itself is a risk factor. Pregnant women are more vulnerable to developing severe illness from COVID-19. They’re also at high risk for complications, including preterm labor and stillbirth. The vast majority of medical experts say getting the shot is safe and effective — much safer than having the illness.
But HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced in May that the agency would no longer recommend that pregnant women get the vaccine. Before testifying before Congress in June, Kennedy circulated a document on Capitol Hill claiming higher rates of fetal loss after vaccination. But the authors of those studies told Politico that their work had been misinterpreted.
Experts say the federal shift puts the onus on state health agencies to ramp up vaccine guidance and outreach. Clinicians and public health organizations are trying to dispel misinformation and make sure information reaches low-income people and people of color, who had higher maternal death rates during the pandemic. During the first two years of the pandemic, the virus contributed to a quarter of maternal deaths, according to federal data.
“We are severely disappointed,” said Dr. Neil Silverman, a professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California, Los Angeles David Geffen School of Medicine. He has studied vaccines and pregnancy for the past 15 years and specializes in high-risk pregnancies.
Silverman called the federal shift a “public health tragedy on a grand scale.”
Vaccinations against COVID-19 help prevent severe illness in pregnant people as well as their newborns, who are too young to get vaccinated, Silverman said. In what’s called passive immunity, vaccinated mothers pass on antibodies to their babies through the placenta and through breast milk.
“State public health agencies are probably going to have to implement vaccine guidance that differs from the federal recommendations. And that’s going to be an interesting can of worms,” said OB-GYN Dr. Mark Turrentine, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas.
Turrentine serves on a board of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists that focuses on immunization and infectious diseases. He said his recent pregnant patients who had COVID-19 hadn’t gotten the vaccine.
“The change in guidance on the federal level just really makes a lot of confusion, and it makes it very challenging to try to explain to individuals why all of a sudden the difference,” Turrentine said.
A slew of public health organizations have been making a concerted effort to dispel vaccine myths. They include the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit organization of maternal-fetal experts. At a news briefing the society held this month, clinicians stressed the safety and long-standing science behind COVID-19 vaccines, as well as the shots for RSV and the flu. Cases of RSV and the flu tend to peak in the winter months, while in recent years COVID-19 cases have spiked in the summer and the winter.
Dr. Brenna Hughes, an OB-GYN who chairs the organization’s infectious diseases and emerging threats committee, pointed to survey data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing that less than a third of eligible pregnant patients received COVID-19 shots, and only 38% received RSV shots for the 2023 to 2024 season. Less than half — 47% — received flu shots, and 59% received TDAP (whooping cough) vaccines.
CDC data shows that for last year’s and this year’s season, only between 12% and 14% of pregnant patients got the COVID-19 vaccine.
“The complications from the infection are so much greater than the complications and the very few and typically minor adverse events that might occur from the vaccine,” said microbiologist Sabra Klein, a professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
In June, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and 30 other professional health organizations signed a letter urging insurers to continue covering the COVID-19 shot for pregnant women, and have continued to urge coverage since then.
CVS Caremark, one of the nation’s three major pharmacy benefit managers, told Stateline it will continue covering the vaccine for pregnant women. The Arizona, California and North Carolina state Medicaid agencies also told Stateline they are still currently covering COVID-19 vaccines for pregnant women.
Dr. Kimberly Fortner, president-elect of the Infectious Diseases Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology, said during the maternal-fetal medicine briefing that she hopes medical groups’ joint messaging will bolster insurers.
“Hopefully by us linking arms, that can then help develop consistency so that insurers will continue to pay for the vaccine,” she said.
 Exacerbating disparities

Dr. Ayanna Bennett, director of the District of Columbia Department of Health, said the federal government’s new stance has upended “a system that’s been stable for a very long time.”
Bennett said her agency used federal pandemic aid to shore up vaccine outreach efforts to communities of color. Now that flow of money is ending.
The changes in federal guidance and funding will “almost certainly exacerbate” maternal health disparities, said Marie Thoma, a perinatal epidemiologist and an associate professor in the University of Maryland Department of Family Science who researches pregnancy and COVID-19.
Black and Indigenous women died at higher rates. The virus exacerbated existing racial disparities in maternal health — and created new ones: Latina mothers, who generally see low rates of maternal mortality, saw deaths surge to 28 per 100,000 in 2021. Their rate was about 12 per 100,000 in 2018, according to federal data.
“We are going in with some exposure already that we didn’t have during the start of the pandemic. So, there will be some protection, but now that will erode,” said Thoma. “If we’re not getting vaccines, or if people are hesitant to take them, we could see some increase.”
Silverman said the administration’s efforts to strip mentions of race from government policies makes it difficult for institutions to reach populations at greatest risk. He called the dismissal of decades of data “saddening and infuriating.”
“The politicization of the vaccine process, or access to it, is what concerns me the most,” said Dr. Yvette Martas, a Connecticut OB-GYN who chairs the board of directors of the Hispanic Health Council.
Many women “are trying to navigate an economic system that’s not always in their favor in terms of also providing access to the kind of educational material that they need,” she said.
 Not just COVID-19

In June, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee, replacing them with some members who are vaccine skeptics.
The change is creating chaos. Some states have vaccine laws, such as mandates for kids and coverage statutes, that are specifically tied to the committee’s decisions.
The Vaccine Integrity Project at the University of Minnesota called on frontline health workers, health officials and professional societies to “counter the spread of inaccurate and confusing vaccine information.”
At a news briefing this month held by the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, representatives from Alabama, Connecticut and Washington, D.C., said they will continue to recommend vaccines.
Alabama’s state health officer, Dr. Scott Harris, said clinicians will be instrumental in getting correct vaccination information to patients.
“We don’t think that we necessarily have the same authoritative voice that we might have had a decade ago in trying to guide people in what to do, but we do believe that people trust their health care providers in most cases and are certainly willing to listen to them,” he said at the briefing.
Bennett said she is hopeful that strong, consistent messaging from respected medical organizations will help combat confusion.
“Having established groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics or the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology make very firm recommendations that keep us essentially not changed from where we have been, I think, should reassure families,” she said.

(Courtesy photo)Advertisements promoting the abortion pill will be at gas stations across West Virginia and Kentucky over the next few weeks.
Mayday Health, a New York-based health education nonprofit, will run the ads at 104 rural gas stations through Sept. 7. The campaign started Aug. 11.
The advertisements say “Pregnant? Don’t want to be? Learn more at Mayday Health.”
Executive director Liv Raisner said it’s crucial to advertise at gas stations, which serve as community hubs in rural areas.
“Many rural counties in West Virginia and Kentucky have few or no OB-GYN providers. Some have lost their only hospitals, their only clinics,” Raisner said. “So routine education and preventative reproductive health information is much harder to access through traditional medical channels. And so that’s why we decided to advertise at gas stations.”
The organization started after the Supreme Court overturned Roe V. Wade and the constitutional right to abortion in 2022.
“We heard this sobering statistic that only 10% of Americans even knew what abortion pills were,” Raisner said. “And with clinics closed, reproductive options became very limited for women across the United States. We knew that a massive education campaign needed to be executed to inform people that they still have options.”
According to the Guttmacher Institute, in 2023, medication abortion accounted for 63% of all abortions in the United States, up from 53% in 2020.
In 2022, West Virginia lawmakers passed a law banning abortion with narrow exceptions. Earlier this summer, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the ban in a challenge brought by abortion pill manufacturer GenBioPro.
Despite abortion being illegal in West Virginia in most cases, Raisner said the organization does not fear legal repercussions from the campaign.
“We don’t have concerns about advertising because we don’t sell, distribute or package abortion pills,” they said. “We’re merely spreading First Amendment-protected free speech. So if anyone wants to come after us, what they’re coming after is the First Amendment.”
Earlier this year, Mayday Health launched a digital billboard and poster campaign in Tennessee and an aerial campaign above the Indy 500.
While abortion is mostly illegal in West Virginia, states with abortion bans may have trouble prosecuting out-of-state providers and entities mailing pills to people within their borders.
Since the Supreme Court struck down Roe V. Wade, 22 states and Washington D.C. have enacted shield laws that protect patients, providers and people assisting in abortion from the reach of states where it’s illegal, according to KFF. Some shield laws protect providers who send abortion pills to people in states with abortion bans.
Earlier this year, the West Virginia Senate passed a bill aimed at out-of-state providers that would have made it a felony to prescribe or distribute medications used for abortion to people in West Virginia unless the abortion is legal. The bill was not taken up by the House of Delegates.
West Virginia Attorney General J.B. McCuskey recently signed on to a letter urging Congress to ban shield laws, calling them “blatant attempts to interfere with states’ ability to enforce criminal laws within their borders.”
“People in [states with abortion bans] should be and are empowered to make their own decisions,” Raisner said.
The website directs people to sites where they can order abortion medication.
People who visit Mayday Health are also linked to a helpline where they can get free, private advice on state specific abortion laws, they said. The group encourages website visitors to reach out to a hotline where a group of doctors provide free advice.
Raisner said it’s also important for people to know that abortion pills are safe and effective. 
“There’s so much misinformation peddled by the anti-choice movement about the dangers of abortion pills, and it’s just not true,” Raisner said. “Abortion pills are so safe that they are even sold over the counter in some foreign countries.
“Clinics are closing across the country, but people everywhere still have the power to make the choices that are right for their reproductive health,” they said.

Dr. Ayanna Bennett, director of the District of Columbia Department of Health, said the federal government’s new stance has upended “a system that’s been stable for a very long time.”
Bennett said her agency used federal pandemic aid to shore up vaccine outreach efforts to communities of color. Now that flow of money is ending.
The changes in federal guidance and funding will “almost certainly exacerbate” maternal health disparities, said Marie Thoma, a perinatal epidemiologist and an associate professor in the University of Maryland Department of Family Science who researches pregnancy and COVID-19.
Black and Indigenous women died at higher rates. The virus exacerbated existing racial disparities in maternal health — and created new ones: Latina mothers, who generally see low rates of maternal mortality, saw deaths surge to 28 per 100,000 in 2021. Their rate was about 12 per 100,000 in 2018, according to federal data.
“We are going in with some exposure already that we didn’t have during the start of the pandemic. So, there will be some protection, but now that will erode,” said Thoma. “If we’re not getting vaccines, or if people are hesitant to take them, we could see some increase.”
Silverman said the administration’s efforts to strip mentions of race from government policies makes it difficult for institutions to reach populations at greatest risk. He called the dismissal of decades of data “saddening and infuriating.”
“The politicization of the vaccine process, or access to it, is what concerns me the most,” said Dr. Yvette Martas, a Connecticut OB-GYN who chairs the board of directors of the Hispanic Health Council.
Many women “are trying to navigate an economic system that’s not always in their favor in terms of also providing access to the kind of educational material that they need,” she said.
 Not just COVID-19

In June, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee, replacing them with some members who are vaccine skeptics.
The change is creating chaos. Some states have vaccine laws, such as mandates for kids and coverage statutes, that are specifically tied to the committee’s decisions.

The Vaccine Integrity Project at the University of Minnesota called on frontline health workers, health officials and professional societies to “counter the spread of inaccurate and confusing vaccine information.”
At a news briefing this month held by the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, representatives from Alabama, Connecticut and Washington, D.C., said they will continue to recommend vaccines.
Alabama’s state health officer, Dr. Scott Harris, said clinicians will be instrumental in getting correct vaccination information to patients.
“We don’t think that we necessarily have the same authoritative voice that we might have had a decade ago in trying to guide people in what to do, but we do believe that people trust their health care providers in most cases and are certainly willing to listen to them,” he said at the briefing.
Bennett said she is hopeful that strong, consistent messaging from respected medical organizations will help combat confusion.
“Having established groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics or the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology make very firm recommendations that keep us essentially not changed from where we have been, I think, should reassure families,” she said.

Monday Creek Watershed flows 27 miles through parts of Athens, Hocking, and Perry counties and drains into the Hocking River south of Nelsonville, but it is heavily polluted by acid mine drainage, which is contaminated water formed when iron is exposed to the air and water. The acid mine drainage is caused by pre-regulated mining and makes it nearly impossible for aquatic life to survive in that environment.

“Water is extremely important to communities and sustainability,” said Rural Action Watershed Program Director Nate Schlater. “We all need water to live.”
The United States Department of Agriculture ranked Monday Creek as the third most severely acid drainage polluted stream in Ohio in 1985 and Rural Action has been doing watershed restoration work since 1994. 
“These streams, which were nearly completely devoid of life, have seen vast improvements in chemical and biological water quality because of the work of this coalition,” said Matt Ledford, a Rural Action water quality specialist. 
Clean water is necessary for a healthy ecosystem, he said. 
“Human health and development – everything from drinking water, groundwater recharge, flood management and much more rely on a healthy, functioning ecosystem,” Ledford said. 
Monday Creek was once considered a dead stream, meaning it lacked aquatic life. 
“That is typically the result of pre-regulation abandoned coal mine impacts and the acidic water and the metals associated with those impacts and discharges,” Schlater said.
Today, 37 fish species have either returned to Monday Creek or are living in Monday Creek, Schlater said. 
“That is the result of treatment and reclamation of pre-regulation coal mining issues,” he said. “… Some of those had lived there early on, but most of those had not been there for the past 100 years. … It’s literally life and death for biology and aquatic life in these streams.”
But there is still work to be done as Schlater recently found only two species of fish in a tributary to Monday Creek. 
“That’s essentially as poor as it can get,” he said. 
Rural Action does weekly maintenance on Monday Creek and uses limestone dosers filled with pulverized limestone to help neutralize the acidity.  
“It’s ricotta lasagna,” Ledford said on a recent weekly maintenance trip upon seeing the limestone mix with the acid mine drainage in the water. 
The weekly maintenance involves several stops at various points along Monday Creek to check the water’s pH levels. Seven is a neutral pH level. 
“The lime is going to drive the pH level up, drive it up from like a two or three to like a 10,” he said. “… So then you’re gonna have highly alkaline water from here … hopefully that’ll bring the pH down … once it mixes into (the acid mine drainage), it gets diluted, and then we’re back down around seven.” 
A lot of the Rural Action’s watershed program focuses on abandoned mine land restoration, Schlater said. 
“We’ve seen around 74 stream miles improved as a result of that work in the areas that we’re focusing on,” Schlater said.  
The watershed program also focuses on non-point source water quality impairments, which is a pollution source that is not coming from a regulated pipe.  
“Non-point source would be water that runs onto the field and it brings a bunch of nutrients and sediment out of the field with it, into the creek, and that causes some pollution into the creek,” Schlater said. “There’s a lot of stormwater inputs from upstream that are causing sediment and nutrients and stuff to enter the streamways, but it’s not coming from a regulated pipe of any type.”
Coal mining in Ohio
Coal mining in Ohio started around 1800 and was unregulated until the Strip Coal Mining Act took effect in 1947, according to the Ohio Department of Natural Resources. More than 3.7 billions of coal have been mined in Ohio since 1800, according to ODNR.
Belmont County has produced the most coal in Ohio, followed by Harrison and Jefferson counties, according to ODNR. Perry, Athens, Tuscarawas, Guernsey, Meigs, Muskingum and Noble counties are also considered historically high coal producing counties.  
There were 1,155 underground mines operating in Ohio in 1898, compared to seven in 2003, according to ODNR. 
 “There’s so many square miles of underground mines here,” Ledford said. “They mined everything here. Before coal, it was clay (and) timber. Coal mining was obviously the biggest money maker. It powered the Industrial Revolution.”
Regulated mining still takes place in Ohio today. There were 26 surface mines in Athens, Belmont, Columbiana, Guernsey, Harrison, Jackson, Noble, Tuscarawas and Vinton counties in 2023, according to ODNR. There were two underground mines in Harrison County in 2023.
“Any mining of any sort of anything is going to cause those effects,” Ledford said. “These things are regulated now and effects aren’t just completely devastating as they were and continue to be, but they’re still bad.”

The Trump administration has threatened the city over its sanctuary policies. City officials say some officers violated the policy by assisting in the arrests.  (Photo courtesy of City of Rochester)The Trump administration is once again pressuring liberal cities and states to cooperate with deportation efforts, despite previous setbacks in court.
Attorney General Pam Bondi sent letters last week telling sanctuary states, cities and counties that “you better be abiding by our federal policies and with our federal law enforcement, because if you aren’t, we’re going to come after you,” she said in a Fox News interview. She demanded the areas answer her by Tuesday.
Cities and states with so-called sanctuary policies generally refuse to assist with immigration raids or accede to requests for local jails to hold prisoners for deportation. Those that responded to Stateline’s questions about the letters said they were not inclined to change their positions about cooperation with immigration authorities.
“It’s the tactic of a bully. And the only way to deal with a bully is to let them know that they’re not going to intimidate you,” Rhode Island Democratic Attorney General Peter Neronha said in a statement.
The Trump administration is attempting to force more cooperation with immigration arrests. But it suffered a serious court reversal on July 25, when a federal judge dismissed a sanctuary policies case against Illinois, Chicago and Cook County.
The state and local policies reflect a “decision to not participate in enforcing civil immigration law — a decision protected by the Tenth Amendment,” Judge Lindsay Jenkins wrote in an order now under appeal.
Bondi’s letters follow the Justice Department’s Aug. 5 release of a list of sanctuary jurisdictions including 12 states, the District of Columbia, four counties and 18 cities. That’s fewer jurisdictions than the 14 states and almost 500 counties and cities that appeared on an earlier list, which the agency withdrew after criticism that it included conservative counties that were fully cooperating with immigration enforcement.
The states on the new list are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington state. The list also includes some counties and cities in those states as well as in Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New Mexico.










It's the tactic of a bully. And the only way to deal with a bully is to let them know that they're not going to intimidate you.


– Rhode Island Democratic Attorney General Peter Neronha 


Other federal courts have issued injunctions to at least temporarily stop Trump administration from withholding unrelated federal funding from governments that don’t cooperate on immigration. Cities, counties and states have filed lawsuits challenging Trump’s executive orders targeting sanctuary policies, including a February order that federal payments to states and localities must not “by design or effect, facilitate the subsidization or promotion of illegal immigration, or abet so-called ‘sanctuary’ policies that seek to shield illegal aliens from deportation.”
“The executive orders are directing agencies to basically take a maximalist approach to putting pressure on local governments to cooperate with immigration [enforcement], even though they’re not required to do so by federal law,” said Jonathan Miller, one of the attorneys working on the California case for the Public Rights Project, a California-based group promoting civil rights protections for states and cities.
One city on the administration’s list was Rochester, New York, which disciplined some police officers for helping federal agents make a March arrest in the city. The city already faces a lawsuit brought by the Trump administration that prominently mentions the arrest of three men from Guatemala; one of whom has since pleaded guilty to re-entering the United States after a previous deportation.
States, sheriffs puzzle over Trump’s error-filled list of immigration sanctuaries

A spokesperson for the city, Barbara Pierce, said in a statement to The Guardian that, “Nothing in Attorney General Bondi’s letter is new and none of it has legal merit.”
“The letter reiterates many of the frivolous arguments that the federal government has already made in its pending suit against the city of Rochester,” she added. “These same arguments were levied against the city of Chicago and were dismissed by the federal district court for the eastern district of Illinois nearly a month ago.”
Ally Sullivan, a spokesperson for Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis, said in a statement that Colorado “is not a sanctuary state. The Governor continues to be frustrated by this mistaken and incorrect label.” In a televised interview earlier this year, Polis pointed out that Colorado fully cooperates with federal authorities on criminal matters. Immigration, he said, is a civil matter.
“In Colorado, we are improving public safety, apprehending dangerous criminals, cooperating with federal law enforcement on criminal investigations, and keeping our communities safe,” Sullivan said.
Nevertheless, Colorado faces a federal lawsuit brought by the administration over its alleged sanctuary policies. Polis signed a measure in May that limits local law enforcement’s communication with federal immigration authorities and restricts where federal authorities can operate within schools, child care facilities, hospitals and libraries without a judicial warrant.
ICE has a new courthouse tactic: Get immigrants’ cases tossed, then arrest them outside

Connecticut Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont in a statement said the state’s Trust Act, which the Trump administration has targeted as a sanctuary policy, was passed with bipartisan support and helps ensure local police concentrate on serious crimes. The Trust Act, passed in 2013 and expanded in 2019, limits information sharing and compliance with requests to detain immigrants for federal immigration authorities.
“Nothing about this makes Connecticut a sanctuary in any legal or practical sense — it makes our state one that upholds the Constitution, respects the rule of law, and prioritizes the safety and well-being of our communities,” Lamont said.

In a court hearing for the driver who struck him, State Police Col. Mark Hall called him one of the greatest troopers in the State Police’s history, WMUR reported at the time.
On Monday, Hall spoke about the fallen officer again, this time during a ceremony at the State Police barracks in Epping devoted to tightening and renaming a law meant to protect law enforcement or anyone else who finds themselves on the side of a busy road.

“From this day forward, this law will be known as ‘Sherrill’s Law,’ a lasting testament to Jesse’s service, sacrifice, and the values he embodied,” Hall said. “This legislation expands the original ‘Move Over Law’ to require drivers to move over and slow down for all vehicles stopped on the side of the roadway. It reflects Jesse’s enduring concern for the safety and well-being of others, something he demonstrated every day, both in uniform and in life.”
Roughly a month before the ceremony, Gov. Kelly Ayotte signed into law Senate Bill 273, sponsored by state Sen. Donovan Fenton. Previously, pursuant to state law, drivers were required to slow down and give a wide berth, if practical, to any vehicles partially or completely blocking a road following a crash, as well as vehicles involved in police traffic stops. SB 273 expands the law to include any “stopped or standing vehicle” displaying emergency lights or warning signals, such as road flares, traffic cones, or caution signs, and anyone inside or outside of their vehicle. The legislation also renames the “Mover Over Law” as “Sherrill’s Law.” The law goes into effect Sept. 13.
At the ceremony Monday, Ayotte signed a proclamation honoring Sherrill.
“Ultimately, what happened to Jesse Sherrill was preventable,” Ayotte said. “We have a duty to make sure we learn from what happened to honor Jesse’s tremendous legacy, and to do all that we can to make sure that this does not happen again.”
Sherrill, a native of Exeter, started his law enforcement career in 2001 with the Hooksett Police Department before joining the State Police in late 2002, where he served until his death. He was guarding a construction project the day he was killed. Jay Medeiros, the driver, pleaded guilty to felony negligent homicide and felony reckless conduct and was sentenced to a year in jail. He was accused of having marijuana in his system and in the vehicle.
Sherrill’s Law is one of a few traffic safety measures approved this year. House Bill 776, sponsored by state Rep. Terry Roy and signed into law by Ayotte this year, makes wrong-way driving an “aggravating factor” for driving while intoxicated charges in New Hampshire. That means drunken drivers who travel in the wrong direction face more severe penalties than in a typical DWI. That law was spurred by State Police troopers who told legislators they were having issues with wrong-way drivers in New Hampshire.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ayottesherrill-1024x630.jpg,,,2025-08-19 05:56:20.103520

A Kentucky church is urging its members to permanently remove books from the Shelby County Public Library by checking them out and never returning them. The books portray gay characters and historical figures or explore LGBTQ+ themes.
Pamela Wilson Federspiel, who has been director of the library in downtown Shelbyville, Kentucky, for 34 years, says the action is tantamount to “stealing.”
But three leaders of the Reformation Church of Shelbyville defend what they call an “act of civil disobedience.”
  Austin Keeler
“Yes — we have urged Christians, both locally and across the country, to search their libraries for books that promote sodomy, gender confusion, and rebellion against God — and if found, to check them out and never return them as an act of civil disobedience,” pastors Jerry Dorris and Tanner Cartwright and Austin Keeler, an evangelist with the church mission, Reformation Frontline Missions, recently told the Lantern in an email.
The library has “lost” 16 books valued at $410.85 since a member of the church checked them out last year with due dates in late June 2024, said Federspiel. Some of the books were written for children, some for adults. (The list of books is at the bottom of this story.)
Federspiel did not identify the library patron and said the books were never returned after several notices.
The titles include “The Art of Drag,” “My Two Moms,” and “My Two Dads.”
Chris Hartman of Louisville, executive director of the Fairness Campaign, said he has never considered “theft to be a form of civil action.”
He also said he has never heard of a church encouraging its members “to steal from a public institution. It is shameful, unfortunate, and disrespectful.”
Such activity often backfires by making people, especially young people, curious about the books and giving them more attention, he said.
  Author Sarah Prager
Sarah Prager of Boston wrote one of the 16 books the Shelby County Public Library has “lost.” It is called “Kind Like Marsha: Lessons from LGBTQ+ Leaders”  and  is for juveniles. Amazon.com says it celebrates 14 LGBTQ+ people throughout history, like politician Harvey Milk, scientist and painter Leonardo da Vinci, Mexican artist Frida Kahlo, and Marsha P. Johnson, who took care of her trans community on the streets of New York City.
“My book is not about sexual acts. It is about real, caring people — and what is wrong about that? A library must always have a diverse inventory.  We can never let that change,” Prager said.
Complaints about books increase
The church posted its recommendation to check out certain library books and not return them in a 2 minute, 57 second video on its Facebook page on June 1, 2024.  Church leaders said recently their message has not changed.
“Friends, the Shelby County Public Library is promoting the vile LGBTQ agenda to groom and trans children in Kentucky,” a script accompanying the video says.
“Would you help us expose what’s happening here?” it asks before providing contact information for two library officials and listing books the church found objectionable.
Complaints about books to public libraries are not new but are growing in Kentucky and the United States. There were 302 challenges to Kentucky public libraries in 2024, up from only 26 in 2023, according to the state Department of Libraries and Archives annual Statistical Report of Kentucky Public Libraries released in April.
But rare, if ever, is the practice condoned by the Shelbyville church for making books disappear from the shelves.
“Strategically checking out books with no plans to return them as a method of permanently removing certain books from local public libraries is not a common practice, at least not one that has been reported to KDLA,” said Jill Midkiff, a spokesperson for the Kentucky Education and Labor Cabinet and the Kentucky Department for Libraries and Archives (KDLA).
  Suzanne Trimel
PEN America, based in New York, tracks book bans and fights censorship across the country. Spokesperson Suzanne Trimel said she has never heard of the  book-removal tactic recommended by the Shelbyville church, though some conservative churches have urged members to seek public office to be in a position to censor LGBTQ+ books. She’s also heard of hiding controversial books where they aren’t likely to be found on library shelves
PEN America has seen censorship activities in public schools and public libraries intensify, she said, as public libraries have responded to pressure by canceling author visits and drag story hours.
Trimel said public libraries also have been under pressure from the “Hide the Pride” campaign, largely led  by a conservative Catholic advocacy organization called CatholicVote. In 2022, the leaders of CatholicVote estimated 50 to 100 libraries were targeted for “Hide the Pride.”
The campaign instructs parents to go to the children’s section of a public library and check out all “Pride Month” books on the display shelves. The parents return the books on time but place them on other shelves out of reach of children.
The Reformation Church of Shelbyville does not return controversial books removed from the Shelby County library.
The church’s stance
Pastor Dorris said the church became aware of the controversial books when a member took their children to the library and the “children were exposed to some of them. Upon investigation they discovered the remaining books.”
Like librarian Federspiel, Dorris declined to identify the patron. He said the family did not want any public attention. Records of books checked out by patrons of public libraries are not subject to Kentucky’s Open Records Act, said Amye Bensenhaver, co-founder and co-director of the Kentucky Open Government Coalition.

Dorris said he is uncertain where the checked-out books are now. “They have not been destroyed to my knowledge.”
He said his independent church, which “shepherds 357 souls,” is taking a “public stand against sexual perversion being pushed upon children through taxpayer-funded institutions.” It will continue to take that stand without apology, he said.
“This is not literacy — it’s grooming,” Dorris said.
Defying party, Ayotte vetoes school book removal bill, other Republican legislation

Asked about the removal of public property, Dorris said, “We reject the idea that civil rebellion is only legitimate when it’s done with rainbow flags or Marxist slogans. Civil disobedience is a biblical category when obedience to God and love for neighbor demand it.”
Dorris said that when the church discovered the controversial materials in the local library, it contacted Shelby County’s state senator and representative. It also contacted the library’s staff and its board members “to express our deep concern and call for action.”
“No library staff or board member ever followed up with us, no request has been made for the return of these books, and — tellingly — the books themselves have not been replaced. Not that we would return them — but the silence itself speaks volumes,” said Dorris.
Matt Burgin, president of the library’s board of trustees, said Federspiel told the board about the situation but no one else has ever contacted him about the books.
The library has handled it like other cases of overdue books, he said.

Dorris said he did talk to then-state Sen. Adrienne Southworth, R-Lawrenceburg, but he would not divulge their conversation. She could not be reached for comment. State Rep. Jennifer Decker, R-Waddy, did not return phone calls to her Frankfort office seeking comment.
Dorris stressed that the book action is not a formal position of the Reformation Church and “not every member of our church is aware of and agrees with these actions, and that’s acceptable. We don’t discipline or pressure members over strategy. These actions — like the permanent removal of library books — were taken by individual Christians under personal conviction. We support their right to act or refrain in good conscience.”
The library’s stance
The 16 books director Federspiel says are “lost” due to the efforts of the Reformation Church range in cost from $19.99 to $35.
The library offers a variety of books for a diverse community, she said. “All are library property.”
Library materials that are not returned are not available for other patrons, said Federspiel, who declined to have her photo taken for this article. “The library is committed to providing materials that meet patron needs. Materials that are not returned are not available for other patrons. Replacing lost material is costly.”
Amanda Perry-Davis, the library’s collection manager, said the library acquires books generally based on their popularity. That can be determined by various book reviews, journals and magazines. Library professional journals recommended the “lost books” as appropriate titles for each age level.
Patrons also suggest specific books to acquire, said Perry-Davis.
Federspiel, who is retiring at the end of the year, said several staffers also provide their input on what books to buy but the final decision is hers.
Federspiel said that most of the “lost books” had not been in high demand by library patrons.
  Shelby County Public Library, Aug. 5, 2025. (Kentucky Lantern photo by David Stephenson)
The library left a voicemail message with the patron about the overdue books and issued three other notices before turning the matter over to a collection agency, Unique Management, after 60 days, she said. The replacement cost is added to the patron’s card but so far the books remain missing.
Church has other targets besides library
The church has engaged in more public protests, including against a now closed Shelbyville bar and a fall fundraiser in Cynthiana in which people dress up as witches.
The church protested The Barrel Room, formerly a bar in downtown Shelbyville, for holding drag shows and the city’s conference center for allowing “drag queens to dance in front of children.”The church branded Cynthiana “a hotbed of witchcraft” in response to the Harrison County seat’s Witches’ Day Out event.
“These displays grieve the heart of God and signal our community’s descent into spiritual decay,” said Pastor Dorris. “We do not hate the men who perform in drag, nor the librarians, nor the critics who accuse us of being hateful. We love them enough to tell the truth — that Jesus Christ is Lord, that sin leads to hell, and that the gospel alone can set people free.”
The Barrel Room closed in October. Vicki Jones Lee, a local gay rights advocate, said she saw several drag shows there. “We would hear the protesters outside, making a lot of noise. The shows would just go on,” she said.
A spokesperson for the conference center said the center became the site for a Pride event in the summer of 2023 “to help it find a public venue.

James Smith, executive director of the Cynthiana-Harrison County Chamber of Commerce, said “Witches Day Out” is part of the community’s annual Halloween festivities. Participants dress like witches and try to raise money for a needy cause such as helping a family whose child had brain cancer
“It’s not a cult, it’s not a religion. Cynthiana’s Witches Day Out is a fun, community event with 130-plus vendors, food, readings, and a Victorian seance-themed Crystal Ball on the first Saturday in September in downtown Cynthiana to kick off the fall season,” said committee member Sam Lunger.
“But it is disappointing to hear anyone say it involves witchcraft. Everyone is entitled to free speech but this is misleading and out of bounds. We do provide a free space for the church protesters.”
Drag shows and witches are taboo to the church but it has given most attention to books.
Consequences
Dorris, the pastor, expects “some sort of reaction against the church” for its book removal efforts but does not know exactly what that will be.
“We know there will be consequences for saying what others are afraid to say. We will not be silent. We will not comply. We will not flinch. Our duty is to God, and our aim is the good of our neighbors — even those who revile us,” he said.
Madison Markham, a staff member on PEN America’s Freedom to Read team, said, “The alarming rise of book bans and censorship in the country is and will continue to have devastating consequences in our communities in the years to come.
“Regardless of whether you are a student, a parent, a librarian, an author, or a community member, this is an issue that affects all of us. Access to books with LGBTQ+ representation helps LGBTQ+ people and their families feel seen, and builds empathy. Everyone deserves the right to read and to be exposed to diverse ideas and experiences.”
Mark Adler, director of the Paris-Bourbon County Public Library and last year’s winner of the Kentucky Public Library Association’s Intellectual Freedom Award, acknowledges that community members have the right to voice their concerns about materials in a public library but suggested it be channeled through a reconsideration request.
Each individual library has its own reconsideration process, as each community is unique in its makeup just as the local library collections are, he said. “These reconsideration requests provide an avenue for community members to file objections while also providing a structured, consistent process for libraries to follow when requests are filed. We encourage community members who have questions to bring those directly to their local libraries so we can work with the affected citizens to address their concerns.”
Shelby County’s Federspiel concurred, adding a public library should always celebrate books for all kinds of people.
In 1903, when Andrew Carnegie built the library in Shelbyville and donated $10,000 to it, “he had inscribed on the floor as you enter …  ‘A University for the People,’ showing his dedication to unite communities,” she said.
“To this day, we proudly honor these words by acquiring acquisitions that celebrate both inclusiveness and diversity of our community.”

(Getty Images.)This story was originally published by Canary Media.

As the Trump administration aims to bolster fossil fuels at the expense of clean energy expansion, new research shows the oil and gas sector has so far failed to become a major jobs creator for heavily fracked areas of northern Appalachia.


“To the degree that we allocate resources to help develop that industry, we’re diverting those resources from other industries that actually could deliver” more jobs and higher per-capita incomes, said Sean O’Leary, author of the recent report from the Ohio River Valley Institute.


The report uses the term ​“Frackalachia” to describe 30 top oil- and gas-producing counties in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. As a group, the counties have smaller populations and a net loss in the number of jobs compared to 2008, just before Appalachia’s shale-gas boom began.


The counties’ growth in per-capita income also has lagged behind the national average, even as their nominal gross domestic product nearly doubled, increasing their share of the country’s GDP by 6%. Basically, comparatively high economic output from the counties did not produce higher-than-average incomes for their residents.


“Despite immense economic growth as measured by GDP, Frackalachia is in a position of actually having lost jobs since the beginning of the natural-gas boom,” O’Leary said. In his view, the numbers contradict pro-industry pitches for more oil and gas development.


“Whatever else it is, the natural-gas boom is not an engine for economic prosperity,” O’Leary said. He thinks the gas industry is ​“structurally incapable” of delivering lasting growth in jobs and income for the people living in heavily fracked areas. The Frackalachia counties have also seen relatively few jobs from ​“downstream” industries, such as the production of plastics, he added.


Oil and gas development is ​“highly capital-intensive, but not very labor-intensive,” O’Leary explained. Most earnings go to shareholders, investors, and suppliers based far from where fossil fuels are extracted, so only a small share of project income stays in the community to stimulate more economic activity.


Completed wells don’t need many permanent employees, O’Leary said. And many people who work in drilling and fracking come from outside the local area.


Canary Media’s review of data from the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services is consistent with that observation. From 2012 through 2022, the agency issued annual reports about the economic impact of the state’s oil and gas industry, including data for both ​“core” jobs and ​“ancillary” industries, which support oil and gas development.


More than half of the new hires for the core industry jobs in 2021 came from outside Ohio, according to the state data. Even in ancillary industries, nearly four-tenths of new hires were from other states.


Meanwhile, the state holds clean energy companies to higher standards when it comes to sourcing local labor. Solar developers who want to qualify for certain property tax relief must provide at least 70% of a project’s jobs to Ohio residents.

 Not so great expectations?

Canary Media drilled further into the figures from the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services to see how employment numbers compare to those touted by fossil-fuel industry organizations.


As of 2024, the core shale-industry sectors employed almost 9,100 people. The net gain compared to 2012 was about 860 jobs. Employment in those sectors peaked in 2017 at about 16,400.


Roughly 199,000 people worked in the industry’s ancillary sectors in 2024, for a net gain of about 30,000 jobs compared to 2012. However, the Department of Job and Family Services’ reports note that those ancillary sectors support other industries as well, such as engineering services, iron and steel mills, and construction of highways, streets, and bridges.


The Ohio agency numbers fall short of the 204,000 new jobs that an industry-funded report forecast oil and gas businesses might create or support. That analysis was published in 2011, in the lead-up to the 2012 law that set up the state’s current regulatory scheme for drilling and fracking of horizontal wells.


The agency numbers are also far lower than the 79,000 direct and 375,00 total jobs the American Petroleum Institute cited in a 2021 report based on data from 2019.


A communications representative for the American Petroleum Institute declined to answer Canary Media’s questions about that report or the new research from the Ohio River Valley Institute.


A spokesperson for the Ohio Oil and Gas Association did not respond to a phone call and emails seeking comment for this story.


The cyclical boom-and-bust dynamics that often characterize oil and gas development also impact jobs, said Gilbert Michaud, an assistant professor of environmental policy at Loyola University Chicago. In contrast, utility-scale solar could be built out over time, to offer ​“opportunities for a more stable and consistent workforce,” he said.


An analysis prepared by Michaud and others in 2020 estimated that utility-scale solar development could provide tens of thousands of jobs over the course of a few decades if the state encouraged it. That study came out before Ohio lawmakers added extra hurdles for most utility-scale solar and wind projects in 2021.


Now federal policy has also shifted away from renewables and in favor of fossil fuels.


“While this might spur some jobs in oil and gas, it will also take jobs away from renewables, which can be built nearly anywhere, not just in places like eastern Ohio that have shale resources,” Michaud said. ​“It will threaten a big renewable energy pipeline that has developed over the past decade or two.”

Mike DeWine still won’t endorse a successor, having consistently said that there is plenty of time for more candidates to get into the race. With more than a year until the midterms, that is already ringing true for the Democratic Party.
The clock is ticking.
“This race, really, kind of started early,” Gov. Mike DeWine said.
Millions of dollars have already poured into the race to succeed DeWine. Out the gate, the biggest named Democrat is COVID-era health director Amy Acton.
“They want to see leaders use common sense for the common good,” Acton told us in an interview Friday.
The doctor from Youngstown has already broken fundraising records for a Democratic candidate this early with $1.4 million, and she said bipartisanship will be key to her campaign.
“I will always be focused on Ohioans and whatever it takes to move them forward and solve the issues that affect their everyday lives,” Acton said.
Now that former U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown is running to reclaim a Senate seat, former Congressman Tim Ryan’s spokesperson said this has “renewed and heightened Tim Ryan’s interest in running for governor to further serve the people of Ohio.”
“I would love nothing more than for the Democratic side to have a competitive primary with multiple candidates because we have unprecedented unity on the Republican side,” Vivek Ramaswamy, the GOP-endorsed Republican candidate, said during a one-on-one interview, but followed up with similar sentiments this week.
Ramaswamy raised $9.7 million, also a record-breaking number for this early on in the campaign.
“I’m in this to unite everybody in the state of Ohio around a vision of economic growth,” Ramaswamy said.
The Cincinnati businessman also won President Donald Trump’s endorsement, but not from the top executive in Ohio.
DeWine — who has repeatedly avoided talking about Ramaswamy and has, on occasion, rolled his eyes at the mention of his name — and the 40-year-old businessman differ dramatically.
“Oh, there’ll be ample time,” DeWine said about his endorsement. “We’re still a long ways away.”
DeWine has continued to promote the work of Lt. Gov. Jim Tressel, who said in May that he is considering a run.
At a business event for Amazon in early August, Tressel was asked if he could match Ramaswamy’s fundraising and name ID.
“Well, I haven’t raised any money,” the lieutenant governor responded. “I’ve been busy at things like this because I see you guys all the time. Today is ‘Amazon,’ and it became ‘Intel,’ but it’s not ‘Jim Tressel’s future in this world.’”
But one thing is for sure about the DeWine endorsement.
“I’m the governor of the state, Republican governor,” DeWine said. “I’m gonna support the Republican nominee for governor and other statewide offices.”
Candidates have until early February to get into the race.
Other candidates who have started to campaign for governor include Republicans Heather Hill and Philip Funderburg, Democrat Jacob Chiara and independent Tim Grady.

States and clinicians are working on getting correct information on vaccines to vulnerable groups amid shifting federal guidance. (Photo illustration by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Heading into the respiratory illness season, states and clinicians are working to encourage pregnant patients to get COVID-19 vaccinations, even though the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services no longer recommends that they should.
Along with being older and having an underlying health condition, pregnancy itself is a risk factor. Pregnant women are more vulnerable to developing severe illness from COVID-19. They’re also at high risk for complications, including preterm labor and stillbirth. The vast majority of medical experts say getting the shot is safe and effective — much safer than having the illness.
But HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced in May that the agency would no longer recommend that pregnant women get the vaccine. Before testifying before Congress in June, Kennedy circulated a document on Capitol Hill claiming higher rates of fetal loss after vaccination. But the authors of those studies told Politico that their work had been misinterpreted.
Experts say the federal shift puts the onus on state health agencies to ramp up vaccine guidance and outreach. Clinicians and public health organizations are trying to dispel misinformation and make sure information reaches low-income people and people of color, who had higher maternal death rates during the pandemic. During the first two years of the pandemic, the virus contributed to a quarter of maternal deaths, according to federal data.
“We are severely disappointed,” said Dr. Neil Silverman, a professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California, Los Angeles David Geffen School of Medicine. He has studied vaccines and pregnancy for the past 15 years and specializes in high-risk pregnancies.
Silverman called the federal shift a “public health tragedy on a grand scale.”
Vaccinations against COVID-19 help prevent severe illness in pregnant people as well as their newborns, who are too young to get vaccinated, Silverman said. In what’s called passive immunity, vaccinated mothers pass on antibodies to their babies through the placenta and through breast milk.
“State public health agencies are probably going to have to implement vaccine guidance that differs from the federal recommendations. And that’s going to be an interesting can of worms,” said OB-GYN Dr. Mark Turrentine, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas.
Turrentine serves on a board of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists that focuses on immunization and infectious diseases. He said his recent pregnant patients who had COVID-19 hadn’t gotten the vaccine.
“The change in guidance on the federal level just really makes a lot of confusion, and it makes it very challenging to try to explain to individuals why all of a sudden the difference,” Turrentine said.
A slew of public health organizations have been making a concerted effort to dispel vaccine myths. They include the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit organization of maternal-fetal experts. At a news briefing the society held this month, clinicians stressed the safety and long-standing science behind COVID-19 vaccines, as well as the shots for RSV and the flu. Cases of RSV and the flu tend to peak in the winter months, while in recent years COVID-19 cases have spiked in the summer and the winter.
Dr. Brenna Hughes, an OB-GYN who chairs the organization’s infectious diseases and emerging threats committee, pointed to survey data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing that less than a third of eligible pregnant patients received COVID-19 shots, and only 38% received RSV shots for the 2023 to 2024 season. Less than half — 47% — received flu shots, and 59% received TDAP (whooping cough) vaccines.
CDC data shows that for last year’s and this year’s season, only between 12% and 14% of pregnant patients got the COVID-19 vaccine.
“The complications from the infection are so much greater than the complications and the very few and typically minor adverse events that might occur from the vaccine,” said microbiologist Sabra Klein, a professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
In June, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and 30 other professional health organizations signed a letter urging insurers to continue covering the COVID-19 shot for pregnant women, and have continued to urge coverage since then.
CVS Caremark, one of the nation’s three major pharmacy benefit managers, told Stateline it will continue covering the vaccine for pregnant women. The Arizona, California and North Carolina state Medicaid agencies also told Stateline they are still currently covering COVID-19 vaccines for pregnant women.
Dr. Kimberly Fortner, president-elect of the Infectious Diseases Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology, said during the maternal-fetal medicine briefing that she hopes medical groups’ joint messaging will bolster insurers.
“Hopefully by us linking arms, that can then help develop consistency so that insurers will continue to pay for the vaccine,” she said.
Exacerbating disparities
Dr. Ayanna Bennett, director of the District of Columbia Department of Health, said the federal government’s new stance has upended “a system that’s been stable for a very long time.”
Bennett said her agency used federal pandemic aid to shore up vaccine outreach efforts to communities of color. Now that flow of money is ending.
The changes in federal guidance and funding will “almost certainly exacerbate” maternal health disparities, said Marie Thoma, a perinatal epidemiologist and an associate professor in the University of Maryland Department of Family Science who researches pregnancy and COVID-19.
Black and Indigenous women died at higher rates. The virus exacerbated existing racial disparities in maternal health — and created new ones: Latina mothers, who generally see low rates of maternal mortality, saw deaths surge to 28 per 100,000 in 2021. Their rate was about 12 per 100,000 in 2018, according to federal data.
“We are going in with some exposure already that we didn’t have during the start of the pandemic. So, there will be some protection, but now that will erode,” said Thoma. “If we’re not getting vaccines, or if people are hesitant to take them, we could see some increase.”
Silverman said the administration’s efforts to strip mentions of race from government policies makes it difficult for institutions to reach populations at greatest risk. He called the dismissal of decades of data “saddening and infuriating.”
“The politicization of the vaccine process, or access to it, is what concerns me the most,” said Dr. Yvette Martas, a Connecticut OB-GYN who chairs the board of directors of the Hispanic Health Council.
Many women “are trying to navigate an economic system that’s not always in their favor in terms of also providing access to the kind of educational material that they need,” she said.
Not just COVID-19
In June, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee, replacing them with some members who are vaccine skeptics.
The change is creating chaos. Some states have vaccine laws, such as mandates for kids and coverage statutes, that are specifically tied to the committee’s decisions.
The Vaccine Integrity Project at the University of Minnesota called on frontline health workers, health officials and professional societies to “counter the spread of inaccurate and confusing vaccine information.”
At a news briefing this month held by the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, representatives from Alabama, Connecticut and Washington, D.C., said they will continue to recommend vaccines.
Alabama’s state health officer, Dr. Scott Harris, said clinicians will be instrumental in getting correct vaccination information to patients.
“We don’t think that we necessarily have the same authoritative voice that we might have had a decade ago in trying to guide people in what to do, but we do believe that people trust their health care providers in most cases and are certainly willing to listen to them,” he said at the briefing.
Bennett said she is hopeful that strong, consistent messaging from respected medical organizations will help combat confusion.
“Having established groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics or the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology make very firm recommendations that keep us essentially not changed from where we have been, I think, should reassure families,” she said.

(Getty Images)There is a classic Beatles song — “In My Life” — that speaks of “places I remember, all my life, though some have changed, some forever, not for better …”
There is a day in my life when I put all of the daily demands and distractions aside, and travel to a tiny town in Kansas to visit my father’s grave. That town is Tipton, and that date is Aug. 14. I have done this just about every year for the past 23. First and foremost, I do this to honor his memory, but also as a sort of therapy for myself so that I am reminded of my life’s journey, and how important it is never to forget my roots.
This journey begins on Interstate 70, but when I get to Colby, I turn onto U.S. Highway 24 and take it through Hoxie and other small towns until arriving in Osborne, whereupon I take the back way to Tipton.
The pace of life is different along that road, and in my mind the “mile markers” that I see every year are comforting in a way. Those mile markers might be an old combine that has not moved in 20 years, or a barn that has seen its share of Kansas weather over the decades. While it is often said that the only constant is change, and certainly in our turbulent world it is difficult to find stability, there is a certain peacefulness that I feel when going through these small towns, from interacting with folks at the local grocery store or gas station.
Kansas is often referred to as the heartland of America, and it would also be fair to say that many of the people in the small towns are good-hearted folks who show respect and kindness towards others.
Perhaps it is an overused phrase, but time seems to have stood still in these towns. That is apparent in Tipton. The Catholic church and the Catholic high school are old buildings, but they are immaculate. The same is true for many of the town’s other buildings and homes. There is a strong sense of community pride in this dot on the map. While many small towns in the Great Plains have had their share of challenges, Tipton is different. It will never be a metropolis, but the sense of community there has stood the test of time.
Before I went to my father’s grave on the 14th, I drove a few miles outside of town to the site of the old homestead. It is at the corner of two lonesome roads, and the house is no longer there. It was a classic two-story frame house, probably built in the 1920s by my grandfather and his family. The surrounding area is a mix of grazing land and crop.
When I got to the site, I parked the car, and just sat in silence for a while, reflecting on a lifetime of memories.
From this starting point in the 1950s, I never could have imagined where my life’s journey has taken me. That said, the roots are deep in Kansas, and that will always be the case.
Like the church and school, the Tipton cemetery is well maintained. It has been there for many decades, and the portion of it where family members have their final resting places is toward the back. Time does stop when I kneel next to my father’s grave. He was a lifelong farmer who also had a tremendous skill (self taught) for creating beautiful things from wood. For years, he exhibited his creations at arts and crafts fairs in Oklahoma and Kansas.
I remember speaking about his gnarled hands — made so by a lifetime of hard work on the farm — during his eulogy, while noting that those hands also made things of great beauty.
When I make this journey each August, I am never in a hurry to get there, and I am always slow to leave. I like to soak up the people and the scenery that I see along the way. And I like the chance to reflect on the things that are most important in this life. It is good for the soul to do so. Perspective matters.

If you’re confused about the aims, conduct and outcome of the summit meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin held in Anchorage, Alaska, on August 15, 2025, you’re probably not alone.
As summits go, the meeting broke with many conventions of diplomacy: It was last-minute, it appeared to ignore longstanding protocol and accounts of what happened were conflicting in the days after the early termination of the event.
The Conversation U.S.’s politics editor Naomi Schalit interviewed Donald Heflin, a veteran diplomat now teaching at Tufts University’s Fletcher School, to help untangle what happened and what could happen next.
It was a hastily planned summit. Trump said they’d accomplish things that they didn’t seem to accomplish. Where do things stand now?
It didn’t surprise me or any experienced diplomat that there wasn’t a concrete result from the summit.
First, the two parties, Russia and Ukraine, weren’t asking to come to the peace table. Neither one of them is ready yet, apparently. Second, the process was flawed. It wasn’t prepared well enough in advance, at the secretary of state and foreign minister level. It wasn’t prepared at the staff level.
What was a bit of a surprise was the last couple days before the summit, the White House started sending out what I thought were kind of realistic signals. They said, “Hopefully we’ll get a ceasefire and then a second set of talks a few weeks in the future, and that’ll be the real set of talks.”
Now, that’s kind of reasonable. That could have happened. That was not a terrible plan. The problem was it didn’t happen. And we don’t know exactly why it didn’t happen.
Reading between the lines, there were a couple problems. The first is the Russians, again, just weren’t ready to do this, and they said, “No ceasefire. We want to go straight to permanent peace talks.”
Ukraine doesn’t want that, and neither do its European allies. Why?
When you do a ceasefire, what normally happens is you leave the warring parties in possession of whatever land their military holds right now. That’s just part of the deal. You don’t go into a 60- or 90-day ceasefire and say everybody’s got to pull back to where they were four years ago.
But if you go to a permanent peace plan, which Putin wants, you’ve got to decide that people are going to pull back, right? So that’s problem number one.
Problem number two is it’s clear that Putin is insisting on keeping some of the territory that his troops seized in 2014 and 2022. That’s just a non-starter for the Ukrainians.
Is Putin doing that because that really is his bottom line demand, or did he want to blow up these peace talks, and that was a good way to blow them up? It could be either or both.
Russia has made it clear that it wants to keep parts of Ukraine, based on history and ethnic makeup.
The problem is, the world community has made it clear for decades and decades and decades, you don’t get what you want by invading the country next door.
Remember in Gulf War I, when Saddam Hussein invaded and swallowed Kuwait and made it the 19th province of Iraq? The U.S. and Europe went in there and kicked him out. Then there are also examples where the U.S. and Europe have told countries, “Don’t do this. You do this, it’s going to be bad for you.”
So if Russia learns that it can invade Ukraine and seize territory and be allowed to keep it, what’s to keep them from doing it to some other country? What’s to keep some other country from doing it?
You mean the whole world is watching.
Yes. And the other thing the world is watching is the U.S. gave security guarantees to Ukraine in 1994 when they gave up the nuclear weapons they held, as did Europe. The U.S. has, both diplomatically and in terms of arms, supported Ukraine during this war. If the U.S. lets them down, what kind of message does that send about how reliable a partner the U.S. is?
The U.S. has this whole other thing going on the other side of the world where the country is confronting China on various levels. What if the U.S. sends a signal to the Taiwanese, “Hey, you better make the best deal you can with China, because we’re not going to back your play.”
At least six European leaders are coming to Washington along with Zelenskyy. What does that tell you?
They’re presenting a united front to Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio to say, “Look, we can’t have this. Europe’s composed of a bunch of countries. If we get in the situation where one country invades the other and gets to keep the land they took, we can’t have it.”
President Trump had talked to all of them before the summit, and they probably came away with a strong impression that the U.S. was going for a ceasefire. And then, that didn’t happen.
Instead, Trump took Putin’s position of going straight to peace talks, no ceasefire.
I don’t think they liked it. I think they’re coming in to say to him, “No, we have to go to ceasefire first. Then talks and, PS, taking territory and keeping it is terrible precedent. What’s to keep Russia from just storming into the three Baltic states – Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania – next? The maps of Europe that were drawn 100 years ago have held. If we’re going to let Russia erase a bunch of the borders on the map and incorporate parts, it could really be chaotic.”
Where do you see things going?
Until and unless you hear there’s a ceasefire, nothing’s really happened and the parties are continuing to fight and kill.
What I would look for after the Monday meetings is, does Trump stick to his guns post-Alaska and say, “No, we’re gonna have a big, comprehensive peace agreement, and land for peace is on the table.”
Or does he kind of swing back towards the European point of view and say, “I really think the first thing we got to have is a ceasefire”?
Even critics of Trump need to acknowledge that he’s never been a warmonger. He doesn’t like war. He thinks it’s too chaotic. He can’t control it. No telling what will happen at the other end of war. I think he sincerely wants for the shooting and the killing to stop above all else.
The way you do that is a ceasefire. You have two parties say, “Look, we still hate each other. We still have this really important issue of who controls these territories, but we both agree it’s in our best interest to stop the fighting for 60, 90 days while we work on this.”
If you don’t hear that coming out of the White House into the Monday meetings, this isn’t going anywhere.
There are thousands of Ukrainian children who have been taken by Russia – essentially kidnapped. Does that enter into any of these negotiations?
It should. It was a terror tactic.
This could be a place where you can make progress. If Putin said, well, “We still don’t want to give you any land, but, yeah, these kids here, you can have them back,” it’s the kind of thing you throw on the table to show that you’re not a bad guy and you are kind of serious about these talks.
Whether they’ll do that or not, I don’t know. It’s really a tragic story.

Heading into the respiratory illness season, states and clinicians are working to encourage pregnant patients to get COVID-19 vaccinations, even though the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services no longer recommends that they should.
Along with being older and having an underlying health condition, pregnancy itself is a risk factor. Pregnant women are more vulnerable to developing severe illness from COVID-19. They’re also at high risk for complications, including preterm labor and stillbirth. The vast majority of medical experts say getting the shot is safe and effective — much safer than having the illness.
But HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced in May that the agency would no longer recommend that pregnant women get the vaccine. Before testifying before Congress in June, Kennedy circulated a document on Capitol Hill claiming higher rates of fetal loss after vaccination. But the authors of those studies told Politico that their work had been misinterpreted.
Experts say the federal shift puts the onus on state health agencies to ramp up vaccine guidance and outreach. Clinicians and public health organizations are trying to dispel misinformation and make sure information reaches low-income people and people of color, who had higher maternal death rates during the pandemic. During the first two years of the pandemic, the virus contributed to a quarter of maternal deaths, according to federal data.
“We are severely disappointed,” said Dr. Neil Silverman, a professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California, Los Angeles David Geffen School of Medicine. He has studied vaccines and pregnancy for the past 15 years and specializes in high-risk pregnancies.
Silverman called the federal shift a “public health tragedy on a grand scale.”
Health groups urge insurers to cover COVID-19 shots for pregnant women

Vaccinations against COVID-19 help prevent severe illness in pregnant people as well as their newborns, who are too young to get vaccinated, Silverman said. In what’s called passive immunity, vaccinated mothers pass on antibodies to their babies through the placenta and through breast milk.
“State public health agencies are probably going to have to implement vaccine guidance that differs from the federal recommendations. And that’s going to be an interesting can of worms,” said OB-GYN Dr. Mark Turrentine, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas.
Turrentine serves on a board of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists that focuses on immunization and infectious diseases. He said his recent pregnant patients who had COVID-19 hadn’t gotten the vaccine.
“The change in guidance on the federal level just really makes a lot of confusion, and it makes it very challenging to try to explain to individuals why all of a sudden the difference,” Turrentine said.
A slew of public health organizations have been making a concerted effort to dispel vaccine myths. They include the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit organization of maternal-fetal experts. At a news briefing the society held this month, clinicians stressed the safety and long-standing science behind COVID-19 vaccines, as well as the shots for RSV and the flu. Cases of RSV and the flu tend to peak in the winter months, while in recent years COVID-19 cases have spiked in the summer and the winter.
Dr. Brenna Hughes, an OB-GYN who chairs the organization’s infectious diseases and emerging threats committee, pointed to survey data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing that less than a third of eligible pregnant patients received COVID-19 shots, and only 38% received RSV shots for the 2023 to 2024 season. Less than half — 47% — received flu shots, and 59% received TDAP (whooping cough) vaccines.
CDC data shows that for last year’s and this year’s season, only between 12% and 14% of pregnant patients got the COVID-19 vaccine.
“The complications from the infection are so much greater than the complications and the very few and typically minor adverse events that might occur from the vaccine,” said microbiologist Sabra Klein, a professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
In June, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and 30 other professional health organizations signed a letter urging insurers to continue covering the COVID-19 shot for pregnant women, and have continued to urge coverage since then.
CVS Caremark, one of the nation’s three major pharmacy benefit managers, told Stateline it will continue covering the vaccine for pregnant women. The Arizona, California and North Carolina state Medicaid agencies also told Stateline they are still currently covering COVID-19 vaccines for pregnant women.
Black maternal health advocates, researchers press on amid federal funding cuts

Dr. Kimberly Fortner, president-elect of the Infectious Diseases Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology, said during the maternal-fetal medicine briefing that she hopes medical groups’ joint messaging will bolster insurers.
“Hopefully by us linking arms, that can then help develop consistency so that insurers will continue to pay for the vaccine,” she said.
 Exacerbating disparities

Dr. Ayanna Bennett, director of the District of Columbia Department of Health, said the federal government’s new stance has upended “a system that’s been stable for a very long time.”
Bennett said her agency used federal pandemic aid to shore up vaccine outreach efforts to communities of color. Now that flow of money is ending.
The changes in federal guidance and funding will “almost certainly exacerbate” maternal health disparities, said Marie Thoma, a perinatal epidemiologist and an associate professor in the University of Maryland Department of Family Science who researches pregnancy and COVID-19.
Black and Indigenous women died at higher rates. The virus exacerbated existing racial disparities in maternal health — and created new ones: Latina mothers, who generally see low rates of maternal mortality, saw deaths surge to 28 per 100,000 in 2021. Their rate was about 12 per 100,000 in 2018, according to federal data.
“We are going in with some exposure already that we didn’t have during the start of the pandemic. So, there will be some protection, but now that will erode,” said Thoma. “If we’re not getting vaccines, or if people are hesitant to take them, we could see some increase.”
Silverman said the administration’s efforts to strip mentions of race from government policies makes it difficult for institutions to reach populations at greatest risk. He called the dismissal of decades of data “saddening and infuriating.”
“The politicization of the vaccine process, or access to it, is what concerns me the most,” said Dr. Yvette Martas, a Connecticut OB-GYN who chairs the board of directors of the Hispanic Health Council.
Many women “are trying to navigate an economic system that’s not always in their favor in terms of also providing access to the kind of educational material that they need,” she said.
 Not just COVID-19

In June, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee, replacing them with some members who are vaccine skeptics.
The change is creating chaos. Some states have vaccine laws, such as mandates for kids and coverage statutes, that are specifically tied to the committee’s decisions.










The politicization of the vaccine process, or access to it, is what concerns me the most.


– Dr. Yvette Martas, a Connecticut OB-GYN who chairs the board of directors of the Hispanic Health Council


The Vaccine Integrity Project at the University of Minnesota called on frontline health workers, health officials and professional societies to “counter the spread of inaccurate and confusing vaccine information.”
At a news briefing this month held by the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, representatives from Alabama, Connecticut and Washington, D.C., said they will continue to recommend vaccines.
Alabama’s state health officer, Dr. Scott Harris, said clinicians will be instrumental in getting correct vaccination information to patients.
“We don’t think that we necessarily have the same authoritative voice that we might have had a decade ago in trying to guide people in what to do, but we do believe that people trust their health care providers in most cases and are certainly willing to listen to them,” he said at the briefing.
Bennett said she is hopeful that strong, consistent messaging from respected medical organizations will help combat confusion.
“Having established groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics or the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology make very firm recommendations that keep us essentially not changed from where we have been, I think, should reassure families,” she said.

Intersex people have always existed. How they first started to find each other, build community and forge a movement against medical erasure is a story that’s mostly gone untold.
A new book aims to change that. “Hermaphrodite Logic: A History of Intersex Liberation” by writer, comedian and historian Juliana Gleeson was released in June by Verso Books. It’s a roughly 230-page dive into the very brief history of organizing for intersex rights from the 1990s to present day.
Approximately one out of every 100 people is born intersex or with a sexual characteristic that does not fit neatly into the binary of male or female. Despite the prevalence of intersex conditions, Gleeson demonstrates how doctors’ views on gender evolved in relationship to intersex bodies, explaining that the history of intersex people is one marked by medical censorship.
For much of the 20th century, doctors have been operating on intersex babies to assign them sexes, often without fully explaining the consequences to their parents. After those surgeries are complete, the children can be left with painful irreversible conditions and a loss of sexual sensation.
Pediatric intersex surgeries, such as clitoral reductions or hypospadias repairs to move the position of the urethral opening, are performed routinely at children’s hospitals today. But as Gleeson notes, starting in the 1990s, intersex activists started to raise the alarm about the procedures and the devastating physical and mental toll many reported experiencing as a result of them.
The Intersex Society of North America, which shaped the early intersex rights movement, was founded in 1993. Today, its work is carried on by national nonprofit InterACT.
Gleeson admits that writing about contemporaries makes the story complicated to tell.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“I guess writing histories of living people is quite challenging, because they can contradict or undermine me very easily,” she told the 19th.
But Gleeson said she wanted to tell a story where intersex people, not their doctors, would be the protagonists. As a community, intersex people started to find each other and organize in the 1990s. So, that’s where Gleeson’s story starts, too.
“The truth of their treatments was left impossible for intersex people to reach individually, but was easily recognised when they gathered,” Gleeson wrote. “Then, they could intuitively grasp the shared wounding and neglect that previously isolated intersex people.”
As a result, intersex people started to name the harms they had experienced. Then, they dragged those into public view, shaming the doctors who had hurt them and sometimes even abandoned their ongoing care following those first surgeries.
“Few doctors would keep in contact with intersex children as they became adults,” Gleeson wrote. “So both medics and parents would be left balancing unknown harms done against sexist fantasies.”
According to Gleeson, those fantasies had little to do with research based on the lived experience of intersex people. Rather, they were rooted in the fears about what “might be encountered in the ‘locker room’ (or much later in the marital bed).”
Gleeson’s text details just 30 years during which intersex people went from being largely discounted by doctors to recognized and celebrated by President Joe Biden’s White House with an Intersex Awareness Day proclamation in 2023. The book does something that few others have aimed for: It speaks to intersex audiences, even if it is readable by the larger public.
“It’s addressed to intersex people and partly addressed to everyone who’s grappling with the history of sex, which is to say, all of us,” Gleeson told The 19th.
In the past five years, several hospitals have stopped performing intersex surgeries on infants, and intersex advocates have found growing support among the American public to halt the practice.
Gleeson’s book comes amid discussions of sex and gender prompted by Republican politicians aiming to push transgender people further from public life. The debate about gender often reverts back to rudimentary ideas about sex and the American understanding that there are only two of them. But the intersex movement, often overlooked and under-reported, exposes the reality that even sex can be a messy spectrum.
As Gleeson writes, “Far from being founded in decisive clinical science, these decisions were based more on crude assumptions, and eyeballing genitals. Medics would base surgical decisions on speculations concerning intersex children’s potential integration in locker rooms or performance in marital bedrooms.”
Gleeson hopes “Hermaphrodite Logic” becomes intersex history 101.
“I think there’s also a lot of original thinking, a lot of original points and observations, analysis and so on, which just comes from me [in the text],” she said. “I’m just interested to see where it goes.”

Jim Pillen's outlining of the state's property tax issues at the Columbus Area Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday, June 26, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)Did you know what the Bureau of Labor Statistics was before last week? If so, you’re one of the few. But now, whether its jobs data is right or wrong and what it means is all that the talking heads want to discuss.
Here’s some good news, though: Columbus has proven that you can ignore that debate. Because our business leaders, pairedwith smart policy, have delivered indisputable economic growth. And not only do we welcome anyone to copy our playbook, but we’re actively inviting workers and entrepreneurs alike to consider setting up shop here.
In case you haven’t followed the jobs back-and-forth, the BLS recently revised its national jobs reports down for May and June. While it had projected job gains of 144,000 and 147,000 for those two months respectively, it recently changed them to 19,000 and 14,000, instead.
What does that suggest? That the U.S. economy isn’t growing as fast as it had been. That just isn’t true here in Columbus. Over just the last few months, several businesses and major employers have rolled out plans to expand their operations.
For example, in May, Columbus Community Hospital broke ground on its state-of-the-art cancer center. This will both consolidate existing services, and create space for advanced treatments and cutting-edge technologies that give patients unbeatable care.
Just last week, BD (Becton, Dickinson, and Co.) announced plans to invest more than $35 million in its manufacturing plant here. Beyond creating 50 high-quality local jobs, this investment will help meet rising demand for BD’s syringes as well as increase resiliency across the U.S. health care system.
Small businesses around Columbus are growing, too. Recently, Blazer Athletics invested in automated welding equipment for constructing its hurdle line. This innovative tech speeds up manufacturing and frees Blazer’s world-class workers to create value in other places.
It’s reasonable to ask: Why? What is Columbus doing that works so well?
To start with, our people have bought into good policies. For example, in June, Columbus voters reauthorized the city’s economic development program. This program has helped attract key industries to the area through operational incentives and training and workforce initiatives, and thanks to Columbus residents, it will continue to do so for another two decades.
We’ve also shown how good policy goes hand-in-hand with real growth in housing. While much of the rest of the country faces a housing shortage of around 4.5 million units, Columbus has streamlined permitting, leveraged workforce housing initiatives, and used every other resource available to raise new homes and bring affordable apartments online quickly.
From 2020 to 2024, developers and community leaders built enough housing to bring in 1,200 new residents. And we anticipate adding another 1,400 housing units beginning in the next year, which would give 3,500 new residents a place to live while adding more than $280 in property valuation.
Earlier this year, Columbus City Administrator Tara Vasicek was invited to speak before the U.S. House of Representatives Housing and Insurance Subcommittee about the work we’ve done.
More recently, Richard Baier, who helps run the Nebraska Bankers Association, pointed to Columbus as a model of progress in his own testimony before Congress.
It’s our not-so-secret sauce of pairing good policies with private sector leadership that has helped Columbus achieve sustainable and consistent growth.
So, I’d encourage anyone interested in copying our results to ignore the talking heads as they debate jobs numbers, and to instead reach out. We’re happy to host you here in Columbus, walk you through what we’ve done and find ways to partner.

(Photo by Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)Ahead of a special legislative session to rebalance Colorado’s budget, Democratic lawmakers are briefing their constituents on the cause of the fiscal challenge and the policy solutions they will debate later this week.
“That (federal) tax law went right into our budget and shot a $1.2 billion hole in what was a balanced budget,” Rep. Bob Marshall, a Highlands Ranch Democrat, told a room of about 80 people in Lone Tree on Monday night.
Marshall said his events typically draw anywhere from a handful to a few dozen attendees. This time, the seats were full and people stood on the perimeter of the room to listen to his remarks.

It was an already-planned town hall, but Marshall coupled it with a series of events across the state hosted by the Colorado Democratic Party to explain the fallout of the recent Republican tax and spending cut bill to Coloradans. The congressional bill, backed by President Donald Trump, is also known as H.R. 1, or the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.
“We have such a unique budget situation here in the state and people need to know the ramifications in these big federal actions that will take effect for years,” Shad Murib, the party chair, said after the town hall.
State lawmakers are set to return to the Capitol on Thursday to begin a special session to address that hole in the state budget, which could be around $800 million due to that $1.2 billion revenue loss created by the federal law, which passed in July.










I'm usually very bipartisan, but it's very irritating being called profligate when we had a balanced budget, and meanwhile, the federal government has just put us in hock to the highest level since World War II.


– State Rep. Bob Marshall, a Highlands Ranch Democrat


To do so, Gov. Jared Polis suggested a handful of policy tweaks, including using up to $300 million in the state’s budget reserve, decoupling the state from the federal qualified business income pass-through exemption for business owners, allowing large taxpayers like insurance companies to prepay future taxes, expanding the list of countries Coloradans are prohibited from using as tax shields, and getting rid of some tax breaks for insurance companies. Additionally, the Legislature will likely need to find millions of dollars to cut in existing programs.
Colorado Democrats have played offense since Polis called the session by blaming Republican members of Congress for the budgetary shortcomings. All four Republican members of Colorado’s congressional delegation voted in favor of the bill. All four Democrats voted against it.
The reforms of the federal tax code, which Colorado is tied to through a “rolling conformity” structure, will result in a loss of $950 million in state corporate income tax and $460 million in individual income taxes, according to the governor’s office. Those are the immediate risks for the current fiscal year, as major changes to Medicaid and food assistance programs will take place in later years.
“I’m usually very bipartisan, but it’s very irritating being called profligate when we had a balanced budget, and meanwhile, the federal government has just put us in hock to the highest level since World War II,” Marshall said.
Colorado Republican lawmakers have blamed increased spending under a Democratic majority for the deficit created by the federal bill.
“It is not an overspending issue, because we cannot borrow and we cannot raise revenue because of (the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights). So we are spending to the TABOR cap, which is how much the voters have told us we can spend,” Marshall said.
TABOR is a constitutional amendment that sets a limit on how much revenue the state can keep and spend in a given year. It puts a limit on annual spending growth based on inflation and population growth.
Marshall said he will run two bills alongside Democratic Rep. Yara Zokaie, including the one to add more countries to the list of tax havens Colorado will not recognize. The new additions could be Singapore, the Netherlands and Ireland. Marshall will also sponsor a bill to further decouple Colorado from the Foreign-Derived Intangible Income deduction.
Kathy Boyer, a Democrat in Marshall’s district, said she usually attends his town halls.
“It was news to me that our Colorado taxes are so heavily based on our federal taxable income, so that explains a lot as to why the federal bill will be so detrimental,” she said.
Emily Haigh lives in Denver but went to Marshall’s town hall to learn more about the financial impact of the federal law.
“I know this is Lauren Boebert’s district, and I don’t like her, and I wanted to hear what someone from the district had to say, even if he’s a Democrat,” she said. “It was informative to hear what he had to say about it, and I felt like it was good to hear from someone that cares.”

But HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced in May that the agency would no longer recommend that pregnant women get the vaccine. Before testifying before Congress in June, Kennedy circulated a document on Capitol Hill claiming higher rates of fetal loss after vaccination. But the authors of those studies told Politico that their work had been misinterpreted.
The Florida Department of Health, led by Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo, a vaccine skeptic, took credit for the federal shift. Florida was the first state to recommend against mRNA Covid vaccines for healthy children in March 2022 and in January 2024 recommended against them for in all populations, including pregnant women.
“Today’s federal action, thanks to the tireless efforts of Secretary Kennedy, is an important advancement for parents, physicians, and children across the country,” Ladapo said in a written statement. “Ultimately, scientific evidence dictates that the use of these products should end for all populations.”

Experts say the federal shift puts the onus on state health agencies to ramp up vaccine guidance and outreach. Clinicians and public health organizations are trying to dispel misinformation and make sure information reaches low-income people and people of color, who had higher maternal death rates during the pandemic. During the first two years of the pandemic, the virus contributed to a quarter of maternal deaths, according to federal data.
“We are severely disappointed,” said Dr. Neil Silverman, a professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California, Los Angeles David Geffen School of Medicine. He has studied vaccines and pregnancy for the past 15 years and specializes in high-risk pregnancies.
Silverman called the federal shift a “public health tragedy on a grand scale.”
Vaccinations against COVID-19 help prevent severe illness in pregnant people as well as their newborns, who are too young to get vaccinated, Silverman said. In what’s called passive immunity, vaccinated mothers pass on antibodies to their babies through the placenta and through breast milk.
“State public health agencies are probably going to have to implement vaccine guidance that differs from the federal recommendations. And that’s going to be an interesting can of worms,” said OB-GYN Dr. Mark Turrentine, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas.
Turrentine serves on a board of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists that focuses on immunization and infectious diseases. He said his recent pregnant patients who had COVID-19 hadn’t gotten the vaccine.
“The change in guidance on the federal level just really makes a lot of confusion, and it makes it very challenging to try to explain to individuals why all of a sudden the difference,” Turrentine said.
A slew of public health organizations have been making a concerted effort to dispel vaccine myths. They include the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, a Washington, D.C., nonprofit organization of maternal-fetal experts. At a news briefing the society held this month, clinicians stressed the safety and long-standing science behind COVID-19 vaccines, as well as the shots for RSV and the flu. Cases of RSV and the flu tend to peak in the winter months, while in recent years COVID-19 cases have spiked in the summer and the winter.
Dr. Brenna Hughes, an OB-GYN who chairs the organization’s infectious diseases and emerging threats committee, pointed to survey data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing that less than a third of eligible pregnant patients received COVID-19 shots, and only 38% received RSV shots for the 2023 to 2024 season. Less than half — 47% — received flu shots, and 59% received TDAP (whooping cough) vaccines.
CDC data shows that for last year’s and this year’s season, only between 12% and 14% of pregnant patients got the COVID-19 vaccine.
“The complications from the infection are so much greater than the complications and the very few and typically minor adverse events that might occur from the vaccine,” said microbiologist Sabra Klein, a professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
In June, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and 30 other professional health organizations signed a letter urging insurers to continue covering the COVID-19 shot for pregnant women, and have continued to urge coverage since then.
CVS Caremark, one of the nation’s three major pharmacy benefit managers, told Stateline it will continue covering the vaccine for pregnant women. The Arizona, California, and North Carolina state Medicaid agencies also told Stateline they are still currently covering COVID-19 vaccines for pregnant women.
Dr. Kimberly Fortner, president-elect of the Infectious Diseases Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology, said during the maternal-fetal medicine briefing that she hopes medical groups’ joint messaging will bolster insurers.
“Hopefully by us linking arms, that can then help develop consistency so that insurers will continue to pay for the vaccine,” she said.
 Exacerbating disparities

Dr. Ayanna Bennett, director of the District of Columbia Department of Health, said the federal government’s new stance has upended “a system that’s been stable for a very long time.”
Bennett said her agency used federal pandemic aid to shore up vaccine outreach efforts to communities of color. Now that flow of money is ending.
The changes in federal guidance and funding will “almost certainly exacerbate” maternal health disparities, said Marie Thoma, a perinatal epidemiologist and an associate professor in the University of Maryland Department of Family Science who researches pregnancy and COVID-19.
Black and Indigenous women died at higher rates. The virus exacerbated existing racial disparities in maternal health — and created new ones: Latina mothers, who generally see low rates of maternal mortality, saw deaths surge to 28 per 100,000 in 2021. Their rate was about 12 per 100,000 in 2018, according to federal data.
“We are going in with some exposure already that we didn’t have during the start of the pandemic. So, there will be some protection, but now that will erode,” said Thoma. “If we’re not getting vaccines, or if people are hesitant to take them, we could see some increase.”
Silverman said the administration’s efforts to strip mentions of race from government policies makes it difficult for institutions to reach populations at greatest risk. He called the dismissal of decades of data “saddening and infuriating.”
“The politicization of the vaccine process, or access to it, is what concerns me the most,” said Dr. Yvette Martas, a Connecticut OB-GYN who chairs the board of directors of the Hispanic Health Council.
Many women “are trying to navigate an economic system that’s not always in their favor in terms of also providing access to the kind of educational material that they need,” she said.
 Not just COVID-19

In June, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee, replacing them with some members who are vaccine skeptics.
The change is creating chaos. Some states have vaccine laws, such as mandates for kids and coverage statutes, that are specifically tied to the committee’s decisions.
The Vaccine Integrity Project at the University of Minnesota called on frontline health workers, health officials, and professional societies to “counter the spread of inaccurate and confusing vaccine information.”
At a news briefing this month held by the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, representatives from Alabama, Connecticut, and Washington, D.C., said they will continue to recommend vaccines.
Alabama’s state health officer, Dr. Scott Harris, said clinicians will be instrumental in getting correct vaccination information to patients.
“We don’t think that we necessarily have the same authoritative voice that we might have had a decade ago in trying to guide people in what to do, but we do believe that people trust their health care providers in most cases and are certainly willing to listen to them,” he said at the briefing.
Bennett said she is hopeful that strong, consistent messaging from respected medical organizations will help combat confusion.
“Having established groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics or the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology make very firm recommendations that keep us essentially not changed from where we have been, I think, should reassure families,” she said.

Maybe you are approaching retirement yourself and are looking forward to that next chapter in life.
Social Security, which celebrates its 90th anniversary this year, is foundational to a secure retirement.  Beginning with my first job at age 16, I contributed from each paycheck to provide a future retirement payment from Social Security. So did my employers.
Social Security stands as one of the cornerstone programs in the tapestry of retirement planning and financial security for millions of individuals. Since its inception in 1935, the Social Security system has played a pivotal role in providing a safety net for retirees, disabled individuals, and survivors of deceased workers.
This cornerstone is under threat.  In 2033, it is projected that Social Security will have about 80% of the assets needed to make full payments.  Unless Congress acts, that means a 20% reduction in the amount of payment made to retirees – the payment that they were promised and that they had earned with the contributions both they and their employers made throughout their working years.
Surveys conducted by AARP indicate that 80% of individuals rely on or plan to rely on Social Security at least somewhat in retirement. That includes 39% of individuals that rely on or plan to rely on Social Security as the sole or primary income source in retirement.  For many, a 20% reduction in Social Security income would be challenging.  For some, that reduction will be daunting. For still others, that reduction would result in poverty.
This outcome doesn’t have to be.  Congress can act now to prevent that outcome.  Possible solutions include:

Eliminate or raise the wage cap on which FICA taxes are paid. This would increase revenues to the Social Security Trust Fund.
Increase payroll taxes, again resulting in an increase in revenues to the Social Security Trust Fund.
Raise the retirement age at which individuals receive the full retirement payment. Again, this would increase revenues to the Trust while also recognizing our increased longevity.
Reduce retirement payment amount for high income workers through the introduction of means testing that recognizes other income and assets available to individuals.
Use other funding. For example, Sens. Bill Cassidy (R) and Tim Kaine (D) are collaborating on a proposal that would introduce an additional investment fund that would operate in parallel to the current trust fund — not replace it.  This fund would be invested in stocks, bonds and other investments that generate a higher rate of return.

Social Security is far more than a monthly check—it is a social contract that underpins financial security, dignity, and peace of mind for millions of retirees. Its importance cannot be overstated, especially as the retirement landscape grows more complex and uncertain. 
By providing guaranteed, inflation-protected income, reducing poverty, and serving as a stabilizing force in the economy, Social Security remains a linchpin in the pursuit of a secure and dignified retirement.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-19 04:01:29+00:00,CT Mirror,CT has made progress on homelessness prevention. Now we must keep going,Adriana Negron,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/19/ct-has-made-progress-on-homelessness-prevention-now-we-must-keep-going/,"We need more housing, more support for people reentering society, stronger protections for tenants, and a deeper understanding that our well-being is bound together.","A mother is forced to choose which of her children can stay with their grandmother while she takes the others to a shelter. A father, the sole provider for his family, loses his job and falls behind on rent—now facing eviction. An elderly couple, unable to read and living on Social Security, can no longer afford the rent in the home they’ve had for over two decades.
These aren’t distant headlines. They are real stories. They are our neighbors. And I know these choices too well because for over 20 years, my family made them too.
My family experienced severe housing instability and at a certain point homelessness. I grew up watching people in my own community make heartbreaking choices every single day, choosing between rent and food, between medical care and transportation. Many of these people had jobs. They had income. What they didn’t have was access to safe, affordable housing. That story is still unfolding for far too many across our state. 
That kind of survival leaves a mark.
So when I talk about homelessness prevention, I don’t just mean stopping an eviction notice from landing on someone’s doorstep. I mean keeping families together. I mean protecting our elders and ensuring that people coming home from incarceration are given a true second chance —not a fast track to homelessness. Homelessness isn’t just the loss of a roof —it’s the weight of ongoing trauma, of being stuck in constant survival mode.
Today, as the Coordinated Homeless Prevention Manager at Journey Home, I have the honor of working to break that cycle. Through Coordinated Homeless Prevention, we are reaching people earlier, those facing mounting rent, impossible choices, and growing uncertainty, but who haven’t lost their homes yet. It includes working in hand with local partners, offering rental assistance before an eviction is filed, connecting people to legal support, and sitting down for financial counseling that builds real stability. Through Coordinated Prevention, we are able to meet people with solutions, not judgement and making sure help comes before an escalation of crisis.   
Every day, I see how close many in our community are to the edge, despite working hard and doing everything right. And yet, I also see the impact of real solutions. Connecticut has made undeniable progress. We’ve invested in rental assistance. We’ve expanded access to legal representation through right-to-counsel for tenants. And just this year, housing affordability and homelessness prevention rose to the top of the legislative agenda in both chambers. Multiple bills addressing housing development and tenant protections have passed through our House and Senate reflecting a growing understanding that stable housing is foundational to well-being.
We are moving forward. But we still have more work to do.
The truth is, in today’s tense political climate both locally and at the federal level, that progress is fragile. The federal conversation around homelessness continues to shift, and prevention, while long discussed, still doesn’t always receive the full support it deserves. But here in Connecticut, we’ve shown what’s possible and we can’t afford to stall now.
While we have started the work, too many still live on the edge. Rising rents, stagnant wages, and a shrinking supply of truly affordable housing have left thousands in our state one emergency away from losing it all. 
This is a moment for clarity and courage. Homelessness prevention has always been a part of the conversation. Now it must become the priority.
We must double down on what we know works, investing in rental assistance, eviction prevention, and community-led solutions that offer not just temporary relief, but lasting stability. We need more housing, more support for people reentering society, stronger protections for tenants, and a deeper understanding that our well-being is bound together. Because this is not just about policy, it’s about making sure no one has to choose between staying warm and staying fed, that no child goes to sleep worried about where they’ll wake up, and that every person is met with dignity, not dismissal. 
Because prevention is not just a strategy. It’s a promise: that everyone deserves the chance not just to survive, but to live.

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown has joined two more multistate lawsuits against the Trump administration, one over proposed caps on administrative costs for renewable energy projects and another on restrictions for federal grants for victims of crime.
The suits, filed Friday and Monday, are the latest of dozens that have been filed by Democratic attorneys general and governors challenging executive actions by President Donald Trump (R) and proposed cuts enacted by federal agencies. In each of the latest cases, Maryland was one of 20 states and the District of Columbia to sue.
On Monday, the states filed suit against the U.S. Department of Justice for its proposal that would tie federal grants under the Victims of Crime Act to a state’s willingness to support what the states called the “administration’s extreme immigration enforcement efforts.”
The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Rhode Island asks the court to permanently stop the administration from implementing or enforcing these “illegal conditions.” In addition, the suit claims the department “literally has no power to act … unless and until Congress confers power upon it.”
“Crime victims need all the help they can get to survive traumatic, often violent experiences that can forever change their lives,” Brown said in a statement. “The administration’s unlawful attempt to withhold this critical funding undermines the ability of states to provide essential services and threatens the trust that survivors place in programs designed to help them heal and rebuild their lives.”
Natalie Baldassarre, a spokesperson for department, declined to comment Monday afternoon.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
According to the suit, the department would cut off nearly $1.4 billion to states in federal fiscal 2025, about half of which would be due to the states filing suit. The federal fiscal year runs through Sept. 30.
The Victims of Crime Act was enacted by Congress in 1984 under former President Ronald Reagan (R) and is split between two funds: victim compensation and victim assistance. The compensation grant can be used for medical care, mental health counseling, funeral expenses, among other sources. Victim assistance can be used by public agencies and community organizations to assist crime victims in a particular case, which can include emergency shelter, wrap-around services and communication to victims and witnesses when a person is released from custody.
In Maryland for state fiscal 2025, which ended June 30, the Governor’s Office of Crime Prevention and Policy awarded $60.5 million in state and federal funds to 125 state, county and local offices and state and local nonprofit organizations, among others. Some of the money went to assist victims of domestic violence and sexual assault, legal assistance and other services.
A deadline to apply for new federal grants for states is Wednesday with awards expected to be announced by Sept. 30.
Attorneys general from Rhode Island, New Jersey, Delaware, California and Illinois participated in a Zoom call with reporters Monday to discuss the lawsuit.
“This case isn’t about a lack of cooperation with the federal government when it comes to law enforcement,” Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said, according to a story in the Rhode Island Current, a part of the States Newsroom network. “We need our state police and our local police investigating violent and other crime. That’s their job, that’s what they are trained to do, that’s what we need them to do.”
The other jurisdictions in the lawsuit are the District of Columbia, and the states of Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin.
Another 20 Democrat-led jurisdictions filed suit Friday in U.S. District Court in Oregon against the Department of Energy and its proposed cap on administrative and staffing costs associated with clean-energy and energy-efficiency projects.
Appeals court lifts injunction that would have blocked DOGE access to personal records

The suit said federal law has required agencies to negotiate agreements with states that set fair reimbursement rates for federally funded, state-run energy programs, including basic administrative and staffing costs needed to run these programs. It said those costs were never capped until May 8, when DOE announced that it was capping reimbursement to the states at 10% of a project’s total budget. Any balance would fall to the states.
Brown said in a prepared statement that the suit is needed to “help our State meet its commitment to advancing clean energy, reducing harmful emissions and supporting Marylanders’ efforts to make energy improvements to their homes.”
“Maryland has set ambitious climate goals that promise a cleaner, healthier, and safer future for our children – but this short-sighted federal policy would unlawfully limit our State’s ability to support projects that are crucial to meeting those goals,” his statement said.
Oregon was the lead plaintiff in the suit, which was joined by Maryland, New York, Colorado, California, Minnesota, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Kentucky, Maine, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Washington, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia.
Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield said in a statement to the Oregon Capital Chronicle, another member of the States Newsroom network, that Oregonians “count on these programs to keep our homes energy-efficient, our air clean and our bills manageable.”
“This cap strips away the resources we need to keep that work going — and the people and expertise behind it,” Rayfield said. “We can’t meet Oregon’s energy needs if the federal government pulls critical infrastructure that supports the people and expertise behind this work midstream.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025_feb10_anthonybrown-newsletter-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-19 06:56:12.094432

Zadok Magruder High School in this photo from 2022. (Photo by Christine Zhu/Capital News Service)School bells will soon be ringing for 900,000 schoolchildren in Maryland. Here’s my crystal ball on what to expect between now and when (to the relief of students and teachers) summer rolls around again.
At the start of every school year, students, parents and teachers are all excited and busy getting ready. Optimism and enthusiasm reign.
Parents are not just happy to have kids out of the house. They hope for a safe and welcoming environment, academic progress and the social and emotional well-being of their children.
Educators – even battle-scarred veterans of the system – are upbeat. Maybe this year, they think, we’ll get more administrative support and fewer unreasonable demands heaped on us.
That’s a sunny cheerful outlook. But are there storm clouds on the horizon?
Here’s a forecast.
Many students will have good years — full of accomplishment and growth. And many teachers will enjoy positive job satisfaction.
Alas, a much larger number of students – predominantly low-income and of color – won’t. A large majority of them will fall farther below their grade level than when the year began. They will not have experienced even one year’s growth, much less the progress necessary to close the typically large gaps between their grade level and their performance level, usually in literacy and math.

Opinion pieces must be signed by at least one individual using their real name. We do not accept columns signed by an organization. Commentary writers must include a short bio and a photo for their bylines.
Views of writers are their own.




And many teachers will have experienced the disappointment that comes when students fall farther behind. In the face of the poor outcomes for so many their students, a large number of teachers will come up short on job satisfaction.
Maybe this crystal ball tells us nothing that we didn’t already know about the dire state of public education. But we dare not become immune to the personal pain that many parents, students and teachers suffer day to day and year to year. We dare not lessen our efforts to improve their experience.
With that in mind, what is our – the public’s – homework this year? First, it is to redouble our efforts to bring about change. We know it will be hard. The task seems as politically daunting as the overall challenge of overturning Trumpism.
But it’s no secret what we must do: We must take heart and stir public outcry (remember the famous TV announcer in the movie Network imploring people to open their window and shout, “I’m mad as hell and I’m not going to take it anymore”).
Outrage must spur political organization and action, no less so in public education than in our nation’s politics at large. We don’t need fresh ideas as much as fresh leadership and resolve.
In Maryland, of course, that means not giving up on the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future. Its first five years have brought small benefits for schoolchildren. Still, maybe this year could bring a breakthrough.
The best chance of that is if the heralded kindergarten-to-third grade literacy plan — the flagship initiative of state Superintendent Carey Wright – starts to pick up some steam. We must be watchful and supportive.
But even if the early literacy plan shows promise, that won’t be enough to remove all the obstacles in the way of students continuing to hit the mark through grades K-12. We must pressure more than ever leaders in Annapolis to rekindle the can-do, courageous spirit that animated the Blueprint when it was enacted.
To borrow Mark Twain’s famous quip about the weather, the governor and General Assembly complain a lot about the Blueprint but haven’t done a darn thing about it.
And then, not to pile on the challenge ahead, we can’t lose sight of the severe impact on school failure caused by the broader failures of our nation which put students who are low-income and of color at such a disadvantage. We’ve known this since the famed Coleman Report in 1966 found that the single most important factor in student success was the parents’ income and education.
That doesn’t mean, of course, that the quality of instruction and teachers doesn’t matter. It matters a lot. You’ll see that in the fact that some schools and teachers – even if you control for student demographics – get higher marks than others. It’s also proven that research-based instruction gets beneficial results.
All of this is to say that all – elected officials, teachers, parents and we the public – have a part to play this school year if the crystal ball is to be brighter next year. Let’s summon the will and activism to make it happen.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/school-scaled-e1715106937322.jpg,,,2025-08-18 23:56:48.879782

Tom Begich of Anchorage on Monday became the first Democrat to file a letter saying he intends to run for Alaska governor in the 2026 election, joining a field already crowded with eight Republicans.
“I felt Alaska’s sort of stagnated over the last few years — hasn’t moved forward,” he said. “And partially that’s because there’s a lack of communication between the Legislature and the governor, the governor and the Legislature. That leads to a breakdown in decision making.”
Begich said that’s affected a lack of progress on resolving differences over education policy and funding, and on a long-term plan for the state budget. 
Begich said he would visit communities across Alaska, listening to residents, to shape his plan for the state.
“I already have ideas, but I want to hear what their ideas are, because together, you can actually build a comprehensive roadmap that gets you to a sustainable future,” he said. “You can’t do it by imposing that on people.”
Begich served in the state Senate for six years, from 2017 to 2023, including serving as the minority caucus leader for the last four. 
Begich said that his legislative track record shows he can cross the state’s political divides. He pointed to his relationships with several Republican leaders, including former Senate Presidents Cathy Giessel of Anchorage and Peter Micciche of Soldotna, Rep. Cathy Tilton of Wasilla and Gov. Mike Dunleavy, which led to policy compromises. In the case of Dunleavy, a major compromise was the 2022 Alaska Reads Act, aimed at increasing early literacy. 
“It takes the ability to recognize — sometimes you’re going to disagree about, maybe, how you get to an issue, but you need to look for, what is the fundamental thing you care most about,” and aim to reach common ground on that, Begich said.  
While Begich gives credit to Dunleavy for his work on the Reads Act, he said his own record includes making progress on a wider range of issues, including funding for food banks and housing to improve public health.
While no Democrat has been elected governor since Tony Knowles reelection in 1998, Begich said recent results – including former U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola’s victories in 2022, indicate that Alaska is a “purple” state and no longer the solidly Republican state of previous decades. 
Begich said the state’s ranked choice voting system could benefit a candidate who can appeal to a wide range of voters.
“I think the environment is right as well, because in Alaska, we recognize pragmatism over politics — and party politics in particular,” Begich said. “I believe we do, and I think that I represent that.”
The eight Republicans in the field for governor are former state Sen. Click Bishop of Fairbanks; former state Revenue Commissioner Adam Crum of Wasilla; Lt. Gov. Nancy Dahlstrom of Eagle River; Matanuska-Susitna Borough Mayor Edna DeVries; podiatrist Matt Heilala of Anchorage; former teacher James Parkin of Angoon; and business owner Bernadette Wilson of Anchorage.
Begich said that regardless of the outcome, it’s important to articulate a different vision, “instead of, you know, bickering about issues that have no daily impact on whether or not you can afford to buy groceries, or whether or not your energy costs are too high, or whether or not your education is sufficient. Those are the issues that matter.” 
Begich owns a consulting business, CW Communications, shorthand for “Crazy World.” Through consulting, he’s worked on strategic planning and issues related to juvenile justice. The work has brought Begich all around the state, and helped hone his ability to communicate with Alaskans from different backgrounds, he said.
And he’s a guitarist and singer-songwriter, with a website that describes him as “the bohemian son of a family steeped in Alaska politics” whose “music and poetry resonates with the stories and the conflicts of the human condition.”
The Begich family has been among the most prominent in state history, beginning with Tom Begich’s father, Democratic U.S. Rep. Nick Begich Sr., who was presumed to have died in a plane crash in 1972. Tom Begich, now 64, was 11 when his father died, and he credits his mother Pegge Begich with instilling in him his approach to politics and life. 
“She showed me how to listen to people. She showed me that caring and public service mattered more than just talking and thinking there was something special about you or anybody else,” he said.
Tom’s brother Mark Begich, also a Democrat, was a U.S. senator from 2009 to 2015.
Last November, Nick Begich III – the son of Tom and Mark’s brother Nick Jr. — became the first Republican Begich to win statewide office. 
Tom Begich said he hasn’t supported his nephew’s electoral runs, but said every family member is entitled to be different. He acknowledged that some new voters may not be familiar with his family’s history: “I hope that a new person to Alaska would see who I am, what I stand for, and be excited about the possibilities it promises for Alaska, as opposed to prejudging me based on the actions of a nephew whom I don’t agree with.”
Begich filed a letter of intent to run for governor, which allows him to start building a campaign, but isn’t a formal campaign launch. 
He indicated one potential pathway that would lead to him cutting short a run for governor. Another prominent Democrat, Peltola, hasn’t said what if any office she will run for next year. Begich said he has committed to her that he would not run for governor if she later decides to run for the position. She has also been mentioned as a potential candidate for U.S. Senate, against Republican U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, or to run in a rematch against Republican U.S. Rep. Nick Begich III. 
“Until that time, it’s important to have a vision out there on the table that talks to Alaskans about what our vision is,” Tom Begich said. “And that’s important to me. You don’t get there if you don’t talk to people, learn from people.”

(Photo by Allen Miller/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)Recently published opinion pieces paint a dire picture of Alaska’s predator control efforts, portraying them as reckless and unjustified assaults on brown bears and wolves. This narrative is not only misleading, but fundamentally misunderstands both the purpose and the science behind Alaska’s intensive management laws and programs.
Let’s be clear: No one in Alaska is at “war” with grizzly bears. Harvesting caribou is extremely important to many Alaskan families. Participating in the hunt and sharing the bounty is a long-standing tradition. However, many rural Alaskans — especially those who rely on caribou for sustenance — are fighting to preserve their traditional subsistence culture and food security. The Alaska Board of Game and Department of Fish and Game’s policies reflect that reality.
 Constitutional and statutory mandates: sustained yield and subsistence priority 
Article VIII, Section 4, of Alaska’s Constitution requires wildlife, including predators and prey, to be managed for sustained yield, “subject to preferences among beneficial uses.”  The Alaska Legislature defined “preferences among beneficial uses” as ensuring caribou and moose are managed to ensure population levels that are sufficient to meet demand.
By law, the Board of Game must consider intensive management — including predator control — when big game prey populations that are identified as important food sources for Alaskans fall below objectives to provide harvest opportunity. Alaska’s intensive management law has been repeatedly upheld by the Alaska Supreme Court.
When this happens, the Department of Fish and Game must assess feasibility, create an adaptive management plan, and implement it as approved by the board. The board can prioritize prey like caribou over predators to maintain hunting opportunities but must ensure bear and wolf populations remain viable, with monitoring and adjustments to prevent long-term harm. That is exactly what the board did when it reinstated the program earlier this month after fixing legal flaws that resulted in the program being overturned by the courts.
Predator control is a short-term, carefully targeted tool for areas where predation limits prey recovery, in this case, the Mulchatna caribou herd. Once nearly 200,000 animals, the herd fell to 12,000 in 2019 but has risen to nearly 15,000 as of July 2024. Without such measures, Alaskans could lose caribou harvest opportunities for years.
 Science supports the strategy
Those criticizing predator control often demand scientific certainty that it will work. Alaska’s wildlife management decisions are products of intense research, public opinion, and the law. Overwhelming evidence for the Mulchatna caribou herd, collected by the department since the program began in 2023, supports the conclusion that calf survival increased when bear numbers were reduced in calving areas — a critical window when most predation occurs. In the west Mulchatna, where bear control has occurred, the minimum count of caribou has had a dramatic 17% population increase since the bear control efforts began.
Despite popular misconceptions, predator populations aren’t being decimated. With intensive management, bears and wolves will recolonize within a few years. Bear or wolf populations have not been reduced to unsustainable levels, and hunting seasons remain unaffected. While habitat and disease sometimes affect herd numbers, predation is the main factor limiting the Mulchatna herd’s recovery. Predator control in 2023–2024 improved calf survival.
 A rebuttal to fear-based claims
A July 8 opinion piece in the Anchorage Daily News claims that nearly 200 brown bears have been “poached” by the Department of Fish and Game. This is a gross mischaracterization. These animals were lethally removed as part of a legal, legislatively mandated intensive management program, following extensive population surveys, biological assessments and public processes. This isn’t poaching. It’s predator control grounded in science and law. ADF&G uses efficient methods to remove the animals quickly and humanely without undue suffering. When possible, the department provides edible meat to local villages, and hides and skulls are either loaned for educational purposes or offered at auction.
 The role of values — and the importance of balance
Ultimately, wildlife management decisions are shaped not just by science but by values. Many Alaskans are supportive of state efforts to intensively manage predators and prey.  Others, whose values and experiences differ, question predator reduction methods, especially aerial control. Still others question whether humans should be intervening at all in what they refer to as a natural system of predators and prey. The Board of Game’s job is to balance these values, not to let one dominate the other.
As we established earlier, the board and ADF&G have constitutional and statutory responsibilities to manage for high levels of harvest in designated areas, and predator control is one of the tools available to achieve this goal when herds are struggling. This approach is flexible, adaptive, and transparent, and includes public input at every step.
 A future with both bears and caribou
Predator reduction for the Mulchatna caribou herd is supported by local users and communities, Fish and Game Advisory Committees, and the Alaska Federation of Natives, and has already demonstrated success, with improved calf survival and herd growth since the intensive management program began in 2023. Stopping this effort puts the herd’s recovery — and our commitment to rural subsistence users — at risk.
We can have both healthy predator populations and abundant prey. But that balance won’t happen by accident — and it won’t happen if we let ideology override evidence. Predator control isn’t about destroying nature. It’s about managing it wisely, for the benefit of all Alaskans, especially those who rely on these renewable resources to feed their families.
We need to rebuild this herd to provide for sustained hunting opportunities as required under state law.  We can’t afford to ignore the biological reality — Caribou won’t come back with good intentions alone.

(Photo by Madison McVan/Minnesota Reformer.)Food shelves are facing a double crisis: cuts to direct funding and food shipments, and cuts to SNAP, the federal program that helps keep people out of food shelves by helping them buy food.
The GOP mega-law passed by Republicans in Congress and signed into law by President Donald Trump on July 4 will cut funding for SNAP by around 20%, or $187 billion over 10 years. 
U.S. Rep. Kelly Morrison, who represents the west metro, visited Second Harvest Heartland headquarters in Brooklyn Park Monday to highlight the impact of the cuts. 
“Why did President Trump and the Republican majorities cut SNAP and leave Americans hungry again? …It was to pay for tax cuts for the wealthiest,” Morrison said. 
The SNAP cuts come from expanded work requirements for parents of teenagers and people between the ages of 55 and 64; changes to how utility and internet bills are counted against an applicant’s income when determining benefits; and shifting costs to the states.
Minnesota, which is facing a budget deficit in upcoming years, could be on the hook for $86 million annually, plus another $40 million earmarked to defray administrative costs of the food program.
“We are seeing more families, more seniors, and more working adults asking for help finding food — and now with the cuts from the one big bill, we are bracing for even more desperation,” said Mesa Siebert, who manages the SNAP outreach program among others at Second Harvest Heartland. 
Families continue to struggle with food inflation, which was nearly 24% between 2020 and 2024, according to federal data. 
Dan Narr, executive director of ICA Food Shelf in Minnetonka, said donations are declining even as more families are visiting the food shelf. 
The GOP law also effectively eliminated the SNAP-Ed program, which educated SNAP recipients on healthy eating and how to lead a physically active lifestyle. Those cuts resulted in 60 layoffs at the University of Minnesota last month, the Minnesota Daily reported. 
The Trump administration has also canceled shipments of food to organizations including Second Harvest.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/P1241067-1024x715.jpg,,,2025-08-18 21:56:59.661888

Eastern Montana saw thunderstorms last week, which National Weather Service meteorologist Todd Chambers said caused a few new fire starts. He said there were about 4,000 lightning strikes in the area during those storms. 
Some of the fires grew throughout the week. Weather is expected to be warm across the state during the next few days, said Chambers, who is based in Billings.
“It will bring an increased potential for those fires to grow and expand in places where they’re not under control,” Chambers said Monday morning. “But right now, the one thing that we’re missing from all of this is a strong wind event.”
Sustained wind can be a serious problem for fire crews, as it can create new spot fires or push flames over a containment line. High winds can also ground aircraft, meaning firefighters may not be able to get aerial support.
“So far, over the last little bit, it looks like the land management agencies have been getting on those fires pretty good,” Chambers said. “We haven’t seen them get too out of control at this point. So as long as those are fairly contained and we don’t have any big wind events, I think we’re going to be OK.”
Northeast Montana is under a Heat Advisory until Wednesday evening, with day time highs expected to be between 95 and 105 degrees.
Chambers said motorists should take caution, making sure they aren’t dragging chains or running their cars in tall grass. Anything that creates sparks can be dangerous, he added, and even harvesting fields needs to be done with caution.
“Also, welding becomes an issue at this time of year, people are outside doing some work on cars or whatnot, and welding sparks can cause fires,” Chambers said. “So just be extra careful over the next few days, and then we have improved conditions as we go into Thursday, Friday.”
 Mission Butte

Working the Mission Butte fire, burning in grass, BIA Forestry and Wildland Fire Management Crow Agency’s Randy Pretty On Top said fire crews were paying attention to the weather. That fire is burning about five to seven miles east of St. Xavier.
Pretty On Top added the Mission Butte fire was about 6,000 acres, burning in rolling hills and gullies. Crews were working to contain the fire, he said.
“It was primarily a fire that started in the rough terrain, and then it started spreading all over the place,” Pretty On Top said. “And accessibility is a problem.”
 Windy Rock

The Windy Rock fire, near Garrison, moved to 848 acres on Monday and was listed as 0% contained. The DNRC’s County Assist Team under incident commander David Hamilton is on that fire. All public lands in the area are closed, a Monday press release from the fire said.
Almost 100 more personnel were assigned to the fire during the weekend, which is now staffed by 216 people. Two helicopters were assigned to that fire on Monday, which was estimated to have cost $1.2 million to suppress so far. Fire costs are shared by state and federal governments and are divided at the end of the year.
Officials held a community meeting in Avon about the fire during the weekend. There are numerous structures near the fire.
Crews on the southeastern flank of the fire were scouting and conducting structure assessments and planning. On the northwest side of the fire, crews were digging hand lines. 
The fire had seen some precipitation, but was still active, creating spot fires and torching trees. Wind gusts reached 40 to 50 mph from isolated thunderstorms, according to Monday’s fire report.
 McAllister

The McAllister fire, burning 3 miles south of Norris and 3 miles north of Ennis Lake, was listed at 3,500 acres and 30% contained on Monday. More than 100 firefighters have been assigned to that incident, as well as one helicopter.
The fire was first reported late in the afternoon on Aug. 16. and DNRC is currently managing the fire. Crews were working to establish lines around the fire on Monday.
There are evacuation warnings in effect for the fire: All residents in the area between Bradley Creek, Shining Mountains West and US Highway 287 (between mile markers 61 and 64).
A situation report for the fire asked motorists to use caution when driving through Norris to get to Ennis on Highway 287 — equipment is staged near that area.
 Other incidents

The Bivens Creek and nearby Cloudrest incidents, burning in remote areas of the Tobacco Root Mountains, both grew over the weekend. 
The Bivens Creek fire was nearing 2,000 acres, while the Cloudrest incident was listed at slightly over 1,100 acres and are about 15 miles northwest of Virginia City. Both were lightning caused and are being managed by Northern Rockies Complex Incident Management Team 6.
There is a public meeting for those two fires at 7 p.m. on August 19 at the Sheridan Fire Station, located at 3284 Highway 287 South. Smoke may impact Pony, Harrison and Bozeman, a press release for the fire said.
About 140 personnel were assigned to those two fires, which included areas with hazardous trees. Dangerous fire weather over multiple days was also a concern for crews on those two incidents.

A federal trial judge in Florida has ruled that the state’s law banning books deemed “pornographic” from school libraries is, in part, “overbroad and unconstitutional.”
Carlos Mendoza, a President Barack Obama-appointed judge in the Middle District Court of Florida, issued a summary judgement in a lawsuit filed by book publishers against the 2023 law, HB 1069, this week.
The suit, filed a year ago, asked the court to deem the state’s interpretation of “pornographic” and content that “describes sexual conduct” unconstitutional.

“By leaving these items undefined, Florida has given parents license to object to materials under an ‘I know it when I see it’ approach,” Mendoza wrote in his 50-page judgement, referring to a lack of definition for “pornographic” and “describes sexual conduct.”
Publishers Penguin Random House, Hachette Book Group, HarperCollins Publishers, Macmillan Publishing, and Simon & Schuster argued the law removes books without considering their literary or artistic value.
The law, Mendoza wrote, “does not evaluate the work to determine if it has any holistic value,” a key part of the legal standard to determine whether material is obscene.
“Educators must again perform statutory interpretation on the fly to determine what exactly is ‘inappropriate’ or ‘unsuitable’ because those terms go undefined. All the while, the specter of harsh penalties looms in the background,” Mendoza wrote.
Especially recently, the Florida Department of Education has made public threats and called superintendents in front of the state Board of Education to explain why certain materials are in school libraries.
Also on the plaintiffs’ side were The Authors Guild, John Green, Jodi Picoult, and other authors and parents.
Mendoza listed various books involved in the suit, including “The Color Purple,” “I am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter,” “Paper Towns,” “The Kite Runner,” “The Handmaid’s Tale,” “Water for Elephants,” and “Homegoing.”
“None of these books are obscene,” Mendoza wrote.
Mendoza determined “pornographic” in law is synonymous with “harmful to minors.”
A Florida Senate committee this year debated further defining what school boards should consider “harmful to minors” but after First Amendment concerns arose, the bill stalled.
Dan Novack, an attorney representing the publishers called it “a sweeping victory for the right to read, and for every student’s freedom to think, learn, and explore ideas,” in a statement to the Phoenix.
“We are elated that the federal court in Florida has upheld the First Amendment rights of students, educators, authors, and publishers. The Court ruled that books may only be removed from school libraries if they lack serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value when considered as a whole,” Novack said.

(Courtesy of Christian Espinosa Torres campaign)OMAHA — Christian Espinosa Torres, currently assistant director of the Omaha Human Rights and Relations Department, announced his bid this week to become the first newly elected Douglas County treasurer in 20 years. 
The post was vacated two months ago when John Ewing Jr. — who was first elected treasurer of Nebraska’s most populous county in 2006 — resigned after 18 years to take the reins of the City of Omaha. Ewing was elected Omaha mayor in May, and in June the Douglas County Board named Tim Cavanaugh, who previously worked in the office, as interim treasurer.

In tapping Cavanaugh, county board members said he told them he would not seek election to the four-year term.
Espinosa, a Democrat, is the first to announce a run for treasurer, essentially the county’s banker who oversees the collection of taxes. It marks his first bid for elected public office. Whoever wins the treasurer seat in November 2026 will be sworn in the following January.
In an interview with the Nebraska Examiner, Espinosa said he would work to make the Treasurer’s Office and its mission more understood and accessible to the public. For example, he said he wants a more interactive website so county residents understand more fully where their tax dollars go and how they are used.
Espinosa said he wants to find a way to save county residents the transaction fees they pay to companies when they use a credit card to pay county taxes. 
“My career has been dedicated to advancing economic development, supporting small businesses and ensuring that public resources serve the entire community fairly and effectively,” Espinosa said. “As treasurer, I will ensure that public funds are managed and invested with the highest standards of integrity, transparency and responsibility.”
Espinosa, 45, has worked in the Omaha Human Rights and Relations Department since 2017. For the past two years, he’s been assistant director, overseeing such initiatives as the Small and Emerging Business Program and the Economic Sustainability Program. 
He said his work managing budgets, evaluating contracts and ensuring regulatory compliance reflects the skills needed to oversee public funds.
Espinosa has an undergraduate degree in economics and earned a master’s degree in sociology from the University of Northern Iowa. He said the treasurer job would allow him to put his economic expertise and community service to use in a position with broader reach. 
His previous jobs included being a congressional staffer working with small business and economic development for the late U.S. Rep. Brad Ashford, D-Neb. Prior to that, he directed a get-out-the-vote program for the Heartland Workers Center, was a researcher for the University of Nebraska at Omaha’s Office of Latino-Latin American Studies and served in the protection department of the Consulate of Mexico’s Omaha office. 
His volunteer service includes roles as chair of the Nebraska Early Childhood Collaborative Board, member of the NU Institutional Review Board and as an advisory board member for the Greater Omaha Chamber’s REACH program.

Three livestock groups, a Montana property association and a conservative group ask justices to consider the case, which pits property rights against public access.
The post Ranchers, landowners, conservatives urge Supreme Court to hear Wyoming corner-crossing case appeared first on WyoFile .","Five groups are supporting Elk Mountain Ranch owner Fred Eshelman’s petition for the U.S. Supreme Court to review a 10th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that he cannot block the public from corner crossing to reach public land surrounded by his ranch.
The groups filed briefs Monday urging the Supreme Court to take up the matter. The 10th Circuit ruled earlier this year that four Missouri hunters did not trespass when they corner crossed to hunt on public land on Elk Mountain in Carbon County.
Eshelman wants that ruling overturned, claiming that the hunters trespassed. They did not touch his land but passed through the airspace above his property.
United Property Owners of Montana, The Claremont Institute’s Center for Constitutional Jurisprudence, Wyoming Stock Growers Association, Wyoming Wool Growers Association and Montana Stockgrowers Association joined Eshelman on Monday in seeking a high-court review.
Corner crossers step from one piece of public land to another where they meet at the common corner with two pieces of private property. Corner crossers do not set foot on private land, but they pass above it.
“There is a need for a nationwide rule addressing corner crossing.” John Gabel Connors
At issue is public access to 2.4 million acres of public land in Wyoming and 8.3 million acres across the West that would be “corner locked” and inaccessible to the public if the Supreme Court sides with Eshelman. By controlling access at common corners, a landowner can essentially have exclusive use of public property, the Missouri hunters have said.
The 10th Circuit decision applies to Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Kansas. But it leaves a gray area elsewhere in the West, Eshelman’s supporters say.
“The outcome of this case affects 150 million acres of public and private land,” John Gabel Connors wrote in a brief for Montana landowners. “There is a need for a nationwide rule addressing corner crossing, and this case may be the only opportunity for the Court to consider the issue.”
Unconstitutional?
The groups suggested numerous reasons for the Supreme Court to take up the issue. The three ranching associations also urged justices to reverse the lower-court decision.
Attorneys argued that the 10th Circuit decision was an unconstitutional taking of property without compensation. The appeals court, however, said the 1885 Unlawful Inclosures Act prevented Eshelman from blocking public access to public land in the checkerboard area of Wyoming.
Eshelman never had a right to exclude others and so there was no taking, according to the ruling.
That rubs Montana landowners the wrong way.
“The fundamental flaw in the decision … is the Tenth Circuit’s belief that the UIA ‘permit[s] limited trespass’ and ‘functionally operates like a limited easement’” the brief states. The lower court concluded that corner crossing was legal and Eshelman “was not entitled to compensation for the property right that had been taken.” That “taking” is unconstitutional, the group said.

The 10th Circuit ruling also opens “previously inaccessible property” to the public, creating headaches for federal and state governments and even limiting the federal government’s power to purchase public access easements, the brief says.
In another brief, the Claremont Institute’s Center for Constitutional Jurisprudence reached back to English common law in its arguments. “[T]he ‘poorest man’ in the meanest hovel can deny entry to the King,” John Eastman wrote of the foundation of the United States’ legal framework.
“The natural right to own and use property … is a foundation of individual liberty,” Eastman’s brief states. “One of the core principles of the American Founding is that individual rights are not granted by majorities or governments but are God-given and inalienable.”
The 10th Circuit decision allows corner crossing in the checkerboard area of southern Wyoming where the government granted land to enable railroad construction. That created the pattern of alternating square-mile sections of public and private land and the ongoing embroglio.
“Congress created the patchwork mess,” Eastman wrote, “it can fix it as well.” That would be by purchasing easements, he argues.
Ranchers see disruption
Stock growers leaned on potential damage to ranchers and cases known as Leo Sheep and Camfield.
In the Leo Sheep conflict, courts concluded the federal government did not have a right to construct a road across a common corner because the road was partly on private property. In Camfield, fences constructed on private land wrongly prevented access to public grazing pasture, courts decided.
The Camfield decision essentially abated a nuisance and is centered on laws preventing such things, attorney Brandon Jensen wrote for the stock and wool growers. But Leo Sheep addresses implied easements.
The Leo Sheep precedent rejected an implied easement at common corners, albeit for a road. “Certiorari must be granted to provide necessary clarity on the application of existing legal reasoning and Leo Sheep’s effect on precedent under the UIA,” the brief states.
“The [Montana Stock Growers Association] believes corner-crossing is a serious threat to the integrity of private landownership, undermines long-standing property boundaries, and may set a harmful precedent that erodes the ability of landowners to manage and protect their property,” Jensen’s brief states.
The 10th circuit unleashed chaos, the brief suggests.
“Without a systemic and strategic method to acquire access to corner locked federal lands, the public will have access to lands that the state and federal government may not regulate or maintain,” the filing states.
Public access to public lands “can cause great stress to livestock,” stock growers said. Ranchers will be shouldered with “the burden to absorb the costs to their livestock operation if livestock are disturbed or livestock is lost to an errant hunter’s shot (which certainly happens); the burden to clean up the public lands intermingled with their private lands from trash, empty cartridges, plastic water bottles, gut piles and waste which can attract predators that may also choose to prey on livestock.”
The 10th Circuit decision also creates a gray area with respect to liability, the filing states.

Congress’ recent paring back of federal food programs will impact New Mexico’s food from the farm to the table, state officials told lawmakers Monday.
At a Las Cruces hearing, state agency deputies overseeing New Mexico’s agriculture, food assistance programs, school lunches and senior care told the interim Water and Natural Resource Committee cuts will likely deepen children and senior hunger.
However, the full impacts of the Congressional spending bill signed by President Trump in July remain uncertain, they told lawmakers, as some cuts go into effect immediately, but others are implemented in later years.
State lawmakers have met over the summer to address cuts to federal programs like Medicaid and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) as New Mexico ranks the highest enrollments per capita in both programs. Members of Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s office has said she will call a special session in late August or September to address federal policies.
Just over one in five New Mexicans — 457,655 participants — use SNAP benefits and nearly 40% are children. Niki Kozlowski, the acting deputy secretary for the state’s Health Care Authority told lawmakers that cutting eligibility and stricter enforcement of work requirements will likely worsen outcomes for low-income children.
“We have a very high rate of child food insecurity, about 23%, which we do believe is likely to worsen due to the downstream impacts of this bill,” Kozlowski said.
While $5.5 million of the cuts to school SNAP programs are not immediate, the state is working to transition schools to a different federal program, said Michael Chavez, the senior manager for student success and wellness at the state’s education department.
“We’ve got to stay ahead of the curve of what these cuts are going to be,” Chavez told Source NM.
The state’s senior population also has the fifth highest poverty rate in the nation with 64,000 New Mexicans over 60 years old receiving SNAP benefits as of fiscal year 2022.
“The impact of funding cuts, although unknown, is very alarming for this population because we do know that our aging population is growing and they’re in need,” said Denise King, who directs aging network services for the New Mexico Aging and Long-Term Services Department.
Reduced federal funds will impact state programs for produce safety inspections and climate funding for sustainable farming, Les Owen, the deputy director at the New Mexico Department of Agriculture, said.
The 40% reduction in the federal budget will not impact actual inspections of produce, but will limit how much outreach and education the agency can do. Owen also noted the U.S. Department of Agriculture canceled hundreds of  millions of dollars in funding, which impacted a few programs in New Mexico for soil health and reducing carbon in ranching.
Originally, New Mexico was awarded funds for 22 projects according to a USDA dashboard, but Owen said he didn’t have a full figure of the grant cuts when reached by Source NM.
“All of these changes, the shake-ups and the reorganizations have created just a tremendous amount of uncertainty,” he said.

Union and management agreed on a contract Monday, Aug. 18, but it still needs to be ratified by union members. Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)After three months on the picket line, Butler Hospital’s unionized workers have reached a tentative agreement with the psychiatric facility and its owner, Care New England.
According to a joint statement from Butler’s President Mary Marran and Jesse Martin, the executive vice president of SEIU 1199NE, the two parties have arrived at satisfactory agreements for union workers of all pay grades. 
“On behalf of both Butler Hospital and members of the bargaining committee representing all job classifications of the hospital, we are pleased to share that a tentative agreement has been reached,” Marran and Martin wrote in a joint statement. “More details will be forthcoming in the coming days.” 
The strike, purported to be the longest hospital labor strike in state history, began on May 15, after the roughly 720 unionized members of SEIU 1199NE who work at Butler failed to acquire new contracts after the old ones expired in March. A set of four contracts covered Butler’s union workforce, which includes nurses, mental health workers, and dietary and clerical staff.  
Members of the union’s bargaining committee said multiple times that the strike’s duration continued because the lowest-paid workers, such as those in the dietary and clerical departments, would still see wages around $18 an hour, which the union argued is not a livable wage in the Ocean State. 
Care New England, meanwhile, closed three units at Butler over the strike’s duration, leaving the hospital at roughly half its capacity of around 197 beds. 
As recently as Tuesday, Aug. 12, union workers maintained at a press conference that no bargaining talks were scheduled after negotiations had failed once again the previous week. Union members also said that they had made significant movement on their end, although statements from hospital leaders offered a different interpretation of events. 
More recently, on Thursday, Aug. 14, Butler posted to its website, “As they have since the beginning of their indefinite strike, SEIU 1199NE continues to misrepresent facts about the state of negotiations …After 18 hours of negotiations last week on August 6-7, it was the federal mediator — not the Hospital — who ended the session … The union leaders, who have never worked in our hospital, are misleading the public and placing unnecessary strain on patient care.”
The agreement still needs to be ratified by union members, and spokespeople for both sides would not divulge more details Monday ahead of any final vote.
But the absence of details did not stop Gov. Dan McKee and Rhode Island AFL-CIO President Patrick Crowley, one of the state’s top labor leaders, from issuing a joint statement.
“My office worked closely with RI AFL-CIO and Care New England to play a supportive, convening role during this process,” McKee wrote.
“Working through this dispute took a great deal of patience and a commitment to problem-solving, and both sides deserve credit for taking this step forward,” Crowley said.

(Peter Hall/Capital-Star)A crucial passenger rail link between central Pennsylvania, Philadelphia and New York could be in jeopardy if state lawmakers don’t act to stave off public transit cuts in the commonwealth’s largest metro area, U.S. Rep. Brendan Boyle (D-2nd District) said Monday.
Boyle said Amtrak President Roger Harris told him the loss of more than $71 million in payments from the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) would severely impact Amtrak’s operations, possibly leading to the suspension of the Keystone Service.
“Many people in our area rely on the Keystone Service. If SEPTA cuts or eliminates that funding to Amtrak, that rail line will cease to operate,” Boyle said in a call with reporters Monday.
The train makes 13 daily round trips between Harrisburg and New York with stops in Lancaster, and several smaller communities in southcentral and southeastern Pennsylvania, in addition to Philadelphia. The trains, which are primarily funded by PennDOT, carried 1.27 million passengers last year, according to Amtrak. That makes the Keystone the railroad’s fifth-busiest service. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Amtrak officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Facing a $213 million deficit, SEPTA plans to reduce or eliminate service throughout its system. The cuts could begin as soon as next week if the legislature is unable to increase public transit funding in the state budget, which is now more than six weeks overdue. The reductions could impact up to 800,000 people who use the transit system daily.
The cuts to bus and rail service include the elimination of SEPTA’s regional rail routes that operate on lines owned by Amtrak. They include the Northeast Corridor between New York and Washington and the Keystone Corridor between Philadelphia and Harrisburg.
SEPTA contributed $42.3 million for capital projects including track and signal improvements and $28.8 million in operating expenses including policing and station operations, according to Boyle’s office.
By eliminating five commuter rail services that use Amtrak’s lines, SEPTA can put the cost savings toward its structural deficit, spokesman Andrew Busch said. While service on the remaining eight commuter lines is slated to be reduced by 45%, SEPTA owns those rails and would not see comparable savings by cutting them entirely.
“SEPTA does not know how the elimination of regional rail service on Amtrak-owned lines will impact Keystone Line service,” Busch said. “We understand that Amtrak will have to make decisions in the coming weeks whether to pause or postpone infrastructure projects on the Keystone Line in response to the planned elimination of SEPTA’s lease payments on Jan. 1.”
It’s also unclear whether the loss of SEPTA’s payments would affect Amtrak’s once-daily Pennsylvanian Service between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. In 2023, the state won a federal grant to make improvements to tracks owned by Norfolk Southern Corp. to allow a second daily Pennsylvanian run.

PennDOT officials did not respond to a request for comment Monday. 
While cuts to Amtrak service are not a certainty even if SEPTA makes its planned cuts, the possibility shows how the public transportation crisis “puts tens of millions of dollars in serious jeopardy for the operation of Amtrak in our regions,” Boyle said. 
“It’s yet one more reason why the SEPTA funding crisis needs to end,” he said.
While SEPTA is the state’s largest mass transit agency, public transportation providers in every county have faced a financial crisis since ridership dropped precipitously during the COVID-19 pandemic. With a larger number of people working remotely since then, revenue from fares has not returned to pre-pandemic levels. 
At the same time, lawmakers have struggled to find reliable sources of funding for transportation generally as more fuel-efficient vehicles and the proliferation of electric vehicles have chipped away at fuel tax revenue. 
It has also highlighted the duality of the commonwealth’s urban and rural divide. Republican lawmakers have opposed more funding for transit without additional money for roads, bridges and other transportation infrastructure such as regional airports that serve rural districts.

Gov. Josh Shapiro has proposed increasing the state’s contribution of sales tax revenue to public transportation in his last two budgets to provide about $300 million more for transit. Last year, however, the compromise budget included only $80 million in additional money for transit. Shapiro redirected $153 million in federal highway funding to keep SEPTA afloat.
Despite a flurry of activity last week, the impasse between the Democratic-controlled House and Republican-led Senate appears no closer to breaking. 
House Democrats shot down a $47.6 billion budget proposal Wednesday that had cleared the GOP-controlled Senate late the night before by a party line vote, effectively prolonging the stalemate. 
The Senate’s proposal is about $3 billion less than the one that passed the House last month.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)JAMESTOWN, N.D.  – As shovels dug in for the first time Monday at the site of the new State Hospital in Jamestown, state health officials said they believe North Dakota is turning the page on addressing mental health challenges in the state.
The new State Hospital will be on 12th Avenue, directly across from the current hospital, and house about 140 beds, an increase of 19 beds from the old facility. The new hospital will be smaller, about 316,000 square feet, than the current 650,000-square-foot hospital complex.
Gov. Kelly Armstrong said the new hospital reflects the state’s focus on modernizing important public services, like mental health and addiction services.
“I will be the happiest governor in the world if those 19 beds are eventually sitting empty,” Armstrong said to the standing room only crowd at the groundbreaking ceremony. “Because that will mean we’ve successfully served people upstream, well before their cases become so acute that they require an institutional setting.” 
He said the new facility will be “safe and secure” not only for the patients, but the staff that serves them.

The state has budgeted $300 million for construction of the new facility, which was downsized from $330 million that was initially proposed by House lawmakers during the legislative session.
Dr. Eduardo Yabut, medical director for the State Hospital, said behavioral health care has changed and improved over the decades, but the facilities at the old hospital complex remain in the past.
“We’re talking about the seriously and persistently mentally ill. Those that do not do well in a private setting,” Yabut said. “If it takes three to four months, if they stay at the State Hospital for that amount of time, they never end up coming back. They do well in the community.”
The new hospital will provide the similar treatment services as the old facility, such as: short-term inpatient psychiatric treatment, substance abuse services, forensic services and secure inpatient evaluation and treatment services for individuals deemed sexually dangerous.
Other amenities that will be part of the new state hospital are: an arts room, a bank, barber, a botanical garden, chapel, fitness areas, group therapy space, a library and teaching and vocational spaces.
Yabut said the hospital focuses on rehabilitation, which is why there are amenities like a bank and library because patients need to learn how to use those services to become positive community members.
“When they get out into the community they know how to go to a clinic, know how to show up for their appointments, know how to manage their finances … that can never be replicated in an acute care hospital,” he said.

Pam Sagness, director of the behavioral health division for the Department of Health and Human Services, said Armstrong and the Legislature have invested in the new facility because they view it as important to the well-being of the state.
“It’s recognizing how mental health and looking at addiction … that we’re going to make it a priority in the state of North Dakota,” Sagness said. 
She said the new hospital will take advantage of simple things that may have been overlooked in the 1800s that can contribute to better mental health and wellbeing of a patient, like natural light.
“Being able to have natural light in your windows so as you are healing, you don’t have that darkness that you see in the older brick buildings,” she said. Sagness added it will also improve the lives of the hospital staff to only need to be in one building, instead of six buildings that make up the current complex.
“Even just little things like the outside courtyards, we’re able to have a labyrinth where you can walk and do nature trails,” she said. “And we’re looking at therapeutic things like gardening, things that other people get to do at home, that we can do in the community, but we can also do them at the hospital.”
Construction is expected to be completed by the end of 2027, according to the project website, but isn’t expected to be operational until early 2028.
“I think people have been waiting for this,” Sagness said. “This is one of those projects that, session after session, it was always discussed, but never signed, stamped and endorsed, and this time, it’s our day.”

(Photo provided by Washington State Patrol)Police in Washington are sometimes waiting over a year for the state to test firearms evidence, as the Washington State Patrol deals with a growing backlog.
For the past four years, the state patrol’s forensic crime labs in Vancouver, Tacoma, Seattle and Spokane received an average of 628 requests for testing firearms per year, according to the state patrol. But the labs are only completing 418 of those requests annually.
The state patrol says it is making strides to address the issue, which can delay trials and hinder attempts to quickly find suspects.
As of July 1, over 950 cases awaited forensic analysis of firearms, with the current wait time stretching 54 weeks. The state patrol expects the backlog to peak at more than 1,050 cases this summer as demand for testing grows.
Larger departments can do some testing on their own. This is the case for the King County Sheriff’s Office, according to Undersheriff Jesse Anderson. The sheriff’s office, Anderson said, also uses the National Integrated Ballistic Information Network to examine bullet shell casings.
But for more technical needs, King County still relies on state crime lab scientists.
Tests can include matching a bullet found at a crime scene to the exact gun that fired it. Detectives can then try to track down that gun. Scientists can also try to decipher serial numbers that a person attempted to remove from a gun to help find its owner.
But getting results back from the crime lab can take anywhere from six to 18 months, said Anderson, a former detective.
“Demand continues to grow. It doesn’t go down, it just continues to increase,” he said. “The challenge for all law enforcement agencies and forensics labs is just to be able to keep up with that workload and the expectations that the prosecutors have for building these cases.”
While awaiting testing, police and prosecutors may still have enough evidence to charge suspects, but have to wait to go to trial. In other cases, the forensics may be key to developing leads detectives can follow up on to track down a suspect.
In the past couple years, the crime lab added eight forensic scientists focused on guns, doubling capacity. But it takes two years to train them, said state patrol Chief John Batiste.
Half have completed their training and are examining firearms. As of early August, two more were on track to join the ranks this month, and the other two are expected to finish training by the end of the year.
“The bottom line is that the number of cases where firearms play a part in criminal activity has grown, and we must restructure and grow our forensics capacity,” Batiste said in a statement. “This is a process, not an event. But we are getting closer to meeting our needs every day.”

Once all the new scientists are on board, state patrol expects to reduce its firearm backlog by 35% by next July, and 60% by January 2027. The goal is to consistently finish testing within 120 days by 2028.
Anderson said he thinks the crime lab “is doing what they can to try to keep up.”
“This is just going to be a challenge all the time,” he said.
Washington State Patrol has also faced backlogs in blood toxicology as well as DNA testing, specifically for sexual assault kits. The state auditor said in December that the backlog of sexual assault testing kits had been “effectively eliminated.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Firearms-Lab-DSC_7272-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-08-18 19:56:39.369414

Debra Bazemore and National Alliance on Mental Illness Georgia Chapter Executive Director Kim Jones deliver letters calling on Georgia Insurance and Safety Fire Commissioner John King to enforce Georgia's Mental Health Parity Act. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderMental health advocates gathered at the state Capitol in Atlanta to urge Georgia Insurance Commissioner John King to step up enforcement of the state’s mental health parity laws just a few days after King’s office announced it would fine health insurance companies $20 million for failing to comply. 
The fines, announced Friday, mark the first major instance of the state enforcing a 2022 law aimed at ensuring that insurers cover mental health care alongside its coverage for physical health.
Georgia residents have long faced barriers when it comes to seeking mental health treatment. The state ranks 47th in the nation for access to mental health care, according to an annual report from Mental Health America, and nearly 35% of adults with frequent mental distress said they could not seek care because of the cost – with Georgia ranking last on that metric.
King’s office, which is tasked with ensuring that insurance companies comply with Georgia regulations, said it found over 6,000 violations involving 22 different insurance providers. Companies can be fined up to $2,000 for every violation, or up to $5,000 per violation if they knew or reasonably could have known they were violating the law.

“The time to get in compliance with the law was yesterday,” King said in a statement Friday. “Today, we are taking decisive action to hold those who think they can skirt the law accountable.”
A spokesperson for the Office of Insurance and Safety Fire declined to name which insurers had received fines, saying that more information would become available once the final orders had been issued.
Georgia’s Mental Health Parity Act was signed into law in 2022, and was aimed at improving enforcement of a 2008 federal law requiring health insurance companies to treat behavioral health benefits on par with physical care, meaning that deductibles, co-pays or limits on the number of visits or days of hospitalization should be the same for both mental and physical services.
The law also mandates that Georgia’s Office of Insurance and Safety Fire conduct an in-depth review of insurer data and submit an annual report to the governor, lieutenant governor and speaker of the House of Representatives every August. This year’s report has not yet been publicly posted. 
At a rally for mental health parity outside King’s office Monday, advocates called for greater enforcement of Georgia’s existing parity law and urged King to uphold other aspects of the legislation, including a requirement that the commissioner’s office establish a separate portal for parity-related complaints.
“It’s the parity law, not the parity recommendation or suggestion,” said Jeff Breedlove, the strategic policy advisor for the Georgia Council for Recovery. “It is a privilege for an insurance company to do business in the state of Georgia and serve Georgia families, not a right. And if you want to profit off of Georgians, then you need to at the very least follow our laws.”
And while mental health advocates said they were excited by King’s announcement, many also expressed disappointment in the outcome.
“I’m a little underwhelmed by it,” said Roland Behm, one of the co-founders of the Georgia Mental Health Policy Partnership, adding that the $20 million fines will be split between the numerous insurance companies who failed to comply with the law.

“We’re looking at individual insurers bearing a cost of about a million dollars,” Behm said. “And once again, while more than I have in my checking account, it’s not really a lot of money in the context of insurers who might begin to think that the best thing for them to do is to not comply with the parity act and then just pay whatever fines might be assessed.”
Georgia state Rep. Mary Margaret Oliver, a Decatur Democrat who was a co-sponsor of the 2022 measure and who attended Monday’s parity rally, said she hopes to pass additional legislation aimed at closing the gaps in enforcement when the Legislature reconvenes in January.
House Bill 612, which was introduced by Rome Republican Katie Dempsey, would create a formal mechanism to review and address parity complaints by establishing a parity compliance review panel. It would require health care providers to report suspected violations by health insurers. The bill stalled in the Senate insurance committee, but could be picked up again in 2026.
“I am grateful that we are having some demonstrable evidence from the commissioner today that we’re moving forward, but there is much more to do,” Oliver said.

State officials maintain Vermont is not a sanctuary state but received a letter Monday from the U.S. attorney general’s office alleging it has immigration enforcement policies in place the federal government sees as unlawful.
“For too long, so-called sanctuary jurisdiction policies have undermined this necessary cooperation and obstructed federal immigration enforcement, giving aliens cover to perpetrate crimes in our communities and evade the immigration consequences that federal law requires,” reads the letter dated Aug. 13, shared with VTDigger.
Studies show immigrants in the United States commit crimes at lower rates than the U.S.-born population. Meanwhile, immigration authorities this year have been detaining and deporting record numbers of immigrants who have little or no criminal record, according to the Marshall Project.
Gov. Phil Scott is reviewing the letter from Attorney General Pamela Bondi and is preparing a response to push back on that assertion, according to Dustin Degree, a spokesperson for the governor.
“You are hereby notified that your jurisdiction has been identified as one that engages in sanctuary policies and practices that thwart federal immigration and enforcement to the detriment of the interests of the United States. This ends now,” Bondi’s letter states.
Degree rejected Bondi’s assertion Monday.
“Importantly, Vermont is not a sanctuary state. Vermont does not have any law or policy that impedes the enforcement of federal immigration law,” Degree wrote to VTDigger in an email.
“In fact, the opposite is true: Vermont State law is very clear that the State does not prohibit or impede any public agency from complying with the lawful requirements of 8 U.S.C. §§ 1373 and 1644,” he stated.
Those laws state local law or governmental entities may not prohibit or restrict the sending or receiving of information from federal authorities regarding a person’s immigration status.
Any policy or practice that existed in Vermont that conflicts with federal immigration requirements has been abolished, according to Degree.
“Governor Scott will convey these important details in a response to the AG, which we expect will be sent tomorrow,” Degree wrote.
The letter, which was sent to multiple communities, threatens criminal charges, civil action and potentially withholding federal funds if entities don’t comply.
The letter comes on the heels of the Justice Department announcing its latest list of 35 sanctuary jurisdictions, which includes Vermont, as part of the federal government’s continued effort to target communities that it believes are interfering with immigration enforcement.
An earlier list in May named more than 500 jurisdictions across red and blue states in response to President Donald Trump’s April 28 executive order directing federal authorities to identify so-called sanctuary jurisdictions nationwide that are “deliberately obstructing the enforcement of federal immigration laws and endangering American citizens.”
The whittled down list naming about three dozen sanctuary jurisdictions, largely Democratic, makes no reference to the older list which has been quietly removed from the Department of Homeland Security’s website.

(Photo by Paul Mansfield Photography/ Getty Images)Though Maine’s newly enacted food waste ban won’t start until 2030, advocates and food waste experts say the state needs to take steps in the meantime to prepare. 
Maine was the last New England state to pass legislation creating what’s known as a food waste ban, which diverts food waste from traditional waste streams by prioritizing the donation or recycling of organic material, rather than sending it to landfills or incinerators. It took multiple legislative attempts, but Gov. Janet Mills allowed Maine’s ban to become law earlier this year without her signature.
Because of a first-of-its-kind study in 2024, there is concrete data showing that more than 360,000 tons — or about 520 pounds for every person in the state — of food is wasted or lost in Maine annually. While much of that could be recovered to feed the one in eight Mainers who face hunger, it instead rots in landfills creating methane, a harmful greenhouse gas, according to a study the Maine Department of Environmental Protection asked the University of Maine’s Senator George J. Mitchell Center for Sustainability Solutions to complete. 
Proponents like Peter Blair, policy and advocacy director for the national environmental advocacy organization Just Zero, believe the ban will help the state better address its challenges managing waste, including the fact that a state-owned landfill that currently collects just over half of landfill waste in Maine is expected to reach capacity in 2028. But there is work to be done in the next few years to make sure the state is fully prepared when the new law takes effect. 
Susanne Lee, a faculty fellow at the center the completed the study, said her team at Food Rescue MAINE is already doing some of that work and doesn’t think of this new law in terms of a “ban.” Rather, she said it reinforces the idea that food is a resource and gives credence to the work that is underway to remove it from the waste stream.
“This legislation has really clarified, ‘We’re not kidding. Here in the state of Maine we see food as a resource, a valuable resource that should never be treated as waste,’” Lee said.
A recycled, refined proposal
When Sen. Stacy Brenner (D-Cumberland) proposed LD 1065 earlier this year, it was the third session in a row that such a ban had been introduced in the Legislature. She told the Environment and Natural Resources Committee that her bill built on the earlier bills. 
“LD 1065 incorporates and improves upon that language, offering us a polished, ready-to-go path forward,” she said during the April public hearing.  
The new law prohibits significant generators of food waste — which could include schools, hospitals, food producers and others — from disposing of food waste in traditional landfills or incinerators if they are close to a facility that could compost or otherwise dispose of the waste. It takes a gradual approach to expand the requirement based on someone’s proximity to an organics recycler and the amount of waste generated.
Previous attempts to pass a food waste ban garnered support from lawmakers, but failed due to a lack of funding. Those bills were projected to cost more than $500,000 to implement because the Department of Environmental Protection said it would need multiple new positions and other resources to get such a program up and running. 
This year’s bill seemed like it was headed for the same fate based on the department’s initial testimony on the proposal, but Brenner worked with the department to get that cost down to less than $20,000, allowing this year’s attempt to make it over the finish line. The department ultimately determined it could do the work with existing staff, but that required pushing the start date back by a few years. 
2030 start date 
Blair said the delayed start has the potential to be beneficial, but only if the state prepares for the policy in the meantime. 
If the state ignores this impending policy for the next few years, Blair anticipates issues with its roll out, so he said he would “really urge the state to start proactively getting ready to implement this.”
To do that, he’d like to see the state create a list of which businesses, grocery stores, restaurants and more will be subject to the first wave of the law and educate them on what to expect. Once those entities have been identified, Blair said the department could educate them on the harm of food waste and how to recycle or donate what they would typically throw away. 
The state Department of Environmental Protection did not respond to a request for comment by the time of publication.
Lee said for the past few years her team has been working with communities, schools and businesses on food waste education. The study completed last year helped quantify the issue and led more communities and schools to work with her team, she said. 
Specifically for businesses, her team has already been offering free services to track their food waste and develop solutions to mitigate it. 
The multi-year timeline gives Lee and her team the ability to work with even more entities that will be affected by the new law, figure out what it means for them and how best to prepare. That way, she said, “when 2030 comes, it’s a non-event.”
For Lee, the new law is less about telling people what they can’t do and more about teaching people alternative ways to make use of excess food, such as by feeding other people, animals or nourishing the soil. But the state also needs to have the infrastructure in place to support those behavior changes. 
Maine currently has 83,600 tons of composting and anaerobic digesting capacity, according to testimony from the department shared with the environmental committee. However, many composting facilities are at capacity, with the exception of an anaerobic digester in Exeter in Penobscot County. 
Existing composting infrastructure in the state is concentrated in southern Maine along the coast, so Blair said there is also work to be done to make composting more accessible in northern Maine, especially Aroostook County, which is an agricultural hub for the state. 
Lee echoed the fact that there are gaps in composting infrastructure throughout the state. Her team is already working with food producers in Aroostook County to encourage composting and said there is interest in increasing facilities in that part of the state. 
Now, she said they can leverage LD 1065 being on the books to help get loans or other resources to develop the resources that will be needed come 2030.

(Photo: Clayton Henkel)The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit ruled last week that the federal courts lack jurisdiction to declare the arrest of Maurice Wells Jr. at a 2020 Black Lives Matter protest in Alamance County unconstitutional.
Wells alleged he was racially discriminated against when he was arrested by Alamance County Sheriff Terry Johnson and charged with disorderly conduct and failure to disperse at a July 11, 2020 protest over the police killing of George Floyd in Minnesota. Wells was convicted of both charges in March 2021, and has appealed for a new trial before the Alamance County Superior Court, which remains pending.
In his lawsuit, Wells requested a declaration from the federal courts that Johnson violated his First Amendment rights.
Wells was arrested following an argument with supporters of Alamance County Taking Back Alamance County, a neo-Confederate group, as the BLM protesters demanded the removal of a Confederate statue at the county courthouse in Graham. His initial complaint, filed with the Alamance County Superior Court, says that members of ACTBAC, as the group is known, who also refused the sheriff’s order to disperse were not arrested.
“The plaintiff, Mr. Wells, was deprived of his constitutional rights of free speech and assembly by the defendant, Sheriff Johnson,” his attorneys wrote. “Sheriff Johnson’s actions are evidence of a practice or policy to disfavor the speech of people of color when applying and enforcing the law in Alamance County.”
In a response to the complaint, attorneys for Johnson wrote that he believed Wells to be “inciting a fight” at the protest and denied that his civil rights were violated. Johnson arrested Wells as he continuously rang the courthouse bell and refused to disperse when ordered, testifying at trial that he told Wells, “Son, quit ringing the bell or you’re going to jail. It’s time to disperse.”
“It is denied that Plaintiff’s arrest was part of a pattern and practice in which ACSO suppressed the rights of protesters to speak on matters of public concern following the death of George Floyd in May, 2020,” lawyers for Johnson wrote.
On Aug. 12, a Fourth Circuit panel made up of Judges Paul Niemeyer, Jay Richardson and Henry Floyd found Wells cannot be granted relief because he sought only a declaration that the arrest was unconstitutional, not damages, and failed to show that a declaration would protect him from future harm.
“[A plaintiff] must either allege or show that the preclusion is likely to help redress his injury by doing some work in future litigation. Wells does not,” Richardson wrote. “We therefore hold that the declaration Wells seeks does not offer constitutionally adequate redress. For this reason, Wells cannot seek it in federal court.”
The judges wrote that Wells did not show that a ruling in his favor would protect his rights going forward.
“Even if he again faced arrest and again sued, Wells does not say why Johnson is the defendant against whom he would need preclusion. Wells gives no reason to think he will again protest in Alamance County or be arrested by Johnson himself,” Richardson wrote. “Yet if he protested elsewhere or faced arrest from officers belonging to another agency, no preclusive effect from this case would help him.”
The appeals court vacated a district court ruling dismissing Wells’s case and returned it to the Alamance County Superior Court.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ConfederateMonument_AlamanceCourthouse_chenkel-1024x624.jpg,,,2025-08-18 18:56:53.443786

A political action committee tied to Vermont’s sole U.S. representative — though separate from her campaign — reported thousands of dollars in donations from Google, Nike and Universal Music Group in its latest federal filing.

U.S. Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt., has made a point in recent appeals to supporters that she serves in Congress free from corporate influence. “Hi, it’s Becca,” she wrote in an email to potential campaign donors last month. “I don’t take corporate PAC money.”
But a recent financial disclosure filed by a political action committee Balint uses to support and win favor with other members of Congress — known as a leadership PAC — paints a less clear-cut picture of the second-term representative’s fundraising. 
Over the first half of 2025, Balint’s “Courage PAC” accepted thousands of dollars in contributions from political action committees tied to major corporations, according to its latest Federal Election Commission report.
The leadership PAC is separate from Balint’s main campaign account, or what the FEC calls a “principal campaign committee.”
According to its July 31 filing, Balint’s leadership PAC reported $13,500 in contributions over the first half of the year. More than half of that total came from political action committees linked to big-name companies: $5,000 from Nike’s federal PAC; $2,500 from a PAC tied to Universal Music Group; and $1,000 from Google’s federal PAC.
Some of those contributions came at or around the same time Balint was disavowing corporate support to potential donors. Her leadership PAC reported receiving the Google donation, for instance, on June 12; less than a week later, she wrote in an email seeking donations directly to her campaign that “unlike other politicians, Becca doesn’t take money from big corporate donors with a hidden agenda — she relies on support from people like you who pitch in $10 or $5 at a time.”
The remaining $5,000 in last month’s report came from Equality PAC, which is the political arm of the Congressional Equality Caucus and raises money to elect more openly LGBTQ+ people — such as Balint — to the U.S. House and Senate.
Balint’s leadership PAC also accepted more than $12,000 from corporate PACs during the 2024 election cycle, according to previous FEC filings. That included donations from PACs tied to Elon Musk’s SpaceX, Amazon, Paramount, Sony Entertainment and Toyota, as well as the Nike, Universal Music Group and Google-affiliated PACs.
Many members of Congress, including the two other members of Vermont’s delegation, have their own leadership PACs. Politicians often use these PACs to fundraise for other candidates within their party, which can in turn bolster their own image and influence.
Leadership PACs are legally separate from politicians’ own campaigns, though, and the former cannot directly fundraise for the latter. That’s a point Sophie Pollock, a Balint spokesperson, made in a statement to VTDigger about Balint’s PAC’s fundraising. 
“These funds are used to donate to other campaigns that the Congresswoman believes in, progressive candidates rooted in their communities, fighting for working people,” Pollock said. “To be clear, these funds do not go toward Rep. Balint’s campaign for her own reelection.”
She added that Balint sees her leadership PAC as a tool to help elect more members of Congress who will counter President Donald Trump’s administration in the coming years. Right now, Republicans control the White House and both houses of Congress.
“She’s laser focused on taking back the Republican controlled House that’s doing so much damage. We must defend our democracy from Donald Trump,” Pollock said. “The stakes are too high.”
Filings show Balint’s leadership fund has contributed in recent months to Rep. Chris Pappas, D-New Hampshire, who is running for a U.S. Senate seat in 2026; Rep. Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio, who narrowly overcame a Republican challenge to her seat in 2024; and JoAnna Mendoza, a Democrat running for a GOP-held House seat in Arizona.
Still, the recent big-brand donations to Balint’s leadership PAC stand out compared to the list of contributors, over the same time period, for the leadership PACs used by Vermont’s Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders and Democratic Sen. Peter Welch.
Sanders’ leadership PAC, called “Progressive Voters of America,” reported a total of $200,650 from at least 179 contributions over the first half of the year, according to FEC filings. Nearly all of those came from individual donors, filings show, while just one — $5,000 from the National Education Association, or NEA — came from a PAC.
Welch’s leadership PAC — “Maple PAC” — raised $70,500 in that time from at least 34 contributions. Most of that money came from PACs, though none are affiliated with corporations. The largest contributors, at $5,000 apiece, include PACs representing the hospitality industry, mortgage bankers, realtors, dermatologists, broadcasters, sheet metal workers and electric co-ops, according to the committee’s latest filing.
Neither of the senators’ leadership PACs reported contributions from corporations during the 2024 election cycle, either, previous FEC records show.
Matthew Dickinson, a political science professor at Middlebury College, said it’s common for leadership PACs to take in money from many different sources, including corporations. Balint is not running afoul of any laws by spending corporate money on other candidates she likes, he said. But Dickinson added the leadership PAC’s activities could appear “in tension” with Balint’s campaign messaging, which in part entices people to donate using a pledge that she takes no corporate contributions. 
“It’s all legal. But perhaps, ethically, some might view that it tarnishes the claim not to accept corporate money,” Dickinson said in an interview. “She’s not lying in her email. But she’s not telling you the whole story.”
The latest FEC report filed for Balint’s campaign account, which is called “Becca Balint for Vermont,” also lists a handful of donations from PACs that are tied to corporations — something that would directly conflict with Balint’s campaign messaging. But Pollock said the campaign had, as of last week, rejected those donations and was returning them. (The donations made up a relatively small percentage of the total receipts.)
“Rep. Balint does not and will never take corporate PAC money into her own campaign account. Period,” Pollock said in a statement.
July’s FEC filings show that about two-thirds of the money Balint’s campaign brought in over the first half of the year came from individuals. Much of the rest came from PACs representing different industries, labor interests or cooperatives — including one, notably, that featured in the contentious final stages of Balint’s 2022 primary race against Molly Gray. Balint beat Gray and was later elected to her first term.
At the time, Balint’s campaign skewered Gray over a donation Gray received from a PAC tied to American Crystal Sugar Company, which is the country’s largest producer of beet sugar. Balint’s campaign charged that the Minnesota-based cooperative was the “number one donor to GOP congresspeople who willfully encouraged and supported the insurrection on Jan. 6th.” Later that year, a report from the nonpartisan watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington found that American Crystal Sugar’s PAC ranked among the top campaign contributors to members of Congress who voted against the certification of the 2020 presidential election.
Balint was also caught up in controversy following the 2022 primary after campaign filings revealed that Nishad Singh, then a top advisor to the now-disgraced cryptocurrency mogul Sam Bankman-Fried, had donated $1.1 million to a PAC that then used Singh’s money to buy pro-Balint advertisements. Balint’s campaign later said it had no coordination with Singh during that process.
This April, Balint’s campaign took a $5,000 donation from American Crystal Sugar’s PAC, FEC filings show. (In both the 2022 and 2024 election cycles, the PAC donated more to Democrats than to Republicans, according to an OpenSecrets analysis.)
Asked for comment about that contribution, Pollock said only that Balint “accepts donations from agriculture associations who support her progressive agenda.”
“She’s looking ahead toward taking back the House,” Pollock said.

Bailey was appointed attorney general in 2022 after Eric Schmitt was elected to the U.S. Senate. Schmitt got the job in 2018 after Josh Hawley resigned to join the Senate. He announced his decision to leave the attorney general’s office Monday evening.
“My life has been defined by a call to service, and I am once again answering that call, this time at the national level,” Bailey said in a news release announcing his departure. “But wherever I am called, Missouri is and always will be home,”
Bailey’s last day as attorney general will be Sept. 8. Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe will name his replacement, who will then serve until the current term expires in 2028. 
Bailey had never run for public office before former Missouri Gov. Mike Parson tapped him to replace Schmitt in 2022. At the time, he was serving as Parson’s general counsel. He previously worked as an assistant prosecuting attorney in Warren County and as an assistant attorney general. 
Andrew Bailey says his approach as Missouri Attorney General is shaped by faith, war

Weeks after being elected to full four-year term last year, Bailey was vying to be President Donald Trump’s new attorney general or FBI director. He will now join the FBI as it faces a torrent of criticism from across the political spectrum over the Trump administration’s refusal to release government files on the late sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein. 
His short stint as Missouri’s attorney general was largely defined by confrontation — lawsuits against the federal government, investigations of health care providers and public fights with other statewide elected Republicans.
Bailey’s most high-profile cases since becoming attorney general included twice suing to block federal student loan forgiveness and carrying forward an unsuccessful lawsuit alleging the Biden administration was colluding with social media companies to censor conservative speech.
His office is also involved in four different lawsuits regarding medical records of transgender children — part of his effort to end gender-affirming care in Missouri. 
The attorney general’s office under Bailey helped force St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner out of office and is pursuing felony charges against St. Louis County Executive Sam Page. 
Bailey has also been unflinchingly loyal to Trump, including publicly endorsing the lie that the 2020 presidential election was stolen and unsuccessfully attempting to intervene in the criminal case against him in New York that resulted in 34 felony convictions. 
But Bailey’s tenure as attorney general has also been marked by accusations of corruption, incompetence and grandstanding, with his critics alleging he’s more interested in scoring appearances on Fox News than effectively running the sprawling office or winning in the courtroom.
Among the many lawsuits Bailey inherited from his predecessor was a case against Missouri school districts that implemented mask mandates during the COVID-19 pandemic. After a judge ruled in support of the school boards, Bailey’s office missed its deadline to appeal.
Last summer, he narrowly avoided being questioned under oath about his contact with a defendant in his own case against Jackson County. One of Bailey’s deputies lost his license because of the meetings, according to a filing from the county’s attorneys.
Bailey was also the focus of a formal complaint about the behavior of his office after he falsely blamed the Hazelwood School District’s diversity, equity and inclusion program for the off-campus assault of a student.
He’s also faced criticism over his contributions to his campaign. 
Bailey recused himself from a gambling lawsuit filed against the Missouri State Highway Patrol after PACs connected to the lobbyist of the companies suing the state wrote checks to the committee supporting his campaign.
He raised eyebrows after accepting $50,000 in campaign donations from Doe Run, a St. Louis-based company being sued by thousands of Peruvians over allegations of lead smelter poisoning in their mining town in the Andes. A few months before the donation, Bailey filed a brief asking the federal court to move the lawsuit out of Missouri.

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana House Republicans met privately Monday on the north side of Indianapolis to discuss the possibility of redrawing Indiana’s congressional map — but it’s still unclear where the caucus may land on the politically-charged proposal.
House Speaker Todd Huston told the Indiana Capital Chronicle after the roughly two-hour meeting that “we had a good conversation” but did not give details about where the caucus stands, overall.
“We’re still talking, and we’ll work on all this together,” Huston said. 
He said there was no timeline for the caucus to make any decisions and declined to comment on whether a special session seemed likely or not.
While other state lawmakers were mum — with several declining to speak to the Indiana Capital Chronicle following the meeting — members of Indiana’s GOP congressional delegation have jumped on board.
“Democrats have proven they will use every tool available to them to gain and keep power. For years, Republicans have idly stood by while the Left has weaponized government against us,” U.S. Rep. Marlin Stutzman wrote Monday on X. “It’s time for us to drop the gloves. At this moment, our state has the opportunity to give conservative Hoosiers the representation in DC they deserve. I stand with President Trump, it’s time to redraw Indiana’s congressional map!”
Stutzman’s northeastern seat is probably the most isolated from any redistricting threats, though some worry that cracking deep-blue Indianapolis into several districts — rather than packing all the voters into one — could erode the safe margins Republicans currently have in other seats.

— Rep. Marlin Stutzman (@RepStutzman) August 18, 2025

Of Indiana’s nine congressional districts, seven are held by the GOP. Outside of Indianapolis, Democrats hold the northwestern Indiana district. 
U.S. Rep. Victoria Spartz — whose 5th District in central Indiana grew redder in the last map process — also came out in support. She pinned her statement to a post from California Gov. Gavin Newsom calling “to meet fire with fire.”
“This fall, Indiana will have the chance to respond to Democrats’ gerrymandering and stand with President Trump and the state of Texas to stand up for our REPUBLIC! Given developments across the country, I fully support mid-cycle redistricting,” Spartz said. 
And U.S. Rep. Mark Messmer, R-8th, posted this statement: “I am proud to support Hoosier State Legislators and our great @GovBraun in fighting the long history of weaponized voter manipulation in CA, NY, and IL. Redistricting in Indiana will accurately reflect the will of Hoosier voices.”
Messmer was in state Senate leadership when the current congressional map was drawn in 2021 by Indiana Republicans. 
U.S. Rep. Rudy Yakym, R-2nd, posted “Democrats have long used every tool to advance their agenda and hold power. Republicans can’t afford to stay on the sidelines any longer. Indiana now has a chance to ensure conservative Hoosiers are truly represented in Washington. I stand with President Trump — it’s time to redraw our congressional map.
Just after 6 p.m., southern Indiana U.S. Rep. Erin Houchin also publicized her support.
“Democrats will stop at nothing to push their radical agenda. Republicans can’t accept that any longer. Indiana can act to guarantee that all Hoosiers have the strongest possible conservative voices in Washington. I’m standing with President Trump — it’s time to redraw Indiana’s congressional map,” Houchin said.
Pressure on Hoosier Republicans
The push comes after national Republicans, including President Donald Trump, have pressured red states to reconfigure their maps ahead of 2026 to maximize GOP control in the U.S. House. Indiana was launched to the forefront of that conversation following recent meetings between Vice President JD Vance and top state leaders. 
Indiana GOP legislators are headed to the White House next week for a visit that was previously scheduled, but now redistricting will be a topic. 
  Gov. Mike Braun addresses reporters on Aug. 18, 2025. (Niki Kelly/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
Gov. Mike Braun reiterated Monday afternoon that he remains noncommittal on whether to call a special session for redistricting, saying the decision will depend on consensus within the General Assembly. 
“I’m not going to call one unless there is going to be general agreement that we need to,” Braun told reporters, noting a session could cost taxpayers roughly $150,000. A special session in Indiana in 2022 cost about $240,000.
Braun acknowledged the national political pressure but emphasized that Indiana is already solidly Republican. 
“Yes, there will be political pressure put on, and it will be cranked up, probably closer you get to the finish line of when they’d like to get it done.”
He added that Republicans “run 88% of the local government offices,” he said. “When southern Indiana, where I’m from, flipped 20 years ago, [it] started into become solidly red congressional districts. It changed, and it’s going to change until something else will flip the other way”.
Still, he left the door open to GOP lawmakers’ demands. 
“We could create nine Republican districts,” Braun said. “But … many things that should evolve (should) not be done out of context”.
Divisions in the caucus
But not all Republicans are on board. 
Rep. Ed Clere, R-New Albany, blasted the idea of an emergency session to redraw congressional lines.
“Under no circumstances will I vote for a new map,” Clere said in a written statement provided to the Capital Chronicle. “Special sessions should be reserved for emergencies. The president’s desperation to maintain a U.S. House majority by stacking the deck in favor of Republicans does not constitute an emergency.”
Clere, speaking before Monday’s caucus, warned that rushing the process without public hearings could open the state to legal challenges and set a dangerous precedent. 
“It would be another step toward a full-time legislature, and that’s the last thing Indiana needs,” he continued. “There is nothing that can’t wait until the next regular session.”
A White House visit and poll amplify redistricting fight in Indiana

He added that redistricting could even backfire on Republicans: “Be careful what you ask for — a new congressional map could have the effect of making some Republican-held congressional districts more competitive.”
Meanwhile, GOP activists have ramped up pressure on lawmakers through telephone calls to Hoosier constituents. 
Longtime Republican Jewell DeBonis told the Capital Chronicle she received multiple automated “robocalls” urging her to contact local legislators, though several initially targeted the wrong representatives. She has since filed a complaint with the attorney general’s office.
“Braun said wait and see what Texas does. I’m offended by that,” DeBonis said. “It shouldn’t matter to us in Indiana what people in Texas or California or Illinois do. We’re better than that. We should stand up for what’s right for Indiana, regardless of what other states are doing. If we go down this path of redistricting every time we get concerned about what the outcomes of the next election might be that’s just perilous. It’s just wrong. … The Republican Party is better than this.”
Josh DeFonce, the communications director for Attorney General Todd Rokita, confirmed that the office had received calls to investigate the legality of Forward America’s robocalls. 
“We rely primarily on complaints to investigate consumer related matters including robocalls,” DeFonce said. “… we now have multiple to review. Only just receiving them today and as you can understand, it will take some time to review those appropriately and fully.”
Conservative activist Charlie Kirk, a co-founder and the executive director of Turning Point USA, also took to social media to threaten Indiana’s GOP incumbents.
“We will support primary opponents for Republicans in the Indiana State Legislature who refuse to support the team and redraw the maps. I’ve heard from grassroots across the country and they want elected Republicans to stand up and fight for them. It’s time for Republicans to be TOUGH Don’t let California steal the 2026 house from us.”

In Montpelier, city officials plan to remove the Pioneer Street Dam and restore a nearby floodplain. Together, the projects are predicted to have compounding positive effects that reduce flood risk in the city.  
The Pioneer Street Dam — an old mill dam — is about 1.3 miles upstream from the capital city’s downtown along the Winooski River. Not only is the dam filled with cracks, but engineers consider it a flood hazard. 
“It’s got about everything wrong with a dam you can imagine,” said Roy Schiff, an engineer who’s monitoring the dam. 
Nearby sits an 18 acre parcel of land at 5 Home Farm Way, where the Stevens Branch of the Winooski River joins the main branch. That land, which houses the Jacob Davis Farmstead, was historically a floodplain. Restoring it to such, coupled with the dam removal just downstream, could significantly reduce flood risk, Schiff said.

The project offers a look at how recovery efforts from the 2023 flood are underway in the city. After years of monitoring water levels and studying the feasibility of the project, officials are starting to seek permitting and funding approval for their plans. 
“There is a real sense of forward momentum and progress,” said Jon Copans, executive director of the Montpelier Commission for Recovery and Resilience. 
The Vermont River Conservancy first pushed for Montpelier to take down four dams along the river back in 2021. Along with taking down the Pioneer Street Dam, they encouraged dismantling the Bailey Dam, the North Branch Dam and the Hidden Dam. Removing them could mitigate flood risk, improve river ecology and offer recreation opportunities, Randzio said.  
The four old dams hold back a large amount of sediment and a small amount of water, Randzio said. The sediment built up behind their structure pushes water levels even higher during times of peak flow.

The conservancy selected consulting firm SLR International to perform feasibility studies of the four dams in 2021, she said. A grant from The Lake Champlain Basin Program paid for those studies, Randzio said. 
After floods pummeled the state in 2023 — and hit Montpelier especially hard — river experts pointed to thousands of what Schiff calls “deadbeat dams” around the state. Then, city officials and state lawmakers started taking notice. 
In Montpelier, Randzio’s proposals became a high priority. Necessary evaluations of the dams were already underway — putting the project on a fast track, Randzio said. 
The Pioneer Street Dam dates to when people used water to turn wheels or millboards or grind grains, Schiff said. But dams are expensive to maintain and they deteriorate fast, he said. 
Those working on the project anticipate the sediment built up behind the dam contains pollutants from an old coal facility that once operated along the riverbank upstream, Randzio said. Digging out that sediment while breaking down the dam is an iterative process, Schiff said. 
“You have to lower the water a little bit, remove some sediment, lower the dam a little bit,” to prevent sediment from being released downstream, he said.
Just upstream from the dam, at 5 Home Farm Way, sits The Jacob Davis Farmstead, a historic building declared a public safety hazard in 2019, according to The Barre Montpelier Times Argus. The city is currently working with The Preservation Trust of Vermont to remove the building from the property and restore some pieces of it, Copans said. 
That way, the 18 acre property would again be a floodplain. By using that land “we can create more flood storage to help protect the local area and store some more water to protect Montpelier,” Schiff said. 
The city’s also considering ways it can use the land for recreation and public enjoyment, Copans said. 
Schiff’s firm worked with city officials and employees at the regional planning commission to submit a list of projects to request funding from the state. The firm concluded the removal of the Pioneer Dam coupled with the floodplain restoration would offer significant flood mitigation risk compared to other proposed projects, and it made sense to tackle the two projects together. 
The city hopes to get funding from part of FEMA’s hazard mitigation grant program funding offered to Vermont, Copans said. So far, they’ve received positive signals from the state and remain hopeful, he said. 
Then, the project proposals must clear a number of Act 250 and permitting processes before a contractor is hired and work begins, Schiff said. 
But all acknowledge the project is just a piece of the puzzle. Randzio hopes the town can remove all four dams, especially the Bailey Dam by Shaw’s grocery store downtown. 
“Each one of these projects is a step forward and there are more projects sort of in the pipeline,” Copans said.

But the council’s affirmation highlights a growing divide between the City of Wilmington and New Hanover County over government’s role in fostering diversity, equity and inclusion. The conflict is playing out in real time as state and local government officials await a possible veto override of House Bill 171, which targets DEI initiatives in state and local government.
The measure prohibits state agencies and local governments from using state funds to “promote, support, fund, implement, or maintain diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives or programs.” It passed along party lines with Republicans voting for the bill and Democrats against it. Gov. Josh Stein vetoed the legislation but it could face an override attempt.
The legislation came on the heels of President Donald Trump’s executive order terminating diversity, equity, and inclusion offices, positions, and programs in the federal government and equity-related grants and contracts.
Wilmington Council member Kevin Spears said city officials must do what they think is right for the citizens of Wilmington.
“I couldn’t care less about what the federal government at this moment mandates or what the state government at this moment mandates as it relates to how we work to better this community,” he said during a recent council meeting.
However, after a lengthy and spirited discussion last month, the New Hanover Board of County Commissioners voted 3-2 along party lines to withdraw from the partnership on the community relations committee. The three Republicans argued that the committee overstepped its authority by attempting to become a “quasi forum” for fair housing complaints, unfair hiring practices and complaints about other forms of discrimination.

County Manager Chris Coudriet, who recommended ending the county’s participation on the committee, agreed with the three commissioners.
“It should have never been contemplated that the CRAC [Community Relations Advisory Committee] was a clearinghouse for housing complaints,” Coudriet said. “The county had made the decision to eliminate the Human Relations Commission for that very reason.”
In 2009, New Hanover’s commissioners disbanded the county’s Human Relations Commission, which was created decades earlier to assist residents with discrimination complaints regarding racism, sexual harassment or their sexual orientation. Critics of that decision argued that the Human Relations Commission provided ordinary citizens a chance to be heard when complaints regarding discriminatory practices arose.
Similar arguments were made last month in support of the Community Relations Advisory Committee.

“Absent this committee, for the general public, there’s no established platform to be able to come to on a regular basis and bring up issues,” said Commissioner Rob Zapple, one two Democrats who argued in favor of the county continuing to support the Community Relations Advisory Committee.“We pull that away, and we’ve taken a step back 20 or 30 years. I don’t think it’s the best way to serve our citizens.”
 
Concern over civilian review board
For the three Republican commissioners, the larger issue appeared to be the Community Relations Advisory Committee’s past attempt to create a civilian review board for the Sheriff’s Office.

“The sheriff is elected by the people of New Hanover County, that is the civilian review board of the sheriff,” Commissioner Dane Scalise said during a July board meeting. “The sheriff does not need another organization coming in and telling him how to run his office and the fact that that came about is an indication that the committee has misplaced its priorities.”
Commissioner LeAnn Pierce, the board’s vice-chair, was equally blunt in her remarks about the nearly decades-old civilian review board discussion.

“The committees that we appoint citizens to, they work at the pleasure of the county commissioners and if we feel like they have gotten off track, this is where it lands,” Pierce said.
Zapple noted that the committee’s debate over a civilian review board happened long ago.
“We took a look at it and our sheriff weighed in on it and we said ‘No, we don’t think this is a great idea,’” he said. “To use that as justification here in 2025 to disband it [the Community Relations Advisory Committe] was not fair, it wasn’t right.”
Coudriet acknowledged that the the civilian review board discussion wasn’t the work of the current Community Relations Advisory Committee.
“That is not recent discourse but is very prominent discourse in the nature of that body,” Coudriet said.
  Antrevonn Tate (Photo submitted)
Antrevonn Tate, chairman of the committee, said a civilian review board does not reflect the mindset of current committee members. The city appointee said it’s unfair to hold current committee members responsible for actions of past boards.
“If someone had talked to me, we could have sat down and explained to them where we are today,” Tate said. “We are not where we were back in 2016. We’re actually shifting and aligning a lot more with what our bylaws are today and that’s really focused on prejudice and discrimination.”
Pushing race relation efforts out of the county
Tate said the committee’s mission is clear.
“CRAC [Community Relations Advisory Community] wasn’t formed to legislate. It wasn’t formed to force anything, any policy or action from a local perspective. It was really more so to advise our elected body and governing officials.”
Tate acknowledged the committee will feel the loss of county appointees, some of who are employed by New Hanover County and brought invaluable insight to the committee
“These are people that are with the county, so they have good perspectives,”  Tate said. “They’re in the health field, so they’re professionals in the health field, they have their doctorates and a lot of these people have master’s [degrees].”
Republican commissioners didn’t push DEI to the forefront of arguments against ending county participation on the Community Relations Advisory Committee. Their critics, however, said the commissioners goal to rid the county of such initiatives has been undeniable.
“I think without a doubt, it seems like anything that dealt with race relations in a community or in an official capacity, is getting a spotlight put on it,” Zapple said. “It either being changed or eliminated.”
The views of at least one member on the subject are well known.
In January, Scalise railed against a request by the New Hanover County Commission on African American History, Heritage and Culture to adopt a National Day of Racial Healing.
Scalise criticized the county’s Office of Diversity for bringing the proclamation to commissioners.
“The County’s Office of Diversity or DEI department has amply demonstrated that it should not be funded in this year’s or future budgets,” Scalise said in a prepared text he later posted on X. “It is time, as President Donald Trump correctly noted during his inaugural address yesterday (Jan. 20), to ‘end the government policy of trying to socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life.’ I will work tirelessly to make that a reality at the local level during our coming budget discussions.”
Commissioners approved the proclamation on a 4-1 vote, with Scalise voting against it.
But the county’s Office of Diversity disappeared and a new Office of Civic Engagement took its place. That office’s stated mission is to “promote an engaged, fair and equal environment that fosters a strong community and culture where residents and employees are respected, valued, and contribute to the county’s success.”
“Commissioner Scalise and the other two Republican Commissioners could not deny the good work that was coming from that office,” Zapple said. “I think what they objected to was the name of the office.”
The office did lose three of its five member staff because of deep county budget cuts, Zapple said.
Meanwhile, at City Hall, the council discussed whether to continue the Community Relations Advisory Committee without county participation.
HB 171 does not prohibit local governments from establishing DEI programs Wilmington City Attorney Meredith Everhart, said. But she warned the council that state lawmakers hold the “purse strings.”
“And what they say [state lawmakers] is that the city has to make a report to the state auditor every year [stating] that we do not engage in any DEI programs and the [state] auditor is supposed to check in on those things and if the auditor reports back [that we’re engaged in DEI programs], we could lose state funding,” Everhart said.
Wilmington Mayor Bill Saffo said the Community Relations Advisory Committee has been invaluable in helping Wilmington through civil strife and could continue to play an important role helping to “break through some of the silos” that prevent people from coming together to discuss issues that threaten to disrupt the community.
“I think it can play an important role if it’s properly structured and it’s something that we think could help,” Saffo said.
Saffo said the city understands the risks that come with HB 171.
“We understand the consequences of what’s being held over our heads,” Saffo said. “We get that.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Wilmington-Riverwalk-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-08-18 18:56:53.443786
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-18 22:22:22+00:00,CT Mirror,Emails: Lamont sought counsel as HB 5002 housing bill opposition erupted,Ginny Monk,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/18/ct-lamont-hb-5002-169strong-emails/,"CT Gov. Ned Lamont involved his wife, a former state senator and others in discussions over how to respond to opposition to HB 5002.","In the weeks leading up to the veto of the most significant piece of housing legislation to ever cross Gov. Ned Lamont’s desk, he, his wife and key members of his staff calculated the public perception and politics related to whether he would sign the bill, according to internal emails obtained by The Connecticut Mirror.
Less than a month before his decision to veto House Bill 5002, the governor debated how to combat the rhetoric of CT169Strong, a group strongly opposed to the legislation. He called their assertions “gross misrepresentations” of the housing bill, as he considered running for a third term.
“Here’s an example of the anti housing literature, which is catching fire in Fairfield County,” Ned Lamont wrote in a May 31 email seeking the advice of a former Connecticut politician. “I’m trying to figure out how best to respond to these gross misrepresentations before it is too late.”
The literature he was referring to was a lengthy email detailing 169Strong’s concerns about the bill and an explanation of their interpretation of the measure. Lawmakers and housing experts who worked on the bill have repeatedly said the group’s messaging misinterprets the bill and classified it as misinformation.
A CT Mirror review of more than 14,000 pages of communications sent to and from the governor and key members of his staff showed that, in the weeks that followed, the Democratic governor received thousands of emails from people opposed to the housing bill, many featuring identical or similar language.
The governor’s office was particularly interested in gauging the temperature of voters as the bill came to his desk, emails show, asking staffers to tally the number of people in favor and against. They reported that much of the opposition came from Fairfield County residents who appeared not to have read the actual bill.
Rob Blanchard, Lamont’s communications director, said in a statement Monday that the governor wanted to “ensure that all views were being expressed and shared on the housing bill, rather than one group controlling the conversation.” 
We won’t be sidetracked by some small group of housing extremists who are probably more worried about where they’ll be ‘summering’ this season than they are about someone else’s plight to find housing.Statement from democratic senators
“The Governor ultimately did not sign the housing bill into law because of concerns he had around whether local leaders would be able to achieve the goals outlined in the bill— no current or future politics played a role in his decision,” Blanchard said. He added that Lamont has been working to add more state resources to housing construction and is committed to working on an improved housing bill.
“One thing we have learned from that work is that local leaders need to be bought in to the solution — and it was clear that was not the case with this bill,” he said in the statement. “Additionally, rhetoric that spreads misinformation or villainizes efforts to fix our housing can also make that mission harder.”
House Bill 5002 was a sweeping piece of housing legislation that addressed issues from parking to zoning and homelessness. It aimed to increase the state’s housing supply as Connecticut faces a dire lack of homes, particularly those that are affordable to its lowest-income residents. A report released earlier this year from the state’s largest business association also showed that the lack of housing is holding back Connecticut’s economy.
The bill was years in the making and was a priority for House and Senate Democrats. Lamont’s staff helped negotiate it, and lawmakers passed it with assurances that the governor would sign.
But it faced fierce opposition from Republicans and groups that represent towns. CT169Strong, which operates largely out of Fairfield County and has opposed state-level changes to zoning policy, also launched a campaign to get Lamont to veto the bill.
“People are recognizing that if they want to find out what’s in the bills, they come to us as a source for that information when their legislators are not necessarily doing that,” said Maria Weingarten, one of the 169Strong co-founders, in an interview Monday.
On June 23, Lamont vetoed the bill, saying he wanted lawmakers to try again and that he thought he could get towns on board with a new bill to be addressed in a special session.
He said he particularly wanted to work on a provision in the bill that would have banned off-street parking minimums for smaller housing developments and a measure that assigned each town a number of units of housing to plan and zone for.
“I think we can make it better,” Lamont said when he vetoed the bill. “I think the only way to really make it work is if you have buy-in from the local communities. And I think the vast majority of those communities want to do the right thing.”
In a statement, Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, Housing Committee co-chair Sen. Martha Marx, D-New London, and Planning and Development Committee co-chair Sen. MD Rahman, D-Manchester, said it’s unfortunate the original bill was vetoed, but they are working with Lamont on a new housing bill.
“Meanwhile, we won’t be sidetracked by some small group of housing extremists who are probably more worried about where they’ll be ‘summering’ this season than they are about someone else’s plight to find housing that is affordable, or a business owner’s plight to find employees who can actually afford to buy a home in Connecticut,” the statement said.
Housing Committee co-chair Rep. Antonio Felipe expressed concern about 169Strong’s influence in the process.
“I think it’s just a little concerning that 169Strong has such a hold on folks’ opinions when there were plenty of us within the legislature that worked closely with the governor’s office, and the governor himself, that had different opinions,” said Felipe, D-Bridgeport. “It felt like this group, as large as they are, had more sway in the moment, or had more say on our policy than us as policymakers.”
Framing the message
Internal emails from the start of the session until the day of the veto show very little discussion of the policies in the bill. Lamont’s office raised a few technical concerns in the spring but appeared to be on board by the time the bill was signed, although the governor and Annie Lamont, his wife, raised concerns early on about public perception.
On May 29, the day before the Senate gave final passage to H.B. 5002, Annie Lamont received an email containing a message from 169Strong outlining their opposition to the bill. She sent it along to the governor. 
“Let’s get a response to this so I can send back,” Ned Lamont responded, forwarding the message to his spokesman, Blanchard. “I don’t think we have an equivalent of 169 strong.”
The Senate gave final passage to H.B. 5002 on May 30. On May 31, Lamont emailed former Sen. Will Haskell, D-Wilton, to ask his advice on controlling the “anti housing” messaging from 169Strong.
The group, which is registered as a corporation and takes donations, formed five years ago. 
Haskell told the governor the best way to tamp down the opposition was to sign the bill. He suggested framing the law as both a “moral and economic imperative” and gave the governor specific suggestions on how to announce the bill signing, including an example of a social media video to mimic to promote the effort.
“This bill isn’t about changing our towns, but rather ensuring a few more people can enjoy what makes this state special,” Haskell said in the email. He also spoke about what he considered 169Strong’s weaknesses.
“I would sign the bill loudly, go on offense, and attempt to put the CT169Strong crowd on their heels. I know Maria (who wrote that 169 email), and she doesn’t do well when forced to reckon with big-picture policy questions,” he said, referring to Weingarten, one of the founders of the group.
Haskell declined to comment on Monday.
Weingarten said Monday she wasn’t bothered by Haskell’s email but more focused on ensuring that the policymaking process is transparent. The omnibus bill started as a study, and during the legislative process, several bills were added together to create H.B. 5002. They got public hearings earlier in the process under different names.
That’s typically the process for Connecticut’s legislature, but Republicans have criticized it, saying it’s misleading.
“Listening to the governor’s comments, it still wasn’t clear to us that he had fully grasped what was in the bill,” Weingarten said. “We stand by everything we’ve said about what’s in the bill, and we encourage everybody to continue to understand and look at the details of what’s in the bill and the potential implications.”
Haskell’s idea didn’t stick with the governor’s office. 
Blanchard said Lamont regularly consults with allies and colleagues on policy matters.
“This bill was no different,” he wrote. “The Governor heard from and met with many who requested he sign the bill and others who asked that he not. He appreciated hearing different viewpoints and strategies and will ultimately incorporate some of them into a new housing bill.”
The governor and first lady heard from fellow Greenwich residents about the reasons Lamont shouldn’t sign the bill.
A Greenwich resident on June 4 emailed Annie Lamont asking what she thought about a 169Strong message. Annie forwarded the message to Ned.
“We need to get our talking points out there !!!” she said.
That wasn’t the only time the Lamonts heard from someone who knew them. On June 5, a Wilton resident the governor met at a boat show emailed him.
“I find HB 5002 an extreme government overreach of the state to towns and cities. I am frankly shocked that this bill passed with bi-partisan opposition,” the resident wrote, referencing the Democrats and Republicans who voted against the bill.
Annie Lamont intervened directly with Blanchard on June 4, forwarding him the 169Strong email. 
“It must be going all over the state and we have no response. Lots of people commenting. Concerted effort on R’s [Republicans’] part to say ned raised taxes and destroyed the guard rails,” she wrote. “They are gearing up fir a compaign. We need to provide a bullet point by BP [bullet point] response.”
The governor’s staff emailed about a few questions about the policy but ultimately agreed with the measures.
“I think policy-wise we are fine with most of the list, but there are fiscal notes on many pieces that we’ll have to oppose/ will be negotiated in the budget pieces,” said Megan Krementowski, a legislative director at the governor’s office, in an April 29 email.
Patrick Hulin, Lamont’s policy director, emailed in mid-May requesting smaller changes to the bill and thanking lawmakers “for engaging us so thoroughly in this process.”
Voices of voters
In the weeks leading up to the veto, the governor’s office got thousands of emails and calls from residents about H.B. 5002. Most of them, especially early on, implored the governor to veto the bill.
The opposition to the housing bill organized early and pushed what political pundits say was a last-ditch attempt to ensure it didn’t become law. Meanwhile, supporters thought Lamont planned to sign the bill and didn’t organize until later when it became clear the governor was wavering.
“We had every indication that the governor was on board with the bill as it passed the House and Senate,” said Erin Boggs, executive director of the Open Communities Alliance, which advocated for the bill. “So there was no reason to mount the campaign to ensure the Governor did not veto it, particularly because his staff was deeply involved in developing it.”
Blanchard asked staff answering the phones for daily counts of the numbers in favor or against the bill.
While the numbers fluctuated, the majority were in opposition, according to the reports. The majority were also from a few towns in Fairfield County — New Canaan, Greenwich, Fairfield, Darien and Westport were named specifically. 
“Many callers mention preserving the ‘culture’ of their town as a big reason they oppose the bill,” wrote one of the governor’s staff members in an email to Blanchard. “We have had some supporters, but not many likely less than 50 in total. It seems many of the callers are using information they are getting from the CT169 organization.”
Staff answering the phones also noted that most of those callers didn’t appear to have read the bill. “Many callers are relying upon mailers from special interest organizations as their sole source of information,” the June 23 email to Blanchard read.
Many of the opposition emails also appeared to be form messaging, using much of the same language. The Senate Republicans posted suggested language asking for a veto online, and 169Strong’s emails included a button that could send an email to Lamont’s office with just a couple of clicks.
“I most politely urge you to veto HB 5002, a sweeping bill that threatens local control, environmental protections, and public participation in land use decisions across Connecticut,” one common email began.
Many environmental advocates were in favor of H.B. 5002. On June 11, an official with the CT Roundtable on Climate and Jobs asked Blanchard whether Lamont would be interested in participating in a celebration and public signing of the environmental wins during the session, and listed 5002 as one of those.
That celebration didn’t occur as proposed.
Emails in favor, while fewer in number, differed more from one another.
“I understand that concerns have been raised, particularly from Fairfield County,” wrote Eliza Massaro, chair of the Avon Democratic Town Committee. “But as you know, Fairfield is just one of [the] … counties in Connecticut. While their voices matter, we cannot allow the perspective of a single region to dictate the direction of a statewide solution.”
Blanchard said Monday that the staff carefully reviewed all messages that came into the office about the bill. 
“While there were hundreds of calls or emails, some simply opposed the bill through generic form letters, while others may have been opposed but provided detailed thoughtful legislative feedback, in addition to those who were supportive,” he said.
Planning and Development Committee co-chair Rep. Eleni Kavros DeGraw, D-Avon, said in a Monday interview that she spoke with the governor ahead of the veto about what she viewed as the outsized influence of Fairfield County on the rest of the state.
“While I understand the importance of Fairfield County, that is not our only place that needs housing, and make no mistake, they need housing too,” Kavros DeGraw said. “So I think it was accurate to say that they [169Strong] were grossly misrepresenting what was in the bill … They were unfortunately legitimized by the veto.
“We often hear that a city or a town doesn’t want Hartford making decisions for them. Well, it sounds like we had a handful of towns making decisions for the entire state. That’s not fair or acceptable either,” she said.
When Lamont vetoed the bill on June 23, Blanchard gathered a list of news coverage and responses to the decision, including some from angry and disappointed lawmakers and housing advocates. Lamont forwarded the message to his wife.
“On plane to Nashville.. thanks for sharing this.. know it’s not going to be as fun.. but what third term is.. and world getting more angry and divided not less,” she responded.
Some advocates and lawmakers said the emails show Lamont thinks more people oppose the bill than actually do. Kavros DeGraw, who represents a district that has been represented by Democrats and Republicans and who has been a leader on housing policy for years, said many voters want to see better housing policy.
Last session, in a race largely centered on housing and zoning policy, one of the 169Strong co-founders, Alexis Harrison, lost a House race against incumbent Jennifer Leeper, D-Fairfield, by a landslide. That race, among others, has led pundits to question whether Connecticut voters are really as opposed to housing development as traditionally believed.
“I actually think we had greater consensus than ever before that there is an important housing crisis we need to deal with,” Boggs said. “And proposals in House Bill 5002 were a major step in the right direction. So while it’s true that disinformation can accentuate the divides that exist, I think they were actually hearing from a smaller group of folks who oppose this bill.”
Lawmakers said they were looking forward and continuing to negotiate with Lamont on an adjusted version of the bill.
“My hope is that we are still moving in a productive direction for the state of Connecticut on housing and ensuring that the people who want to live here are able to stay here in an affordable way, and that people who are looking to move here are also able to find a home here,” Kavros DeGraw said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Lamont-Veto-0623-DE-014-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-18 18:56:53.443786

(Sam Bailey/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — State leaders continued to stand firm against federal demands for personal data of Kansans who have received food assistance, even after a letter last week threatened funding losses. 
Kansas Department for Children and Families secretary Laura Howard laid out objections to turning over the data of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program applicants and users in a Monday news release. The data includes Social Security numbers, birthdates, addresses and more.
“The USDA’s data request is for the purpose of creating a federal database of SNAP participant information that may be disclosed to other entities, and it is unclear whether those entities are legally allowed to access that information,” the release said. 
Collecting the extensive dataset, which is more than has been required in the past from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, may cost as much as $100,000, the release said. In addition, the current secure way DCF transfers data to the federal government is not set up to handle that amount of information. 
Howard said state finances would be affected by the data collection process. 
“We also believe this request places a significant burden on DCF and state resources, and it’s not something that can be accommodated on a short deadline,” Howard said. “Providing this magnitude of data could take months and come with a hefty price tag.”
Gov. Laura Kelly joined a lawsuit with other states challenging whether the data should be turned over, and the press release said it would be appropriate to wait until the lawsuit was decided before sending any information. 
Previously, USDA secretary Brooke Rollins said her agency would hold off on requesting the data until the lawsuit was decided.  
Beginning in May, DCF refused the USDA’s requests for personal data of SNAP users. 
The USDA escalated its push for the information in the letter last week, demanding Kansas officials make “adequate progress towards meeting the data collection requirements,” setting an Aug. 15 deadline to submit a plan to do so.  
The letter also said refusing to comply would put SNAP administrative funding at issue. 
Kansas leaders stood firm, even as Republicans have lambasted Kelly and Howard for failing to share the information. 
Rep. Dan Hawkins, R-Wichita, challenged Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach last week at the Legislative Coordinating Council meeting to find whether Kelly has the right to withhold the data. He also repeated misinformation that the error rate in the SNAP program is 12%. The most recent error rate is 9.98%, according to the USDA. \
The error rate refers to the percentage of errors found in SNAP applications and is calculated annually. 
Kobach told Hawkins he has a team of attorneys investigating that question, and he added that providing information is a requirement for receiving the federal money. 
“We certainly know that the federal government has the ability at this stage, if the governor continues to refuse to provide the information, to deny the funds, and I understand that that’s a very substantial amount of money we’re talking about,” Kobach said. “She is putting at risk the receipt of Kansas of those monies, which I guess is sort of ironic, and probably why you asked the question, because that is a very substantial amount of money.”

Corey Paris threatened after ICE reposts call to file charges,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/18/ct-rep-corey-paris-threatened-after-ice-reposts-call-to-file-charges/,The @LibsofTikTok X account called for a CT legislator to be charged for 'helping illegals evade arrest.' The official ICE account reposted it.,"The timing and reach of a social media posts accusing a Connecticut state lawmaker of impeding federal immigration agents are drawing the FBI, state police and Capitol police to assess the threat posed by the resulting deluge of abuse.
It is the latest and highest-profile example of what House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford says is is an all-too-common drill: divining the differences between political speech, harassment and credible criminal threats.
“That line can be very small and thin at times,” said Ritter, who estimates that half of all lawmakers will need threat assessments in any given two-year term. “We have a protocol in place.”
The shootings of two Minnesota state lawmakers on June 14 had lawmakers on edge long before “@LibsofTikTok,” a right-wing poster with 4.3 million followers on X, urged federal charges against Rep. Corey Paris, D-Stamford.
Three days ago, it accused him of divulging, in an Instagram post, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents’ “live location and warning illegals to stay ‘vigilant.’ He’s helping illegals evade arrest and impeding ICE. Charge him.”

It was reposted a day later by the official ICE account, tagging the Justice Department account. That was enough for “@LibsofTikTok” to proclaim Sunday that ICE had referred Paris for prosecution.
Paris did not identify any locations where Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were gathered, instead sharing unverified reports that ICE agents were active in his House district.
“While we are still working to verify the full scope of these reports, I urge all residents to remain vigilant, stay aware of your surroundings, and, above all, prioritize your safety,” Paris wrote in his post.
The @LibsofTikTok critique was viewed 970,000 times, a number amplified by other reposts. The reaction over the weekend was furious and abusive, much of it racist, friends said.
Paris is Black.
“I think the dehumanization of public officials is horrifying — and coming out of what happened in Minnesota is particularly concerning,” said House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford.
Candelora returned Monday morning on a red-eye flight from Los Angeles, where he was attending a small bipartisan legislative conference. One of the attendees was a friend of Melissa Hortman, the Democratic legislative leader killed in Minnesota. Her husband also was killed, and a second lawmaker and his wife were shot and wounded in a separate attack the same night.
“Her life is changed forever. I’ve gone to several conferences with her,” Candelora said. “People forget that public officials are human beings.”
Whether anyone disagreed with Paris does not justify abuse and harassment, he said.
Candelora said even before the incident with Paris that state legislators in Connecticut were removing legislative plates from their motor vehicles because they feared being identified.
One anonymous caller to Paris’ cell phone said his life and family connections were known and being distributed widely, a chilling claim, said other lawmakers.
The call was recorded by Paris’s fiancée. They were together in his car when his phone range, and she answered. She used her phone to record it. A copy was provided to the Connecticut Mirror.
“You’re messing with someone that was a subcontractor for the NSA, you stupid [expletive] idiot,” the caller said. “This content is being replicated and duplicated all across Christian networks, all across Trump supporters, MAGA supporters and right wing newspapers.”
ICE did not respond to a request for comment.
Christine Bartlett-Josie, a political consultant and family friend of Paris, said the FBI has a copy of the recorded call and is investigating, as are the Capitol and state police.
“It is unfortunate and alarming to be wrongfully targeted by a federal agency and even called for arrest by the DOJ,” Paris said in a statement released by the legislature’s Black and Puerto Rican Caucus. “However, my commitment to compassion, courage, and community — and my refusal to be silenced when the safety of my neighbors is at stake — will never be shaken.”
Rep. Antonio Felipe, D-Bridgeport, said angry calls and emails come with the job, but what Paris is experiencing is of another scale — as is the role of a federal law enforcement agency in fueling the abuse.
“The federal government should be a place that you go to protect yourself when you’re facing these attacks, not a place that amplifies them and calls people against you,” he said.
Sen. Gary Winfield, D-New Haven, a Black and Puerto Rican Caucus member who is accustomed to online abuse as the co-chair of the Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over hot-button issues such as gun control, said it has become unwise to dismiss harassment as merely offensive words.
Winfield spent time with Paris, reviewing the threats.
“Some of these folks seem unhinged,” Winfield said. “It’s been a crazy day and a half.”
Like the anonymous caller, many made clear they know where to find Paris and people in his immediate circle. 
“There may not be a direct threat, but there is an implied threat,” Winfield said.
Candelora, the Republican leader, agreed.
“That is the danger of social media. It brings everyone into your living room,” he said. “You don’t know.”
Candelora said the accused shooter in Minnesota did not have any direct contact with his victim.
“It was random,” he said. “It was evil.”

(Photo by Gage Skidmore)Toward the end of a four-hour hearing in central Pennsylvania on Friday, the judge overseeing a challenge to the constitutionality of Alina Habba’s appointment as acting U.S. attorney made a comment that will cause New Jersey Democrats’ hearts to sink.
“I think it’s very likely that Ms. Habba is going to end up, at some point down the road, as the United States attorney for the District of New Jersey,” Judge Matthew Brann said.
I don’t think Brann was signaling how he plans to rule on this matter later this week, because he noted that he has no “crystal ball.” I think what he may have intended to communicate to both sides in the matter is how this saga will likely end if it lands in the U.S. Supreme Court’s lap.
Let’s back up a bit for the uninitiated.
President Donald Trump named Alina Habba, a personal attorney who represented Trump in a civil defamation case, as New Jersey’s chief federal prosecutor back in March. That’s a role that requires confirmation from the U.S. Senate, but Trump didn’t nominate her until the tail end of her 120-day term as acting U.S. attorney. When her term was drawing to a close and there was no movement on her nomination — our two U.S. senators, both Democrats, object to Habba, and her confirmation is unlikely without their approval — New Jersey’s district judges were tasked with naming a more permanent replacement. They chose Habba’s second in command, Desiree Grace.
The Trump administration then fired Grace, Habba resigned as U.S. attorney, and the administration gave Habba the No. 2 job in the office. Because the U.S. attorney spot was now vacant, Habba automatically assumed the role of acting U.S. attorney again, this time for 210 more days, the Trump administration says. Two men facing federal criminal charges then challenged Habba’s appointment as unconstitutional, leading to Friday’s hearing in Pennsylvania (the matter was handed to Brann because New Jersey’s district judges had conflicts).
I went into Friday’s hearing with a significant bias against Habba. I’ve written before about my distaste for her swooning over an alleged sex trafficker in January. I think her stated goal to help New Jersey Republicans get elected is disqualifying. And the zeal with which she tossed Newark Mayor Ras Baraka (D) behind bars — on a charge so flimsy she had to retreat just days later — was obscene.
Nothing about the hearing changed my mind on whether Habba is fit to serve as U.S. attorney. But the arguments persuaded me the law is murky enough that the fight to prevent her from staying in office will fail.
There’s no smoking gun here, despite the valiant efforts on both sides to argue their case to Brann. Yes, the Trump administration’s maneuvering was an obvious end run around the U.S. Senate confirmation process — but the administration’s reliance on the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, which allows first assistants in various government agencies to be the default acting No. 1, is convincing. And the challengers’ response is less so. They argue that the statute is automatic, triggered by a vacancy — meaning the U.S. attorney spot was vacant when Habba resigned, and so she can’t resume that position by later taking the No. 2 spot.
“What happened here was the president or the executive, they terminated the first assistant in order to backfill the role, and Ms. Habba then created the resignation — well, she resigned, created the vacancy to fill it herself. It’s circular. I mean, it doesn’t make any sense. And it goes completely against what the statute is meant to protect,” said attorney Thomas Mirigliano, who is representing a man seeking to nullify Habba’s appointment.
Henry C. Whitaker, representing the Trump administration, countered that the vacancy in the U.S. attorney post existed not just at the moment Habba resigned — it also existed when she subsequently accepted the No. 2 post that allows her to become acting U.S. attorney for a new, 210-day term.
“The vacancy is a continuing condition,” Whitaker said.
Like I said, Brann gave no hint how he might rule on this — though he wisely conceded that he will not be the final word and said Habba and the New Jersey judges who tried to replace her may have to find a way to coexist. The judges, Brann noted, are appointed for life and are not likely to resign.
“They’re going to have to find a way to maneuver things together after this immediate issue, which is quite interesting, is resolved,” Brann said.
Brann is smart enough to realize that this matter may only be resolved by the nation’s highest court. The Roberts court has embraced the power of the executive, most recently in its June 27 decision limiting the power of federal judges to institute universal injunctions. Do we think the same justices, faced with a controversy over who gets to pick the U.S. attorney of New Jersey, will side with our state’s federal judges over Donald Trump?
If the Trump administration wins here, it may be a short-lived victory. Its own arguments on Habba hinge on her current appointment lasting for 210 days. That means her term has an expiration date of mid-February 2026, giving the administration plenty of time to find someone who has the qualifications to win confirmation from the U.S. Senate. Or enough time to think of a new legal strategy to keep her in the post no matter what.

(Photo courtesy of Iowa Department of Corrections)A state corrections officer fired for misconduct has been awarded jobless benefits, with a judge finding the state’s own evidence failed to back up its claims of wrongdoing.
Samantha Holub worked for the Iowa Department of Corrections at the Anamosa State Penitentiary from November 2023 through February 2025, when she was placed on administrative leave. She was fired on April 2, 2025 for allegedly violating rules related to employee conduct.
According to the DOC, a review of security-camera footage indicated that in early February, Holub took a Ziploc bag out of her pocket, removed a pill, and then gave the pill to an inmate. The DOC allegedly discovered another incident that occurred at around the same time that involved Holub giving a handwritten note to an inmate while they were in the infirmary.

The department also alleged Holub had been using the workplace Google Chat software to communicate with co-workers at non-work email addresses — a potential security violation.
According to state records, DOC investigator Michael Griffith interviewed Holub, who allegedly explained the incident with the pill by stating that nurses withheld ibuprofen from inmates who visited the infirmary since it was hoped the inmates would instead purchase the drug through the commissary.
Holub allegedly explained that it can take days for the commissary-ordered medications to arrive after they’re ordered, leaving the individuals in pain – and so, after seeing a nurse refuse one inmate’s request for ibuprofen, she gave the inmate the drug.
As for the note passing, Holub explained she had talked to an inmate who was interested in applying for a part-time job in the infirmary and had written down for the inmate the names and job titles of administrators who handled such applications.
Holub admitted using Google Chat to communicate with others through non-work email addresses, but indicated she was unaware that was not allowed.
Recently, Administrative Law Judge Elizabeth Johnson presided over a hearing on Holub’s request for unemployment benefits, which the DOC had challenged.
At the hearing, the DOC chose not to offer any witness statements, any video evidence, or any records to support its decision to discharge Holub, Johnson noted. “The employer’s own testimony also failed to support its stated reasons for discharging (Holub),” Johnson said in her ruling, adding that Holub’s explanations for her conduct were credible.
Johnson also pointed out that while the DOC claimed Holub’s use of Google Chat had violated security protocol, that claim was “undermined by a supervisor” who had initiated one of the conversations the department was citing as evidence of wrongdoing.
“Out of the alleged 324 pages of messages in the employer’s possession, it did not submit a single message as evidence for the hearing,” Johnson stated in her ruling. “The evidence in the record does not establish the employer discharged (Holub) for disqualifying, job-related misconduct. It may have complied with its internal policies in ending her employment, and this decision does not question the soundness of the employer’s business decision.”

(Courtesy photo)Citing violations of state law and other concerns, New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez on Monday filed a petition with the New Mexico Supreme Court to consider removal of Eleventh Judicial District Attorney Bernadine Martin in McKinley County.
The move, according to a New Mexico Department of Justice news release, follows a request from Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and a “detailed investigation” by the agency.
The petition’s findings include: a hostile workplace environment; failure to prepare or subpoena witnesses in McKinley County; violations of procurement law, despite a prior settlement with the State Ethics Commission; “improper reliance” on contract attorneys; and Martin’s alleged continued work in private legal practice while serving as district attorney, in violation of state law.
A voicemail and email to Martin was not returned prior to publication.
Martin was elected to her second four-year term in November of 2024. According to the petition, at least 48 employees in the Eleventh Judicial District Attorney’s office either resigned or have been terminated during Martin’s tenure. The investigation on workplace issues was based on 14 interviews, including with Martin, the petition says.
“Nearly every person interviewed during NMDOJ’s investigation reported [Martin’s] office to be a hostile work environment,” the petition says, with two “seasoned investigator” saying they resigned due to her “yelling, screaming, and belittling behavior.” The petition notes that Martin said “she never raised her voice or yelled at any of her employees.”
The petition also alleges Martin “consistently fails to properly prepare or subpoena witnesses for court proceedings in a timely
fashion,” and cited Gallup Police Chief Erin Toadlena-Pablo who said Martin didn’t meet with officers prior to court, unlike her predecessors. McKinley County Sheriff James Maiorano confirmed to investigators “that subpoenas were being faxed to the sheriff’s office the same day cases were scheduled for hearings. When officers didn’t appear, [Martin] blamed the sheriff’s office for dismissing the cases.”
According to the petition, Martin’s office does not have any assistant district attorneys, but instead relies on contract lawyers for felony prosecution and DWIs. Moreover, the petition claims those lawyers are being used in ways that also may violate state law, including for conflicts of interest as one of the contract lawyers maintains a private practice that has both civil and criminal cases.
Martin herself retains a private practice, the petition says, a violation of state law.
“This is an extraordinary step, but it is necessary to protect the integrity of the justice system,” Torrez said in a statement. “The people of McKinley County deserve a district attorney who can fulfill the responsibilities of the office. It is now up to the Supreme Court to review the evidence and determine whether Ms. Martin should remain in that role.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/bmartin-1024x1024.png,,,2025-08-18 18:56:53.443786

 A VTDigger investigation found that UPS workers in Vermont had their paid time off taken without their consent. The issue has drawn attention from an international union and potential action from the attorney general. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont workers allege UPS violated family leave law.","Workers at two United Parcel Service package centers in Vermont are accusing their employer of violating state family and medical leave laws by using their paid time off without their knowledge or consent.
UPS workers at package centers in Brattleboro and Wilder shared documents with VTDigger showing that their previously approved unpaid family and medical leave had been switched with their paid time off. In making the switch, the UPS locations effectively reduced the amount of paid days workers can take off.
The federal Family and Medical Leave Act, passed in 1993, entitles workers up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave in a one-year period for certain family or medical needs. Vermont law has continually expanded those rights since the 1990s, including giving workers up to four hours of unpaid short-term leave every 30 days for purposes such as taking children to medical appointments or school activities and taking family members to appointments related to their well-being.Vermont law also states that employees can use accrued paid leave, including vacation and personal leave, in lieu of unpaid family and medical leave “at the employee’s discretion.” However, the UPS workers claim management used their paid leave without their permission.This accusation has prompted action from the International Brotherhood of Teamsters — a labor union that represents 1.3 million workers globally — and a potential incoming response by the Vermont attorney general’s office.
A UPS spokesperson told VTDigger in a statement on Friday that the company is “aware of the issue,” and is taking “necessary steps to quickly correct the situation and ensure this is not an issue in the future.”
Issues for package center workers in Wilder began in February, after Driver Supervisor Nick Webster allegedly expressed his frustration over drivers using FMLA during a snowstorm in a way he thought was improper, according to a June 9 complaint filed with the Vermont attorney general’s office.
Webster said that after a meeting with the UPS’s labor department, it was decided that anyone attempting to use FMLA would have that unpaid leave swapped with their paid time off, the complaint alleges. It also says  that a union steward told Webster this would be illegal, but that Webster did not seem to care. 
Webster declined comment for this story, and two UPS labor managers covering the Vermont area did not reply to requests for comment.

Two workers at the Wilder package center who spoke to VTDigger described being confused about how the situation around the FMLA unfolded. Despite the issue being discussed in February, the workers said, it took until late May for them to see their previously approved family and medical leave swapped with paid time off. One worker at the Brattleboro package center also said that the issue began for them in May.
One of the Wilder package center workers, David Kendall, a driver, said that by changing his leave from FMLA to personal and sick days, management left him with fewer days available to spend with his teenage nephew, Jerimiah. Kendall has had full custody of Jerimiah since 2014.Kendall, who has been with UPS for almost a decade, said he enjoys his route that regularly weaves through the backroads of Springfield and Eastman, a journey so rural that when he’s driving he often doesn’t have cellphone service. 
“When I’m out on the road, I’m essentially my own boss. I enjoy the freedom of not having somebody looking over my shoulder every five minutes, like if I was in an office setting,” Kendall told VTDigger. “I enjoy when I’m delivering a parcel to someone and they’re like, ‘Oh my gosh, we were hoping for you to be here on time for so-and-so’s birthday or an important event,’ and they’re like, ‘We weren’t expecting you so soon!’ and have a huge smile on their face.”Kendall said, in interviews with VTDigger, that he first noticed the issue after a previously approved FMLA full-day leave on May 27 was switched to an option day. This is a form of paid time off earned by UPS workers. This switch was made by Webster without Kendall’s knowledge or consent, he said. Since May, Kendall said, he has had six days of paid time off taken without his permission: four of his five sick days and two of his three option days.

“Now I have no sick days. So if I’m sick, I still have to go to work,” he said. “And, they took the option days I would use to spend more time with my nephew … to attend school events that he wanted me to attend, and stuff like that, ’cause he plays basketball for the youth basketball team.”
Kendall said that until May, he had been allowed to use family and medical leave to take Jerimiah to medical appointments. Jerimiah has developmental and cognitive challenges, as well as mental health issues, Kendall said.
“Whenever we took FMLA, it wasn’t an issue,” he said. “I would go into work and I’d work like four, five, six hours, and then I would take the rest of the day off to get him to his appointments.”
Payroll and insurance documents obtained and reviewed by VTDigger show that six of Kendall’s previously approved family and medical leave days were switched with sick and option days by various members of UPS package center management. 
Kendall is not the only worker alleging that their unpaid family and medical leave was switched without their consent. 
Justin Doubleday, an employee at the UPS package center in Brattleboro, said that in one instance this issue led to a workplace confrontation. He  said he took his 10-year-old son to a medical visit using previously approved short-term family leave. When he attempted to return to work at the Brattleboro package center, he said, he found his truck wasn’t loaded. He said he discovered that management had put him in for a sick day.
“I put in for four hours of short term FMLA … instead they put me in for a sick day. They put in the system that I called out sick, even though I gave them a week in advance a short-term family medical leave form and let them know that I would be into work after. … Everybody there, other management included, were like ‘This is fucked up. This isn’t right. You put in for FMLA.’”
Doubleday said he confronted the supervisor who had put in the sick day without Doubleday’s consent. After an argument and pressure from other members of management, the supervisor reversed the decision, Doubleday said. The supervisor gave Doubleday back his sick day and paid him for the 33 minutes he had spent arguing in the facility that day before going home.“This is the shit that they do and that we put up with. Isn’t that ridiculous?” Doubleday said. 
Documents obtained by VTDigger show that one of Doubleday’s previously approved short-term family and medical leave was replaced with an option day. 
UPS did not respond to a request for comment Monday on the specific allegations made by the workers. 
Union action
After learning his paid time off had been used, Kendall said, he alerted the union — Teamsters Local 597, a chapter of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. Kendall filed multiple grievances with the union, and union officials communicated the FMLA issue directly with UPS management, according to the June 9 complaint filed with the Vermont attorney general. 
On June 26, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters sent a letter to UPS’s counsel, demanding they “immediately cease and desist from requiring our members in Vermont use their accrued paid leave during FMLA-qualifying leave,” further stating that they were prepared to take legal action if they did not hear from UPS by July 4.
“They’re not just violating the law, they’re violating the collective bargaining agreement. So it’s not just a law enforcement issue, it’s also an issue for the international union,” said Curtis Clough, president of Local 597.The union’s contract with UPS states that the company, “may require the employee to substitute accrued paid vacation or other paid leave,” when a worker is taking FMLA, but that workers are permitted two weeks of paid vacation that cannot be substituted for FMLA. 
However, the contract goes on to say that these provisions, “shall not supersede any state or local law, which provides for greater employee rights,” meaning Vermont’s family leave law supersedes the contract.Clough, who worked his way up from a seasonal helper at UPS to a full-time driver before leaving to take a position at the union, said the paid time theft is an escalation in what has become a fractious relationship between management and workers. The union does not know why UPS has stood so firmly behind what he sees is a clear violation of the law, he said.
“UPS is pretty antagonistic. … UPS routinely harasses drivers, so it’s hard to pick out a reason why,” he said. “There is no longer a culture where the driver supervisors come up through the ranks.”
According to communications obtained by VTDigger, at least one of the attorney general’s senior investigators has reviewed the alleged violations at the package centers. A representative from the attorney general’s office told VTDigger that the office could not comment on what cases they are investigating.

Luna-Perez is accused of killing a woman and her daughter in a drunken driving crash in Lakewood. (Tim Hawk for New Jersey Monitor)TOMS RIVER — The undocumented immigrant accused of driving drunk and killing two people in Lakewood last month, landing himself at the center of a political firestorm because of his immigration status, will remain jailed pending trial.
Raul Luna-Perez, a 43-year-old resident of Red Bank, consented during a brief hearing in front of Superior Court Judge Guy P. Ryan on Monday to remain detained. Luna-Perez is facing multiple counts of aggravated manslaughter, assault by auto, and vehicular homicide.
Attorneys revealed no new details about the case during Monday’s 10-minute hearing.
Luna-Perez was charged July 27 in connection with a crash the day prior that killed Maria Pleitez and her 11-year-old daughter. Police say Luna-Perez was behind the wheel with a blood alcohol content over three times the state’s legal limit when he crossed into oncoming traffic and hit Pleitez’s car head on. 
In an earlier hearing, a different judge ordered him released pending trial on home confinement with an ankle monitor despite arguments from the county prosecutor to keep Luna-Perez detained. Luna-Perez has two prior arrests from earlier this year on drunken driving charges, and was the subject of a 2023 domestic violence complaint that was later withdrawn, according to court documents and court officials.
After his initial release from jail, immigration agents took him into custody and jailed him at an Elizabeth detention center. Ocean County prosecutors then added additional charges, retrieved him from Elizabeth, returned him to the county jail, and asked the court a second time to detain him pending trial.

The White House has highlighted Luna-Perez’s case to criticize New Jersey’s Immigrant Trust Directive, which restricts when local law enforcement can cooperate with federal immigration agents, and it has placed the blame for the fatal crash on Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat who supports the directive.
Murphy in response has said Luna-Perez “shouldn’t have been on the road, and frankly, he shouldn’t have been in the country.”  
The state Attorney General’s Office has said the directive did not bar local police from cooperating with federal immigration officials to deport Luna-Perez. The directive allows for cooperation regarding undocumented immigrants facing some serious and violent charges, including assault.

Free.,"Trump, Zelenskyy exit White House talks hopeful about security guarantee for Ukraine",Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-zelenskyy-exit-white-house-talks-hopeful-about-security-guarantee-ukraine,,"President Donald Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European allies at the White House Monday celebrated Russian President Vladimir Putin’s concession of NATO-like security protections for Ukraine as part of a future peace deal between the two countries.Zelenskyy and officials from Western Europe called Putin’s acceptance of security guarantees for Ukraine protecting the nation against another attack a major step toward ending the three-year-old war.Dating to before the war, one point of tension between Ukraine and Russia has been Ukraine’s increasingly warm relationship with the West, with potential membership in NATO a major issue for Putin.But Trump said Putin accepted something like it during the pair’s meeting in Alaska last week.“The Alaska summit reinforced my belief that, while difficult, peace is within reach,” Trump said before a group meeting in the White House’s East Room. “In a very significant step, President Putin agreed that Russia would accept security guarantees for Ukraine.”Trump and Zelenskyy met one-on-one in the Oval Office before a handful of European leaders joined them for a multilateral meeting in the East Room.During introductions for the multilateral meeting, Zelenskyy said it had been his best meeting with Trump to date, and he was “very happy” with Trump about the possibility of winning security guarantees.“We spoke about it, and we will speak more about security guarantees,” he said. “This is very important that (the) United States gives such (a) strong signal and is ready for security guarantees.”The other attendees Monday were NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Finnish President Alexander Stubb.‘Article 5-like’Several European allies highlighted the issue of security guarantees for Ukraine, which they compared to the NATO charter’s Article 5 that compels every member state to defend any other member that has been attacked.“It's very good to hear that we're working on the security guarantees,” von der Leyen said. “Article 5-like security guarantees: so important.”The next step in the peace process would be to set up direct talks between Putin and Zelenskyy, possibly also to include Trump.Trump said he had spoken to Putin “indirectly” on Monday and that he planned to phone the Russian president following the meeting with European leaders.Ceasefire needed?Before meeting with Putin, Trump had supported a ceasefire as a path toward a permanent end to the war, though he came out of the Alaska summit closer to Putin’s position that a ceasefire was not necessary before a final peace agreement.Monday, he said he would like a ceasefire to immediately end violence, but that it was not strictly necessary from a diplomatic point of view. The United States had helped negotiate the ends of other conflicts without a temporary ceasefire in place, he said.“All of us would obviously prefer an immediate ceasefire while we work on a lasting peace,” he said. “I don't know that it's necessary.”Germany’s Merz pushed back, saying a ceasefire should be a precondition for a Putin-Zelenskyy meeting.“I can't imagine that the next meeting would take place without a ceasefire,” Merz said. “So let's work on that, and let's try to put pressure on Russia, because the credibility of these efforts we are undertaking today are depending on at least a ceasefire from the beginning of the serious negotiations.”Smoother meeting with Zelenskyy in suitAt the open-press portion of Trump’s meeting with Zelenskyy, the two appeared on friendlier terms than they had during the Ukrainian leader’s last Oval Office visit in February, when Trump and Vice President JD Vance complained Zelenskyy was not appreciative enough of U.S. aid.As the February meeting turned heated, Trump told Zelenskyy he had “no cards” to fight Russia on his own or make demands of the United States.But Monday, Trump resisted an option to return to that argument, brushing off a reporter’s question about which country had “better cards.”And Zelesnkyy also wore an all-black suit Monday after a writer at a pro-Trump media outlet questioned him at the February meeting about wearing military-style attire.“You look fabulous in that suit,” the same writer said Monday.“I said the same thing,” Trump echoed.",,,,2025-08-18 18:56:53.443786

U.S. Agriculture officials announced a new initiative Monday to stop subsidies for solar energy panels that take up farmland while supporting cuts in agriculture grants to Tennessee universities.
Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins introduced the initiative by the Trump administration after a Future Farmers of America breakfast at the State Fairgrounds in Lebanon where she said the federal government will make new grants to bolster Tennessee farming while targeting grants that don’t help farmers’ production.
Rollins criticized the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act and “market distorting incentives” for solar panels, which she said are eliminating Tennessee farmland.
The secretary made the statements even though a study by the nonpartisan Tennessee Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations found that solar facilities aren’t likely to be the “primary driver” of development on farmland for decades. The study also determined that land can be returned to farming once a solar facility goes out of use.

Earlier this year, the federal government made dramatic cuts to higher education grants, including eliminating more than $31 million in funding to the University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture, which houses agricultural research and resources for Tennessee farmers and communities in 95 counties.
Rollins defended the reductions, saying “Those cuts were being made in programs that did not align with the president’s vision of putting farmers first.”
Deputy Secretary Stephen Vaden of Tennessee described the reduction as a “repurposing” and said changes were made in research funding based on whether a grant “helps a farmer in the field make more money.” Projects aimed at “clean energy” or based on “racial criteria” were eliminated, he said.
In addition to stopping solar panel development on farmland, Rollins announced that nearly $89 million will go toward 13 rural development projects in 28 Tennessee counties to “promote partnerships” and infrastructure investments for rural education. The department has distributed nearly $100 million this year to more than 10,000 farmers through the Emergency Commodity Assistance Program, according to Rollins.
Some farmers have said they expect prices to increase because of President Donald Trump’s tariffs, which are forcing them to pass on higher rates to customers. Rollins said Monday the administration has signed eight new trade agreements expected to boost the nation’s economy.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Last week marked the first time since mid-June that statewide precipitation levels were below normal, while temperatures were 2-4 degrees above normal for the period, according to State Climatologist Justin Glisan.
Despite the diminished precipitation levels, soil moisture remains high. Crops rated highly during the Aug. 11-17 reporting period, though developments for corn and soybean acres are slightly behind the five-year average, according to the crop progress and condition report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
Twenty-seven percent of corn has reached the dent stage, one day behind the average. Nearly 80% of Iowa corn is in the dough stage, making the crop three days behind the average. The crop continues to rate well, however with 30% of corn acres rated excellent for the reporting period. 


Crop phenological stages:
— Corn in dough stage: a thick or dough-like substance is present in all kernels.
— Corn in dent stage: all the kernels have dented, ear is firm and no milk is present in the kernels.
— Soybeans setting pods: pods are developing on lower portions of the plant, with some blooming still on top of plant.

All but 4% of soybean acres have started blooming across the state and 83% of soybean acres are setting pods, which is four days behind normal. Soybeans also rated well, with 60% of the crop good and 22% excellent. 
Agronomists and plant pathologists have noted this crop season has good conditions for sudden death syndrome, a fungal disease that can impact soybean yields. Cases of SDS have cropped up in most of the state but the total acreage impacted has not been calculated. 
Oat harvest is 91% complete across the state, and 65% of alfalfa hay acres have had a third cutting. 
Soil moisture conditions improved slightly from the previous reporting period, with a small decrease in the percent of surplus soil moisture. Overall, 72% of topsoil moisture conditions and 73% of subsoil moisture conditions were adequate. 
North central parts of the state continue to have the wettest soils, with 55% of topsoil rated surplus.
Glisan noted in the report that portions of eastern Iowa had above-average precipitation during the reporting period, but as a whole, the state average was eight-tenths of an inch, a little more than one-tenth below the normal. 
Some areas of the state recorded temperatures as high as 16 degrees above normal, though the average temperature for the period, at 74.8 degrees Fahrenheit, was just 2.8 degrees above the normal. 
Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said the “warm and muggy conditions didn’t deter visitors from enjoying another successful Iowa State Fair.” 
Naig, in a statement, also noted that Iowa had no drought conditions, per the U.S. Drought Monitor map, for the first time in more than a year. 
For farmers in southwest Iowa, where drought has been most persistent, the rain has been a welcome reprieve. Dale Maassen, who farms near Avoca, said he has had more rain since June than he got all of last year. 
“Right now, I can’t complain,” Maassen said. “It’s the best I’ve seen in quite a while.”

Standing near him is Gov. Larry Rhoden. (John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)National Guard troops on both sides of South Dakota are now processing paperwork for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden announced Monday that three guard members in Sioux Falls and three in Rapid City have begun to document and process ICE arrest information, which Rhoden said will let immigration agents stay in the field in search of migrants eligible for deportation. 
The National Guard also assigned a liaison to serve as the communication point between ICE and the six people working on immigration paperwork.
The news is part of a flurry of immigration enforcement activity in South Dakota since the inauguration of President Donald Trump. Rhoden ascended to the state’s chief executive post following the departure of his predecessor, Kristi Noem, to serve as secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the federal agency under which ICE operates.
‘Operation Prairie Thunder’ will assist with deportations and boost Sioux Falls law enforcement

The National Guard’s ICE assistance is part of a broader, branded effort from Rhoden dubbed “Operation Prairie Thunder.” 
Last week, Rhoden’s administration announced that the Board of Pardons and Paroles had granted early release to 10 men from various countries who lacked legal status and were in line for federal deportation proceedings upon their release from state custody.
South Dakota Democrats have bristled at the enforcement push, and have said Rhoden’s immigration efforts are “politicized.”
Correctional actions
On Monday, as part of his press release on the National Guard, Rhoden said the DOC had finalized its cooperation agreement with ICE, known as a 287(g) agreement. According to the agreement and ICE’s 287(g) website, the agreement was finalized on July 27.
Rhoden’s office did not immediately respond to a question on why the announcement came three weeks after the agreement was finalized.
Such agreements allow local agencies to work with ICE through one of three cooperation models. The DOC’s agreement was signed under the Jail Enforcement Model, which trains state-level officers to identify people without documentation of legal status and turn them over to ICE for removal.
The 10 inmates paroled last week were not identified by state correctional officers trained to work with ICE. They already had “ICE holds,” which is a term used in corrections to note which inmates are expected to move into ICE custody upon their release from state or local custody.
The DOC has yet to identify how many employees will be trained to work with ICE on investigating the status of inmates not already identified as in line for deportation, DOC spokesman Michael Winder said in an email on Monday. 
South Dakota Attorney General clarifies scope of immigration enforcement agreement

Rhoden previously signed a letter of intent to signal the prison system’s plans to commit to an ICE agreement earlier this summer, while announcing Operation Prairie Thunder. 
He also said at the time that ICE-trained state troopers would carry out limited immigration actions through the Highway Patrol’s 287(g) agreement. The agency finalized its Task Force Model agreement on May 22, according to the ICE website. That model essentially deputizes local law enforcement to work with ICE.
Broader efforts
In his press release, Rhoden characterized the latest developments with the DOC and the National Guard as efforts to “to keep South Dakota strong, safe, and free.”
There are now five state agencies with active 287(g) agreements. 
The state Division of Criminal Investigation is using the Task Force Model. Attorney General Marty Jackley, who leads that agency, has said his detectives will target undocumented people who’ve committed acts of violence.
Two local jails have agreements under the 287(g) Warrant Service Model. Under those agreements, staff at the Hughes and Minnehaha county jails can serve ICE warrants on people in custody, which saves ICE agents from appearing personally at the jail to do so.
All five of the agreements in South Dakota were finalized this year, after Trump signed an executive order to encourage more state and local agencies to sign 287(g) agreements.

Article Summary

A billboard promoting the Proud Boys, a right-wing extremist group, has been put up near a high school in Clinton County in southern Illinois.
The group, which has been labeled a hate group, has ties to the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol in Washington, D.C.
Local leaders expressed outrage but said the billboard is protected by the First Amendment.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

Editor’s note: This story has been updated to include a comment from Gov. JB Pritzker’s office.
BREESE, Ill. — A billboard rising from a Clinton County cornfield near Breese that appears to be a recruiting tool for the Proud Boys — a far-right extremist group tied to the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol — has touched off outrage in the small southern Illinois community.
The sign is located at Old U.S. Route 50 and St. Rose Road, about 1,000 feet from the entrance to Central Community High School. It lists a local phone number for people to call. Repeated calls to a phone number on the recruiting billboard went to a voicemail that is full.
Federal prosecutors secured seditious-conspiracy convictions against top Proud Boys leaders for their roles in the Capitol breach, including former chairman Enrique Tarrio, who received a 22-year sentence; he was pardoned by President Donald Trump along with others involved in the insurrection when he returned to office for a second term in January.
Originally the billboard was sitting atop another sign for Hospital Sisters Health Systems of Springfield, which has hospitals in southern Illinois, including Breese. At 4 p.m., a worker for Lamar Advertising was moving the Proud Boys billboard to the other side. A spokesperson for HSHS acknowledged that the billboard was placed above its existing hospital advertisement.
“An external company sells these billboards individually and we appreciate that the public and our patients understand there is no connection between HSHS and any message or organization represented on a billboard above ours,” the company said in a statement.
The Southern Poverty Law Center lists the Proud Boys as a hate group, and the Anti-Defamation League describes them as extremist; Canada designated the Proud Boys a terrorist entity in 2021. The United States does not maintain a domestic “terrorist list,” but FBI memos have described the group as an “extremist group with ties to white nationalism,” according to media reports.
After the Proud Boys were found guilty of vandalizing an African Methodist Episcopal Church in Washington, D.C., during a December 2020 pro-Trump rally, the church sued the group and Tarrio for hate crimes, vandalism, and conspiracy. A Superior Court judge in Washington granted the church a $2.8 million judgment and the rights to the group’s trademark. But the far-right group has continued to use the name anyway, according to news reports.
Clinton County Board Chair Brad Knolhoff told Capitol News Illinois he’d received calls and emails and had asked the county state’s attorney to review what, if anything, the county can do.
“I have forwarded to our state’s attorney just so he can look at it,” he said. The county, he explained, typically regulates “the size and the location” of a billboard, “but the language, we don’t … and I would estimate, the reason that that’s never been the case is just because we’re not really the arbiters of speech. The U.S. Constitution is pretty clear on freedom of speech. I think a billboard really falls in that lane no matter what it says.”
Knolhoff said some residents were expected to raise the issue at Monday night’s county board meeting, though the agenda was already finalized last week. “It’s not an action item that we have,” he said. Still, he encourages anyone to speak during the public comment period.
Breese resident Drew Kampwerth, who lives about a mile and a half from the billboard, said she first saw it at the end of last week. “It is sickening that they are putting it in front of a high school,” said Kampwerth, 30, who has four young children.
She said she’s concerned that the billboard “is putting out feelers” to impressionable teenagers in a predominantly white community. “They are letting people know there is a safe space for hate and I think that’s wrong,” she said. “This shouldn’t be made normal in our community,”
Breese Mayor Kevin Timmermann repeated multiple times that the billboard is on county land, though his city is the closest to it. He said the city’s legal counsel has cautioned him to “watch what we are saying about it.”
“For me personally, I am very opposed to this. I am totally opposed to it,” Timmerman said. “I am concerned about it, yes. But right now I have no authority over that sign.”
Gov. JB Pritzker’s office denounced the placement of the billboard, saying it has no place in Illinois.
“A few wasted advertising dollars will not change the fact that there are millions of Americans who, regardless of political affiliation, know them as an extreme fringe organization that does not reflect who the people of Illinois are,” governor’s spokesperson Alex Gough said in a statement.
Bill Freivogel, a journalism professor with a media-law background at Southern Illinois University, said the law gives governments little room to police billboard content, meaning the county “can’t force the Proud boys to take down their billboard,” he said. That doesn’t mean they can’t protest the content, he said, adding, “they could buy a competing billboard.”
The U.S. Supreme Court has long set limits on when offensive or incendiary speech can be restricted. In Brandenburg v. Ohio in 1969, the Court ruled that speech is protected unless it is intended and likely to incite imminent lawless action. In that case, Ku Klux Klan leader Clarence Brandenburg invited television cameras to a rally where Klansmen burned a cross, carried weapons and delivered racist, anti-Semitic speeches. That precedent has been tested repeatedly since.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Union workers at the Department of Children, Youth and Families’ (DCYF) central office in Providence have recently implored the state to not renew the agency’s lease of the building, citing health and safety concerns about the working conditions there.
Now, a few unwelcome visitors at the Friendship Street offices have temporarily forced the agency out of the building: A bat was found on the premises Sunday evening, according to an email DCYF Director Ashley Deckert sent to agency staff on Monday morning.
“We are taking this situation seriously and, out of an abundance of caution, will be moving to a fully remote work arrangement until further notice,” Deckert wrote in her message, which was obtained by Rhode Island Current. 
The email, sent at 8:32 a.m., noted that the building would close at 10 a.m. Deckert advised staff to grab any “essential items” for remote work before that time.
Shortly after noon Monday, DCYF spokesperson Barb Francella confirmed via email that the building was closed as of 10 a.m. Francella also confirmed that Sunday’s bat sighting follows another bat sighting on Thursday, Aug. 14. Pest control removed that bat the same day, and Francella said pest control is now working to remove the second bat.  
“Our pest control provider was called in to remove the bat this morning, inspect the building and determine the point of entry,” Francella wrote. “We are working closely with the landlord, property manager and pest control provider to address the issue and comply with all necessary standards.”
But the exodus from the Friendship Street office is not a total surprise to the DCYF workers unionized with SEIU Local 580, which comprises about 300 of the 460 workers in the building. Matthew Gunnip, the union’s president, shared a number of emails with Rhode Island Current which traced a clearer timeline for the bat saga.
Union members were notified in an email blast the morning of Aug. 14, with a short message that read, “There is an animal bat on the second floor. It has not been located.”
A few hours later, DCYF Chief of Staff Misty Delgado wrote in an internal email to all staff that a “small bat” had been removed from the building’s second floor, and that staff in the area had been temporarily relocated. Pest control was on the scene within 30 minutes, Delgado wrote, and the bat was “safely removed” from the building and sent off to the state health department, where it would be tested for rabies. 
A copy of the rabies test results was not available from DCYF as of Monday afternoon.
Gunnip’s emails culminated in a Sunday evening request to DCYF leadership that the Providence office be shuttered Monday.
“What assurances does DCYF have that there are no additional bats in the building, and what corrective actions have been taken to ensure that the intervention on Thursday actually remedied the issue? How are workers to trust that this time there truly are no more bats in the building?” Gunnip wrote in the email, which was addressed to DCYF leadership as well as state health and administrative officials.  
Richard Charest — who leads the Rhode Island Executive Office of Health and Human Services, which oversees a large roster of state agencies including DCYF — wrote to Gunnip Monday morning that he had spoken with Deckert and that employees would be allowed to work from home as the building is evaluated further.
Bats signal deeper problems, union claims
In his Sunday email, Gunnip cited several health concerns regarding the bats, from the risk of rabies to the potential spread of histoplasmosis, a respiratory illness that can be acquired from bat excrement, also known as guano. That is especially a concern, Gunnip wrote, as the Friendship Street office building uses recirculated air in its HVAC system — one of the factors identified as a culprit in what workers call the building’s poor air quality, and a major reason why the workforce wants to discontinue the current lease, which expires at the end of November. 
The State Properties Committee needed to approve the lease extension by the end of July, and was set to weigh in upon the proposed 10-year renewal at a July 22 meeting. Union pushback caused the committee to delay a vote until air-quality reports were completed and reviewed.
At a subsequent meeting on July 29, the committee delayed the vote again, and said it wants to schedule a public hearing on the lease renewal, but a meeting had not been scheduled as of Monday. 
Gunnip said in a phone call Monday afternoon that union leadership never received copies of the air quality report from DCYF directly, but instead saw the report for the first time when it was uploaded with a story published on Rhode Island Current.  
DCYF headquarters lease renewal still up in the air

DCYF leadership has previously said the Friendship Street building is safe, and characterized the union’s presence at the July 29 State Properties meeting — in which workers brought large photographs documenting building issues like mold and rodents — as “theatrics.”  
But the issues are not unique to DCYF, Gunnip said, noting he had spent his day starting the grievance process on behalf of a worker at the Department of Human Services building in Warwick, who is concerned that his recent headaches may be due to the building’s working conditions. 
Emails from the agency’s chief of staff said that the landlord performed testing recently and there was no mold present. But the building has had mold problems in the past, according to a Feb. 2024 analysis. 
SEIU Local 580 represents numerous social service agencies in Rhode Island’s public sector, many of them within the Executive Office of Health and Human Services, including the Department of Human Services. Gunnip said issues with aging buildings often leased by the state are only widening the rift between management and workers.
Gunnip said of the Warwick human services worker, “He’s thinking, ‘Am I just going crazy, or is it really the building?’ That’s the problem in and of itself. If it wasn’t a substandard building…then you know, that’d be a different story.”

The action was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska on behalf of Sabina Carmona-Lorenzo, whom the ACLU said was in the U.S. more than 25 years. She and her husband have five children, three of whom are minors. One is in college and the other in the U.S. military, the ACLU said.
Similar to at least three other recent lawsuits, including one filed by the ACLU for another woman, the latest argues that Carmona-Lorenzo’s continued detention extends beyond legal authority and violates her right to due process.
An Omaha-based immigration judge on July 15 granted that Carmona-Lorenzo be released upon posting a bond, but the federal government blocked the bond by invoking an “automatic stay.” Bond would have freed her to be with her family while her legal team built a case for why she should not be deported. 
The government acted after a leaked July 8 memo from the Trump administration offered new guidance that immigrant advocates say made nearly all who entered the country without authorization ineligible for bond while they battle deportation proceedings. 
Previously, undocumented immigrants already living in the U.S. generally were allowed to request a bond hearing before an immigration judge. But the memo said the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice had revisited the government’s legal position on detention and release and determined based on a different section of immigration law that such immigrants “may not be released from ICE custody.” 
In rare exceptions, an undocumented immigrant may be released on parole, but that decision will be up to an immigration officer, not a judge, ICE’s acting director told agents, according to the Washington Post, which reported the memo.
Two women caught in Omaha immigration raid reunite with families per judge’s order

The new guidance is based on a section of immigration law that says unauthorized immigrants “shall be detained” after their arrest, but historically that applied to those who recently crossed the border and not longtime U.S. residents.
Last week, U.S. District Court Senior Judge Joseph Bataillon ordered that two other women detained in the Omaha raid be released “immediately” after they re-posted bond, saying the government was unlawfully detaining the women, both from Mexico.
In those cases, both Yanier Garcia Jimenez and Floribertha Mayo Anicasio also had been granted release on bond by an immigration judge, yet for weeks continued to be detained under an automatic stay appeal by the feds.
A hearing is scheduled for Tuesday in Bataillon’s courtroom for the other worker represented by ACLU, Maria Reynosa Jacinto. All four women were jailed in the Lincoln County Detention Center North Platte, hours from their Omaha families, along with numerous others from the Glenn Valley raid. 
According to the ACLU, “These back-to-back cases highlight the urgent need for immigration authorities to comply with constitutional requirements and respect immigration court judges’ bond determinations.”

The GOP leaders denounced the 1,400 page omnibus bill, which they displayed on the podium and was passed by the Democratic majority in the closing moments of the 2024 legislative session. (Photo by Michelle Griffith/Minnesota Reformer.)A Ramsey County District Court judge on Monday struck down a 2024 law banning binary trigger devices — which double the rate of fire of semiautomatic firearms — as a violation of the state constitution’s rule requiring legislation to be about a single subject.
Although just the binary trigger ban was struck down, Judge Leonardo Castro used sweeping language about the DFL-controlled Legislature’s violation of the single-subject rule, clearing the way for potential litigation over a bevy of subjects included in the law, from Uber and Lyft driver wages to paid leave provisions.
The ruling didn’t strictly address the legality of binary triggers, but instead focused on the 1,400-page bill in which the binary trigger ban was included last year. In the final moments of the 2024 session, the DFL-controlled Legislature passed an “omnibus” bill — think: everything but the kitchen sink — that included 13 separate subjects, including minimum pay rates for Uber and Lyft drivers; alterations to the state’s paid leave program; and changes to make the child tax credit more user-friendly.
The Minnesota Constitution states “no law shall embrace more than one subject, which shall be expressed in its title.” The purpose is to prevent legislators from steamrolling provisions into big bills with little notice.
But bills running several hundred pages about a multitude of subjects are common, no matter which party controls the Legislature.
Castro said in his ruling that the Minnesota Supreme Court has considered dozens of cases challenging the state Constitution’s single-subject clause since 1857.
The case challenging the binary trigger ban was brought by the Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus, arguing the 1,400-page omnibus bill in 2024 was unconstitutional.
Castro ruled that the bill included many provisions that had nothing to do with one another.
“The 2024 Omnibus Bill violates the Single Subject and Title Clause, because, at best, it contains many non-germane parts, and at worst, has no identifiable common theme,” Castro wrote.
Despite his sweeping language, Castro employed judicial restraint. He refrained from invalidating all the provisions in the 1,400-page bill and only struck down the binary trigger ban. He did so because Minnesota Supreme Court precedent states that courts should favor striking certain provisions rather than invalidating entire bills, he wrote.
“But make no mistake, during the late hours of May 19, 2024, lawmaking did not ‘occur within the framework of the Constitution,’” Castro concluded. “This Court respectfully suggests that if there has ever been a bill without common theme and where ‘all bounds of reason and restraint seem to have been abandoned,’ this is it; and if there has ever been time for the ‘draconian result of invalidating the entire law,’ that time is now.”
Democrats proposed the binary trigger ban after a man fatally shot and killed two Burnsville police officers and a paramedic in early 2024.
“The state has repeatedly tried to bury gun control provisions inside sprawling omnibus bills. Today’s ruling makes clear that this practice violates the Minnesota Constitution, ” Senior Vice President of the Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus Rob Doar said in a press release.
A spokesperson for Gov. Tim Walz confirmed that the state will appeal the ruling. 
“This law was passed in the aftermath of the horrific killing of three first responders in Burnsville, and was intended to help ensure such a tragedy does not happen again. The governor stands firmly behind this law and plans to appeal this decision,” the spokesperson said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/P1163350-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-18 17:57:33.117713

(Maria Korneeva/Getty Images)New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez announced a $350,000 settlement in a case filed last year against a Santa Fe spa for violations of the Unfair Practices Act.
The suit against Santa Fe Spa Center (aka Voupre Spa or SHM Group 2019, Inc.) accused the business of employing “aggressive and deceptive practices to lure individuals into the store,” a news release says, and then would often charge customers more than the prices upon which they had agreed.
In addition to the $350,000, the AG’s settlement with the spa requires the business to:
• report within 30 days to the AG if it changes its name or other identifying features that “could affect consumer recognition of the entity responsible for the transaction”;
• provide customers with itemized receipts and complete transactions “within the confines of each retail location”
• create and maintain a return policy that complies with the Unfair Practices Act; is disclosed to customers; and is available in writing.
A news release says the New Mexico Department of Justice will reach out to customers who have already filed a complaint with the office, but other complainants have until Feb. 10, 2026 to submit a claim.
“Our Department has been hard at work on this case, and we are proud to return money to consumers who were targeted and financially harmed,” Torrez said in a statement. “Visitors and locals alike should never be charged thousands of dollars more than a fair price, nor should they be subjected to high-pressure sales tactics and false promises designed to trick them into buying products they don’t want or need. This case underscores our commitment to protecting consumers in New Mexico and holding bad actors fully accountable for exploiting our communities.

Tina Bojanowski, D-Louisville, confers with Kentucky Auditor Allison Ball about education data before the start of Monday’s Interim Joint Committee on Education meeting. (LRC Public Information)A Democratic lawmaker asked Republican Auditor Allison Ball if her office’s recent critical audit of the Kentucky Department of Education makes the case for Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s proposal for universal pre-K. 
Ball presented the findings of the audit released last month during a Monday meeting of the Interim Joint Committee on Education. The audit said “widespread improvements” are needed across the agency, which oversees all public education for the state’s K-12 students. 
Senate Democratic Caucus Chair Reginald Thomas, of Lexington, asked if the audit’s findings on low readiness for kindergarten supported the governor’s argument for offering all Kentucky children universal pre-K before they enter kindergarten. 
  Senate Minority Caucus Chair Reginald Thomas, D-Lexington, asks a question during a July meeting. (LRC Public Information)
“Doesn’t your report make the case that Kentucky needs to follow the rest of the country now and adopt some form of universal pre-K?” Thomas asked. “Is the governor absolutely correct in pushing for that? And if you disagree with that, then explain why not?”
The Democratic governor has long supported implementing universal pre-K statewide, but the idea has not gained traction in the Republican-controlled state legislature. Beshear signed an executive order to establish an advisory committee to explore support for universal pre-kindergarten programs in Kentucky earlier this summer. 
Ball said that “if we’re not doing a good job on that at this point, then we don’t want to expand that out to other kids.” The audit’s findings on kindergarten readiness between 2018 and 2023 “revealed overall kindergarten readiness levels below 50% for each year with performance declining in the most recent three years.” 
“So, step one would be to make sure our preschools are performing to the highest level they can be,” Ball said, adding that her takeaway would be to fix that first.
 Only about 27% of Kentucky’s 4-year-olds were enrolled in a state-funded preschool program during the 2023-24 school year, according to data presented last week to Beshear’s Pre-K for All Advisory Committee. Kentucky’s neighbor, West Virginia, which offers universal pre-K, enrolled 67% of its 4-year-olds in a state preschool program during that same time. Iowa and Oklahoma enrolled 66% of their 4-year-olds.
Early learning sets kids on life trajectory, Kentuckians hear, as Beshear keeps pushing for pre-K

Ball’s audit report of KDE said “widespread improvements are needed across the agency.” For about 45 minutes, Ball gave lawmakers an overview of the more than 550-page document Monday. KDE did not address lawmakers during the meeting. 
The General Assembly passed legislation in 2024 directing the auditor to review the education agency. 
Ball said that it was an opportune time to do the audit as KDE crafts its strategic plan and “and this will help them, I think, quite a bit to be able to accomplish that in the most effective way.” Also, lawmakers will deliberate the next biennial state budget when they reconvene in Frankfort in January. 
The auditor emphasized during her presentation a need for KDE and the Kentucky Board of Education to have measurable benchmarks instead of broad goals and to improve communication issues between education leaders in Kentucky. 
Ball also encouraged lawmakers to think about how the legislature can address issues with budget appropriations, such as providing funding for math and literacy coaches and addressing a shortage of school counselors. The auditor said her team found that 628 more counselors are needed in Kentucky. 
“We discovered that nearly half of all school districts don’t meet the recommended counselor to student ratio of 1 to 250 students,” Ball said. “And that actually sounds like quite a lot to me, even as it is, but that’s our goal right now.” 
The School Safety and Resiliency Act passed in 2019 set a goal for school districts to have at least one counselor for every 250 students. It also said counselors should spend at least 60% of their time providing direct services to students. 
The audit also covered some financial issues, including a finding that KDE failed to use $250 million that could have gone into bolstering underfunded areas of education during fiscal years 2021-24. However, the department disputed the finding in its response to the report.
Ball also said that KDE could do more when it comes to sexual assault prevention and raising awareness in schools. Some issues auditors found were that there is not a database to track middle and high school coaches being investigated or charged with inappropriate behavior towards minors. Also, the Kentucky High School Athletic Association (KHSAA) does not have a tracking system for Title IX complaints. 
Title IX is a federal law that prohibits sex-based discrimination in education programs that receive federal funding. The law has gained attention recently after a federal judge reaffirmed his decision to block Biden administration Title IX rules, including those aimed at protecting LGBTQ+ students from discrimination in schools, earlier this year. 
Ball said “boys playing in girls sports” is “still a national issue” that can come up in Title IX complaints. The General Assembly passed a law banning transgender womens and girls from playing on female sports teams in the state in 2022.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/bojanowski081825-1024x697.jpeg,,,2025-08-18 17:57:33.117713

Mere months ago, the Vermont Asylum Assistance Project was furloughing staff, reeling from federal funding cuts that slashed about half of the group’s budget. 
Now, the key immigration law organization helping noncitizens fight detention and removal in Vermont is expanding rapidly, according to Executive Director Jill Martin Diaz. That’s thanks to both private donations — some in the six figures — as well as a $100,000 grant from the Vermont Immigration Legal Defense Fund. 
“For better or worse, this year has taught me how to run a business,” Martin Diaz said. 
The asylum assistance project is the first recipient of money from the legal defense fund. A group of well-connected leaders and elected officials announced the fund in May, quickly raising more than $30,000 in donations online after that rollout, according to Natalie Silver, a consultant for the fundraising operation.

More than three months in, the fund, created to expand legal resources for Vermonters facing immigration proceedings, has raised $250,000, a quarter of the way to its $1 million goal. 
As President Donald Trump’s administration ramps up immigration enforcement nationwide, the effects have hit Vermont, with noncitizens detained, incarcerated in the state’s prisons and moved by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement around the country. Few attorneys in Vermont have immigration law expertise, a niche that the legal defense fund and asylum assistance project have looked to fill. 
“This is something Vermonters really care about,” Silver said. “What we have learned is that people are fired up about the fact that there are people in our communities who are being pushed through this system without ever speaking to an attorney.”
Silver said the fund has received money from more than 700 individual donors, and has benefited from partnerships, like one with Vermont Green Football Club, which raised $25,000.
“There is an urgent need. The need is only increasing,” she said. 
Martin Diaz agreed. The asylum assistance project is looking to increase its partnerships by having staff work alongside other community organizations, growing the clinic’s regional reach. The organization is also increasing its work in Vermont’s prisons, where legal staff can meet people in need of representation. 
“This is a system that’s overdue for Vermont, and we want to sustain it going forward,” they said. 
In the next few months, the project will bring on two new legal fellows, as well as an intake specialist and a director of operations, among other positions, according to Martin Diaz. On the back of strong fundraising, the Vermont Asylum Assistance Project plans to more than double its spending, from $383,000 last fiscal year to more than $1.05 million this year. 
Martin Diaz described this whirlwind period as bittersweet. On the one hand, the Vermont Asylum Assistance Project has taken off. But that’s due to the surge in immigration enforcement since Trump took office, and meanwhile, other organizations engaged in similar work have suffered from federal funding cuts. 
“To think that in just a few months we pivoted so dramatically, it’s stunning,” they said.

(Photo by Austin Fisher)Local, tribal or quasi-government organizations are eligible for up to $45,000 in each of New Mexico’s 13 behavioral health regions, the state Administrative Office of the Courts announced on Monday.
The money will be used to support regional behavioral health planning as required under new Behavioral Health Reform and Investment Act — passed by state lawmakers and enacted earlier this year — which seeks to rebuild behavioral health services in the state.
The law requires the Administrative Office of the Courts to divide the state into behavioral health regions, each of which will identify five behavioral health priorities over the next four years.
Last May, Health Care Authority Behavioral Health Services Division Director Nick Boukas laid out a timeline for implementing the law, which the statutorily created five-member Behavioral Health Reform and Investment Act Executive Committee approved earlier this month.

“This funding will help each behavioral health region identify its priorities, engage stakeholders and create an implementation plan that reflects available resources and addresses community needs,” AOC Director Karl Reifsteck, a member of the state’s Behavioral Health Reform and Investment Act Executive Committee, said in a statement.
An AOC news release says the “planning funding process encourages stakeholders in each region to collaborate in
identifying an entity – such as a local or tribal government – to apply for funding and coordinate” the planning work.
Any entity that applies for funding will be required to have a letter of support from county managers in each of the counties within their regions. The money for planning can cover work such as establishing committees; organizing community meetings; and hosting workshops.
Regions are required to co-host at least one community listening session as directed by AOC, according to a memo from the court’s Behavioral Health Investment and Reform Administrator Esperanza Lucero.
Requests for planning funding must be submitted to the AOC by Sept. 30, and will be proceeded by two informational sessions at the end of August and the beginning of September.
“The funding will lay the foundation to build a sustainable regional network for delivering behavioral health services to New Mexicans,” Lucero said in a statement.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_9775-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-08-18 17:57:33.117713

For one CT couple, not very",CT Mirror's Long Story Short,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/18/podcast-ez-pass-ct-couple/,"WSHU and CT Mirror's Mark Pazniokas discussed his article about tolls mistakenly billed to a retired couple, rather than a state lawmaker.","A couple from Berlin, Connecticut found they had been charged for hundreds of dollars in tolls mistakenly billed to them instead of a state Rep. with the same license plate number.
WSHU’s Ebong Udoma spoke with CT Mirror’s Mark Pazniokas to discuss his article, “How a Berlin couple got billed for a CT legislator’s E-ZPass tolls,” as part of the collaborative podcast Long Story Short. Read Mark’s story here.
WSHU: Hello, Paz, this is a fascinating revelation that you’ve done here, into the confusion regarding the assignment of low digit number plates in Connecticut. These are supposed to be specialized plates, so how come different people would get the same number?
MP: Well, yes, this is something I think that will surprise people, that every state, Connecticut included, has several classifications of motor vehicle license plates, and many states, not all, but Connecticut included, they will use the same numbers for different classes of plates, which is of no great moment, typically. But you know, my story focuses on the troubles that a couple had because the E-ZPass photographic readers confuse their plate with that of a legislator who had this same number.
WSHU: Tell us a little bit about the background of Dick and Gail Benson of Berlin and how they got into this trouble.
MP: There’s a great irony here. The Bensons are not entirely amused by it, but they do certainly see the joke, and that is that Dick Benson was an aide to Governor Weicker and Senator Weicker for many years, and in that function, one of the chores he was given at the end of the Weicker administration is to distribute these low digit plates, one, two and three digit plates that the political class seems to think is kind of a cool thing to have. And he was charged with distributing what was left. And he was told, you know, take one for yourself and your wife. And Dick Benson is a disabled Vietnam vet. And he took the number three disabled vet plate and gave his wife a plate that was 145. And 145 happens to be the district number of a young state rep named Corey Paris in Stamford.
WSHU: Now let’s get back to why state legislators get the number plates low numbers — because of their districts, right?
MP: Right. They are the district numbers, and the plates are distinctive to the naked eye from a regular passenger plate. The plates have two blue stripes and it says legislative plate. So in most circumstances, there is not, you know, real confusion, although, as I was doing the reporting on this, I did, I did suggest to legislative authorities that perhaps it would make sense for legislative plate, if you were from the house to have, oh, I don’t know, maybe the letter H before the number.
WSHU: Now, Corey Paris, state legislator from Stamford, has the same number as Gail Benson, and he has been going into areas where his license plate number has been read by the E-ZPass cameras. So what happened after that?
MP: So one day in November at the end of 2023, Gail Benson got a notice of an unpaid parking ticket in West Hartford, which she found odd, because she had not been to West Hartford in some time. And when she inquired, and West Hartford officials looked at it, they found that the car was not a Volvo, which is what she drives. It was a Kia, which Corey Paris drives. And after consulting with the department motor vehicle, they straightened it out. Then, in fact, it was Corey Paris’s car. And then they thought, well, we better check our E-ZPass statement to make sure there’s no other confusion. And they found hundreds and hundreds of dollars in tolls that they had been paying. You know, their E-ZPass account is on auto pay. And I don’t know about you, but I’m not terribly attentive to certain bills that come in on auto pay. And so it went on for at least a year and a half.
WSHU: Wow.
MP: Yeah.
WSHU: It must have racked up quite a bit.
MP: So what ensued is it was made clear that E-ZPass is not the easiest organization to deal with, and they eventually got some credits back on their bills. And then finally, when I started inquiring, they also got a final check for another 240 bucks and Corey Paris said he was unaware of it, because he had an old E-ZPass, which he said he was unaware had become inactive. So he also was not checking his statements, if indeed he was getting any. And so he had his own problem in trying to straighten out what he owed. And in fact, at some point, E-ZPass was trying to ding him for late payments on charges that he had never received.
WSHU: You mentioned the fact that it’s not easy dealing with the bureaucracy of E-ZPass. Tell us a little bit about your experience trying to sort this out.
MP: Well, going through the E-ZPass customer service, there was no luck there. I had better luck with the MTA Bridge and Tunnel authority. They did look into it, although they would not provide anyone for an interview to just sort of answer basic questions about, is there a written policy for handling these mistakes? You know, mistakes are inevitable. There are, you know, billions of transactions. E-ZPass is available in 17 states. In New York alone, there are six different tolling authorities. And you know, so you know, this stuff happens, but it was, it was pretty maddening to try to get some straight answers. At one point when they informed me that they had reviewed their files and they were sending a refund, I was told, so therefore, “there’s no story here, right?”
WSHU: Interesting. What about the Connecticut DMV? You spoke with them. What’s their take on all of this?
MP: Well, you know, the Connecticut DMV, like every DMV, is much maligned, but I have to tell you, in this story, the only bureaucracy that the Bensons and Corey Paris praised was the DMV, they said that they did what they could to help straighten this out. You know, they are not a direct player in this, as everyone knows, Connecticut does not have tolls, but there are interstate compacts in which their files are available to E-ZPass, and that’s how E-ZPass can attach a photograph of a plate to an address and send a bill by mail if you don’t have the E-ZPass transponder.
WSHU: So Paz, what’s the bottom line here? Is it going to be any easier dealing with E-ZPass going forward? Is there any indication there might be some type of policy change?
MP: No. I don’t see any possibility of that. Based on years of them dealing with these kinds of things, I did find other cases, sporadic cases around the country, and there’s a similarity, and that is people tended to get refunds after the media started looking into it. You know, I don’t know why this is so difficult for them now, part of it is the fault of these states having duplicate numbers on different classifications of plates.
WSHU: There are 10 number threes in Connecticut.
MP: Yes, including a state representative, Minnie Gonzalez (D-Hartford). But I talked to her, and she actually said, it’s funny, it seems to work for her. She does not have a transponder. But she said, you know, just last week, she was up on the Mass Pike, and she did get a bill by mail. So apparently it works sometimes. But the DMV people told me that in their experience, there seems to be a tendency of the electronic plate readers to default to an assumption that they are a passenger plate and not one of the other classifications, you know. And so when it comes to plate number three, you know that Dick Benson has, there’s a fire truck that has a number three. There’s at least one legislator, although the state senator from the third district does not have legislative plates, and some legislators just, you know, they can’t be bothered because you have to have a regular registration. You get the legislative plate by paying an extra $14 and some people like to have it on their car. I don’t know about you, but I like to be anonymous.
WSHU: That’s why I wasn’t surprised that Senator Anwar preferred not to have one. Thank you so much Mark. I really appreciate it.
MP: Thank you.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_7561-2-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-08-18 17:57:33.117713

Mike Caruso to serve as Palm Beach County clerk of the circuit court and comptroller, the governor’s office announced Monday.
Caruso was the lone vote against some legislation disfavored by the governor during the 2025 legislative session, signaling his loyalty to DeSantis during a time when Speaker of the House Daniel Perez and the governor did not see eye-to-eye.
House leadership removed Caruso as chairman of the House Infrastructure Subcommittee and moved his office after he voted against a legislative immigration enforcement package that conflicted with the governor’s.
Monday afternoon, Caruso’s office announced he had resigned from the House, one year before he would be term-limited out of office.
“It has been the honor of my life to serve the people of Florida,” Caruso said. “I am deeply thankful to my constituents for their trust, my colleagues for their partnership, and most especially Governor DeSantis for the opportunity to continue serving the citizens of Palm Beach County in this important capacity.”
In his new role, Caruso will manage public records and court documents and oversee county finances.
“I look forward to bringing the same dedication, integrity, and results-driven approach I’ve shown in the legislature to the Clerk’s Office,” Caruso said. “Palm Beach County deserves the most transparent, efficient, and fraud-free system of public service.”
Caruso, a Delray Beach Republican, was first elected to the House in 2018.
The position Caruso will take up was vacated by Democrat Joseph Abruzzo, a former state senator and representative. Abruzzo was elected as clerk of circuit court and comptroller in 2020 and left the spot in June when he became Palm Beach County’s administrator.

The […]","Photo illustration by Getty Images.Admitting Montana is out of step with other states, and facing the threat of a class-action lawsuit, Montana Superintendent of Public Instruction Susie Hedalen and the State of Montana have come to an agreement in federal court to allow those with disabilities to stay enrolled in public schools until they reach their 22nd birthday.
The suit was brought by parents of two disabled students and challenged by Disability Rights Montana.
“This is a huge win for Montana students,” said David Carlson, executive director of Disability Rights Montana. “Students with disabilities were being exited from school before earning a high school diploma and before they were ready to transition to post-secondary employment, education and independent living. Now students who need it will have the additional time that federal law allows to prepare for success as adults.”
Montana’s special education was offered through the age of 19, but state leaders had insisted for years that a certificate of completion of an individual education plan was equal to a high school diploma, and therefore, public schools were not obligated to keep disabled students until the age of 22, as most other states mandate.
Some states, according to Disability Rights Montana, provide services until the age of 26.
Parents of two students sued the state, saying that Montana was using the terms interchangeably in order to shirk responsibility for the additional years of support required by the Free Appropriate Public Education concept within the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.
In court documents, officials from the state’s Office of Public Instruction admitted that a high school diploma was not equivalent or interchangeable with an individual education plan, which is usually a document created by a team of teachers, specialists and administrators that outlines an education plan tailored specifically to that student’s abilities, rather than a general curriculum outlined for a high school diploma in the state.
The change, which will take effect beginning in the upcoming 2025-’26 school year, means that districts will continue to provide support and education for individuals with disabilities who are not following a general diploma track.
Moreover, the agreement, signed by U.S. District Court Judge Dana L. Christensen, says that Montana must make attempts to reach students who were cycled out of the school districts but are younger than 22 years old. Those students will now become eligible for an updated individual education plan as well as support services, as part of the legal agreement.
While the State of Montana, including Gov. Greg Gianforte, have agreed that they will not admit they broke the law, they will also be responsible for legal fees for the parents and Disability Rights Montana.
  What comes next? 

As part of the agreement signed last week, Hedalen said that the Office of Public Instruction will begin to issue guidance documents to districts and special education cooperatives that say that Free Appropriate Public Education will be made available to all eligible disabled students until their 22nd birthday.
“Issuing a diploma based on the student’s completion of his or her individual education plan goals does not terminate their eligibility,” Christensen said in the order.
OPI has also said that it will create a plan to communicate with students who “were improperly exited” during the 2024-’25 year, according to the court order and agreement. It will also have to contact each student identified at their last known address with a copy of the judgment and documents to request re-enrollment. The office will have 30 days to send out the notice, and students’ families will have 30 days to return the documentation.
“Critically, students with disabilities who were improperly exited last school year only have 30 days after receiving the notice from their school to complete and return the re-enrollment paperwork,” said a press release from Disability Rights Montana.
The office also agreed to provide ongoing information and training that covers the requirements of the agreement, court documents said. Christensen’s court will also handle any complaint arising out of the agreement, according to court documents.
The agreement will remain in place until the Montana Legislature decides to adopt state law that follows the federal requirements.
“The judgment shall terminate upon a change in Montana statute mandating that a Free Appropriate Public Education made available to all qualifying students until they reach the age of 22,” the court order said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GettyImages-1383546236-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-18 17:57:33.117713

During a forum sponsored by the Sutherland Institute on Monday, Utah Republican Rep. Blake Moore, who represents the area, started his remarks acknowledging the incident and describing it as “a realization of how difficult that job is.”
“We’ve got a great mayor up in Tremonton, a town you don’t often hear this type of stuff happen from, so it’s a little shocking, no matter where it happens,” Moore said. “My heart goes out to northern Utah, and Box Elder County.” 
Other members of Utah’s congressional delegation also lamented the news in prepared statements.
Sen. John Curtis said on X he was “heartbroken by the tragic loss of two law enforcement officers in Tremonton last night.” 
“‘Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends,’” Sen. Mike Lee quoted from the Bible on X as he asked his followers to join him in praying for the law enforcement officers, their families and the Tremonton community.
Rep. Burgess Owens also called for prayers for the fallen officers, the recovery of the wounded deputy and the safety of the state’s law enforcement community on a social media post, describing the incident as “heartbreaking news.”
A male suspect is currently in custody in the Box Elder County Jail under investigation of aggravated murder, a capital crime in Utah.

Brad McVay was sworn in as statewide prosecutor Monday by Attorney General James Uthmeier. It is one of the top positions in the Florida Department of Legal Affairs and takes the lead in investigations that cross multiple county and judicial circuit lines.
McVay spent the past seven years holding top positions in the Department of State, including more than four years as general counsel, responsible for defending Florida’s election laws against multiple lawsuits filed by voting-rights groups. 
McVay also worked as deputy secretary, managing the state’s election crimes office, created at the urging of Gov. Ron DeSantis.
McVay, a graduate of the Florida State University College of Law, spent five years as an assistant state prosecutor earlier in his career.
Uthmeier, during the swearing-in event, said McVay was one of “many qualified” applicants for the post, but he decided that he would be the best person to take on drug cartels, fight election fraud, and help protect children.
“He’s the right man for the job,” Uthmeier said. “He’s a good man. He’s an honorable man.”
Nick Cox, first appointed by then-Attorney General Pam Bondi, had been statewide prosecutor since 2011. He stepped down earlier this year to take a top job with State Attorney Suzy Cox in Hillsborough County.
In brief remarks following his swearing-in, McVay promised that “we will strive to be fast, fearless, relentless, and smart.”
DeSantis appointed Uthmeier, his former chief of staff, as attorney general after he selected then-Attorney General Ashley Moody to fill the Senate seat vacated by Marco Rubio, now U.S. secretary of state.

The letters are a step in the effort to collect driver’s license or partial Social Security numbers from registered voters whose electronic data files appear to be missing those identifiers that the elections board approved in June. 
The mail will encourage recipients to provide one of those numbers online through the DMV, in person at their county elections office,  or by mail, using a self-addressed stamped envelope, according to a Board of Elections news release. 
A searchable list of people who don’t have one of those identifiers attached to their registration can be found through the Registration Repair Search Tool. 
President Donald Trump’s US Department of Justice is suing the State Board over the missing information. State Elections Director Sam Hayes told the board at a recent meeting that the plan for collecting information may help settle the lawsuit.
The DOJ lawsuit mirrored the complaints from GOP Appeals Court Judge Jefferson Griffin. He challenged the votes of more than 60,000 people in his failed attempt to overturn the election of his Democratic opponent for a seat on the state Supreme Court based on what he said was missing registration information.

Article Summary

Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul is seeking to block the Trump administration from withholding $54 million from the state that would aid crime victims.
The administration is seeking to withhold the funding due to Illinois’ immigration enforcement policies that prohibit state law enforcement from working with immigration officials in some circumstances.
The lawsuit is one of 35 that Raoul has filed or joined against the Trump Administration.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on the story. 

SPRINGFIELD – Attorney General Kwame Raoul announced Monday that he has joined a multistate lawsuit seeking to block the Trump administration from withholding federal funding to support crime victims in Illinois due to the state’s policy on immigration.
The lawsuit is one of 35 such suits challenging Trump administration policies that Raoul has joined as part of a coalition of Democratic state attorneys general. That’s an average of more than one suit per week since Trump resumed office on Jan. 20.
The latest suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Rhode Island, argues that the U.S. Department of Justice has imposed unlawful conditions on the distribution of funds under the federal Victims of Crime Act, a 1984 law that provides funding to help crime victims deal with costs resulting from crimes, including medical bills, counseling services and lost wages.
The money is distributed to states through a series of grant programs. States then distribute their share of the money to programs and agencies that provide services or aid to crime victims. For the current federal fiscal year, which runs through Sept. 30, more than $1.3 billion is supposed to be available nationwide, including about $54 million for Illinois.
Raoul’s office said the funding supports such programs as victim and witness advocacy services, emergency shelters, medical, funeral and burial expenses, crime scene cleanup, and sexual assault forensic exams.
Trump administration conditions
According to the lawsuit, however, the Trump administration has attached new and unlawful conditions to the distribution of those funds.
Those conditions were spelled out in a July 21 Notice of Funding Opportunity, which provides that funding may not be used for any “program or activity that, directly or indirectly, violates (or promotes or facilitates the violation of) federal immigration law … or impedes or hinders the enforcement of federal immigration law.”
According to the notice, that includes complying with a federal statute that prohibits state and local governments from restricting communication with immigration officials.
The lawsuit alleges that the requirement is more than a limit on the allowable use of funds but actually serves as an eligibility requirement, meaning any state or local jurisdiction with laws or policies in place that limit their law enforcement agencies from fully cooperating with federal immigration authorities will be deemed ineligible.
At issue in Illinois, according to the lawsuit, is the state’s 2017 TRUST Act, which, among other things, prohibits state and local law enforcement officials from assisting federal immigration agents in enforcement operations, giving immigration agents access to detained individuals or giving agents nonpublic information about the release dates of detained individuals.
“Conditioning that vital funding on cooperation with immigration enforcement is not just unlawful, it is immoral,” Raoul said during a news conference Monday. “VOCA (Victims of Crime Act) funds have no relationship to civil immigration policy. In fact, grants are distributed based on a statutory formula that has nothing to do with immigration.”
The lawsuit argues those conditions violate the federal Administrative Procedures Act, that they exceed the Justice Department’s legal authority and that they violate U.S. Constitution’s spending clause and separation of powers doctrine. It also asks the court to permanently enjoin enforcement of the conditions.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-18 20:48:32+00:00,CT Mirror,CT gets $53M in farm disaster funds; applications could open in fall,Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/18/ct-usda-disaster-relief-funds/,CT was awarded $53 million of a federal block grant to help small and midsized farmers recoup weather-related losses from 2023 and 2024.,"After months of negotiations between state and federal officials, Connecticut will receive about $53 million from a federal block grant designed to help small and midsized farmers recoup weather-related crop losses.
Connecticut famers have been awaiting access to federal relief after experiencing damages caused by disasters and extreme weather in 2023 and 2024. Now that the state knows its portion of the federal funding approved by Congress last year, Connecticut is closer to operating its own crop loss program, with plans to open applications to receive relief in the fall.
The state’s allocation is about a quarter of the $220 million Farm Recovery and Support Block Grant Program, which is open to every state in New England plus Hawaii and Alaska. The amount awarded to Connecticut was about 63.5% of the state’s $82.3 million request. Farmers and lawmakers who had been pushing for finalizing the details of the program say they are satisfied with what Connecticut will receive.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture informed state Agriculture Commissioner Bryan Hurlburt’s office Friday about the allocation of $53 million. Connecticut is still waiting for USDA to approve of its program design and the execution of a contract, which the state expects to happen in September.
State officials will then start administering the program, though the exact timeline has yet to be determined. They are aiming for implementation some time in the fall, with more details to come about what eligible farmers will need in terms of paperwork and documentation to be able to tap into the $53 million pool.
The Connecticut Department of Agriculture “remains committed to providing a flexible, inclusive and farmer-centered recovery approach which meets the needs of the diversity of CT farmers, including small and medium-sized producers who have traditionally not participated in other national USDA programs,” the state agency wrote in its latest update about the grant on Friday.
Smaller farming states that grow more specialty crops don’t typically benefit from federal assistance in the same ways as larger producers that grow commodity crops like corn, soybeans and wheat. Most farmers in Connecticut don’t have crop insurance.
That prompted U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-3rd District, and other lawmakers to push for more federal relief. The block grant was tucked into legislation last December to fund the federal government. It was designed to only apply to small and medium farming states where eligibility didn’t hinge on whether a farmer has crop insurance.
One of the influences behind establishing such a block grant was William Dellacamera, a farmer in North Branford who has been advocating for federal relief for months.
He is coming up on the one-year mark of the 13-minute hail storm that destroyed Cecarelli’s Harrison Hill Farm last August. A month later, he traveled to Washington, D.C., on his tractor to push for help from the federal government.
In December, Congress passed a government funding bill with billions of dollars in emergency disaster aid, including the $220 million Farm Recovery and Support Block Grant Program.
But as months went by with little developments and ongoing negotiations, Dellacamera came back to the nation’s capital to ask about the status of the farm block grant. He met with Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins on two occasions as he made his plea for the quick rollout of the money for small and midsize farmers.
Dellacamera feels hopeful the money allotted for Connecticut will cover a lot of the losses for farmers like him. He said he didn’t expect the number to be as high as it was, noting that the $53 million is four times higher than what the state received under the last supplemental disaster program.
“It’s a big number. It should go a long way,” Dellacamera said. “We got the money right now. There’s still a lot more that needs to get done.”
DeLauro, the ranking member of the House Appropriations Committee, called the state’s allocation a “game changer.” She also credited fellow Connecticut representatives John Larson and Joe Courtney as well as Dellacamera and Hurlburt for helping get the program to final stages.
“I designed this historic block grant program to remove barriers for New England farmers like crop insurance requirements because our federal farm safety net fails so many of our specialty crop producers, and to give Connecticut the flexibility to decide when and where relief is needed,” DeLauro said in a statement. “This announcement is a major step towards putting dollars in the hands of farmers who have endured massive losses, and it is a dramatic improvement over what has been provided in the past.”
Earlier in the summer, disagreements emerged over the rollout of the disaster aid block grant.
As negotiations between federal officials and state counterparts continued, the U.S. Department of Agriculture gave states two options. They could run their own crop loss program by using the block grant tailored for them, but they wouldn’t get access to a larger pot of supplemental disaster aid — the option that Connecticut ultimately chose. Or they could go with the latter, run by the federal agency, but face limits on what gets covered by the block grant.
Connecticut decided it would develop a state-run program using the federal block grant. That meant the state wouldn’t get access to the $21 billion Supplemental Disaster Relief Program.
After learning of the USDA’s proposals in late May, eligible states scrambled to make an assessment and meet the deadline to make a decision between the two funding streams — before knowing how much they’d get from the block grant. States weighed which option made more sense for their farmers before they knew how much of the $220 million block grant they would receive.
Connecticut’s Department of Agriculture argued the block grant option would give the state more flexibility for specialty crop operations, especially since the supplemental disaster funds might not cover many of the farmers and producers in Connecticut.
At that time, the state agency and Connecticut’s congressional delegation pushed back against the USDA’s parameters that states cannot participate in both programs.
Questions emerged over the potential of double dipping and farmers getting money to cover the same thing.
DeLauro had argued the federal agency was going against the intentions of Congress in how it wrote the law, saying they interpreted the special grant as a supplement for smaller farmers who don’t always qualify for traditional disaster relief. A group of 29 Democratic lawmakers who represented the eligible block-grant states framed it as a “bait and switch” that pitted two disaster aid programs against each other.
For its part, USDA placed the blame on Democratic lawmakers, contending that they were delaying aid. The federal agency argued members were looking “to manufacture controversy and blame the Trump Administration.”
Ultimately, Connecticut chose the farm block grant money in June, and regular negotiations continued over the next couple of months.
Since Connecticut went in that direction, it will be fully in charge of administering the program and doling out the eventual compensation. 
Farmers like Dellacamera feel like Connecticut will benefit more from this avenue than they would have through the Supplemental Disaster Relief Program. But since the block grant only covers weather losses from the past two years, he is worried about what relief farmers may need after this year, especially as Connecticut currently faces dry conditions.
“I’m feeling good about it for ’23 and ’24, but what are we going to do in ’25?” Dellacamera said. “I’m happy for us at the moment, but there’s still a lot of work that needs to be done.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_4682-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-18 16:57:40.921951

The truck driver, Harjinder Singh, entered the United States illegally in 2018, according to the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles.
Singh hold a California commercial driver’s license, the department said.
The three people inside a minivan died after crashing into a semi truck driven by Singh, who “recklessly, and without regard for the safety of others, attempted to execute a U-Turn utilizing an unauthorized location,” the department said in a news release.
The crash occurred on the Florida Turnpike near Fort Pierce.
Troopers, citing a 287(g) agreement allowing them to act for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, issued a detainer for Singh.

This individual is an illegal immigrant who was granted a commercial driver’s license by the State of California — and now, three innocent people are dead.
He has been arrested for vehicular homicide and an ICE detainer has been issued. https://t.co/6NkliBDdSl

On Fox & Friends, Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier said the crash “shows how dangerous the open-border policies under Obama and Biden have been that have continued to wreak havoc on communities across the country.”
Singh, Florida officials allege, crossed the U.S.-Mexico border in 2018, during President Donald Trump’s first term in the White House.
“The actions taken by the Defendant while operating a commercial tractor-trailer are both shocking and criminal,” FLHSMV Executive Director Dave Kerner said in a news release. “Three people lost their lives as a result of his recklessness, and countless friends and family members will experience the pain of their loss forever.”
A count of vehicular homicide in Florida can bring a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison.
“He will no longer be able to damage and destroy the lives of Floridians and visitors. At the conclusion of his state charges, he will be deported,” Kerner said.
Newsweek reported that Singh is an Indian national and that the three people who died were a 37-year-old from Pompano Beach, 54-year-old from Miami, and the van driver, a 30-year-old from Florida City. The driver died at a hospital and the two others died at the scene.
Singh was arrested in California by U.S. Marshals on Saturday, Newsweek also reported.

DemasA former Michigan State University research assistant on Monday announced a lawsuit against the school, alleging that exposure to dangerous pesticides led to her being diagnosed with thyroid cancer. 
LingLong Wei was enrolled at MSU as a graduate student between 2008 and 2011, where she pursued a master’s degree in horticulture. According to her complaint, Wei was required, as part of her research, to spray “dangerous amounts of hazardous pesticides and herbicides, including but not limited to; paraquat, glyphosate, and oxyfluorfen.” 
One study published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism found that out of 29 pesticides, 10 of them, including paraquat dichloride, glyphosate and oxyfluorfen, were associated with increased risk of thyroid cancer. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
While conducting research, Wei alleged she was not provided with personal protective equipment, nor were students offered proper training on pesticide application. 
The suit accuses MSU of violating countless safety protocols and governmental regulations, causing Wei serious injuries, namely a diagnosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma in 2024.
“Because of Michigan State University’s failures Ms. Wei required serious surgical intervention removing her thyroid and leaving a permanent disfigurement, namely a visible surgical scar,” the complaint reads. 
Defendants in the suit include the university, the board of trustees, the MSU College of Agriculture and Natural Resources, the Department of Horticulture, and the MSU Office of International Students and Scholars, with Wei studying at the university as an international student. 
Also named in the suit are Bernard Zandstra, a professor emeritus in the horticulture department, former Director of the Office for International Students and Scholars Peter Briggs and Rodney Tocco Jr. who served as a research manager for the university while Wei was attending MSU. 
Wei-Complaint
Wei has requested $100 million in damages accusing the university, Zandstra, Briggs and Tocco of gross negligence and all parties of negligent infliction of emotional distress. 
“Let’s be clear. MSU knew these were dangerous, toxic chemicals and they had the resources to protect Ms. Wei and her fellow student research assistants. But they chose not to,” said Maya Green, one of Wei’s attorneys “Once again MSU has proven that they care more about cashing their students’ tuition checks than keeping them safe.”
University spokesperson Amber McCann said the university cannot comment on pending litigation, but emphasized that MSU prioritizes the health and safety of its entire community.

Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that he will no longer recommend that healthy children and pregnant people get COVID-19 shots. (Photo illustration by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Heading into the respiratory illness season, states and clinicians are working to encourage pregnant patients to get COVID-19 vaccinations, even though the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services no longer recommends that they should.
Along with being older and having an underlying health condition, pregnancy itself is a risk factor. Pregnant women are more vulnerable to developing severe illness from COVID-19. They’re also at high risk for complications, including preterm labor and stillbirth. The vast majority of medical experts say getting the shot is safe and effective — much safer than having the illness.
But HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced in May that the agency would no longer recommend that pregnant women get the vaccine. Before testifying before Congress in June, Kennedy circulated a document on Capitol Hill claiming higher rates of fetal loss after vaccination. But the authors of those studies told Politico that their work had been misinterpreted.
Experts say the federal shift puts the onus on state health agencies to ramp up vaccine guidance and outreach. Clinicians and public health organizations are trying to dispel misinformation and make sure information reaches low-income people and people of color, who had higher maternal death rates during the pandemic. During the first two years of the pandemic, the virus contributed to a quarter of maternal deaths, according to federal data.
“We are severely disappointed,” said Dr. Neil Silverman, a professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California, Los Angeles David Geffen School of Medicine. He has studied vaccines and pregnancy for the past 15 years and specializes in high-risk pregnancies.
Silverman called the federal shift a “public health tragedy on a grand scale.”

Vaccinations against COVID-19 help prevent severe illness in pregnant people as well as their newborns, who are too young to get vaccinated, Silverman said. In what’s called passive immunity, vaccinated mothers pass on antibodies to their babies through the placenta and through breast milk.
“State public health agencies are probably going to have to implement vaccine guidance that differs from the federal recommendations. And that’s going to be an interesting can of worms,” said OB-GYN Dr. Mark Turrentine, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas.
Turrentine serves on a board of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists that focuses on immunization and infectious diseases. He said his recent pregnant patients who had COVID-19 hadn’t gotten the vaccine.
“The change in guidance on the federal level just really makes a lot of confusion, and it makes it very challenging to try to explain to individuals why all of a sudden the difference,” Turrentine said.
A slew of public health organizations have been making a concerted effort to dispel vaccine myths. They include the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit organization of maternal-fetal experts. At a news briefing the society held this month, clinicians stressed the safety and long-standing science behind COVID-19 vaccines, as well as the shots for RSV and the flu. Cases of RSV and the flu tend to peak in the winter months, while in recent years COVID-19 cases have spiked in the summer and the winter.	

 
New Mexico continues to track its COVID-19 cases on a viral respiratory infections dashboard; residents can schedule COVID-19 vaccines on the state Department of Health vaccine website or by calling 1-833-SWNURSE (1-833-796-8773).


Dr. Brenna Hughes, an OB-GYN who chairs the organization’s infectious diseases and emerging threats committee, pointed to survey data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing that less than a third of eligible pregnant patients received COVID-19 shots, and only 38% received RSV shots for the 2023 to 2024 season. Less than half — 47% — received flu shots, and 59% received TDAP (whooping cough) vaccines.
CDC data shows that for last year’s and this year’s season, only between 12% and 14% of pregnant patients got the COVID-19 vaccine.
“The complications from the infection are so much greater than the complications and the very few and typically minor adverse events that might occur from the vaccine,” said microbiologist Sabra Klein, a professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
In June, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and 30 other professional health organizations signed a letter urging insurers to continue covering the COVID-19 shot for pregnant women, and have continued to urge coverage since then.
CVS Caremark, one of the nation’s three major pharmacy benefit managers, told Stateline it will continue covering the vaccine for pregnant women. The Arizona, California and North Carolina state Medicaid agencies also told Stateline they are still currently covering COVID-19 vaccines for pregnant women.

Dr. Kimberly Fortner, president-elect of the Infectious Diseases Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology, said during the maternal-fetal medicine briefing that she hopes medical groups’ joint messaging will bolster insurers.
“Hopefully by us linking arms, that can then help develop consistency so that insurers will continue to pay for the vaccine,” she said.
Exacerbating disparities
Dr. Ayanna Bennett, director of the District of Columbia Department of Health, said the federal government’s new stance has upended “a system that’s been stable for a very long time.”
Bennett said her agency used federal pandemic aid to shore up vaccine outreach efforts to communities of color. Now that flow of money is ending.
The changes in federal guidance and funding will “almost certainly exacerbate” maternal health disparities, said Marie Thoma, a perinatal epidemiologist and an associate professor in the University of Maryland Department of Family Science who researches pregnancy and COVID-19.
Black and Indigenous women died at higher rates. The virus exacerbated existing racial disparities in maternal health — and created new ones: Latina mothers, who generally see low rates of maternal mortality, saw deaths surge to 28 per 100,000 in 2021. Their rate was about 12 per 100,000 in 2018, according to federal data.
“We are going in with some exposure already that we didn’t have during the start of the pandemic. So, there will be some protection, but now that will erode,” said Thoma. “If we’re not getting vaccines, or if people are hesitant to take them, we could see some increase.”
Silverman said the administration’s efforts to strip mentions of race from government policies makes it difficult for institutions to reach populations at greatest risk. He called the dismissal of decades of data “saddening and infuriating.”
“The politicization of the vaccine process, or access to it, is what concerns me the most,” said Dr. Yvette Martas, a Connecticut OB-GYN who chairs the board of directors of the Hispanic Health Council.
Many women “are trying to navigate an economic system that’s not always in their favor in terms of also providing access to the kind of educational material that they need,” she said.
 Not just COVID-19

In June, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee, replacing them with some members who are vaccine skeptics.
The change is creating chaos. Some states have vaccine laws, such as mandates for kids and coverage statutes, that are specifically tied to the committee’s decisions.













The politicization of the vaccine process, or access to it, is what concerns me the most.


– Dr. Yvette Martas, a Connecticut OB-GYN who chairs the board of directors of the Hispanic Health Council





The Vaccine Integrity Project at the University of Minnesota called on frontline health workers, health officials and professional societies to “counter the spread of inaccurate and confusing vaccine information.”
At a news briefing this month held by the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, representatives from Alabama, Connecticut and Washington, D.C., said they will continue to recommend vaccines.
Alabama’s state health officer, Dr. Scott Harris, said clinicians will be instrumental in getting correct vaccination information to patients.
“We don’t think that we necessarily have the same authoritative voice that we might have had a decade ago in trying to guide people in what to do, but we do believe that people trust their health care providers in most cases and are certainly willing to listen to them,” he said at the briefing.
Bennett said she is hopeful that strong, consistent messaging from respected medical organizations will help combat confusion.
“Having established groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics or the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology make very firm recommendations that keep us essentially not changed from where we have been, I think, should reassure families,” she said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-18 20:32:12+00:00,CT Mirror,"CT joins 20 states, DC suing DOJ to stop immigration requirements on victim funds",Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/18/ct-sue-trump-crime-victims-immigration/,AGs from 20 states asked a judge to block DOJ conditions that would cut victim funding if states don't comply with immigration enforcement.,"A coalition of attorneys general from 20 states and Washington, D.C., is asking a federal judge to stop the U.S. Department of Justice from withholding federal funds earmarked for crime victims if states don’t cooperate with the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement efforts.
The lawsuit filed Monday in Rhode Island federal court seeks to block the Justice Department from enforcing conditions that would cut funding to a state or subgrantee if it refuses to honor civil immigration enforcement requests, denies U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers access to facilities or fails to provide advance notice of release dates of individuals possibly wanted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement because of their immigration status.
The lawsuit asks that the conditions be thrown out, arguing that the administration and the agency are overstepping their constitutional and administrative authority.
The lawsuit also argues that the requirements are not permitted or outlined in the Victims of Crime Act, known as VOCA, and would interfere with policies created to ensure victims and witnesses report crimes without fear of deportation.
“These people did not ask for this status as a crime victim. They don’t breakdown neatly across partisan lines, but they share one common trait, which is that they’ve suffered an unimaginable trauma,” New Jersey Attorney General Matthew J. Platkin said during a video news conference Monday, calling the administration’s threat to withhold funds “the most heinous act” he’s seen in politics.
In an emailed statement, Connecticut Attorney General William Tong expressed similar sentiments toward victims of crime, while also taking issue with the conditions imposed by the Trump administration. 
“This is an insult to survivors and victims of crime, and to our police and prosectors on the front lines of real public safety,” Tong wrote. “Masked commandos who round up parents on their way to school, who storm court houses, who seize kids at summer jobs do not make us safer and will not secure our border. We will not waste state funds, personnel or time serving Trump’s reckless thuggery.”
Tong’s office said $14.5 million in federal funding to Connecticut was at stake. 
The federal conditions were placed on VOCA funding, which provides more than a billion dollars annually to states for victims compensation programs and grants that fund victims assistance organizations. VOCA funding comes entirely from fines and penalties in federal court cases, not from tax dollars.
Every state and territory has a victims compensation program that follows federal guidelines, but largely is set up under state law to provide financial help to crime victims, including medical expense reimbursement, paying for crime scene cleanup, counseling or helping with funeral costs for homicide victims. VOCA covers the cost of about 75% of state compensation program awards.
The funds are also used to pay for other services, including testing rape kits, funding grants to domestic violence recovery organizations, trauma recovery centers and more.
Advocates and others argue that the system needs to protect victims regardless of their immigration status and ensure that reporting a crime does not lead to deportation threats. They also say that marginalized communities, such as newly arrived immigrants, are more likely to be crime targets.
“The federal government is attempting to use crime victim funds as a bargaining chip to force states into doing its bidding on immigration enforcement,” New York Attorney General Letitia James, who also joined the lawsuit, said in a statement Monday. “These grants were created to help survivors heal and recover, and we will fight to ensure they continue to serve that purpose … We will not be bullied into abandoning any of our residents.”
The Associated Press left a message seeking comment from a DOJ spokesperson Monday afternoon.
President Donald Trump’s administration has sought to withhold or pull back other federal funding or grant funding midstream, saying awardees and programs no longer agree with its priorities. In April, it canceled about $800 million in DOJ grants, some of which were awarded to victims service and survivor organizations.
And in June, states filed a lawsuit over added requirements in Violence Against Women Act funding that mandated applicants agree not to promote “gender ideology,” or run diversity, equity and inclusion programs or prioritize people in the country illegally.
Several attorneys general said the VOCA conditions appear to be another way the administration is targeting so-called sanctuary jurisdictions that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities, though there is no clear definition of what a sanctuary state or city is.
The Trump administration earlier this month released an updated list of states, cities and counties it considers sanctuary jurisdictions. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said in the August announcement that the department would “continue bringing litigation against sanctuary jurisdictions and work closely with the Department of Homeland Security to eradicate these harmful policies around the country.”
As of Monday afternoon attorneys general from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin — all Democrats — had signed on to the lawsuit.

But Democratic critics and data experts warn it could allow the federal government to vacuum up vast quantities of information on Americans for unclear purposes.
Some Democratic election officials and opponents of the effort fear President Donald Trump wants to build a federal database of voters to target political opponents or cherry-pick rare examples of noncitizen voters to fuel a sense of crisis. Republican election officials allied with the president counter that he’s helping states to maintain accurate voter rolls.
The Trump administration has rolled out changes to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, tool at the same time the U.S. Department of Justice is asking states for copies of their voter rolls. The timing, combined with questions about what happens to voter data uploaded to the program, has alarmed critics.
Trump wants Congress to pass a national proof of citizenship voter registration requirement and in March tried to unilaterally impose one for federal elections through executive order. But with the legislation stalled and the order halted by the courts, the citizenship data tool may offer a backdoor way to accomplish the same goal.
SAVE was originally intended to help state and local officials verify the immigration status of individual noncitizens seeking government benefits. But U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, this spring refashioned it into a platform that can scan states’ voter rolls if election officials upload the data.
The changes to SAVE, rolled out over just a few months and with little public debate, are “tinkering with sort of the bones of democracy,” said John Davisson, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington, D.C.-based research and advocacy group that argues privacy is a fundamental right.
“You’re talking about the voting process and who will be eligible to vote,” Davisson said. “And to take a system that is not designed for use in that process and repurpose it, really on the fly, without a formal comment process, without formal rulemaking, without congressional intervention — that’s pretty anomalous and pretty alarming.”
Previously, SAVE could only search one name at a time. Now it can conduct bulk searches, allowing state officials to potentially feed into it information on millions of registered voters. SAVE checks that information against a series of federal databases and reports back whether it can verify someone’s immigration status.
Since May, it also can draw upon Social Security data, transforming the program into a tool that can confirm citizenship because Social Security records for many, but not all, Americans include the information. NPR reported earlier on changes to SAVE.
“It is incredible what has been done, really since March,” Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray, a Republican who supports proof of citizenship requirements and the SAVE tool, told a gathering of state secretaries of state in Biloxi, Mississippi, last week.
Individuals registering to vote in federal elections must already sign a statement affirming they are citizens under penalty of perjury, and those who cast a ballot face criminal penalties and deportation. One study of the 2016 election placed the prevalence of noncitizen voting at 0.0001% of votes cast.
But as Trump has spread falsehoods about elections, Republicans have made purging noncitizens from voter rolls a central focus.
Democratic concerns were on display last week at the National Association of Secretaries of State conference, held at the Beau Rivage casino-resort in Biloxi. In interviews on the sidelines of the conference, Democratic secretaries of state voiced deep reservations — or outright opposition — about plugging their voter data into SAVE.
Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said Aug. 6 that the federal government appeared to be trying to take over election administration. She formally rejected the Justice Department’s voter roll request two days later.
Bellows said the Department of Homeland Security told her in a recent phone call that it planned to retain SAVE data for 10 years for “audit purposes only.”
“Just like the [Justice Department] is asking us to hand over an electronic file of all the voters in our state, it seems like the Department of Homeland Security is through this backdoor system also asking us to share voter information about every voter in our state,” Bellows said.
At least one state appears to have granted the federal government sweeping authority over any voter data it provides to SAVE.
Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales announced in July he had reached an agreement with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to access the newly expanded system for voter list maintenance. Indiana’s agreement allows the federal agency to use information the state provides for any purpose permitted by law, including criminal prosecutions.
Morales, a Republican, said in a news release that SAVE represented “another step in safeguarding the rights” of eligible voters. His office didn’t respond to Stateline’s questions.
The Trump administration has ramped up efforts to encourage state election officials to use the expanded program. The White House hosted a bipartisan “fly in” event for state secretaries of state on July 29. Multiple secretaries of state told Stateline that USCIS Director Joseph Edlow, who was confirmed on July 15, spoke at the event.
“The president is very much keyed in on voter list maintenance,” Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, a Republican, said in an interview — echoing other GOP secretaries of state who released statements praising the Trump administration after the meeting.
Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, a Democrat who attended the meeting, said he questioned how the federal government would handle voter information provided to SAVE. He added that the Justice Department’s request for his state’s voter rolls raised his level of concern about how data would be used.
“When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances,” Simon told Stateline.
The White House referred questions about SAVE and the event to the Department of Homeland Security and USCIS.
In response to questions from Stateline, USCIS didn’t directly answer whether the agency would share voter roll data with other parts of the federal government but confirmed it disposes of records after 10 years.
“The SAVE application is a critical tool for state and local governments to access information to safeguard the integrity of elections across the country. It’s no wonder many states have quickly adopted it, and we continue to promote the tool to other states and counties not using SAVE,” USCIS spokesperson Matthew Tragesser said in a statement.
“We look forward to continued optimization efforts and implementing more updates to SAVE.”
 GOP pressure

Some Republican election officials and Trump allies have long wanted the federal government to take an expanded role in searching state voter rolls for noncitizens.
Last summer the Trump-aligned litigation group America First Legal, co-founded by Trump adviser Stephen Miller, encouraged states to submit to the Department of Homeland Security the names of individuals for citizenship or immigration status verification.
Some states did just that. Texas, for example, asked USCIS to verify the citizenship of some voters in September, and Indiana asked the agency to verify 585,774 voters in October. The same month, 16 Republican state attorneys general signed a letter criticizing Homeland Security, then under the Biden administration, for failing to work with states on verification.
After Trump took office, GOP state officials kept up the pressure. Twenty-one Republican secretaries of state urged Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in February to prioritize SAVE improvements.
On April 16, Indiana sued the department in federal court for not responding to its verification request last fall. USCIS announced an overhaul of SAVE less than a week later.
As the agency continues to remake SAVE, the tool will soon allow searches using the last four digits of a Social Security number, multiple state secretaries of state told Stateline. The agency confirmed the feature is under development and will be available soon but didn’t provide an exact date.
The change would mark another significant expansion of the program because most states collect the last four digits when individuals without a driver’s license register to vote.
Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican, said SAVE represents a better way to verify citizenship than a state law requiring voters to produce documents. “I think there’s a real opportunity for us to do a lot of this through just sharing of information and I think that’s what we’re seeing happen,” McGrane said in an interview.
 Unreliable data?

But some voting rights advocates and experts on government data caution against an overreliance on Social Security data.
The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, a progressive policy nonprofit, has noted that Social Security only began tracking the citizenship status of all applicants in 1978 — meaning the database doesn’t include comprehensive citizenship information for older Americans. Additionally, Social Security may not always have up-to-date information on the status of naturalized U.S. citizens.
The nonpartisan Institute for Responsive Government also warned in May that since SAVE hasn’t used Social Security numbers to verify citizenship in the past, its accuracy and effectiveness are unknown. The success of the expanded SAVE program may also partially depend on whether it has adequate staff and resources, it said.
A 2017 Government Accountability Office report found that between fiscal years 2012 and 2016, about 16% of the nearly 90 million SAVE searches required additional verification, which the institute says often translates into federal workers manually checking files. Now that SAVE allows bulk searches, the need for manual checking could rise dramatically.
Nick Doctor, director of implementation at the Institute for Responsive Government, said in an interview that a tool confirming the eligibility of registered voters in a way that doesn’t burden individuals can be a good thing. But he emphasized that it depends in large measure on SAVE’s implementation.
“The changes that have been made to SAVE happened very quickly and, to my knowledge, we haven’t seen releases on the level of accuracy of that information,” Doctor said.
During interviews, Republican secretaries of state stressed that voters aren’t kicked off the rolls because SAVE can’t verify their citizenship. Instead, an inability to verify would likely trigger a follow-up process with the voter.
“Just because we get something back from the SAVE database, it’s not a cut and dry, especially on those they’re not sure about,” Hoskins, the Missouri secretary of state, said.
Still, Arizona illustrates why some Democrats worry about any large-scale effort to ask voters — especially longtime, older residents — to prove their citizenship. After the state discovered errors in how it tracked voter citizenship dating back years, election officials are contacting some 200,000 voters seeking proof of citizenship documentation.
Some have been casting ballots for decades without incident and many feel targeted, Arizona Democratic Secretary of State Adrian Fontes said during a presentation at the state secretaries of state conference. “They feel insulted when they get that letter,” Fontes said.
Charles Stewart III, a professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies elections, said Arizona may actually point to the potential usefulness of SAVE. If Arizona runs its voter roll through the program, a list of 200,000 voters needing citizenship verification would perhaps drop into the hundreds, he suggested.
“There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside,” Stewart said.
Connecticut Democratic Secretary of State Stephanie Thomas told Stateline that every secretary wants tools to keep voter lists as clean as possible. But the details are important.
When she hears of something new, Thomas said she asks whether it’s the best option available and whether “the i’s are dotted, the t’s crossed.” She said she’s asked USCIS a series of questions about SAVE and is waiting on some responses.
“When it comes to voter lists,” Thomas said, “I don’t want Connecticut voters to be a guinea pig.”

(Photos by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)In Virginia’s governor’s race, the candidates aren’t just preparing to debate — they’ve been debating whether to debate.
Democratic gubernatorial nominee Abigail Spanberger announced Monday that she has accepted a debate set for Oct. 9, hosted by Norfolk State University and WAVY-TV. 
Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, the Republican nominee, had already agreed last Friday, according to a press release that her campaign said it had shared with reporters, but that The Mercury did not receive at the time.
“Spanberger hasn’t debated since she first ran for Congress,” the release said.
After flipping a previously-Republican-held district in 2018, Spanberger defended the seat for two more terms. She withdrew from a planned debate against challenger Yesli Vega in 2022 over security concerns and disagreements about the moderator. 
During the 2025 election cycle for governor, both Spanberger and Earle-Sears have passed on some debate opportunities. 
Last week, Earle-Sears declined to participate in the “People’s Debate,” which would have been hosted at Virginia State University with AARP Virginia and WTVR-TV, citing a scheduling conflict. 
While Spanberger had agreed to that forum, her campaign declined a CNN-hosted debate,  saying that any debates should be carried by state and local media — the outlets a governor would work with most often. 
“We believe that debates about Virginia’s future should be rooted in Virginia, produced by Virginia media, and accessible to Virginians across the commonwealth,” her campaign manager told CNN recently. 
Peyton Vogel, a spokesperson for Earle-Sears emphasized in a text message to The Mercury Monday that her campaign had agreed to the Norfolk debate first,  sharing a screenshot of last week’s announcement. 
Meanwhile, Spanberger’s Monday statement declared that she “is ready to debate the issues.”
Political analyst Bob Holsworth said it’s not surprising to see candidates and their consultants showing “less interest in debates, because these are events where they don’t control the narrative.” 
Holsworth added he was surprised Earle-Sears, who has trailed Spanberger in fundraising and polling so far this year, didn’t demand debates earlier in the campaign and remained silent when her running-mate, John Reid, pressed Democratic lieutenant governor nominee Ghazala Hashmi to debate. 
On Spanberger’s moves, he said she “adopted a conventional front runner strategy” by limiting the amount of debates and choosing the venues. 
By avoiding the CNN debate, she was also able to sidestep nationally focused moderators asking her about Democrats such as U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-NY, and Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for mayor of New York City — two progressive members of their party that more moderate Democrats have had to contend with. 
Both candidates have accused the other of being “too extreme” for Virginia. But on Oct. 9, they will have a chance to lay out competing visions for the state and challenge each other’s ideas. While both women have highlighted plans to strengthen Virginia’s economy, their party affiliations point to sharp differences in approach. 
The stakes this year extend beyond the governor’s race. The lieutenant governor, attorney general and all 100 seats in the House of Delegates are also on the ballot. Whether Democrats hold their majority in the legislature could determine the future of a proposed constitutional amendment to protect reproductive rights in Virginia. 
While bipartisan support has advanced measures to restore voting rights to ex-felons who’ve completed their sentences and to protect same-sex marriage, the reproductive rights amendment only cleared the legislature because Democrats are in control. If lawmakers pass it again next year, voters would decide its fate at the ballot box. 
As for which woman might become Virginia’s top executive next year, Holsworth said ultimately voters may better know them through commercials and social media than through debates — where candidates face tough questions in high-stakes settings. 
“This is increasingly the way of contemporary campaigns, and it’s not surprising that the public is frustrated with this trend,” he said.

Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks is launching a conservation project next week to protect and expand a recently discovered population of native westslope cutthroat trout in the headwaters of a Madison River tributary.
Elk Creek stretches more than a dozen miles into the foothills southwest of Gallatin Valley. In upper reaches near the creek’s headwaters, a small population of native westslope cutthroat trout population lives in a stretch of river of approximately 0.8 miles.
The project aims to restore cutthroats to roughly eight miles of stream by removing nonnative brook trout during the next year.
“This project will help ensure the survival and continued genetic diversity of native westslope cutthroat trout in this Madison River tributary,” Jenna Sirmon, FWP’s lead fisheries staff member on the Elk Creek efforts, said in a press release.
The species of trout is listed as a “species of special concern” by the state of Montana. Westslope cutthroat historically occupied more than 1,461 miles of tributary streams and rivers in the Madison River basin, according to FWP, but today there are only 22 populations in small headwater tributaries — covering just 14% of their historic range.
Westslope cutthroat have declined due to competition and hybridization with non-native fish, such as brook trout. The small population in Elk Creek has been threatened from the introduction of brook trout downstream from an FWP fishery.
According to FWP’s Westslope Cutthroat Trout Conservation Strategy for the Missouri River Headwaters of Southwest Montana, the long-term goal for WCT conservation is to restore protected conservation populations of WCT to 20% of their historic tributary distribution east of the Continental Divide.
Under the restoration project’s decision notice, released this spring, FWP personnel will remove brook trout located upstream of a constructed fish barrier using rotenone, a plant-derived fish toxin. The treatment, lasting 3-5 days, will be repeated within a year, after which environmental DNA sampling will verify whether all nonnative fish in the stream were successfully removed. If so, the isolated population of westslope cutthroat, which will be collected by fisheries staff prior to treatment, would be returned to the stream and able to occupy roughly eight miles of stream.
According to the environmental assessment of the project, rotenone inhibits oxygen transfer at the cellular level and is effective on fish due to its rapid absorption into the blood stream through the gills. The treatment is not known to pose a threat to terrestrial and avian animals that consume treated waters or dead fish.
After treatment, cutthroat in Elk Creek would be monitored during the next  five to 10 years to document their expansion in the drainage. Experience from other projects indicates that salvaged WCT released back to the stream following non-native trout removals will fill the available habitat within three to six years, according to FWP.
Downstream of the fish barrier on Elk Creek, FWP will continue to manage nonnative species, such as brook trout.
“We also recognize the value of nonnative species to anglers, and FWP will continue to manage most tributaries in the Missouri headwaters for nonnative fish for recreation opportunities,” Mike Duncan, FWP’s fisheries program manager in southwestern Montana, said in a press release.
FWP fisheries staff are scheduled to begin removing brook trout from the project area in Elk Creek the week of Aug. 25. This year’s phase of the project is expected to last about a week. An additional treatment phase of the project will happen in 2026, and subsequent stream sampling will help ensure the project’s success.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/23802588448_8b864c7ac6_k-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-18 16:57:40.921951

(Documents and text message from U.S. District Court files)  A Des Moines events disc jockey who responded to a competitor’s legal claims with a string of contentious messages saying the company’s product “sucks” is now being sued for trademark infringement.
Brian Junge of Des Moines Karaoke & DJ Service is being sued by DJ Trivia, a Georgia company, in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa.
DJ Trivia offers a variety of entertainment services, including disc jockey music, bingo, and trivia services to consumers in taverns and other venues throughout the United States. The company claims it has had a registered trademark on the terms “DJ Trivia” and “DJ Bingo” since 2017.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In 2023, an affiliate of DJ Trivia allegedly contacted Junge regarding DJ Trivia’s rights regarding the term “DJ Bingo,” asking that Junge stop using that term in connection with his business. According to exhibits and attachments to the lawsuit, Junge responded with a text message indicating he had added the word “video” to his use of the term to avoid any conflict.
Junge wrote: “Listen you stupid childish little boy. The work (sic) videos been added to shut your dumb ass up. Stupid parent company franchise from is not going to be able to enforce DJ Bingo as a trademark. That’s the dumbest bunch of s— I’ve ever heard… It’s not wise to create enemies. Why you got to start stupid s—…”
Since then, the lawsuit claims, Junge has continued to use the terms “Video DJ Trivia” and “Video DJ Bingo,” “VJ Trivia,” and “VJ Bingo,” which the Georgia company argues are “confusingly similar” to its trademarks.
On June 6, 2025, a lawyer for DJ Trivia allegedly sent Junge a formal cease-and-desist letter, objecting to his use of the terminology.
Court records include a copy of a June 8, 2025, letter that purports to be Junge’s response to the demand. The letter states in part: “Are you ignorance? we don’t sell our product as DJ trivia. it’s a VJ with a v, as in music video trivia. it’s not even close to the same product that you guys offer which sucks by the way. Go ahead and do what you think you got to do but the fact of the matter is we do not call it DJ bingo at all …  you guys aren’t even providing the same caliber of services let alone do you have a claim against what we’re doing. you are ridiculous and need to get a freaking life.”
The lawsuit alleges trademark infringement and unfair competition and seeks an award of up to three times any actual damages, as well as all of the profits realized by of Des Moines DJ & Karaoke Service through its wrongful acts, plus punitive and exemplary damages due to the Des Moines’ company’s “willful” conduct.
Junge said he had yet to see a copy of the lawsuit and added that he never received the June 6 letter that DJ Trivia claims triggered a response from Junge two days later.
He said he had only received “random” weekend text messages from someone claiming to be an attorney and objecting to the use of his terminology in advertisements and promotions.
“I thought it was a joke to be honest with you,” he said. “We never got any kind of notice or any service of any kind of documentation purporting that they supposedly had a trademark.”
Junge added that he believes the addition of the word “video” to his product names nullifies any claims of infringement. “If your trademark is ‘DJ Bingo,’ that’s not ‘VJ Bingo,’ and ‘VJ’ represents something different than ‘DJ,’” he said. “It’s not the same thing.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)In August of every year, WalletHub publishes their update of the “Best & Worst States for Women’s Equality.” Each year, when I’m asked by the media if this is a surprise, I explain that it is not as we have studied the data for many years at the Utah Women & Leadership Project. In fact, in 2021 we published an extensive analysis of Wallet’s metrics titled “ Women’s Equality in Utah: Why Utah Is Ranked as the Worst State, and What Can Be Done.
Now, for 11 years running, Utah has ranked as the worst state when it comes to women’s equality. And, in WalletHub’s 2025 findings just released, we are not only ranked as the 50th of 50 states yet again, but there is a substantial gap between us the next worst state, Texas, with Idaho, Arkansa, and Louisiana  near the bottom too, but with about 12 points or more (of 100) more than Utah.
As I walk you through the results, it is important to note that the data sources WalletHub uses—for example, the U.S. Census Bureau, Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, CDC—are typically a couple of years behind. However, I do expect that with so many organizations and individuals joining forces with A Bolder Way Forward launched in June of 2023, we’ll be making progress soon.  It is also important to note that these are specific metrics chosen by WalletHub and experts, but they do not represent the full scope of metrics that could be possible (including some positive ones).
Basically, WalletHub groups their findings into three main categories (workplace environment, education and health, and political empowerment) with 17 key indicators that are each weighted differently. With a total of 100 points, Utah had 29.85 points in 2021, 31.22 points in 2022, 19.43 points in 2023, 23.04 in 2024, and 29.93 in 2025. In 2021, we were 7.52 points behind Idaho, while in 2022 we were 12.77 points behind Georgia, and in 2023 Utah was 22.11 points behind Texas. In 2024, we were 16.71 points behind Texas, and now in 2025 we are 11.96 points behind Texas.
I was able to get more in-depth data from WalletHub than was published in their recent report.
Let me share what I found.
Workplace environment
Utah currently ranks 50th for the “Workplace Environment” category (we were 44th in 2021, 48th in 2022, 49th in 2023, and 50th in 2024 ), which is worth 40 of the 100 points. I have not included the actual points for each, but instead their rankings (1=Best State; 50=Worst State) for 2022, 2023, 2024, and now 2025.

Income Disparity: 2022=50, 2023=50, 2024=50, 2025=49
Higher-Income Disparity: 2022=49, 2023=50, 2024=50, 2025=50
Disparity in Share of Executive Positions: 2022=46, 2023=48, 2024=48, 2025=47
Disparity in Share of Minimum-Wage Workers: 2022=1, 2023=1, 2024=1, 2025=1
Unemployment-Rate Disparity: 2022=1, 2023=34; 2024=43, 2025=49
Entrepreneurship-Rate Disparity: 2022=43, 2023=49, 2024=34, 2025=41
Disparity in Average Number of Work Hours: 2022=50, 2023=50, 2024=50, 2025=50
Job Security Disparity: 2022=29, 2023=1, 2024=50, 2025=1
Economic Security Disparity: 2022=3, 2023=3, 2024=3, 2025=3
Disparity in Poverty Rate: 2022=6, 2023=4, 2024=5, 2025=3

The most concerning areas for me include income disparity (gender pay gap), higher-income disparity, and executive position disparity. It is important to remember that our rankings go down when other states make progress.
Education and health
Utah ranks 50th in “Education & Health” (40 points), which was where we were ranked for many years. This category is the sum of the following three key indicators.

Disparity in Advanced Educational Attainment: 2022=50, 2023=50, 2024=50, 2025=50

Disparity in Doctor-Visit Affordability: 2022=33, 2023=45, 2024=37, 2025=41

Although I’m concerned about all of these, I am hoping the progress seen in the disparity in math test scores in 8th grade is not just a blip. This still means, however, that girls are significantly lower (when compared to boys) on math scores, particularly when compared to other states.
Political empowerment
And finally, Utah now ranks 28th on the “Political Empowerment” category (20 points), which I was expecting because of a few increases. We were 42nd in 2022, 49th in 2023, and 41st in 2024):

Disparity in Share of Lawmakers in the U.S. Senate: 2022=21, 2023=22, 2024=22, 2025=22 (all states with no women are ranked at 22)
Disparity in Share of Lawmakers in U.S. House of Representatives: 2022=37, 2023=37, 2024=23, 2025=23 (this increased last year with Celeste Malloy in office; all states with no women are ranked at 37 last year at least)
Disparity in Share of Lawmakers in State Legislature: 2022=37, 2023=40, 2024=39, 2025=32
Disparity in Share of State-Elected Executives: 2022=30; 2023=36, 2024=38, 2025=15 (in 2025, Tina Cannon as now serving as state auditor, along with Deidre Henderson as lieutent governor)

Research continues to show that women in political office are more likely to advocate for public policies around education, health, poverty, and family issues. As I’ve said many times, things change when there are more equal percentages of men and women serving in elected office at all levels.
Understanding where we are in a variety of metrics and ranking is the key to targeted, strategic improvements. Although rankings are not the end-all and don’t highlight some of the positive things women in Utah achieve, they are aligned with the extensive research on girls and women conducted and tracked by the Utah Women & Leadership Project and our partners. Importantly, improving things for girls and women doesn’t mean that we are lifting them at the expense of boys and men—that is the scarcity mentality. We believe that there is enough for everyone through cooperation and collaboration, which is the abundance mentality. We welcome all Utahns to be involved in changing things in Utah girls, women, and families!",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/012624_Senate_03-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-18 16:57:40.921951

(Photo by Nancy Lavin/Rhode Island Current)Violent crime victims and their families across the country stand to lose more than $1 billion in direct compensation and support services under federal directives that illegally condition state grants on compliance with unrelated immigration policies.
So argued 21 Democratic state attorneys general, including Rhode Island’s Peter Neronha, in a new lawsuit filed in Rhode Island federal court on Monday. The complaint seeks to stop the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi from withholding statutory federal funds under the Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) to states whose officials refuse to comply with federal civil immigration enforcement.
Rhode Island is among more than dozen states facing threats from the Trump administration for alleged “sanctuary” policies. Bondi in an Aug. 13 letter to Gov. Dan McKee demanded the state get rid of its policies that “thwart federal immigration enforcement, warning of criminal charges and yanking federal funding if state officials refuse to comply.
McKee and Neronha have previously rebuffed the “sanctuary” label, pointing to a 2014 federal judge’s ruling as the determinant of state immigration policies.
“This case isn’t about a lack of cooperation with the federal government when it comes to law enforcement,” Neronha said in a virtual press conference on Monday. Instead, he argued that the federal administration’s “trumped up” request for states to carry out civil immigration policies — finding and detaining undocumented immigrants who have not committed crimes — was beyond the scope of what local public safety agencies can, or should, do.
Attorneys General Matthew Platkin of New Jersey, Kathy Jennings of Delaware, Rob Bonta of California, and Kwame Raoul of Illinois, also participated in the Zoom call with reporters Monday as co-lead plaintiffs on the case.
“We need our state police and our local police investigating violent and other crime,” Neronha said. “That’s their job, that’s what they are trained to do, that’s what we need them to do.”
 42,000 RI crime victims compensated in FY24

But that logic has not swayed the federal administration, which is threatening to pull funding for victims of gun violence, sexual assault, armed robberies and other violent crimes to pay for lawyers, shelter, funeral and burial services and counseling and other recovery supports. For federal fiscal year 2024, Rhode Island received nearly $3.3 million in federal VOCA funds helping nearly 42,000 violent crime victims and their families with direct compensation and support services through partner nonprofits.
It’s the first time in the federal law’s 41-year history that Rhode Island and other states might not get the congressionally appropriated money, based on a population-driven formula.
Bondi put states on notice in February, warning broadly about cuts to federal funding for states that failed to comply with federal immigration policies.
The threat solidified last month, when the DOJ’s Office for Victims of Crime issued its annual notice alerting states of the window to apply for formula-driven and competitive grants to help violent crime victims. The July 21 memo explicitly stated that states that obstruct or don’t help federal immigration agents find, arrest and detain undocumented immigrants will not receive funding.
If the DOJ follows through on this threat, it would cut off nearly $1.4 billion to states in federal fiscal 2025, in turn hurting victims of crimes, and their families, according to the AGs lawsuit.
“In short, lapses in grant funding, even if temporary, would result in the sudden and massive disruption of state victim services programs that have historically been supported by USDOJ grant funds,” the complaint states. “Among other things, this could result in unsafe conditions for victims and their families. Furthermore, this loss in VOCA funding and curtailment of victim support services would likely impact victims’ willingness to cooperate with law enforcement and adversely impact law enforcement efforts throughout the State.”
The legal arguments echo the 32 federal lawsuits Neronha’s office has led or joined since Trump took office, focused on Constitutional violations of separation of powers and spending. Despite the flurry of legal challenges Democratic attorneys general have not lost vigor and passion — touting their wins during the press conference in securing preliminary and long-term blocks to federal actions on everything from research grants to education funding.
The complaint also references a separate lawsuit filed by 17 state-level coalitions that help domestic violence and sexual assault survivors. Earlier this month, Rhode Island Senior District Judge William. E. Smith temporarily blocked the federal government from withholding Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) grants based on directives around gender ideology and diversity initiatives. The 1994 federal law offers formula-driven funds for sexual assault and domestic violence victims, two subgroups of violent crime victims helped by the Victims of Crime Act, which preceded it by a decade.
The latter also addresses victims and families of gun violence, elder abuse, stalking and harassment and childhood abuse and neglect, among other types of violent crimes. Since 2011, the federal fund has also paid nearly $15 billion to more than 65,600 claimants who were hurt, became sick or died from the Sept. 11 attacks. 
 ‘The most heinous acts’

“This administration is holding hostage over $1 billion directly to support some of the most heinous acts anyone will ever do,” Platkin of New Jersey said during the virtual press conference. Platkin later declared the Trump administration “the most anti-public safety administration” in modern history.
Neronha echoed Platkin’s outrage.
“This Administration is hanging Americans out to dry; in this case American victims who are attempting to pick up the pieces of their lives, bury their family members, and see to it that criminals responsible for hurting them and their loved ones are held accountable,” Neronha said. “In this country, above all else, we expect our government to protect us, and this latest move flies in the face of that expectation.”
The lawsuit asks a federal judge to force the DOJ to remove the strings attached to its federal crime victim funding, and permanently prevent the federal administration from imposing any conditions later.
The clock is ticking, with an Aug. 20 deadline for states to submit their final applications for federal grants. Awards are expected to be announced by Sept. 30.
“If USDOJ refuses to award funds to Plaintiff States that do not comply with the Immigration Enforcement Conditions, the window for Plaintiffs to have secured FY 2025 VOCA funding will have passed,” the complaint states. “As a result, even if Plaintiffs ultimately prevail in having the Conditions vacated and declared unlawful, critical programs for victims and survivors that have long been supported by USDOJ grants will be irreparably disrupted.
In addition to formula-driven awards, states can also seek additional, competitive grants. Rhode Island, for example, intends to apply for a technology grant to enhance its VOICE (Victims Outreach Integrated Community Environment) online portal, which streamlines information about court cases, offenders and other information necessary for crime victims, their advocates, and state agencies, according to the complaint. Neronha’s office began developing the portal in fiscal year 2020, though the rollout was delayed to fiscal 2022 because of the pandemic.
Natalie Baldassarre, a spokesperson for the Justice Department, declined to comment. The lawsuit also names Maureen Henneberg, acting assistant attorney general for the U.S. Office of Justice programs, and Katherine Darke Schmitt, acting director of the Office for Victims of Crime, as defendants.
Other state AGs that joined represent Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia.

Dan McKee has one day left to answer U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi’s demands that Rhode Island eliminate all policies that stand in the way of the Trump administration’s immigration agenda or else potentially lose federal funding because of its status as a “sanctuary jurisdiction.”
“You are hereby notified that your jurisdiction has been identified as one that engages in sanctuary policies and practices that thwart federal immigration enforcement to the detriment of the interests of the United States,” Bondi wrote in an Aug. 13 letter to the governor. “This ends now.”
The letter to McKee, first reported by WPRI-12 Friday, was sent a little over a week after the U.S. Department of Justice published a list identifying 19 cities, four counties and 12 states as engaging in “sanctuary policies and practices.”
Bondi’s letter gives McKee until Tuesday to issue a response that confirms its “commitment to complying with federal law,” but the governor has no plans to do so.
“This generic, non-specific form letter lacks any meaningful detail and does not merit a response,” McKee said in a statement.
McKee’s decision to stand firm against the Trump administration’s immigration policy was lauded by the head of the state’s chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).
“The DOJ letter is really just a hamhanded attempt to intimidate jurisdictions that are refusing to march in step with the Trump administration’s really cruel deportation machine,” Steven Brown, executive director of the ACLU of Rhode Island, said in an interview Monday.
That list was part of an executive order issued by President Donald Trump April 28 mandating federal officials identify and publicly highlight jurisdictions that “refuse to cooperate with federal immigration authorities.”
Rhode Island, as well as the cities of Providence and Central Falls, was included on another, much longer sanctuary jurisdiction list shared by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in May. It was later taken down after some counties and the National Sheriffs’ Association disagreed with their inclusion.
Providence and Central Falls were not included on the DOJ’s new list. A department spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment on why the two municipalities were not included.
According to the Justice Department’s letter, Rhode Island’s designation as a “sanctuary jurisdiction” is based on a review of the state’s laws, policies, and practices. The department’s website further outlines the characteristics of this designation, including: public declarations of sanctuary status; local laws or rules limiting cooperation with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE); and restrictions on information about “immigration status of detainees with federal authorities,” among others.
Rhode Island Current reached out to the DOJ for specific details and received a referral back to the department’s website. 
Brown suggested limits on ICE detainers, which Rhode Island only allows for no more than 48 hours under a 2014 federal court order, as one possible reason.
“That order found that acting otherwise would violate the Constitution,” Brown said. “They’re complaining that Rhode Island is complying with the Fourth Amendment.”
But Bondi wrote that sanctuary jurisdictions give “aliens cover to perpetrate crimes in our communities and evade the immigration consequences that federal law requires.” She added that officials who continue to obstruct the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement efforts may be subject to criminal charges.
It’s a challenge Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha, who was copied on the Aug. 13 letter, welcomed.
“The only way to deal with a bully is to let them know that they’re not going to intimidate you,” Neronha said in a statement. “If the Trump Administration takes issue with this, then the doors of federal court are open to them. Until that point, my focus is elsewhere.”

(File photo by Getty Images)Federal funding for electric vehicle chargers is back.
States have until Sept. 10 to resubmit plans for spending their share of federal money set aside by Congress during the Biden administration to put more fast-charging stations along the interstate system for electric vehicles. South Carolina’s designated share of the $5 billion total is nearly $70 million.
The state Department of Transportation is revising its plan and will meet next month’s deadline, spokeswoman Hannah Robinson told the SC Daily Gazette.
In a state that’s lured billions of dollars’ worth of investment from electric vehicle manufacturers, the availability of electric vehicle charging stations lags most of the country.
In February, after President Donald Trump took office, the Federal Highway Administration stopped sending out dollars for the effort known as the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program.
The highway agency allowed states to keep money for any charging station sites already under contract for construction. But the agency halted all funds not designated for a project with an eye toward clawing back the money and ending the program altogether.
At the time, South Carolina was still drafting documents and had yet to solicit bids, award contracts or spend any money on chargers.
Twenty states, the District of Columbia and half a dozen environmental groups sued the Trump administration over the paused funding. The money remained on ice until a federal judge, in June, ordered the freeze be lifted.
Last week, the highway agency sent notices out to states, letting them know they could reapply.
‘Do it right’
In a statement, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy criticized the Biden administration for its slow rollout of the program. Both NEVI and its sister program, the $2.5 billion Charging and Fueling Infrastructure grant, were plagued by delays.
Though the Biden administration had approved states’ plans, many had spent just a fraction of their funds.
“If Congress is requiring the federal government to support charging stations, let’s cut the waste and do it right,” Duffy said in a statement. “While I don’t agree with subsidizing green energy, we will respect Congress’ will and make sure this program uses federal resources efficiently.”
There are 87 NEVI-funded stations open across 16 states, according to an online dashboard maintained by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials and the National Association of State Energy Officials. States have awarded contracts on more than 200 stations that have yet to be built. Contracts for 160 other stations were paused.
Duffy, in his statement, went on to say the highway agency’s new guidance “slashes red tape and makes it easier for states to efficiently build out this infrastructure.”
What changed
The original program required charging stations to be located every 50 miles along corridors. The new guidance did away with that distance requirement, leaving it up to states to decide.
In line with the Trump administration’s pushback on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts, the highway agency also erased language around soliciting “diverse” feedback, including from rural and underserved communities, and ensuring an “equitable” distribution of chargers. It also cut requirements that 40% of funds pay for projects benefiting disadvantaged communities.
Gone also are requirements that states give added consideration to small, minority and woman-owned contractors.
And the agency no longer suggests states consider renewable energy sources to power the stations, which can charge up to four vehicles at the same time.
States can simply resubmit their same plans for reapproval. The highway agency just won’t take the removed standards into consideration when evaluating it.
Similar to the Biden administration’s original rules, once states have a reliable fleet of fast chargers along its designated interstates, they can spend any leftover funding on installing chargers along state and local roads.
SC lags behind
South Carolina remains 31st in the nation and next to last in the Southeast when it comes to the number of fast chargers per capita, according to the most recent report issued by the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy.
The state also trails in the number of electric vehicles sold.
South Carolina has about 1,640 public charging ports at just over 600 locations, according to the U.S. Joint Office of Energy and Transportation, compared to 10,500 in Florida, 5,435 in Georgia and 4,575 in North Carolina.
In the Southeast, only Alabama has fewer ports — 1,043.
It’s unclear how many charging stations South Carolina could add with the money.
Georgia has spent about $180,000 per charging port, awarding contracts for 20 stations, according to the online database. Alabama expects to add 60 charging stations with the federal grant, while North Carolina plans to add 40. Both states expect to spend about $150,000 per port.
Other federal funding
While the funding for electric vehicle chargers is restored, other climate change-related federal grant money remains out of reach.
Last year, South Carolina’s Office of Resilience won a $124 million Environmental Protection Agency grant for solar programs to help low-income communities. That funding was part of $7 billion awarded nationwide for the so-called Solar for All component of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.
The state had planned to spend the money in four ways:

Money for low-income families that wanted to pool their resources and install off-site solar panels to power multiple homes
Money for low-income households to make their homes more energy efficient and save on their monthly power bill, building on programs already offered by utility companies in the state
Workforce development programs to train more people to work in the solar industry
An innovation fund that affordable housing builders could tap to add solar power to their developments, giving tenants access to low-cost energy

The state Office of Resilience was still in its first year of planning when the funding was pulled, so the agency had yet to work out any further details.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/electric-car-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-08-18 15:57:23.171365

(Photo courtesy of Express Scripts press materials)West Virginia Attorney General J.B. McCuskey announced Monday that the state is following the lead of several other states in suing pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts for its role in exacerbating the ongoing drug and overdose epidemic.
McCuskey said Express Scripts, now known as Evernorth Health, ignored widely known information showing the danger of opioid abuse in order to “prioritize profits over compliance and public safety.” 
In doing so, according to the lawsuit, Express Scripts “violated its legal duties under West Virginia law, contributing directly to the oversupply of opioids and the deepening of opioid use disorder across the state.”
McCuskey first announced the new suit in an interview with MetroNews Talkline, then again in a news conference Monday morning.
The state’s suit is at least the fourth to be filed nationally against Express Scripts for what state attorneys general are alleging is its role in fueling the nation’s drug epidemic. 
Kentucky filed a similar suit last September, Utah did so in December and Michigan filed suit against the company and its subsidiaries in April. 
In the West Virginia suit, attorneys wrote that Express Scripts’ — in its role as a pharmacy benefit manager — held a “uniquely powerful position” within the “prescription drug ecosystem.”
Pharmacy benefit managers often act as intermediaries between insurance providers, drug manufacturers and pharmacies, negotiating discounts and rebates with manufacturers and reimbursing pharmacies for the prescriptions they fill on behalf of the insurance company.
This specific positioning, McCuskey said, made Express Scripts a “central architect” for the opioid epidemic while it ignored data readily available about the harms of widespread prescribing and use of addictive opioids.
“The opioid crisis is a direct result of greed and evil. Opioid manufacturers have been held accountable, now it’s time for others who illegally profited behind the scenes to pay the price,” McCuskey said. “[Pharmacy benefit managers], like Express Scripts … had every tool at their disposal to alert them to how addictive and destructive opioids are. Instead, for decades they ignored their own data, broke state and federal laws and put profits over people’s lives.”
Specifically, according to the lawsuit, Express Scripts violated West Virginia state law by:

Conspiring with opioid manufacturers to “deceptively market” opioids to the public, leading to misconceptions about their safety and the risk of addiction.
Incentivizing increased sale and prescription of opioids through using “substantial rebates and fees,” which “undermine[d] clinical judgement.”
“Eliminating and weakening” certain protocols meant to prevent the overprescription of pills, like prior authorizations and quantity limits on the amount of opioids prescribed.
Ignoring “overwhelming” data — from both inside and outside the company — showing evidence of the widespread risk of opioid abuse tied to overprescription of the drugs.
Dispensing opioids through “mail-order pharmacies,” which lacked “adequate controls or oversight” to prevent overprescription.

Though Express Scripts is a different kind of entity than an opioid manufacturer or distributor, the points laid out in West Virginia’s suit alleging its role in fueling the opioid epidemic are akin to those made in similar cases.
The suit says that while the company now “points to remedial measures” it took that were adopted “under public scrutiny” due to the devastation of the opioid epidemic, those measures aren’t enough to make up for the harm done.
“[Express Scripts] prioritized profit over compliance, safety and the health interests of the state,” the suit reads. “Rather than using its data analytics capabilities to identify and mitigate the harms of excessive opioid distribution, Express Scripts sold these services to opioid manufacturers, enabling the manufacturers to refine their false, deceptive and misleading marketing strategies to increase opioid sales within [West Virginia].”
McCuskey, talking to MetroNews on Monday, said the goal of the suit is to attempt to recoup at least some of the financial loss West Virginia experienced due to the epidemic. Complicating the manner, McCuskey continued, is that the price paid by West Virginians is much more than just financial.
“Ultimately, what we’re asking for is money. And you know, in this world, accountability is achieved through financial transactions, and the amount of damage that has been done to the people of West Virginia isn’t monetizable,” McCuskey said. “… This is generational damage that not only cost the state outrageous amounts of money, but cost us so much more in ways that are very, very difficult to quantify.”

(Screenshot from Iowa PBS livestream)Iowa Rep. J.D. Scholten ended his campaign for U.S. Senate Monday, endorsing his Iowa House colleague Rep. Josh Turek to become the Democratic nominee in 2026.
Scholten, a Sioux City Democrat, entered the race in June after U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst had responded at a town hall to critics of Medicaid cuts included in the GOP budget reconciliation law with “well, we are all going to die.” In a statement Monday, Scholten said he believed the conversation on Medicaid cuts included in the “big, beautiful” law would be crucial in 2026.
“There are still so many issues facing Iowans today but we can’t sit by while healthcare is ripped from millions of Americans,” Scholten said. “And there is no better Democrat in Iowa to talk about healthcare issues than my friend: State Rep. Josh Turek.”
Turek, a Democrat from Council Bluffs, launched his campaign on Tuesday. The two-time Paralympic gold medalist said his family relied on public assistance programs like Medicaid, as well as Iowa’s Area Education Agencies and free summer lunch program as he was growing up, having gone through 21 surgeries by age 12 for spina bifida.
Scholten, a professional baseball pitcher for the minor league Sioux City Explorers, said he and Turek share many similarities as athletes representing western Iowa at the Statehouse.
“From the very beginning, I thought a prairie populist athlete from Western Iowa would be the best candidate to win in the General election,” Scholten said in a statement. “I still do, but instead of me, I have complete confidence that Josh Turek can take this on. That’s why I am suspending my campaign and endorsing him. As his friend, I’m proud to support him.”
Turek said he was “honored” to have Scholten’s support in the race.
“Over the last several years, J.D. and I have fought alongside one another in the state legislature to lower costs for Iowa’s families, to make health care more affordable and accessible, to make housing more affordable, and to make life a little bit easier and a little bit better for Iowa’s families,” Turek said. “We have an incredible opportunity to beat Joni Ernst in 2026, and I’m proud to join forces with J.D.”
Ernst has not officially said if she plans to run for reelection in 2026, though she has told reporters an announcement would be “coming soon.” She also told a GOP audience last week that Democrats can “bring it on” in the 2026 election.
Though Scholten is no longer in the race, there is still a large field of Democrats competing to become the nominee. Iowa Sen. Zach Wahls, D-Coralville, Des Moines School Board Chair Jackie Norris and Nathan Sage, former Knoxville Chamber of Commerce director, are running for the seat, alongside Turek. Two Republicans, Jim Carlin, a former state lawmaker and Joshua Smith, who has run as a Libertarian candidate in previous elections, are also campaigning for the GOP nomination.
Turek and Scholten will hold an event in Council Bluffs Monday evening.

Photograph by John Partipilo/  Tennessee Lookout ©2025NASHVILLE — U.S. Agriculture officials announced a new initiative Monday to stop subsidies for solar energy panels that take up farmland while supporting cuts in agriculture grants to Tennessee universities.
Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins introduced the initiative by the Trump administration after a Future Farmers of America breakfast at the State Fairgrounds in Lebanon where she said the federal government will make new grants to bolster Tennessee farming while targeting grants that don’t help farmers’ production.
Rollins criticized the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act and “market distorting incentives” for solar panels, which she said are eliminating Tennessee farmland.
The secretary made the statements even though a study by the nonpartisan Tennessee Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations found that solar facilities aren’t likely to be the “primary driver” of development on farmland for decades. The study also determined that land can be returned to farming once a solar facility goes out of use.

Earlier this year, the federal government made dramatic cuts to higher education grants, including eliminating more than $31 million in funding to the University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture, which houses agricultural research and resources for Tennessee farmers and communities in 95 counties.
Rollins defended the reductions, saying “Those cuts were being made in programs that did not align with the president’s vision of putting farmers first.”
Deputy Secretary Stephen Vaden of Tennessee described the reduction as a “repurposing” and said changes were made in research funding based on whether a grant “helps a farmer in the field make more money.” Projects aimed at “clean energy” or based on “racial criteria” were eliminated, he said.
In addition to stopping solar panel development on farmland, Rollins announced that nearly $89 million will go toward 13 rural development projects in 28 Tennessee counties to “promote partnerships” and infrastructure investments for rural education. The department has distributed nearly $100 million this year to more than 10,000 farmers through the Emergency Commodity Assistance Program, according to Rollins.
Some farmers have said they expect prices to increase because of President Donald Trump’s tariffs, which are forcing them to pass on higher rates to customers. Rollins said Monday the administration has signed eight new trade agreements expected to boost the nation’s economy.

“It has changed for the worse,” said one attendee at recent memorials for the late Gov. Tom Salmon and a top aide to Democratic successors Madeleine Kunin and Howard Dean.

When the children of the late Vermont Gov. Tom Salmon thought about scheduling a remembrance for their father after the 92-year-old died in January, all knew why they had to wait until August.
Salmon was a Rockingham lawyer in the summer of 1972 when, seeing Democrats without a gubernatorial candidate, he announced a last-minute, long-shot bid on the afternoon of the Aug. 2 filing deadline.
“I run at a time when the public’s confidence in its governmental leaders, at many levels, is at an all-time low, when there is a deep feeling among all segments of the people that things aren’t working,” Salmon said in a speech quoted by state newspapers just starting to print stories about the Watergate scandal. “I run to give our people a choice between the policies of the past and the promise of the future.”
Three months later, Salmon miraculously beat favored Republican businessman Luther “Fred” Hackett in what the Burlington Free Press, then the state’s largest newspaper, deemed “the biggest political upset in Vermont history.”
“We celebrate not a victory of party but a victory for the indomitable and independent people of the state of Vermont,” Salmon told reporters on that Nov. 7, 1972, election night. “Democracy is alive and well.”
A half-century later, family and friends gathered Saturday to remember that past “promise of the future” amid a nationally turbulent present.
“It’s a bit of a rough patch right now — the issues have become more complex and more partisan,” said state Treasurer Mike Pieciak, a 42-year-old who first met Salmon shortly after serving as a student legislative page. “It has become meaner and focused on how are you going to beat the other side.”

The event was one of two recent memorials that featured a Who’s Who of colleagues of the late governor and his two Democratic successors, Madeleine Kunin and Howard Dean.
Salmon’s funeral at Bellows Falls’ St. Charles Parish and follow-up reception at the local country club drew people of all ages and political stripes. They included current Republican Gov. Phil Scott, who ordered the lowering of flags over the weekend in honor of his predecessor, who served from 1973 to 1977.
“Governor Salmon led Vermont through some of our nation’s most difficult times, doing his best to stabilize our economy and strengthen trust of government,” Scott said in a statement. “His efforts on behalf of Vermont are worthy of our gratitude, remembrance and respect.”
In July, dozens more gathered at the Upper Valley’s Hanover Inn to honor the late Kathy Hoyt, an 83-year-old Norwich resident who died in March after a Vermont political career that spanned three gubernatorial administrations.
“She believed in government,” Hoyt’s son Michael said in a speech. “She believed in a society that helps people and works for them, that allows them to achieve their potential.”
Attendees noted a slew of recent headlines about federal cuts to everything from Vermont food assistance to flood mitigation. In contrast, they recalled when state news once centered on Salmon’s work to protect the environment (such as his land gains tax to control subdivisions), Kunin’s efforts to boost education (ensuring all students access to kindergarten) and Dean’s push to expand health care (starting with the Dr. Dynasaur program for children).

Hoyt worked as planning director for the Vermont Agency of Human Services under Salmon, then served as Kunin’s chief of staff after the state’s first, and so far only, female governor won election in 1984.
“It was an exciting time,” Kunin said in a speech. “Women were coming into their own. We were on sort of an adventure, not knowing exactly where it would lead.”
Kunin stepped down in January 1991, only for her successor, Republican Richard Snelling, to die of cardiac arrest that August. Dean, then lieutenant governor, was no sooner sworn in as Snelling’s replacement when he asked Hoyt to serve as his chief of staff and, later, the first female secretary of administration until his departure in 2002.
“The thing that amazed me about Kathy was her integrity and her willingness to always try to do the right thing,” Dean said in a speech, “including a few times when she had to convince me to do the right thing when I was not inclined to do so.”
Attendees at both memorials said such motivation was often lacking today.
“I think in a lot of ways it has changed for the worse,” said Pieciak, noting he was talking more about the national scene. “It’s much more about personal ego, wealth, success, attention, and not about the people. I wonder if I was 10 years younger, would I ever have gotten into politics? Does the politics that I became interested in still exist?”
Pieciak added of speculation about a future run for governor: “It’s too early to talk.”
Kunin voiced similar concerns about the changing tenor.
“In those days, public administration and public action were applauded and revered,” she said. “We live in a time now where the best and the brightest might not serve because you’re demonized if you take that step.”
Attendees at both memorials questioned the best way to respond. Michael Hoyt shared what he thought his mother would say: “She’d tell you, ‘Don’t despair, don’t give up.’ She’d say, ‘It’s always darkest before the dawn.’”
Kunin, set to celebrate her 92nd birthday in September, offered her own answer when asked, “How are you?”
“I’m here,” she said. “You have to hang in there.”

Conservative judges might allow lawmakers to reinstate the practice of conversion therapy, which aims to change the sexual orientation or gender identity of LGBTQ+ people. (Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)Week after week, a teenage Brandon Long sat through counseling sessions that he said framed his identity as a failure.
Now an ordained minister in northern Kentucky, Long told Kentucky state lawmakers about the years he spent undergoing therapy designed to rid him of his “same-sex attraction.”
“Just imagine yourself being told, session after session, that if you remained as you were, you would be rejected,” he said.
Long testified in February before a Kentucky House committee against a Republican-sponsored bill that would cancel Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s 2024 executive order that banned a controversial practice known as “conversion therapy” for minors.
Conversion therapy is a catchall term for controversial efforts to change the sexual orientation or gender identity of LGBTQ+ people. Sometimes called “reparative therapy,” it can range from talk therapy and religious counseling to electrical shocks, pain-inducing aversion therapy and physical isolation.
The bill, Long told lawmakers, “creates a legal shield for conversion therapy, allowing parents to force their children into a practice condemned by every major medical and mental health organization worldwide.”
Kentucky’s Republican-controlled legislature passed the bill, then overrode the governor’s veto in March.
Conversion therapy has been denounced by major medical organizations including the American Medical Association, American Psychological Association, American Psychiatric Association and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. They say it’s ineffective and harmful and puts LGBTQ+ people at risk for depression, substance use, suicide and other mental health issues.
More than half of states have banned or restricted the practice for underage patients since California became the first to do so in 2012, according to the Movement Advancement Project, a nonprofit research organization that tracks LGBTQ+-related laws and policies.
But political currents are shifting. Conservative majorities in the courts, in state legislatures and at the federal level have reshaped the legal landscape, opening the door for Republican lawmakers and conservative Christian groups to reinstate a practice that has been roundly discredited by the medical community.

In March, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear a case challenging Colorado’s 2019 conversion therapy ban on freedom of speech grounds. The decision marks a change from 2017, when the court refused to hear a challenge to California’s ban, and 2023, when it declined to hear a challenge to Washington’s ban.
The high court’s decision, which isn’t expected until next year, could reverse — or solidify — conversion therapy bans across the country.
Last month, a Virginia court partially struck down the state’s 2020 law banning conversion therapy for minors, a win for conservative Christian organizations. GOP lawmakers in Michigan have introduced a bill to repeal the state’s ban. And Missouri‘s Republican attorney general has filed suit to overturn local conversion therapy bans.
On the flip side, in Wisconsin, the state Supreme Court cleared the way earlier this year for the state to permanently ban the practice.
‘The world has changed’
While organized attempts to “cure” homosexuality have been around for centuries, “ex-gay” groups that promised to change a person’s sexual orientation began gaining ground in the 1990s as policy debates arose over same-sex marriage and gay people serving in the military, said Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst in private practice in New York City. He is also a clinical professor of psychiatry at Columbia University whose research has focused on gender and sexuality.
But after Massachusetts legalized same-sex marriage in 2004 and more states followed, the influence of conversion therapy proponents waned.
As of this year, 23 states and Washington, D.C., prevent licensed health care providers from subjecting minors to conversion therapy, according to an analysis of state laws by the Movement Advancement Project. Four more states restrict the practice, such as by not allowing public funding to go toward conversion therapy services.

State laws typically levy fines or discipline the professional licenses of practitioners who try to engage minors in conversion therapy. They don’t necessarily prevent clergy or unlicensed counselors from attempting such counseling.
The bans are more of a public statement of acceptance of LGBTQ+ people, rather than a commonly used preventive measure, said Drescher.
“The bans are reinforcements of the belief that if homosexuality is not a mental disorder or disease, there’s no reason to pretend you can treat it, and anybody who tries is acting outside the mainstream of science,” Drescher told Stateline.
The American Medical Association has written model legislation for state lawmakers who want to ban conversion therapy, a reflection of the broad consensus in the medical community that homosexuality and gender nonconformity are not mental illnesses, said R.J. Mills, a representative from the American Medical Association, in a statement to Stateline.
In the past, some leading psychiatric and psychological associations were hesitant to support state restrictions because they saw the laws as intrusions into the doctor-patient or therapist-patient relationship, Drescher said.










Everybody understands what’s at stake now.


– Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst in New York City whose research focuses on gender and sexuality


Now, spurred by Trump administration policies that place new restrictions on LGBTQ+ people and the most conservative U.S. Supreme Court in generations, medical organizations are growing more vocal in their opposition to conversion therapy.
“The world has changed,” Drescher said. “Everybody understands what’s at stake now.”
Free speech argument
Conservative legal firms have filed lawsuits in states such as Colorado, Michigan and Virginia on behalf of Christian counselors who say the laws prevent them from practicing according to their faith-based values. They say the bans should be repealed so practitioners won’t face losing their careers over providing services informed by their faith.
A Virginia court last month oversaw a consent decree in which Virginia agreed to not fully enforce its 2020 conversion therapy ban and to allow counselors to engage in talk conversion therapy with minors. The plaintiffs in the case were John and Janet Raymond, state-licensed professional counselors in Virginia who were represented by the Founding Freedoms Law Center, an organization that takes on conservative legal causes.
The kind of talk therapy now allowed can involve conversation, prayer and sharing of written materials such as religious scriptures, said Josh Hetzler, the Raymonds’ attorney, during a public news conference following the court decision.
“With this court order, every counselor in Virginia will now be able to speak freely, truthfully and candidly with clients who are seeking to have those critical conversations about their identity, and to hear faith-based insights from trusted professionals,” he said.
Conservative legislators also are citing their Christian faith in their attempts to roll back state bans.
Michigan state Rep. Josh Schriver, a Republican, filed a package of bills last month aimed at repealing a handful of what he calls “anti-Christ laws,” including Michigan’s 2023 ban on conversion therapy for youth.

A legislative aide said Schriver wasn’t available for an interview, and instead referred Stateline to the recent Substack post he emailed to his constituents.
“As legislators, we’re duty-bound to remove statutes that overstep the authority given by our state and federal Constitutions,” Schriver said in the post.
Long, the Kentucky minister, said the bans are needed because “no one enters conversion therapy willingly.”
“The only reason a child would go through it is because a trusted authority in their life — a parent, a pastor or a therapist — has told them that they are broken and need to be fixed.”
At least five states have a law or policy prohibiting or deterring local-level ordinances that aim to protect youth from conversion therapy.
Some states without such laws are going after municipalities that have banned conversion therapy.
Missouri Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey in February sued Jackson County, Missouri, home to Kansas City, challenging the county’s 2023 ordinance and Kansas City’s 2019 ordinance, both of which ban licensed counselors from engaging in conversion therapy with minors.
“Our children have a right to therapy that allows for honest, unrestricted conversations, free from transgender indoctrination,” Bailey said in a statement in February. He called the ordinances “a dangerous overreach” that violate free speech and religious liberty rights.
A Republican loss
In at least one state, conservatives have hit a legal roadblock.
In Wisconsin, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ administration has been trying since 2020 to enact a statewide conversion therapy ban proposed by the state agency that oversees provider licensing.
But the ban has been blocked twice by a Republican-controlled legislative committee.
Evers’ administration sued.
The Wisconsin Supreme Court sided with Evers last month, ruling that the state legislative committee was overreaching and couldn’t block the rule.

(Photo by Nancy Lavin/Rhode Island Current)This story first appeared in the Rhode Island Current.
Violent crime victims and their families across the country stand to lose more than $1 billion in direct compensation and support services under federal directives that illegally condition state grants on compliance with unrelated immigration policies.
So argued 21 Democratic state attorneys general, including Rhode Island’s Peter Neronha, in a new lawsuit filed in Rhode Island federal court on Monday. The complaint seeks to stop the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi from withholding statutory federal funds under the Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) to states whose officials refuse to comply with federal civil immigration enforcement.
Rhode Island is among more than dozen states facing threats from the Trump administration for alleged “sanctuary” policies. Bondi in an Aug. 13 letter to Gov. Dan McKee demanded the state get rid of its policies that “thwart federal immigration enforcement, warning of criminal charges and yanking federal funding if state officials refuse to comply.
McKee and Neronha have previously rebuffed the “sanctuary” label, pointing to a 2014 federal judge’s ruling as the determinant of state immigration policies.
“This case isn’t about a lack of cooperation with the federal government when it comes to law enforcement,” Neronha said in a virtual press conference on Monday. Instead, he argued that the federal administration’s “trumped up” request for states to carry out civil immigration policies — finding and detaining undocumented immigrants who have not committed crimes — was beyond the scope of what local public safety agencies can, or should, do.
Attorneys General Matthew Platkin of New Jersey, Kathy Jennings of Delaware, Rob Bonta of California, and Kwame Raoul of Illinois, also participated in the Zoom call with reporters Monday as co-lead plaintiffs on the case.
“We need our state police and our local police investigating violent and other crime,” Neronha said. “That’s their job, that’s what they are trained to do, that’s what we need them to do.”
Victims compensated
But that logic has not swayed the federal administration, which is threatening to pull funding for victims of gun violence, sexual assault, armed robberies and other violent crimes to pay for lawyers, shelter, funeral and burial services and counseling and other recovery supports. For federal fiscal year 2024, Rhode Island received nearly $3.3 million in federal VOCA funds helping nearly 42,000 violent crime victims and their families with direct compensation and support services through partner nonprofits.
It’s the first time in the federal law’s 41-year history that Rhode Island and other states might not get the congressionally appropriated money, based on a population-driven formula.
Bondi put states on notice in February, warning broadly about cuts to federal funding for states that failed to comply with federal immigration policies.
Street-level violence prevention programs have been decimated by Trump just ahead of summer

The threat solidified last month, when the DOJ’s Office for Victims of Crime issued its annual notice alerting states of the window to apply for formula-driven and competitive grants to help violent crime victims. The July 21 memo explicitly stated that states that obstruct or don’t help federal immigration agents find, arrest and detain undocumented immigrants will not receive funding.
If the DOJ follows through on this threat, it would cut off nearly $1.4 billion to states in federal fiscal 2025, in turn hurting victims of crimes, and their families, according to the AGs lawsuit.
“In short, lapses in grant funding, even if temporary, would result in the sudden and massive disruption of state victim services programs that have historically been supported by USDOJ grant funds,” the complaint states. “Among other things, this could result in unsafe conditions for victims and their families. Furthermore, this loss in VOCA funding and curtailment of victim support services would likely impact victims’ willingness to cooperate with law enforcement and adversely impact law enforcement efforts throughout the State.”
The legal arguments echo the 32 federal lawsuits Neronha’s office has led or joined since Trump took office, focused on Constitutional violations of separation of powers and spending. Despite the flurry of legal challenges Democratic attorneys general have not lost vigor and passion — touting their wins during the press conference in securing preliminary and long-term blocks to federal actions on everything from research grants to education funding.
The complaint also references a separate lawsuit filed by 17 state-level coalitions that help domestic violence and sexual assault survivors. Earlier this month, Rhode Island Senior District Judge William. E. Smith temporarily blocked the federal government from withholding Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) grants based on directives around gender ideology and diversity initiatives. The 1994 federal law offers formula-driven funds for sexual assault and domestic violence victims, two subgroups of violent crime victims helped by the Victims of Crime Act, which preceded it by a decade.
The latter also addresses victims and families of gun violence, elder abuse, stalking and harassment and childhood abuse and neglect, among other types of violent crimes. Since 2011, the federal fund has also paid nearly $15 billion to more than 65,600 claimants who were hurt, became sick or died from the Sept. 11 attacks. 
‘The most heinous acts’
“This administration is holding hostage over $1 billion directly to support some of the most heinous acts anyone will ever do,” Platkin of New Jersey said during the virtual press conference. Platkin later declared the Trump administration “the most anti-public safety administration” in modern history.
Neronha echoed Platkin’s outrage.
“This Administration is hanging Americans out to dry; in this case American victims who are attempting to pick up the pieces of their lives, bury their family members, and see to it that criminals responsible for hurting them and their loved ones are held accountable,” Neronha said. “In this country, above all else, we expect our government to protect us, and this latest move flies in the face of that expectation.”
The lawsuit asks a federal judge to force the DOJ to remove the strings attached to its federal crime victim funding, and permanently prevent the federal administration from imposing any conditions later.
The clock is ticking, with an Aug. 20 deadline for states to submit their final applications for federal grants. Awards are expected to be announced by Sept. 30.
States push to combat human trafficking amid federal funding cuts

“If USDOJ refuses to award funds to Plaintiff States that do not comply with the Immigration Enforcement Conditions, the window for Plaintiffs to have secured FY 2025 VOCA funding will have passed,” the complaint states. “As a result, even if Plaintiffs ultimately prevail in having the Conditions vacated and declared unlawful, critical programs for victims and survivors that have long been supported by USDOJ grants will be irreparably disrupted.
In addition to formula-driven awards, states can also seek additional, competitive grants. Rhode Island, for example, intends to apply for a technology grant to enhance its VOICE (Victims Outreach Integrated Community Environment) online portal, which streamlines information about court cases, offenders and other information necessary for crime victims, their advocates, and state agencies, according to the complaint. Neronha’s office began developing the portal in fiscal year 2020, though the rollout was delayed to fiscal 2022 because of the pandemic.
Natalie Baldassarre, a spokesperson for the Justice Department, declined to comment. The lawsuit also names Maureen Henneberg, acting assistant attorney general for the U.S. Office of Justice programs, and Katherine Darke Schmitt, acting director of the Office for Victims of Crime, as defendants.
Other state AGs that joined represent Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia.

It’s been six weeks now since President Donald Trump signed the so-called one big, beautiful bill act into law and as you’ve no doubt heard, the new law will soon bring massive funding cuts and policy changes to core safety net programs like Medicaid and SNAP food benefits. Meanwhile, here in North Carolina, state lawmakers have passed a so-called mini-budget that, while vastly smaller in scale and scope, will still have significant impacts on health policy.
So, what do these changes look like? Who will be impacted? What issues remain unresolved? And why are some important players in the health care system deeply concerned?

Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly on Aug. 6 asked for a disaster declaration after severe storms that included tornadoes and flash flooding from June 3 to 7. The storms damaged farms and homes, downed electric power lines, and made roads impassable in some areas.
In a letter to the president, U.S. Sens. Jerry Moran and Roger Marshall, along with Reps. Tracey Mann, Derek Schmidt, Sharice Davids and Ron Estes, said the storms left lasting effects.
“Federal support must be provided to assist our state in emergency response and restoration efforts,” the letter said.

Patrick Morrisey is sending the West Virginia National Guard to Washington, D.C., to bolster the Trump administration’s policing of the nation’s capital through a federal crackdown. 
Morrisey announced the move over the weekend, saying 300 to 400 skilled personnel would be sent to Washington along with “mission-essential equipment” to support the D.C. National Guard.
President Donald Trump has declared a “public safety emergency” in Washington, D.C.,  mobilizing the local National Guard to “take back” the capital from what he described as violent criminals. Washington’s elected officials have objected to the president’s claims about the city’s crime. 
Morrisey said he was providing the West Virginia National Guard at the request of the Trump administration. Four other Republican-led states, including Ohio, have now sent guard members to Washington, D.C. in support of the president.
“West Virginia is proud to stand with President Trump in his effort to restore pride and beauty to our nation’s capital,” Morrisey said in a news release. “The men and women of our National Guard represent the best of our state, and this mission reflects our shared commitment to a strong and secure America.” 
  Del. Josh Holstein, R-Boone
Morrisey’s office said the mission will be funded at the federal level. 
West Virginia Adjutant General Maj. Gen. Jim Seward said the National Guard is an “invaluable partner in the important undertaking” of addressing crime in the nation’s capital. 
Josh Holstein, chair of the West Virginia Republican Party, said Morrisey “made the right call” by sending guard troops to Washington, D.C.
“West Virginians overwhelmingly support President Trump and are proud of his effort to restore law and order to our nation’s capital,” Holstein said. “This modest deployment will not diminish important work in our state, but when our neighbors need help, West Virginia is always willing to step up.” 
  Del. Mike Pushkin, D-Kanawha
State Democratic Party Chair Mike Pushkin said the move was “political theater” under Morrisey close allyship with Trump.
“We have enormous respect for the men and women of the West Virginia National Guard, but it’s shameful that Morrisey is making them complicit in Trump’s latest political stunt,” Pushkin said, adding that he believed that the Trump’s initiative was a distraction from the president’s “broken pledge to release the [Jeffrey] Epstein files.”
“The real tragedy here is that instead of helping their neighbors recover from devastating floods at home — our guard members are being shipped off to serve as props in the Trump — Morrisey political theater.”
  W.Va. House Minority Leader Del. Sean Hornbuckle, D-Cabell
Morrisey doesn’t need the Legislature’s approval to direct the National Guard to the nation’s capital.
A spokesperson for House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, R-Clay, said he was unable to comment on the directive by deadline due to his schedule. Senate President Randy Smith, R-Preston, didn’t return a request for comment.
House Minority Leader Sean Hornbuckle, D-Cabell, echoed Pushkin’s comments, calling the move “highly irresponsible” while West Virginia was still recovering from deadly flooding in the Wheeling Area, which the National Guard has assisted with, and facing other pressing issues like public education and road repairs. 
“This is a continuation of campaign theatrics,” Hornbuckle said. “There’s no true governance here, and we desperately need to focus our attention on matters that are affecting West Virginians today.”
Last week, Morrisey announced West Virginia National Guard members along with law enforcement would expand immigration enforcement operations in the state, partnering with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to go through a specialized training program. Seward said 175 Guard members would join the program, which gives officers authority to carry out certain ICE functions.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)The University of Florida has yet to name a new interim president as time runs out on Kent Fuchs’ interim presidency.
During a UF Board of Trustees meeting Monday, Chair Mori Hosseini provided a brief update about the school’s leadership. 
“I’m continuing to work, working on identifying a candidate for interim president,” Hosseini said during the virtual meeting. “This has been a focus over the past few months and I have taken a deliberate and thoughtful approach to this responsibility.”
Fuchs, president of the flagship university from 2015-2023, agreed to serve as interim president on Aug. 1, 2024, after former President Ben Sasse unexpectedly left the post last summer. 
A year elapsed, and Fuchs agreed to extend his one-year agreement for another month, until Sept. 1. 
The search for an official president took an unprecedented turn earlier this year. 
UF trustees in May unanimously approved former University of Michigan President Santa Ono to be the next leader of the institution. However, final approval required by the Board of Governors of the State University System proved a problem. 
Following a long interview in which governors grilled Ono about his past support for diversity, equity, and inclusion, among other topics, they rejected him in June, sending UF trustees back to the beginning. 
Hosseini stood by his support for Ono even after the rejection.

Candidates for the interim and official roles now have to consider whether to subject themselves to the political scrutiny that Ono, who resigned from his Michigan job before the failed vote, went through.
Florida’s higher education presidencies are increasingly populated by politicians.

Former Lt. Gov. and now-Florida International University President Jeanette Nuñez;
Former Department of Juvenile Justice Secretary and now-Pasco-Hernando State College President Eric Hall;
Former GOP state House Leader and now-Florida Atlantic University President Adam Hasner; and
Former lobbyist and state board appointee and now-Florida A&M University President Marva Johnson; all started their jobs within the past year.

The experience of the original presidential search, with members of Florida’s congressional delegation weighing in with political complaints — plus Gov. Ron DeSantis’ intervention in presidential searches at other institutions — appear to be shadowing the process. 
Hosseini said the UF board will interview and vote on an interim president candidate as soon as he identifies one.
“I know that you all are not settling for just anyone that wants the position or that might be recommended. You want the very best for the institution,” Fuchs told trustees. 
Additional searches
The University of South Florida is also in the midst of a presidential search, as is  the University of West Florida.
USF President Rhea law announced earlier this year she would retire after the university names a new president.
Former UWF President Martha Saunders resigned before her contract expired shortly after the system’s Board of Governors and DeSantis overhauled the institution’s board of trustees, making way for former Education Commissioner Manny Diaz Jr. to take over as interim president. He’s expressed interest in the official title.

Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins introduced the initiative by the Trump administration after a Future Farmers of America breakfast at the State Fairgrounds in Lebanon where she said the federal government will make new grants to bolster Tennessee farming while targeting grants that don’t help farmers’ production.
Rollins criticized the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act and “market distorting incentives” for solar panels, which she said are eliminating Tennessee farmland.
The secretary made the statements even though a study by the nonpartisan Tennessee Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations found that solar facilities aren’t likely to be the “primary driver” of development on farmland for decades. The study also determined that land can be returned to farming once a solar facility goes out of use.

Earlier this year, the federal government made dramatic cuts to higher education grants, including eliminating more than $31 million in funding to the University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture, which houses agricultural research and resources for Tennessee farmers and communities in 95 counties.
Rollins defended the reductions, saying “Those cuts were being made in programs that did not align with the president’s vision of putting farmers first.”
Deputy Secretary Stephen Vaden of Tennessee described the reduction as a “repurposing” and said changes were made in research funding based on whether a grant “helps a farmer in the field make more money.” Projects aimed at “clean energy” or based on “racial criteria” were eliminated, he said.
In addition to stopping solar panel development on farmland, Rollins announced that nearly $89 million will go toward 13 rural development projects in 28 Tennessee counties to “promote partnerships” and infrastructure investments for rural education. The department has distributed nearly $100 million this year to more than 10,000 farmers through the Emergency Commodity Assistance Program, according to Rollins.
Some farmers have said they expect prices to increase because of President Donald Trump’s tariffs, which are forcing them to pass on higher rates to customers. Rollins said Monday the administration has signed eight new trade agreements expected to boost the nation’s economy.

Article Summary

JB Pritzker signed 266 bills on Friday, one of which has already sparked a lawsuit backed by Republicans.
Pritzker also vetoed a measure that was supported by Illinois Treasurer Michael Frerichs, saying it could have benefited “extremist” groups.
Another law will create a statewide office to oversee and assist public defenders.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

The governor signed 266 laws on Friday, moving closer to finalizing his part in approving — or rejecting — over 430 laws sent to him by lawmakers this spring.
The new laws include measures to make public defenders more independent, tighten safety regulations at warehouses and increase the age for required annual driver tests.
Gov. JB Pritzker also vetoed two bills, a somewhat rare move from a governor of the same party as the legislature’s supermajorities. One veto was somewhat technical — a budget provision already implemented the policy — but the other highlighted a policy disagreement between him and the state treasurer.
Toxic substance lawsuits  
One of the bills Pritzker signed Friday invited almost immediate pushback from Republicans and business groups.
The law, outlined in Senate Bill 328, allows lawsuits to continue against companies that operate in Illinois even if the company and plaintiffs are from other states. The law only applies to cases dealing with “toxic” substances under state law.
The law is seen as good for trial lawyers, who might see expanded business opportunities under the new law. The head of the Illinois Trial Lawyers Associations applauded the governor’s approval last week and said that the “sole intent” of the new law is provide justice for people exposed to toxic substances.
But critics, like the Illinois Manufacturers Association, say the measure will be bad for business.
A group of Republican lawmakers filed a lawsuit challenging the bill earlier this summer, criticizing it as legalizing “litigation tourism.”
Read more: GOP lawsuit seeks to end ‘gut-and-replace’ legislation
That lawsuit – focused on the legislative process more than the bill’s contents – could also end the practice of passing “gut-and-replace” bills. That’s a procedural maneuver where lawmakers modify a bill already passed in one chamber of the General Assembly with an amendment that removes the entire bill and replaces it.
This move is unpopular among some lawmakers who see it as unconstitutional because it limits or precludes substantial debate on a bill’s actual contents. The lawsuit is still pending in Sangamon County.
Pritzker vetoes nonprofit investment pool 
Another measure — this one backed by state treasurer Michael Frerichs — would have allowed Frerichs’ office to create an investment pool for Illinois nonprofits. The treasurer’s office would then invest those funds and provide the returns on those investments back to the nonprofits.
But Pritzker vetoed Senate Bill 246, saying that the measure had harmful unintended consequences.
“It would unfortunately allow Illinois’ financial investments to be used to benefit fringe and extremist groups,” Pritzker wrote. “I cannot sign a bill that unintentionally allows extremist groups to advance their hateful missions by exploiting state services and resources.”
Pritzker pointed to an Indiana nonprofit linked to the Oath Keepers, an anti-government militia that watchdog groups label as an “extremist” organization. Leaders of the group were found guilty of seditious conspiracy for their role in the U.S. Capitol riots on Jan. 6, 2021.
Pritzker said that organization would be eligible for the investment fund program. But the treasurer issued a statement countering that claim.
“I strongly disagree with the governor’s misguided belief that hate groups would use a state investment pool,” Frerichs said in a statement. “The bill specifically requires that to be eligible, a nonprofit must provide a copy of their audited financial statements. No hate group would ever agree to that. Sunshine remains the best disinfectant for fighting hate.”
Statewide public defender office
Another law signed Friday, contained in House Bill 3363, will create the “Office of State Public Defender” to provide public defender offices throughout the state with more resources. It also reforms the public defender appointment process in an effort to give public defenders more independence from local judges.
An analysis of public defender data from a Northwestern University research team, which supported the bill, found that Illinois had a shortage of public defenders in fiscal year 2023, with only about 56% of the needed number currently allocated statewide.
A 2021 report commissioned by the Illinois Supreme Court found similar results in nine counties. None of those counties had sufficient resources to provide defendants with proper legal representation.

The need for public defenders has also increased in years since the state’s abolition of cash bail in 2023. Cases now require more work in the pretrial phase.
Lawmakers appropriated $10 million for county public defense services in this year’s budget, the same they’ve appropriated since 2023.

(Henry Redman | Wisconsin Examiner)A bipartisan group of former elected officials from Wisconsin on Monday criticized President Donald Trump’s promise to end mail-in voting and the use of electronic voting machines. 
In a Monday morning post on his social media site Truth Social, Trump said that he’d issue an executive order to end the practices ahead of next year’s midterm elections. 
“I am going to lead a movement to get rid of MAIL-IN BALLOTS, and also, while we’re at it, Highly ‘Inaccurate,’ Very Expensive, and Seriously Controversial VOTING MACHINES,” Trump wrote.
Neither the president nor the federal government has the authority to manage election administration in this way. The law gives individual states broad power to decide how to run their own elections. 
Wisconsin’s election system is the most decentralized in the country, giving much of the authority over how to conduct voting to the state’s 1,850 municipal clerks. The state allows mail-in absentee voting without requiring voters to provide a reason, and the electronic voting machines approved for use in the state are incapable of connecting to the internet. Electronic voting machines are more accurate at tallying votes than a human hand counting them. 
After Trump’s post, the Democracy Defense Project-Wisconsin board, which includes former Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, former Attorney General JB Van Hollen, former U.S. Representative Scott Klug, and former Democratic Party of Wisconsin Chair Mike Tate, said in a statement that such an action would increase inaccuracy in the state’s elections. 
“The Constitution is clear: the federal government does not administer elections at the state level,” the group said. “In fact, improved access to voting methods, including the electronic machines Wisconsin uses that produce paper ballots and are unable to be connected to the internet, have benefitted Republicans just as much as Democrats. Wisconsin has displayed time and time again that our elections are safe and secure, and while we can always make them more efficient, there is no tolerance for inaccuracy in our results.”

(Photo by Nancy Lavin/Rhode Island Current)Violent crime victims and their families across the country stand to lose more than $1 billion in direct compensation and support services under federal directives that illegally condition state grants on compliance with unrelated immigration policies.
So argued 21 Democratic state attorneys general, including Rhode Island’s Peter Neronha, in a new lawsuit filed in Rhode Island federal court on Monday. The complaint seeks to stop the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi from withholding statutory federal funds under the Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) to states whose officials refuse to comply with federal civil immigration enforcement.
Rhode Island is among more than dozen states facing threats from the Trump administration for alleged “sanctuary” policies. Bondi in an Aug. 13 letter to Gov. Dan McKee demanded the state get rid of its policies that “thwart federal immigration enforcement, warning of criminal charges and yanking federal funding if state officials refuse to comply.”
McKee and Neronha have previously rebuffed the “sanctuary” label, pointing to a 2014 federal judge’s ruling as the determinant of state immigration policies.
“This case isn’t about a lack of cooperation with the federal government when it comes to law enforcement,” Neronha said in a virtual press conference on Monday. Instead, he argued that the federal administration’s “trumped up” request for states to carry out civil immigration policies — finding and detaining undocumented immigrants who have not committed crimes — was beyond the scope of what local public safety agencies can, or should, do.
Attorneys General Matthew Platkin of New Jersey, Kathy Jennings of Delaware, Rob Bonta of California, and Kwame Raoul of Illinois, also participated in the Zoom call with reporters Monday as co-lead plaintiffs on the case.
“We need our state police and our local police investigating violent and other crime,” Neronha said. “That’s their job, that’s what they are trained to do, that’s what we need them to do.”

(Screenshot)
But that logic has not swayed the federal administration, which is threatening to pull funding for victims of gun violence, sexual assault, armed robberies and other violent crimes to pay for lawyers, shelter, funeral and burial services and counseling and other recovery supports. For federal fiscal year 2024, Rhode Island received nearly $3.3 million in federal VOCA funds helping nearly 42,000 violent crime victims and their families with direct compensation and support services through partner nonprofits.
It’s the first time in the federal law’s 41-year history that Rhode Island and other states might not get the congressionally appropriated money, based on a population-driven formula.
Bondi put states on notice in February, warning broadly about cuts to federal funding for states that failed to comply with federal immigration policies.
The threat solidified last month, when the DOJ’s Office for Victims of Crime issued its annual notice alerting states of the window to apply for formula-driven and competitive grants to help violent crime victims. The July 21 memo explicitly stated that states that obstruct or don’t help federal immigration agents find, arrest and detain undocumented immigrants will not receive funding.
Facing cuts, abuse survivors implore Maine lawmakers to bolster victim services funding

If the DOJ follows through on this threat, it would cut off nearly $1.4 billion to states in federal fiscal 2025, in turn hurting victims of crimes, and their families, according to the AGs lawsuit.
“In short, lapses in grant funding, even if temporary, would result in the sudden and massive disruption of state victim services programs that have historically been supported by USDOJ grant funds,” the complaint states. “Among other things, this could result in unsafe conditions for victims and their families. Furthermore, this loss in VOCA funding and curtailment of victim support services would likely impact victims’ willingness to cooperate with law enforcement and adversely impact law enforcement efforts throughout the State.”
The legal arguments echo the 32 federal lawsuits Neronha’s office has led or joined since Trump took office, focused on Constitutional violations of separation of powers and spending. Despite the flurry of legal challenges Democratic attorneys general have not lost vigor and passion — touting their wins during the press conference in securing preliminary and long-term blocks to federal actions on everything from research grants to education funding.
The complaint also references a separate lawsuit filed by 17 state-level coalitions that help domestic violence and sexual assault survivors. Earlier this month, Rhode Island Senior District Judge William. E. Smith temporarily blocked the federal government from withholding Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) grants based on directives around gender ideology and diversity initiatives. The 1994 federal law offers formula-driven funds for sexual assault and domestic violence victims, two subgroups of violent crime victims helped by the Victims of Crime Act, which preceded it by a decade.
The latter also addresses victims and families of gun violence, elder abuse, stalking and harassment and childhood abuse and neglect, among other types of violent crimes. Since 2011, the federal fund has also paid nearly $15 billion to more than 65,600 claimants who were hurt, became sick or died from the Sept. 11 attacks. 
‘The most heinous acts’
“This administration is holding hostage over $1 billion directly to support some of the most heinous acts anyone will ever do,” Platkin of New Jersey said during the virtual press conference. Platkin later declared the Trump administration “the most anti-public safety administration” in modern history.
Neronha echoed Platkin’s outrage.
“This Administration is hanging Americans out to dry; in this case American victims who are attempting to pick up the pieces of their lives, bury their family members, and see to it that criminals responsible for hurting them and their loved ones are held accountable,” Neronha said. “In this country, above all else, we expect our government to protect us, and this latest move flies in the face of that expectation.”
Facing cuts, abuse survivors implore Maine lawmakers to bolster victim services funding

The lawsuit asks a federal judge to force the DOJ to remove the strings attached to its federal crime victim funding, and permanently prevent the federal administration from imposing any conditions later.
The clock is ticking, with an Aug. 20 deadline for states to submit their final applications for federal grants. Awards are expected to be announced by Sept. 30.
“If USDOJ refuses to award funds to Plaintiff States that do not comply with the Immigration Enforcement Conditions, the window for Plaintiffs to have secured FY 2025 VOCA funding will have passed,” the complaint states. “As a result, even if Plaintiffs ultimately prevail in having the Conditions vacated and declared unlawful, critical programs for victims and survivors that have long been supported by USDOJ grants will be irreparably disrupted.
In addition to formula-driven awards, states can also seek additional, competitive grants. Rhode Island, for example, intends to apply for a technology grant to enhance its VOICE (Victims Outreach Integrated Community Environment) online portal, which streamlines information about court cases, offenders and other information necessary for crime victims, their advocates, and state agencies, according to the complaint. Neronha’s office began developing the portal in fiscal year 2020, though the rollout was delayed to fiscal 2022 because of the pandemic.
Natalie Baldassarre, a spokesperson for the Justice Department, declined to comment. The lawsuit also names Maureen Henneberg, acting assistant attorney general for the U.S. Office of Justice programs, and Katherine Darke Schmitt, acting director of the Office for Victims of Crime, as defendants.
Other state AGs that joined represent Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia.

With few exceptions, insurance companies selling health coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplace plan to increase rates in 2026. In the Kansas City area, all but one carrier have asked Kansas and Missouri regulators for the right to bump up premiums — in one case by 40%.
Only Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City proposed a decrease.
The story is similar across the country.
A survey of proposed rates by KFF and the Peterson Center on Healthcare found a median planned increase of 18% among the 312 insurers participating in ACA marketplaces nationwide. That is 11 percentage points higher than last year and the steepest increase request since 2018.
Only four insurers nationwide said they would decrease rates.
According to the KFF report, insurance companies cited numerous reasons for the increases, including inflation, increasing labor costs and the high price of specialty drugs like GLP-1 weight loss medications.
But health policy experts said much of the blame should fall on new Trump administration laws and policies that will increase the cost of marketplace coverage, drive healthy people to drop out and leave behind patients who cost the most.
 Expiring tax credits and new rules

The first policy that will drive up prices is that enhanced tax credits are expected to expire.
Since 2021 those tax credits have offset the cost of health plans for more than 90% of people enrolled in the ACA marketplaces and made coverage more widely available. The tax credits, which helped double marketplace enrollment between 2021 and 2025, expire at the end of the year if Congress doesn’t renew them.
The second policy driving up prices involves a new Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services rule that overhauls how the marketplace operates.
Some changes will make it harder for people to enroll and keep coverage, such as shortening the enrollment period, eliminating automatic reenrollment and adding stricter eligibility checks. Other changes upend how insurance payments are formulated, which could drive up premiums and force people to pay more for deductibles and copays.
“The bottom line is that out-of-pocket premiums will go up,” said Gideon Lukens, senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, who co-authored a report about the changes. “People will pay higher deductibles and copays, and the maximum out-of-pocket limits will also go up. … And then a lot of people lose coverage as a result.”
 Comparable to repealing Obamacare

The ACA marketplace reached more than 24 million enrollees nationally in 2025, including 417,000 in Missouri and 200,050 in Kansas. That was a record, and double the enrollment in 2021 when enhanced tax subsidies first went into effect. During that same period, Missouri’s enrollment also doubled, while Kansas’ climbed 133%.
But those enrollment highs are widely expected to plummet next year as premiums increase. In a recent report, the Kansas Health Institute predicted that Kansas ACA enrollment could immediately return to 2021 levels and uninsured rates could “greatly increase.”
Anything that makes insurance harder to get — and especially more expensive — leads to fewer people being covered, experts said.
And next year’s potential insurance premium increases come as the Congressional Budget Office predicts that policy changes from the Trump administration will lead to an annual decline in overall resources for the country’s poorest households between 2026 and 2034. The CBO said poor households will lose an average of $1,200 annually during the period, while top-income households can expect to gain $13,600.
Lukens said increased health insurance premiums caused by the expiration of enhanced tax credits and CMS rule changes could effectively lead the country back to a time before the ACA was adopted, when many people couldn’t afford insurance and found it difficult to access health care.
“It’s not a repeal of the ACA, but the size of the impact is comparable,” he said. “The way it’s done is more of a death-by-a-thousand-cuts way — a lot of changes that will just generally add a lot of red tape and make it harder for people to keep coverage, to enroll in coverage, and will raise costs. But the overall impact of it will be to increase the number of people without coverage by getting close to where we were before the ACA.”
 A vicious cycle

Once the dust settles, an estimated 8 million people are expected to lose coverage through the ACA marketplace. On top of that, 9 million could lose Medicaid under federal legislation passed in July, which cuts federal spending on the program by close to $1 trillion and adds new obstacles to keep coverage, like work requirements and documenting hours worked.
“The worst case scenario here is bad,” said Caitlin Donovan, a spokesperson for the Patient Advocate Foundation, which helps people around the country with chronic and life-threatening illnesses find care. “It’s really bad.”
Ultimately, she said, when people lose health coverage they’re less likely to seek care and more likely to get sicker before getting help. That makes care cost more, puts more strain on hospitals and other health care providers and, ultimately, continues the cycle of insurance rates climbing.
“There is going to be a sicker population that’s in a much worse situation,” Donovan said.
When people who are young and healthy don’t participate in the insurance market, leaving behind people who are more expensive to cover, it can trigger a cycle of increasing premiums, said Christopher Garmon, assistant professor of health administration at the University of Missouri-Kansas City.
“Anything that makes healthy people less likely to enroll is going to increase costs and cause premiums to go up, and make healthy people less likely to enroll,” he said. “And that is a vicious cycle.”
ACA premium changes will vary based on where a person lives, their age and income. KFF has a calculator that can help people know how much they may see rates increase come January.
The Commonwealth Fund estimates that people in Missouri who receive tax credits will see a $720 jump in annual premiums, while the same group in Kansas will see a $590 annual increase.
 Rising premiums in Kansas and Missouri

Most of the insurance companies in the Kansas and Missouri marketplaces have requested premium increases next year.
In Kansas, Celtic Insurance Co. proposed a 40% increase, the highest jump. But Medica Insurance Co. said its rates need to go up 29.3% in Kansas. In Missouri, Medica proposed an increase of 29.2%, while Celtic proposed a jump of 24.4%.
Celtic could not be reached for comment.
Medica provided a written statement, saying the company’s rate request “reflects the trend toward increased use of medical services as well as the expiration of enhanced subsidies for those who depend on the Affordable Care Act marketplace for coverage.”
“We urge the Congress to promptly extend assistance that promotes stability in this vital market serving millions of Americans,” the Medica statement said.
Other carriers in the Kansas City market proposing rate increases include Oscar Insurance Co., which is asking for a 14.4% increase in Kansas and an 11.7% increase in Missouri, and United Healthcare Insurance Co., which wants a 10.1% bump in Kansas and a 10.7% increase in Missouri.
Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City is the only carrier in the market — and one of just four in the country — planning to lower rates next year.
The company said it would drop rates 6.1% in Kansas and 4.4% in Missouri.
In a written statement, Rachel Arnett, Blue Cross vice president of sales, said the company had “evaluated our product offerings, gathered feedback from our customers, and developed a variety of options on the ACA Marketplace for health insurance in 2026.”
Those include “a new focused provider network,” which it said would bring lower premiums and predictable cost, and plans to offer its primary care model, Spira Care Access, through nine area centers.
A spokesperson for the carrier declined to answer questions about the rate reduction and did not provide other details about the scope of the coverage.
 Less help available 

Proposed rates must be approved by state insurance regulators before they are officially listed in the marketplace.
That should happen this fall in time for the ACA marketplaces’ open enrollment period, which begins Nov. 1. This year, people will have until Jan. 15 to complete enrollment. But next year that window will shorten to Nov. 1 through Dec. 15.
But many people may not realize how much the ACA will be changing next year or understand what options they may have for coverage. That’s because earlier this year the Trump administration cut funding for navigators who help people find health insurance through the ACA marketplace or, if they qualify, Medicaid.
Funding for public information campaigns about ACA coverage and the open enrollment period has also been cut, meaning some enrollees could miss deadlines or forget to reenroll, which could also add to the number of uninsured.
Justin Gust, vice president of community engagement with El Centro Inc., said he’s seen this play out before. The last time Trump was in the White House virtually all of the funding for public information campaigns was eliminated. And the consequences were not good.
“There was a huge reduction in people enrolling,” he said.

Gerrymandering. Most Americans have come to be familiar with this phenomenon in which politicians rig electoral maps and elections for partisan purposes, but unless you’re a serious political observer, you may not be up to speed on just how far out of control this destructive practice has gotten of late or, indeed, how unless something is done soon, it might well spiral out of control.
Fortunately, a handful of experts have been monitoring and chronicling the gerrymandering mess for some time and one of the most knowledgeable is author Dave Daley. Daley — a senior fellow at the nonprofit FairVote — is author of the books “Rat-Effed: Why Your Vote Doesn’t Count” and “Antidemocratic: Inside the Far Right’s 50-Year Plot to Control American Elections,” and recently he penned an op-ed for the Washington Post in which he noted that the 2026 midterms might not be decided by tariffs or President Trump’s approval ratings, but by gerrymandering. And NC Newsline recently  caught up with him to learn the details.
In Part One of our extended conversation, we explored the sobering current reality of how Republican state-level politicians – most notably right now in Texas — are, at the urging of President Trump, attempting to rig the 2026 midterm elections by gerrymandering their state congressional maps in unprecedented ways.
In Part Two of our conversation, we looked into the ways in which the gerrymandering wars could spin out of control, how the only realistic solution to the problem lies in congressional action, how President Trump’s effort to initiate a mid-decade census is fraught with problems, and how yet another case to be argued before the U.S. Supreme Court this fall could further fuel the fires that threaten American democracy.

Fire area now stretches from 11 miles east of Thermopolis to the borders of Fremont and Washakie counties. Large rural areas are under evacuation orders. 
The post Wyoming’s Red Canyon Fire balloons to over 91,000 acres amid evacuations, emergency order appeared first on WyoFile .","A major wildland fire outside Thermopolis escalated significantly over the weekend, driving further evacuation warnings and an increasing federal response as the burn stretched from Hot Springs County to its borders with Fremont and Washakie counties.
The Red Canyon Fire began Wednesday and by Monday morning covered more than 91,000 acres — an area nearly the size of Denver — as strong winds and dry grass fueled its growth. The fire remains 11 miles east of Thermopolis, and evacuation orders so far appear limited to mostly rural areas. It is burning across ridges and creek drainages dominated by grassland and brush. 
WyoFile has sought an estimate of the number of homes affected by the evacuation orders but has so far not received one from official sources. There are “numerous structures threatened” after extreme fire behavior and large runs of flames driven by the wind over the weekend, the National Interagency Fire Center reported Monday.
The fire gained more than 20,000 acres Sunday into Monday, that agency reported. 
The areas under evacuation orders remain well to the east of the Bighorn River, which is lined by ranches, guesthouses, RV campgrounds and other businesses as it runs north out of Thermopolis toward Worland. 
The Red Canyon Fire as of Aug. 18, 2025. (InciWeb)
As of Monday morning, firefighters were working at least two fronts of the fire, and the most intense activity appeared to be on the fire’s south end. Firefighters on the northern end of the fire were conducting mop up operations and searching for hot spots — areas still smoldering  after the main thrust of the flames has moved on or been extinguished. 
Crews on the fire’s southern end were working to prevent the fire from spreading further in that direction, according to officials. 
There are two other significant fires burning in the Bighorn Basin, though they did not see the same level of growth as the Red Canyon Fire. The Spring Creek Fire near Ten Sleep is now at 3,575 acres, according to Washakie County Emergency Management, and crews under state management have made progress controlling it, working 24-hour shifts.
Firefighters were able to achieve even more containment of the Sleeper Ranch Fire, near Meeteetsee, which is currently estimated at 18,046 acres, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. That fire threatens sage grouse habitat and energy infrastructure. 
Fires burn in mosaic patterns of intensity, and acreage measurements provided during ongoing fires do not mean the flames are burning across all that distance. 
Gov. Mark Gordon declared a state of emergency Monday, which allows him to bring the Wyoming National Guard into the response if needed and also gives the state access to some federal funding. The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency on Aug. 15 authorized federal funding to cover 75% of any state level firefighting costs connected with the Red Canyon Fire. 
Also on Monday, a new federal team took over managing the Red Canyon Fire, indicating its growing complexity — determined largely by fire size, weather and the number of homes and infrastructure threatened. 
The Rocky Mountain Area Complex Incident Management Team 2 assumed command of the fire at 7 a.m. Monday, team public information officer Dakota Baker told WyoFile. Following days of high wind and worrying thunderstorms Sunday that could have brought other lightning-caused ignitions, officials Monday said they expected a very slight reprieve from an incoming high pressure system. 
“Winds are expected to shift to more typical upslope and up-valley patterns gusting up to 20 mph throughout the day,” the new incident management team posted in a Monday morning update. But hot temperatures reaching into the 90s, and low humidity, also lay ahead. 
Officials reported portions of two area roads as closed during the Red Canyon Fire: Buffalo Creek and Black Mountain roads. On Sunday and again on Monday, federal officials reported that some local residents were taking “independent actions” to protect their homes and as a result firefighters had to divert resources away from combatting the flames, though few details were provided. 
“For firefighter safety and public safety, please avoid working in fire area,” Monday’s update asked. Private drone flights had also been a problem, as they have been at an increasing number of fires nationwide in recent years. When people fly drones to document wildfires, it can ground the airborne water and fire retardant tankers, helicopters and other aircraft that are often critical to stemming flames’ rapid advance. 
“If you fly, we can’t,” Monday’s statement read. 
On Monday evening, at 7 p.m., the incident management team and other state and local officials will gather for a community meeting at the Hot Springs County High School.

LaMonica McIver argues in new court filings that she is immune to prosecution over a melee that occurred in May while she was visiting a migrant jail in Newark.,"Rep. LaMonica McIver argues in new court filings that she is immune to prosecution over a melee that occurred in May while she was visiting a migrant jail in Newark. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Federal assault charges against Rep. LaMonica McIver should be thrown out just as similar charges facing dozens of people involved in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol were tossed, McIver’s lawyers argue in a new court filing.
McIver, a Democrat accused of shoving officers during a melee at a migrant jail in Newark in May, said there is no “conduct-based justification” for the U.S. Department of Justice dismissing cases against 160 people involved in the Jan. 6 riot but continuing to prosecute her for allegedly violating the same statute.
“Her alleged conduct was manifestly less egregious than storming the Capitol, throwing explosives, beating officers with bats and riot shields, and spraying them with pepper spray. Some of those defendants had significant criminal histories. Some admitted that they engaged in their assaultive conduct as part of an effort to overturn an election. Some escalated their threats in the subsequent days. Some bragged about their exploits and vowed that they would do it again,” one of the new filings says.
McIver was indicted in June on three counts of assaulting or impeding officers while Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, a Democrat, was arrested May 9 outside of immigration detention center Delaney Hall. Prosecutors say McIver, who says she was there with two other members of Congress to conduct an oversight visit, interfered as federal agents attempted to arrest Baraka for trespassing (prosecutors dropped the charge against Baraka days later). 










If these charges are allowed to move forward, they will send a chilling message to Congress on the risk it takes when it scrutinizes the Administration’s activities.


– Rep. LaMonica McIver's attorneys


McIver, who was elected to Congress last year, has pleaded not guilty to the charges. A judge set a tentative trial date of Nov. 10.
In four briefs filed Friday, McIver’s attorneys urge a federal judge to dismiss the three counts. Her lawyers argue the confrontation was provoked by agents who escalated the situation, that her inspection of Delaney Hall was a legislative act that she cannot be prosecuted over, and that evidence cited in the indictment is contradictory to video footage of the episode shared by the Department of Homeland Security. McIver also wants a judge to order the Department of Homeland Security to delete social media posts that McIver’s attorneys say harm her ability to have a fair trial.
“Individually and collectively, those statements are extraordinarily prejudicial: they unequivocally declare Congresswoman McIver’s guilt; they assail the defenses DHS expects her to assert; they demean her as a ‘gutter politician’ responsible for purportedly escalating rates of assault on ICE agents; and they attempt to associate her with ‘Murderers, Rapists, Suspected Terrorists, and Gang Members’ supposedly housed in the detention facility that the Congresswoman inspected on May 9, 2025, as part of her congressionally authorized oversight responsibility,” one of the filings says.
The incident at the center of the allegations was recorded on videos shared publicly by the Department of Homeland Security. Attorneys for McIver, who is seen in the videos pushing two agents during a chaotic scuffle, call her actions a “modest, proportional, and reactive response to a flood of armed and marked ICE agents.” Federal prosecutors previously said she acted as a “human shield” preventing Baraka’s arrest.

One of McIver’s arguments for dismissal of the indictment focuses on whether her prosecution violates the Constitution’s speech or debate clause, which grants members of Congress broad immunity for legislative acts. McIver, a member of the House Committee on Homeland Security, “unquestionably had congressional authority” to conduct oversight on government agencies, including U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities, her attorneys argue.
Putting McIver on trial for constitutionally vested duties would deter other Congress members from oversight and “imperil the separation of powers,” that filing says.
“That sort of intimidation of independent legislative prerogatives is exactly the evil that legislative immunity was designed to prevent,” her attorneys wrote.
McIver’s filings cite a U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals decision from 2016 that found against then-Sen. Bob Menendez’s arguments that he was indicted over legislative acts protected by the speech and debates clause. That decision said some lawmakers’ actions are “manifestly legislative” — and McIver’s attorneys argue her actions at Delaney Hall on May 9 were indeed manifestly legislative.
“Her sole purpose was to fulfill her constitutional and statutory responsibility of Executive Branch oversight,” they said.
One of the lawmakers who visited Delaney Hall on May 9 with McIver was Rep. Rob Menendez (D-08), the former senator’s son.
McIver’s attorneys also argue that legislators conducting oversight amid escalating immigration enforcement tactics from the Trump administration “have been met with alarming resistance.” They point to Baraka’s arrest, the detention of California Sen. Alex Padilla after questioning Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem during a press conference, and New York City Comptroller Brad Landler’s arrest at an immigration court. 
“If these charges are allowed to move forward, they will send a chilling message to Congress on the risk it takes when it scrutinizes the Administration’s activities. The Speech of Debate Clause was designed to prevent that kind of message and intimidation,” one of McIver’s filings says.",https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/0JS13795_1-1024x759.jpg,,,2025-08-18 14:57:34.812450

(Photo by Nancy Lavin/Rhode Island Current)Violent crime victims and their families across the country stand to lose more than $1 billion in direct compensation and support services under federal directives that illegally condition state grants on compliance with unrelated immigration policies.
So argued 21 Democratic state attorneys general, including Rhode Island’s Peter Neronha, in a new lawsuit filed in Rhode Island federal court on Monday. The complaint seeks to stop the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi from withholding statutory federal funds under the Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) to states whose officials refuse to comply with federal civil immigration enforcement.
Rhode Island is among more than dozen states facing threats from the Trump administration for alleged “sanctuary” policies. Bondi in an Aug. 13 letter to Gov. Dan McKee demanded the state get rid of its policies that “thwart federal immigration enforcement, warning of criminal charges and yanking federal funding if state officials refuse to comply.
McKee and Neronha have previously rebuffed the “sanctuary” label, pointing to a 2014 federal judge’s ruling as the determinant of state immigration policies. 
“This case isn’t about a lack of cooperation with the federal government when it comes to law enforcement,” Neronha said in a virtual press conference on Monday. Instead, he argued that the federal administration’s “trumped up” request for states to carry out civil immigration policies — finding and detaining undocumented immigrants who have not committed crimes — was beyond the scope of what local public safety agencies can, or should, do.
Attorneys General Matthew Platkin of New Jersey, Kathy Jennings of Delaware, Rob Bonta of California, and Kwame Raoul of Illinois, also participated in the Zoom call with reporters Monday as co-lead plaintiffs on the case.
“We need our state police and our local police investigating violent and other crime,” Neronha said. “That’s their job, that’s what they are trained to do, that’s what we need them to do.”

42,000 RI crime victims compensated in FY24
But that logic has not swayed the federal administration, which is threatening to pull funding for victims of gun violence, sexual assault, armed robberies and other violent crimes to pay for lawyers, shelter, funeral and burial services and counseling and other recovery supports. For federal fiscal year 2024, Rhode Island received nearly $3.3 million in federal VOCA funds helping nearly 42,000 violent crime victims and their families with direct compensation and support services through partner nonprofits.
It’s the first time in the federal law’s 41-year history that Rhode Island and other states might not get the congressionally appropriated money, based on a population-driven formula. 
Bondi put states on notice in February, warning broadly about cuts to federal funding for states that failed to comply with federal immigration policies.
The threat solidified last month, when the DOJ’s Office for Victims of Crime issued its annual notice alerting states of the window to apply for formula-driven and competitive grants to help violent crime victims. The July 21 memo explicitly stated that states that obstruct or don’t help federal immigration agents find, arrest and detain undocumented immigrants will not receive funding.
If the DOJ follows through on this threat, it would cut off nearly $1.4 billion to states in federal fiscal 2025, in turn hurting victims of crimes, and their families, according to the AGs lawsuit.
“In short, lapses in grant funding, even if temporary, would result in the sudden and massive disruption of state victim services programs that have historically been supported by USDOJ grant funds,” the complaint states. “Among other things, this could result in unsafe conditions for victims and their families. Furthermore, this loss in VOCA funding and curtailment of victim support services would likely impact victims’ willingness to cooperate with law enforcement and adversely impact law enforcement efforts throughout the State.”
The legal arguments echo the 32 federal lawsuits Neronha’s office has led or joined since Trump took office, focused on Constitutional violations of separation of powers and spending. Despite the flurry of legal challenges Democratic attorneys general have not lost vigor and passion — touting their wins during the press conference in securing preliminary and long-term blocks to federal actions on everything from research grants to education funding.
The complaint also references a separate lawsuit filed by 17 state-level coalitions that help domestic violence and sexual assault survivors. Earlier this month, Rhode Island Senior District Judge William. E. Smith temporarily blocked the federal government from withholding Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) grants based on directives around gender ideology and diversity initiatives. The 1994 federal law offers formula-driven funds for sexual assault and domestic violence victims, two subgroups of violent crime victims helped by the Victims of Crime Act, which preceded it by a decade.
The latter also addresses victims and families of gun violence, elder abuse, stalking and harassment and childhood abuse and neglect, among other types of violent crimes. Since 2011, the federal fund has also paid nearly $15 billion to more than 65,600 claimants who were hurt, became sick or died from the Sept. 11 attacks. 
‘The most heinous acts’
“This administration is holding hostage over $1 billion directly to support some of the most heinous acts anyone will ever do,” Platkin of New Jersey said during the virtual press conference. Platkin later declared the Trump administration “the most anti-public safety administration” in modern history.
Neronha echoed Platkin’s outrage.
“This Administration is hanging Americans out to dry; in this case American victims who are attempting to pick up the pieces of their lives, bury their family members, and see to it that criminals responsible for hurting them and their loved ones are held accountable,” Neronha said. “In this country, above all else, we expect our government to protect us, and this latest move flies in the face of that expectation.”
The lawsuit asks a federal judge to force the DOJ to remove the strings attached to its federal crime victim funding, and permanently prevent the federal administration from imposing any conditions later.
The clock is ticking, with an Aug. 20 deadline for states to submit their final applications for federal grants. Awards are expected to be announced by Sept. 30.
“If USDOJ refuses to award funds to Plaintiff States that do not comply with the Immigration Enforcement Conditions, the window for Plaintiffs to have secured FY 2025 VOCA funding will have passed,” the complaint states. “As a result, even if Plaintiffs ultimately prevail in having the Conditions vacated and declared unlawful, critical programs for victims and survivors that have long been supported by USDOJ grants will be irreparably disrupted.  
In addition to formula-driven awards, states can also seek additional, competitive grants. Rhode Island, for example, intends to apply for a technology grant to enhance its VOICE (Victims Outreach Integrated Community Environment) online portal, which streamlines information about court cases, offenders and other information necessary for crime victims, their advocates, and state agencies, according to the complaint.

Of those three, state legislators have only tapped into the Legacy Fund for property tax reductions so far, a decision made during the past legislative session. According to the latest poll numbers, 69% of respondents support using the Legacy Fund for additional property tax relief, while 25% oppose that action.
Respondents are also firmly behind the idea of local control of property tax rates. A total
of 68% said those should remain with local political subdivisions, while 28% said those
rates should be decided at the state level.
Former governor Edward Schafer, who played a key role in the creation of the Legacy Fund, said the idea that people want more local control but also want state tax revenue from the Legacy Fund to pay for property tax relief, doesn’t quite match up.
“Putting state money into the deal doesn’t solve the problem,” Schafer said. “It’s got to be that local expenditure and responsibility. If people are saying, I want local control, then you’ve got to put the responsibility locally. While it is a worthwhile expenditure of the earnings of the Legacy Fund, I think that we’re going down the road here of the state taking over local property tax responsibility.”
 Poll: ND voters back tariffs, but mixed on impacts of Trump trade policies 

The value of the Legacy Fund currently stands at $12.5 billion.
A portion of the earnings has gone into the general fund during each biennium since 2019.
Around $686 million was transferred from The Legacy Fund to the general fund for the 2023-2025 period, up from $486 million in the previous biennium, but down from the $871 million distributed during the period before.
Updates were made to definitions of earnings on the Legacy Fund during the last legislative session, with 8% of the 5-year average allowed to be used for the general fund.
Schafer said a concern he has with the continued tapping into the earnings off the
Legacy Fund is that commitments keep getting extended, currently to another decade out. If oil revenues that the Legacy Fund taxes drop, those earnings could shrink.
“Instead of each legislative session setting their priorities, they are expending it out and anticipating spending it out on estimated revenues for years and years and years ahead,” Schafer said. “That’s not the way it should be set up.”
Yes on school meals, no on charter schools
Asked if they would like to see the Legacy Fund tapped for universal school meals, 70% supported that proposal and 26% opposed, according to the poll.
During the past session, House Bill 1553 proposed using around $140 million from the Legacy Fund to cover meals for all K-12 students in the state, but was defeated in the House by a 74-14 vote against the bill.

The state legislature expanded eligibility to cover more, but not all, students later in the
session.
“We see again that voters in North Dakota are strongly in favor of that,” said House Minority Leader Zac Ista, D-Grand Forks. “It’s one of those things that will take a financial obligation off their plates and help our students and teachers do better in the classroom.”
Ista said on the property tax measure that was passed, he’s happy to see it is so popular.
“Voters are saying, Hey, can we get a break here?” Ista said. “Can we ease that financial pressure of you know, our property tax bill, whether you’re paying that once a year or every month with your mortgage payment, people see it going up and up, and they want that relief to come their way.”
Respondents went the opposite direction on using the Legacy Fund for paying for school choice initiatives like private school vouchers: 58% opposed while 35% were in favor.
Strong support for Armstrong property tax plan
Most North Dakotans also back Governor Kelly Armstrong’s property tax relief package, which ended up being the choice of the legislature during the last session. That plan increased the existing primary residence property tax credit from $500 to $1600 per year, with a 3% cap on future property tax increases.
A total of 72% of the 625 respondents polled supported that plan, while 18% opposed. Support was relatively even across all political affiliations, though 32% of those identifying as Democrats opposed the plan.
Rick Becker, a former state legislator who drove a statewide measure to essentially abolish property taxes in 2024 that was eventually defeated, said dissent likely came from those who didn’t benefit beyond the residence property tax relief.
“One category would be one where they didn’t go far enough, and that would include farmers who got no relief, and small business or businesses, since property tax relief was left to residential only,” Becker said.
No new tax increases
Most respondents, however, drew the line at raising sales or income taxes to generate revenue to pay for schools, emergency services and infrastructure if property taxes are further reduced.
A total of 53% opposed those increases, 38% supported, and 9% were unsure.
Republicans had the highest level of support for raising those other taxes, with 43% in
favor.
Becker thought the answers could be interpreted several ways and that the numbers
are hard to dissect.
One interpretation is “they would rather not have their property taxes go down if it means sales taxes go up,” he said. Another way to look at it would be “the property tax could go down, but we don’t need sales tax since the local (political subdivisions) are already getting too much money,” Becker added.
“This question leaves open, I think, more questions than it has answers,” he said.
The North Dakota Poll, initiated by the North Dakota News Cooperative, was conducted by Mason-Dixon Polling & Strategy, Inc. of Jacksonville, Florida. From August 4 through August 6, 2025, a total of 625 adult regular voters were interviewed statewide by phone. The margin of error is no more than + or – 4%, according to the polling firm.
A total of 155 respondents were in Fargo-Cass County, 155 in eastern North Dakota, 120 in the Bismarck-Mandan region, and another 195 in western North Dakota. Quotas were assigned to reflect voter turnout by county.
Of the 625 respondents, 135 identified as Democrat (22%), 271 as Republican (43%)
and 219 as independent (35%).

DemasEvery 16 years, Michigan voters are asked whether the state should hold a Constitutional Convention, where a group of delegates will work together to overhaul the state constitution. 
While the mechanism for calling a convention, informally known as a “Con-Con” was written into the Michigan Constitution approved in 1963, the state has yet to call for another convention, with a strong majority of voters rejecting the proposal in 1978, 1994 and 2010. 
With 2026 marking yet another year with a Con-Con proposal on the ballot, opponents from both sides of the aisle are gearing up to speak out against revamping the state constitution, warning the process could fall victim to political extremists. 
On Friday members of Protect MI Constitution from Special Interests filed paperwork to form a ballot question committee to advocate against the Con-Con question, which will appear as Proposal 1 on the ballot. 
What’s a Con-Con? Michigan voters will decide if they want to rewrite the constitution in 2026.

According to the group’s website, its members include individuals from both parties, including small business owners, skilled trades workers, nurses, teachers, police officers and firefighters. 
A statement from the group warns that a Con-Con would cost tens of millions of taxpayer dollars, diverting funds away from programs that benefit Michigan residents. 
During the 2025 Mackinac Policy Conference Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) and Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt (R-Porter Township) backed the effort to call a Con-Con. 
While Hall viewed it as an avenue to remove provisions from the state constitution that he said sounded good on paper but had raised frustrations with voters, Nesbitt viewed it as an opportunity to make updates to the document that politicians in Lansing  haven’t had the “political courage … to actually get done.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
If voters do call a convention, a special primary and general election would be held for delegates, with one delegate elected for each of the state’s 110 House districts and 35 Senate districts. The convention would come together in October 2027 and would work to rewrite the state’s constitution with no time limit to propose a new document. Voters would then need to approve the final document.
Among the individuals involved with the opposition effort are Jeff Timmer, the campaign director for the anti-Donald Trump Lincoln Project and a former executive director of the Michigan Republican Party and Dianne Byrum, a founding partner of Byrum & Fisk Advocacy Communications and a former Democratic state lawmaker who served as Michigan House minority leader while Republicans held the majority. 
“Voting no on Proposal 1 protects Michiganders from tax hikes and ensures politicians don’t get to draw the maps of their own districts​, among other things,” Timmer said in a statement. “Voters have already spoken on these and other important changes over the decades. We can’t allow extreme special interest groups to get their hands on our constitution. Michigan’s Constitution already has an effective, proven and fair process to make changes and it shouldn’t be upended by a ​partisan ​Con-Con​, especially in this ​highly divisive​ political moment​.”
Under the current system, Michigan voters can initiate a Constitutional amendment through a petition drive. In order to have the matter placed before all voters in the state, petitioners must gather signatures from registered voters equal to 10% of the votes cast for governor in the previous gubernatorial election. 
“The Michigan Constitution has served us well for over 60 years, and it works,” Byrum said. “Many citizens and organizations realize the dangers of a Con-Con and they are joining our effort to advocate for a no vote on Proposal 1. Together, we will stand up to efforts by wealthy ​partisan ​donors and special interest groups to rewrite Michigan’s Constitution to promote their extreme agendas.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_1410-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-08-18 14:57:34.812450

(Photo courtesy of Iowa PBS)Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird led a multistate letter Friday questioning whether a new net-zero carbon emissions standard for businesses is illegal under state and federal law.
Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond was also among the 23 attorneys general who co-signed it the letter sent to David Kennedy, CEO of the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), a group that recently released its Financial Institutions Net-Zero standard. This standard is meant to aid financial institutions “in addressing their most significant climate impact through alignment and sector-specific targets,” according to the document, through actions like stopping or limiting investments in new projects related to fossil fuel expansion and addressing deforestation risks in existing investments.
This standard could run afoul of state and federal laws limiting ESG investment strategies — practices where investment firms account for “environmental, social and governance factors” when making investments, according to Bird’s letter. According to the law firm Morgan Lewis, there are 20 states with “anti-ESG” rules in effect as of 2023.
Bird also wrote SBTi and the businesses that commit to following the standard may be in violation of state consumer protection laws and federal and state antitrust laws, constituting an illegal boycott by deliberately cutting off investment and insurance for certain industries through their standard on oil, gas, and coal expansion.
“Some economic arrangements are illegal because they are unfair or unreasonably harmful to competition; the ‘good intentions’ behind them are irrelevant,” Bird wrote.
The letter was co-signed by attorneys general from 22 other states — Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming. It included a list of requested information and documents from SBTi on its communication with members about how it plans to meet net-zero carbon emission commitments, how the standard was developed, and how it is working with insurance companies to reduce emissions.
In a news release Friday, Bird called the standard from SBTi, which partners with the United Nations, the World Wide Fund for Nature and other organizations in providing advisory information, “the next attempt by radical environmentalists to coordinate companies to squeeze important American industries into eliminating carbon dioxide production by some future date.”
“SBTi is trying to redo President Biden’s radical green scheme,” Bird said in a statement. “If successful, they’ll hurt farmers, energy producers, and Iowans. Its program limits output of goods or services, and these unrealistic net-zero programs harm both American agriculture and industry. Making net-zero a goal actively harms Americans, creates risk for energy independence, and increases the cost of safe, healthy, nutritious food.”
Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier also took steps to investigate SBTi last week, announcing he would issue subpoenas to the advisory group and the CDP, an international nonprofit focused on environmental impact reporting. The investigation will look into whether these organizations violated state consumer protection and antitrust laws “by coercing companies into disclosing proprietary data and paying for access under the guise of environmental transparency,” according to a news release.
“Radical climate activists have hijacked corporate governance and weaponized it against the free market,” Uthmeier said in a statement. “Florida will not sit back while international pressure groups shake down American companies to fund their ESG grift. We’re using every tool of the law to stop the Climate Cartel from exploiting businesses and misleading consumers.”

Lindsey Graham of South Carolina (Photo provided by the S.C. Ports Authority)MOUNT PLEASANT – More than a decade after the state Legislature kickstarted Charleston Harbor deepening with a $300 million commitment to put the plan on a fast track, the federal government paid its final share toward the project that gives the S.C. State Ports Authority the deepest shipping channel along the East Coast.
U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham said Monday that nearly $21.3 million was allocated in this year’s Army Corps of Engineers budget for the harbor deepening project, which concluded in late 2022 after about four years of construction and more than a decade of planning.
All told, the federal government spent $302.6 million toward the nearly $580 million project that took Charleston Harbor to a 52-foot depth from its previous 45 feet, allowing some of the biggest and heaviest container ships to visit the Port of Charleston at any time regardless of tides.
The state’s share of the project was $277 million.
The port now hosts 28 weekly container ship services with vessels carrying up to 16,000 cargo boxes measured in 20-foot equivalents. Two more weekly services will begin in the next few weeks – both of them 15,000-box ships – connecting Charleston to ports in Europe, the Mediterranean and Asia.

Graham – a Republican from Seneca and the deepening project’s biggest proponent in Washington, D.C. – called Charleston’s port “the crown jewel of the East Coast.”
“Failure was not an option,” he said of the project. “If we had failed in this endeavor, it would have crippled our economy. … Of all the things I’ve been involved with, I think this was the most important and most consequential.”
Barbara Melvin, the authority’s president and CEO, said the deeper harbor lets Charleston’s port “move and work vessels at any time, boosting productivity and allowing imports and exports to reach their destination more quickly.”
“Our customers tell us that Charleston is a port they can rely on to help them meet their supply chain objectives,” Melvin added.
The project was the first to go through the Army Corps’ “smart planning” process, designed to eliminate the sluggish timelines and massive red tape federal work had been known for by steering authorization, planning, funding and construction through a single, coordinated and streamlined set of steps.
But there was trouble before that process even began.
South Carolina needed $150,000 in 2011 for a feasibility study to show whether harbor deepening was justified, but that money had been left out of a budget proposal, putting the project at risk before it had begun.
Graham was incensed and threatened “to tie the Senate in knots” by holding up then-President Obama’s administration picks.
“No nominations go forward in the Senate until we address CHS port,” Graham tweeted at the time.
The $150,000 was ultimately approved.
“That was a moment when everything could have collapsed if we didn’t think creatively and act boldly,” Graham said, adding he worked across the aisle to get support for the feasibility study.
In 2012, with the prospects of federal dollars uncertain year-to-year, South Carolina legislators set aside $300 million so the port wouldn’t have to wait on Congress to come through before construction could begin. That money would cover the federal government’s share of the deepening project, with the state getting reimbursed from appropriations years down the road.
Graham said he told S.C. officials at the time that if they fronted the money, he’d eventually get it back to them – a promise realized on Monday.
“We’re in a race to get this done,” Graham recalled telling legislators. “So, let’s go around the bureaucracy.”
When legislators committed the $300 million, that was the total expected price tag for dredging the harbor to 50 feet. Plans later called for a 52-foot depth, and costs went up.
Congress gave its go-ahead to the project in 2015, and construction started three years later – marking the biggest endeavor for the Army Corps’ Charleston office.
“The scale of this work speaks for itself – five major dredging contracts, more than 2 ½ million labor hours, more than one million equipment hours and the removal of more than 40 million cubic yards of dredge material,” said Lt. Col. Todd Mainwaring, district commander of the Army Corps’ Charleston District.
“This project is more than an engineering milestone; it’s a strategic investment in our nation’s infrastructure and economic future,” he said.
While the financial books have now been closed on the deepening project once known as “Post-45,” Melvin said there is more work that needs to be done.
The authority plans to deepen the Cooper River north of the Leatherman Terminal to 52 feet – from its current 48-foot depth – to let the biggest container ships visit an expanded North Charleston Terminal. It’s part of a plan that also involves a new, taller structure to replace the Don Holt bridge along Interstate 526 and expansion of the terminal onto the adjacent former WestRock paper mill site along the riverfront.
Those projects along with Leatherman’s expansion will double the port’s cargo capacity to 10 million cargo containers per year.
“As to the North Charleston component, I think I know what they want me to do,” Graham said. “They want me to help, and we’ll help. If it doubles the capability, it’s money well invested.”

(Courtesy of Doña Ana County)In the wake of further monsoon flooding in July, federal officials over the weekend extended federal disaster aid to include more residents in Southern New Mexico impacted by storms and landslides.
This summer’s deadly and devastating floods have impacted hundreds of homes across the state in separate instances. On July 9, runoff from rains over the 2024 Salt and South Fork burn scar flooded Ruidoso’s rivers and killed three people, including two children; required the rescues of dozens of people; and swept away homes and cars. On July 22, monsoon rains in the deserts of Doña Ana flooded the colonias of Vado around the Rio Grande, flooding at least 110 homes and wrecking infrastructure.
The National Weather Service office in Albuquerque issued a notice that flash flooding risk is high in Ruidoso on Monday through 9 p.m.
With the lack of vegetation and non-absorbant soils in the burn scars, flooding is occurring with very little rain in the Sacramento Mountains around the town, said Todd Shoemake, a lead forecaster at the National Weather Service.
“Our forecast models are indicating pretty heavy rainfall rates, probably raining as much as one to two inches per hour,” he said.
‘We’re just here to pick up the pieces’: Ruidoso digs out in the aftermath of flooding

So far, the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency has allocated $2.7 million for damages related to the floods, including $1.6 million for housing assistance. FEMA has approved 235 requests for individual assistance.
According to the federal disaster declaration updated on Saturday, people affected by floods in Doña Ana and Otero counties, along with the Mescalero Apache Nation, will be able to apply for funds for individual housing needs.
The Aug. 16 amendment will also allow governments to apply for reimbursement for permanent repairs in Lincoln, Doña Ana county and Otero counties, including for the Mescalero Apache Tribe.
Local officials in Lincoln and Doña Ana counties have said they’ll need federal funds to rebuild infrastructure such as bridges or sewer and water services, with initial damage estimates in the tens of millions.

Reeves deploys Mississippi National Guard soldiers to D.C., following other GOP-led states",Michael Goldberg,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/08/18/gov-reeves-deploys-mississippi-national-guard-soldiers-to-d-c-following-other-gop-led-states/,"Reeves, a staunch ally of President Trump, opted to have Mississippi participate in the federal takeover after at least three other Republican-led states had already done so.","Mississippi will send about 200 Mississippi National Guard soldiers to Washington, D.C., to support President Donald Trump’s push to federalize law enforcement in the nation’s capital.
Following the governors of at least three other Republican-led states, Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves said on social media on Monday that he deployed the troops to bolster Trump’s “effort to return law and order to our nation’s capital.”
“Crime is out of control there, and it’s clear something must be done to combat it,” Reeves said. “Americans deserve a safe capital city that we can all be proud of. I know the brave men and women of our National Guard will do an excellent job enhancing public safety and supporting law enforcement.”
The move comes after Trump signed an executive order federalizing local police forces and activating about 800 District of Columbia National Guard members. He did so after claiming the nation’s capital was gripped by  “lawlessness.”
Washington’s elected officials have disputed these claims, noting that violent crime is lower than it was during Trump’s first term in office. Hundreds of residents of the city marched in protest of the federal crackdown on Saturday.
Reeves, a staunch ally of President Trump, opted to participate in the federal takeover after at least three other Republican-led states had already done so. 
West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey said he was deploying 300 to 400 guard troops. South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said he deployed 200 at the Pentagon’s request. And Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said he sent 150 guard military police at Army Secretary Dan Driscoll’s request.
Reeves’ announcement on social media did not say who requested support from Mississippi’s National Guard.
The activations from Republican-led states suggest the Trump administration sees the need for additional manpower after the president personally played down the need for Washington to hire more police officers, according to The Associated Press. 
Trump declared an emergency due to the “city government’s failure to maintain public order.” He said that impeded the “federal government’s ability to operate efficiently to address the nation’s broader interests without fear of our workers being subjected to rampant violence.”
Monday was not the first time Reeves followed other Republican governors in sending National Guard troops outside the state.  
In 2023, Reeves mobilized a National Guard unit to help with security at the U.S. border with Mexico. That came a day after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis sent officers to Texas to assist with border security.
In a letter to city residents following Trump’s executive order, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, wrote that “our limited self-government has never faced the type of test we are facing right now.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/07003054/MG_1717-scaled.jpg,,,2025-08-18 14:57:34.812450

According to Brigham City, which is currently handling press communications, an officer with the Tremonton Garland Police Department responded to a neighborhood near Bear River High School at about 9 p.m. Sunday after someone called 911, then hung up, several times.  
The officer began speaking to someone inside the home — that’s when a man emerged from the house with a gun and began shooting at the officer, killing them, according to Brigham City. 
The man then immediately began shooting at a second Tremonton Garland officer who had arrived at the scene, police say. That officer was also killed. 
“They immediately began taking fire. They requested additional units, and then stopped answering their radio,” said Crystal Beck, a detective with Brigham City, speaking to reporters late Sunday night.   
A deputy with the Box Elder County Sheriff’s Office arrived at the scene, taking fire from the man. The deputy, still sitting in a vehicle, was struck, as was their service dog. Both the deputy and the dog stayed in the vehicle until they were evacuated to a hospital, Beck said. 
After firing on the officers, the Brigham City Police Department says bystanders convinced the suspect to put down his gun. He was taken into custody by other responding officers and is currently in the Box Elder Jail. 
“Our community is deeply saddened by the tragic and senseless act of violence,” Tremonton Mayor Lyle Holmgren said in a statement. “This tragedy is a stark reminder of the dangers faced by those who serve and protect. We must unite — not in division, but in strength — to honor their sacrifice, support their families and stand behind all who dedicate their lives to keeping us safe.” 
Beck said that it’s been years since an officer-involved shooting happened in Box Elder County, which is home to about 57,000 people, according to U.S. Census data.

The legend of 19-year-old Mississippi baseball phenom Konnor Griffin continues to grow and grow with each home run blast, each stolen base, each fielding gem, each promotion. Who knows where he will be when he reaches the legal age of 21?

Rick Cleveland
My guess would be Pittsburgh. And his Major League debut may come sooner than that.
Sunday afternoon, the Jackson Prep star, the No. 1 prospect in all of baseball, was promoted by the Pittsburgh Pirates from high-Class A Greensboro, North Carolina, to Class AA Altoona, Pennsylvania. On Tuesday night, he will be youngest player ever to play for the Altoona Curve  in the Eastern League. He doesn’t turn 20 until April 24, 2026.
“It’s a pretty awesome feeling,” Griffin said in a phone call Monday morning while en route from Greensboro to Altoona, a six-hour drive. “I got the news after the game Sunday when they called a team meeting and the manager told us.”
Making the news all the more exciting for Griffin was the promotion of of one of his best friends, catcher Derek Berg, from Greensboro to Altoona.  The 23-year-old Bird is on a much more traditional baseball career path, having played college baseball (at Army) for four seasons before being drafted in the 10th round of the 2024 Major League draft. In contrast, Griffin was playing for Jackson Prep in May, 2024.
“Derek’s a good friend. We were taken in the same draft together and have been together at Bradenton (low Class A) and Greensboro,” Griffin said. “It’s really neat we are taking this next step together.”
Even though the Pirates drafted Griffin with the ninth overall pick (first high school player chosen) of the 2024 draft, his rapid rise this spring and summer has been nothing short of astonishing, as have his statistics. In 50 games at Bradenton, he hit .338 with plenty of power. In 51 games at Greensboro, he hit .325. Combined, he has hit 16 home runs, 21 doubles and four triples. In the process, he has become a more disciplined hitter. His on-base percentage rose from .396 at low-A to .434 at high-A.
Add to all that Griffin’s combined 59 stolen bases and far above average fielding ability at both shortstop and centerfielder positions. Little wonder the 6-foot-4, 225-pounder last month was named the top MLB prospect in all of baseball.
“It’s been a heckuva year; the hard work is paying off,” Griffin said. 
Has his meteoric rise affected his timeline for making to the Major Leagues?
“I am just trying to live in the moment, not think about all that,” Griffin said. “My goal is to remain humble and continue the hard work that has gotten me to where I am. I just thank God for where he has taken me.”
The last Pittsburgh Pirate to make it to the Class AA level at 19 is Andrew McCutchen, who has since become a five-time All-Star and the National League MVP. In 2013, McCutchen, the 11th pick of the 2005 draft, made it to Altoona in 2006 at 19. He did not make his Big League debut until 2009 at age 22. He has since hit 330 home runs.

Griffin would appear to be advancing at faster rate. Nothing has seemed to faze him, including his ascension to No. 1 MLB prospect not quite a month ago. Even his father, Belhaven softball coach Kevin Griffin, expressed concern at the time that the No. 1 prospect designation would heap more pressure on his son, who only last year was playing high school baseball.
“I have tried not to let it add pressure, but there’s no doubt you have more eyes on you with something like that,” Konnor Griffin said. “I try to take it one step at a time, continue to work hard and give it everything I have.”
Altoona has an off day today before playing a home game Tuesday night against the Reading (Pennsylvania) Fighting Phils.
Griffin expects to remain primarily a shortstop, but also play centerfield on occasion. He was to learn more later Monday upon arrival in Altoona where he will meet with Curve manager Andy Fox, a former Major Leaguer who played for two World Series championship teams.
Said Griffin, who remains as grounded and mature as any 19-year-old I’ve encountered, “I just see it as another challenge and another chance to learn. I can’t wait.”

States and clinicians are working on getting correct information on vaccines to vulnerable groups amid shifting federal guidance. (Photo illustration by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Heading into the respiratory illness season, states and clinicians are working to encourage pregnant patients to get COVID-19 vaccinations, even though the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services no longer recommends that they should.
Along with being older and having an underlying health condition, pregnancy itself is a risk factor. Pregnant women are more vulnerable to developing severe illness from COVID-19. They’re also at high risk for complications, including preterm labor and stillbirth. The vast majority of medical experts say getting the shot is safe and effective — much safer than having the illness.
But HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced in May that the agency would no longer recommend that pregnant women get the vaccine. Before testifying before Congress in June, Kennedy circulated a document on Capitol Hill claiming higher rates of fetal loss after vaccination. But the authors of those studies told Politico that their work had been misinterpreted.
Experts say the federal shift puts the onus on state health agencies to ramp up vaccine guidance and outreach. Clinicians and public health organizations are trying to dispel misinformation and make sure information reaches low-income people and people of color, who had higher maternal death rates during the pandemic. During the first two years of the pandemic, the virus contributed to a quarter of maternal deaths, according to federal data.
“We are severely disappointed,” said Dr. Neil Silverman, a professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California, Los Angeles David Geffen School of Medicine. He has studied vaccines and pregnancy for the past 15 years and specializes in high-risk pregnancies.
Silverman called the federal shift a “public health tragedy on a grand scale.”
Vaccinations against COVID-19 help prevent severe illness in pregnant people as well as their newborns, who are too young to get vaccinated, Silverman said. In what’s called passive immunity, vaccinated mothers pass on antibodies to their babies through the placenta and through breast milk.
“State public health agencies are probably going to have to implement vaccine guidance that differs from the federal recommendations. And that’s going to be an interesting can of worms,” said OB-GYN Dr. Mark Turrentine, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas.
Turrentine serves on a board of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists that focuses on immunization and infectious diseases. He said his recent pregnant patients who had COVID-19 hadn’t gotten the vaccine.
“The change in guidance on the federal level just really makes a lot of confusion, and it makes it very challenging to try to explain to individuals why all of a sudden the difference,” Turrentine said.
A slew of public health organizations have been making a concerted effort to dispel vaccine myths. They include the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit organization of maternal-fetal experts. At a news briefing the society held this month, clinicians stressed the safety and long-standing science behind COVID-19 vaccines, as well as the shots for RSV and the flu. Cases of RSV and the flu tend to peak in the winter months, while in recent years COVID-19 cases have spiked in the summer and the winter.
Dr. Brenna Hughes, an OB-GYN who chairs the organization’s infectious diseases and emerging threats committee, pointed to survey data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing that less than a third of eligible pregnant patients received COVID-19 shots, and only 38% received RSV shots for the 2023 to 2024 season. Less than half — 47% — received flu shots, and 59% received TDAP (whooping cough) vaccines.
CDC data shows that for last year’s and this year’s season, only between 12% and 14% of pregnant patients got the COVID-19 vaccine.
“The complications from the infection are so much greater than the complications and the very few and typically minor adverse events that might occur from the vaccine,” said microbiologist Sabra Klein, a professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
In June, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and 30 other professional health organizations signed a letter urging insurers to continue covering the COVID-19 shot for pregnant women, and have continued to urge coverage since then.
CVS Caremark, one of the nation’s three major pharmacy benefit managers, told Stateline it will continue covering the vaccine for pregnant women. The Arizona, California and North Carolina state Medicaid agencies also told Stateline they are still currently covering COVID-19 vaccines for pregnant women.
Dr. Kimberly Fortner, president-elect of the Infectious Diseases Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology, said during the maternal-fetal medicine briefing that she hopes medical groups’ joint messaging will bolster insurers.
“Hopefully by us linking arms, that can then help develop consistency so that insurers will continue to pay for the vaccine,” she said.
Exacerbating disparities
Dr. Ayanna Bennett, director of the District of Columbia Department of Health, said the federal government’s new stance has upended “a system that’s been stable for a very long time.”
Bennett said her agency used federal pandemic aid to shore up vaccine outreach efforts to communities of color. Now that flow of money is ending.
The changes in federal guidance and funding will “almost certainly exacerbate” maternal health disparities, said Marie Thoma, a perinatal epidemiologist and an associate professor in the University of Maryland Department of Family Science who researches pregnancy and COVID-19.
Black and Indigenous women died at higher rates. The virus exacerbated existing racial disparities in maternal health — and created new ones: Latina mothers, who generally see low rates of maternal mortality, saw deaths surge to 28 per 100,000 in 2021. Their rate was about 12 per 100,000 in 2018, according to federal data.
“We are going in with some exposure already that we didn’t have during the start of the pandemic. So, there will be some protection, but now that will erode,” said Thoma. “If we’re not getting vaccines, or if people are hesitant to take them, we could see some increase.”
Silverman said the administration’s efforts to strip mentions of race from government policies makes it difficult for institutions to reach populations at greatest risk. He called the dismissal of decades of data “saddening and infuriating.”
“The politicization of the vaccine process, or access to it, is what concerns me the most,” said Dr. Yvette Martas, a Connecticut OB-GYN who chairs the board of directors of the Hispanic Health Council.
Many women “are trying to navigate an economic system that’s not always in their favor in terms of also providing access to the kind of educational material that they need,” she said.
Not just COVID-19
In June, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee, replacing them with some members who are vaccine skeptics.
The change is creating chaos. Some states have vaccine laws, such as mandates for kids and coverage statutes, that are specifically tied to the committee’s decisions.










The politicization of the vaccine process, or access to it, is what concerns me the most.


– Dr. Yvette Martas, a Connecticut OB-GYN who chairs the board of directors of the Hispanic Health Council


The Vaccine Integrity Project at the University of Minnesota called on frontline health workers, health officials and professional societies to “counter the spread of inaccurate and confusing vaccine information.”
At a news briefing this month held by the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, representatives from Alabama, Connecticut and Washington, D.C., said they will continue to recommend vaccines.
Alabama’s state health officer, Dr. Scott Harris, said clinicians will be instrumental in getting correct vaccination information to patients.
“We don’t think that we necessarily have the same authoritative voice that we might have had a decade ago in trying to guide people in what to do, but we do believe that people trust their health care providers in most cases and are certainly willing to listen to them,” he said at the briefing.
Bennett said she is hopeful that strong, consistent messaging from respected medical organizations will help combat confusion.
“Having established groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics or the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology make very firm recommendations that keep us essentially not changed from where we have been, I think, should reassure families,” she said.

John G. Rowland's pardon application will not be released to the public, consistent with longstanding policy.","The Trump administration is declining to release the application that former Connecticut Gov. John G. Rowland made for the pardon of two federal convictions granted him by President Donald Trump in May.
The response to a freedom-of-information request by The Connecticut Mirror is consistent with a longstanding policy that applications and supporting documents may be released, but they generally are not.
“Please be advised that a search has been conducted in the Office of the Pardon Attorney but no responsive records subject to the Freedom of Information Act were located,” the Office of the Pardon Attorney said in response to CT Mirror.
The Justice Department says the president and his immediate staff are exempt from the Freedom of Information and Privacy acts, a combination that means the White House is not required to release pardon files but has the discretion to do so.
Trump has been generous in offering pardons, granting more since returning to the White House in January than most presidents recorded over the entirety of their terms.
Rowland’s pardon was among the 1,600 issued by Trump in the first six months of his second term, most coming on the first day, when he pardoned more than 1,500 rioters convicted of assault on police officers and other crimes in the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol. 
By contrast, Trump had granted only one of the 421 pardons requested during the first 8 1/2 months of his first term, and 144 of 1,969 requested over his full four years. His successor, Joe Biden, granted 80 of the 1,666 requests over four years, including one for his son, Hunter Biden.
The Office of the Pardon Attorney lists statistics on pardons and clemency grants for every president from William McKinley through Biden.
Facing impeachment and a federal investigation into bid-rigging involving gifts and favors from state contractors, Rowland resigned July 1, 2004 at nearly the midpoint of his third term. He pleaded guilty to a corruption charge on Dec. 23, 2004. He was sentenced to a year and a day in prison, ultimately serving 10 months. 
He was indicted a second time in 2014, accused of soliciting congressional candidates in 2010 and 2012 to secretly pay him as a consultant in campaigns for his old 5th Congressional District seat in violation of campaign finance laws. He was convicted and sentenced to 30 months in prison.
Given that the 68-year-old Rowland had completed his sentences, the practical impact of the pardon for him was limited. Under Connecticut law, his right to vote already had been restored. 
As the Justice Department notes, a pardon is an expression of forgiveness and does not expunge a criminal record, though it can lift some barriers to employment, housing and education.
“I am very humbled and appreciative,” Rowland said via email after being pardoned in May. “I have been blessed with a wonderful family and friends that have been through a great deal over the years. This is a wonderful final resolution.”
Instructions on seeking a pardon advise that petitioners, and anyone submitting testimony in support, can expect a degree of privacy.
“Non-public documents, such as this petition and supporting documents, the presentence investigation report, the results of any federal background investigation, and the recommendation of the Department of Justice are not generally available under the Freedom of Information and Privacy Acts.”
The instructions warn, however, that the privacy is not guaranteed: “[W]hile pardon-related documents in the possession of the White House traditionally have not been made public, they may be legally disclosed at the discretion of the President.
“In addition, pardon-related documents retained by the White House at the end of a presidential administration will become part of the President’s official library, where they become subject to the disclosure provisions of the Presidential Records Act.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_3192.jpg,,,2025-08-18 13:56:56.867223

As lawmakers weigh courts’ decisions on accessing public land, an advocacy group suggests revisions to a draft bill.
The post Hunters want ‘affirmative’ public access in corner crossing bill appeared first on WyoFile .","A public-access group is asking lawmakers to make several changes in a proposed corner-crossing bill when the lawmakers meet Aug. 19 in Casper to consider the draft legislation.
Now that a federal appeals court has ruled that corner crossing is legal in the checkerboard area of Wyoming, some legislators want state law to reflect that decision. Enacting a new law could eliminate confusion regarding the court ruling, which involves lengthy, complex legal arguments.
Corner crossing is the act of stepping diagonally from one piece of public land to another where they meet with two pieces of private property. Corner crossers do not set foot on private land, but they do pass through the airspace above it.
The draft bill under consideration on Aug. 19 by the Joint Travel, Recreation, Wildlife and Cultural Resources Interim Committee says what corner crossing is not — a trespass. Backcountry Hunters and Anglers urged legislators to write and consider a different version establishing corner crossing as an affirmative right.
“We should not be threatened nor charged with trespass if a toe were to inadvertently touch private land.” Backcountry Hunters and Anglers
The draft bill to be debated in Casper — “Corner crossing clarification” — “suggests more of a ‘negative’ right,” BHA states in comments filed with the committee. The bill would say corner crossing is not trespassing under laws grouped under the titles of “crimes and offenses” and “Game and fish.”
Instead, BHA suggested another measure be written as an “affirmative” bill under the “state lands” title of Wyoming laws. The group pointed to a bill drafted in 2011 as a model. The bill did not become law.
“The language of the 2011 [bill] establishes an ‘affirmative’ right to access,” the BHA wrote. A similar measure today would clarify that “Wyoming’s public land users have the right and the ability to access our public land, and then ensures that in doing so we would not be subject to trespass charges when lawfully accessing public land.”
2020 eruption
The conflict over corner crossing erupted in southern Wyoming in 2020 where land ownership is patterned like a checkerboard of alternating public and public property. That’s when four Missouri hunters corner crossed to hunt public land surrounded by the Elk Mountain Ranch.
Carbon County Sheriff’s Office cited the four for trespass, but a jury found them not guilty. Elk Mountain Ranch owner Fred Eshelman also sued Brad Cape and his three friends in civil court in 2022 for trespassing.
Courts ruled against Eshelman, saying an 1885 law prevented him from blocking the hunters’ access. Eshelman has petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to take up the case and overrule the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals decision against him.
Looking for new Wyoming legislation, the hunters’ group also recommended other changes to the committee’s draft bill, including allowing incidental trespass in cases where landowners have not surveyed their property but pursue trespass charges nevertheless.

“The choice of a private landowner to not [survey] cannot be used as a reason to keep public land owners off public land,” the group wrote lawmakers. “If we do our part by properly accessing public land at the corner where the two parcels meet, we should not be threatened nor charged with trespass if a toe were to inadvertently touch private land in the process.”
BHA also believes the committee’s draft bill should not include language about property damage.
“By adding property damage into these sections, the Legislature would be conflating property damages with criminal trespass,” the hunters say. “These are two different crimes, and should likely be handled separately.”
The group wants the committee to consider drafting a second bill and postponing final action on the current bill until lawmakers meet again in November. The committee could then discuss both options, BHA said.
By November’s meeting there may be more developments regarding Eshelman’s Supreme Court petition, BHA said. It is possible the U.S. Supreme Court will have decided by November whether to take up the case or simply let the 10th Circuit decision stand.
Sheriff Bakken to follow law
As hunting season began Friday, the Carbon County sheriff said he will follow the appeals court’s OK of corner crossing. Sheriff Alex Bakken’s office cited the hunters in 2021 for trespassing even though they did not set foot on Eshelman’s ranch.
Bakken posted a community update on Facebook on the opening day of archery season that outlines his department’s policy. “One of the most common questions we have been receiving from the hunting public is how we are handling corner-crossing,” the sheriff wrote.
“Until further clarification is received, the Carbon County Sheriff’s Office will be operating under the United States Court of Appeals-10th Circuit Decision in the case of Iron Bar Holdings v. Cape,” Bakken wrote.
Iron Bar Holdings LLC is the name of Eshelman’s company that officially owns the 20,000-acre-plus ranch on the wildlife-rich Elk Mountain.
Bakken stopped short of describing what corner crossing is or where the ruling applies, instead providing a link to the court’s decision. In that 49-page decision reached in March, a three-judge panel stated “Iron Bar cannot implement a program which has the effect of denying access to federal public lands for lawful purposes.”

After reporters found dozens of firms hiding privacy tools from search results, US senator Maggie Hassan insisted the companies explain their practices—and pledge to improve access to privacy controls.


This story is copublished with WIRED.
United States senator Maggie Hassan is pressing major data brokers after an investigation by The Markup/CalMatters and copublished by WIRED found at least 35 firms hid opt-out information from search results, making it harder for people to take control of their own data and safeguard their privacy online.
Hassan, the top Democrat on the Joint Economic Committee, put five of the top firms—IQVIA Digital, Comscore, Telesign Corporation, 6sense Insights and Findem—on notice Wednesday, demanding that each explain why code on their sites appears designed to frustrate deletion requests.
None of the companies immediately responded to WIRED’s request for comment. None previously responded to requests for comment during the investigation.
California law requires brokers to provide a way to delete personal data; however, the investigation found dozens of registered brokers obscuring their opt-out tools by hiding them from Google and other search results. Consumer advocates called it a “clever work-around” that undermines privacy rights and may qualify as an illegal dark pattern—a design decision that, according to California’s privacy regulator, erodes consumer “autonomy, decision making, or choice when asserting their privacy rights or consenting.”
Hassan wants the firms to justify the placement of their opt‑out pages; acknowledge whether they used code to block search indexing and, if so, against how many users; pledge to remove any such code by September 3; and provide Congress with recent audit results and steps taken since the investigation, if any, to improve user access.
“Data brokers and other online providers have a responsibility to prevent the misuse of consumer data, and Americans deserve to understand if and how their personal information is being used,” Hassan wrote, citing other tactics variously employed by the firms—forcing users to scroll through multiple screens, dismiss needless pop-ups and hunt for links in shrunken text.
Behind the scenes, data brokers fuel a multibillion-dollar industry that trades in detailed personal information—often gathered without a person’s knowledge or consent. They compile sprawling dossiers often packed with precise location histories, political leanings and religious affiliations, then sell and resell those profiles, powering everything from hyper‑targeted ads to law‑enforcement surveillance.
Even among the small share of Americans who know this surveillance ecosystem exists, fewer still grasp its true scale—or the ways it can shape, influence, or intrude on their lives.
Earlier this year, the Trump administration quietly abandoned a proposed rule that would have sharply limited brokers’ collection and sale of Americans’ data by treating certain brokers as “consumer reporting agencies” under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. At the same time, contract documents show the US intelligence community is preparing a centralized marketplace to streamline purchases of commercially available data—giving agencies shared access to large repositories of sensitive information without the court orders otherwise required for traditional surveillance.
For survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking, the risks are acute. The National Network to End Domestic Violence’s Safety Net Project warns that data brokers collect and sell vast amounts of information that can put survivors at risk, adding that opting out is already a burdensome, piecemeal process, forcing people to contact companies one by one, navigate hard-to-find forms and resubmit deletion requests regularly as information is re-collected and re-listed.
“Instead of requiring people to navigate byzantine labyrinths to protect their personal information, these companies have a responsibility to make the tools that allow Americans to exercise their right to privacy easy to find and use,” Hassan told WIRED.
Sean Vitka, the executive director of Demand Progress, a nonprofit advocacy group critical of the industry, compared the surveillance ecosystem underlying commercial data markets to the knotted tails of a rat king—an inseparable tangle of entities sustained by unchecked data flows. “The damage done by data brokers manifests in countless ways,” he said, “but it’s all enabled by the same predatory abuse of consumers’ data.”
“And consistent with what we’re seeing here, the industry cannot be trusted to mitigate its own harms.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/021925-Maggie-Hassan-REUTERS-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-18 13:56:56.867223

(Photo illustration by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Heading into the respiratory illness season, states and clinicians are working to encourage pregnant patients to get COVID-19 vaccinations, even though the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services no longer recommends that they should.
Along with being older and having an underlying health condition, pregnancy itself is a risk factor. Pregnant women are more vulnerable to developing severe illness from COVID-19. They’re also at high risk for complications, including preterm labor and stillbirth. The vast majority of medical experts say getting the shot is safe and effective — much safer than having the illness.
But HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced in May that the agency would no longer recommend that pregnant women get the vaccine. Before testifying before Congress in June, Kennedy circulated a document on Capitol Hill claiming higher rates of fetal loss after vaccination. But the authors of those studies told Politico that their work had been misinterpreted.

Experts say the federal shift puts the onus on state health agencies to ramp up vaccine guidance and outreach. Clinicians and public health organizations are trying to dispel misinformation and make sure information reaches low-income people and people of color, who had higher maternal death rates during the pandemic. During the first two years of the pandemic, the virus contributed to a quarter of maternal deaths, according to federal data.
“We are severely disappointed,” said Dr. Neil Silverman, a professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California, Los Angeles David Geffen School of Medicine. He has studied vaccines and pregnancy for the past 15 years and specializes in high-risk pregnancies.
Silverman called the federal shift a “public health tragedy on a grand scale.”

Vaccinations against COVID-19 help prevent severe illness in pregnant people as well as their newborns, who are too young to get vaccinated, Silverman said. In what’s called passive immunity, vaccinated mothers pass on antibodies to their babies through the placenta and through breast milk.
“State public health agencies are probably going to have to implement vaccine guidance that differs from the federal recommendations. And that’s going to be an interesting can of worms,” said OB-GYN Dr. Mark Turrentine, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas.
Turrentine serves on a board of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists that focuses on immunization and infectious diseases. He said his recent pregnant patients who had COVID-19 hadn’t gotten the vaccine.
“The change in guidance on the federal level just really makes a lot of confusion, and it makes it very challenging to try to explain to individuals why all of a sudden the difference,” Turrentine said.
A slew of public health organizations have been making a concerted effort to dispel vaccine myths. They include the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit organization of maternal-fetal experts. At a news briefing the society held this month, clinicians stressed the safety and long-standing science behind COVID-19 vaccines, as well as the shots for RSV and the flu. Cases of RSV and the flu tend to peak in the winter months, while in recent years COVID-19 cases have spiked in the summer and the winter.
Dr. Brenna Hughes, an OB-GYN who chairs the organization’s infectious diseases and emerging threats committee, pointed to survey data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing that less than a third of eligible pregnant patients received COVID-19 shots, and only 38% received RSV shots for the 2023 to 2024 season. Less than half — 47% — received flu shots, and 59% received TDAP (whooping cough) vaccines.
CDC data shows that for last year’s and this year’s season, only between 12% and 14% of pregnant patients got the COVID-19 vaccine.
“The complications from the infection are so much greater than the complications and the very few and typically minor adverse events that might occur from the vaccine,” said microbiologist Sabra Klein, a professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
In June, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and 30 other professional health organizations signed a letter urging insurers to continue covering the COVID-19 shot for pregnant women, and have continued to urge coverage since then.
CVS Caremark, one of the nation’s three major pharmacy benefit managers, told Stateline it will continue covering the vaccine for pregnant women. The Arizona, California and North Carolina state Medicaid agencies also told Stateline they are still currently covering COVID-19 vaccines for pregnant women.

Dr. Kimberly Fortner, president-elect of the Infectious Diseases Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology, said during the maternal-fetal medicine briefing that she hopes medical groups’ joint messaging will bolster insurers.
“Hopefully by us linking arms, that can then help develop consistency so that insurers will continue to pay for the vaccine,” she said.

Exacerbating disparities

Dr. Ayanna Bennett, director of the District of Columbia Department of Health, said the federal government’s new stance has upended “a system that’s been stable for a very long time.”
Bennett said her agency used federal pandemic aid to shore up vaccine outreach efforts to communities of color. Now that flow of money is ending.
The changes in federal guidance and funding will “almost certainly exacerbate” maternal health disparities, said Marie Thoma, a perinatal epidemiologist and an associate professor in the University of Maryland Department of Family Science who researches pregnancy and COVID-19.
Black and Indigenous women died at higher rates. The virus exacerbated existing racial disparities in maternal health — and created new ones: Latina mothers, who generally see low rates of maternal mortality, saw deaths surge to 28 per 100,000 in 2021. Their rate was about 12 per 100,000 in 2018, according to federal data.
“We are going in with some exposure already that we didn’t have during the start of the pandemic. So, there will be some protection, but now that will erode,” said Thoma. “If we’re not getting vaccines, or if people are hesitant to take them, we could see some increase.”
Silverman said the administration’s efforts to strip mentions of race from government policies makes it difficult for institutions to reach populations at greatest risk. He called the dismissal of decades of data “saddening and infuriating.”
“The politicization of the vaccine process, or access to it, is what concerns me the most,” said Dr. Yvette Martas, a Connecticut OB-GYN who chairs the board of directors of the Hispanic Health Council.
Many women “are trying to navigate an economic system that’s not always in their favor in terms of also providing access to the kind of educational material that they need,” she said.

Not just COVID-19

In June, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee, replacing them with some members who are vaccine skeptics.
The change is creating chaos. Some states have vaccine laws, such as mandates for kids and coverage statutes, that are specifically tied to the committee’s decisions.

The Vaccine Integrity Project at the University of Minnesota called on frontline health workers, health officials and professional societies to “counter the spread of inaccurate and confusing vaccine information.”
At a news briefing this month held by the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, representatives from Alabama, Connecticut and Washington, D.C., said they will continue to recommend vaccines.
Alabama’s state health officer, Dr. Scott Harris, said clinicians will be instrumental in getting correct vaccination information to patients.
“We don’t think that we necessarily have the same authoritative voice that we might have had a decade ago in trying to guide people in what to do, but we do believe that people trust their health care providers in most cases and are certainly willing to listen to them,” he said at the briefing.
Bennett said she is hopeful that strong, consistent messaging from respected medical organizations will help combat confusion.
“Having established groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics or the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology make very firm recommendations that keep us essentially not changed from where we have been, I think, should reassure families,” she said.

(Photo via Getty Images)Health insurance-related tasks are so time-intensive and complex that many clinicians and claims processors in New Mexico are blaming them for compromising patient care and driving health care workers out of the field, according to the authors of a forthcoming study commissioned by the state Legislative Council Service.
Doctors and nurses reported spending at least three to four hours per week on billing tasks, according to the report produced by two researchers at the University of New Mexico Center for Social Policy. The pair is set to present the report Tuesday during a legislative meeting. 
Center for Social Policy Executive Director Gabriel Sanchez and Research Assistant Professor Melanie Sonntag in May and June conducted focus groups and interviews with 31 clinicians and other workers who determine whether insurance will cover care, Sonntag told Source NM.
Participants, who are not identified by their names or workplaces in the study, told the researchers a lot of their time is wasted by prior authorization, which is when a health care provider must get permission from an insurance company before either seeing a patient or administering a treatment, Sonntag said in an interview on Tuesday.
A clinician who participated in the study told Sonntag they spend up to half of their time with each patient just doing documentation and prior authorization, she said. Another physician in emergency medicine told her they try to see as many patients as possible and use their time outside clinical hours to handle billing and insurance tasks, which others have warned will burn them out.
“This is time that could be spent with patients,” Sonntag said. “It’s really frustrating for patients and clinicians that they can’t spend that much time with patients to address their health concerns and are instead spending a lot of time on these administrative tasks.”
Sanchez and Sonntag concluded that there needs to be deep structural change to ensure that people can receive proper health care and that clinicians don’t get burnt out and leave, she said.
“The discussions we had with healthcare professionals suggest that the system is in need of significant revision that may not be possible without considering moving to another model,” they wrote in the study, according to a news release last week from the Health Security for New Mexicans Campaign, a group that advocates for affordable health care.
Sonntag said one structural change she thinks makes sense would be the campaign’s proposal called the Health Security Act, which would  provide health insurance for about 1.8 million of New Mexico’s 2 million residents, or everyone except for federal retirees and members of the military. Under the proposal, the insurance pool would be funded by the premiums workers and employers already pay to private insurance companies.
“They’re really trying to design something that works for our state, and we know New Mexico has our own challenges and ways we like to address things,” Sonntag said.
That legislation was most recently introduced to the Legislature in 2019 but didn’t pass. Another bill that would have tasked the state Office of the Superintendent of Insurance with studying the issue also died in 2022.
The idea has met opposition at the Roundhouse from the state chapter of the National Association of Benefits and Insurance Professionals. Proponents of the legislation have included the New Mexico Medical Society, the professional organization for physicians in the state. Source NM sent requests for comment to both organizations and will update this story as needed.
It’s already well-documented that the United States spends an increasing amount of money on administrative tasks in health care, and more on health care overall than comparable countries, Sonntag said. But the upcoming study illuminates how prior authorizations and the billing cycle make it even more difficult for health care providers in rural areas to care for patients when they’re already dealing with insurance companies denying claims because people are “out-of-network.”
The two researchers are slated to present their findings to the interim Legislative Health and Human Services Committee in Gallup on Aug. 19. Legislative committee meetings between sessions can sometimes, but not always, lead to a lawmaker introducing a specific legislation proposal.
“This is like every academic’s dream but I’m hoping to accomplish system-level change,” Sonntag said about the study. “I think it would be amazing to really reform the system to make sure that health care can be patient-centered.”

In the complaint, the Chippewa Cree Indians of the Rocky Boy’s Reservation and a couple of  tribal members are suing the county, the commissioners, and the clerk and recorder alleging the county’s at-large elections are unlawful.
The plaintiffs want the U.S. District Court’s Great Falls Division to find Chouteau County’s at-large elections for its three commissioners don’t comply with the Voting Rights Act.
They also want the court to implement a redistricting plan that doesn’t dilute the Native American vote.
The complaint requests the court order a plan “that provides at least one Native American voting-age majority single-member commissioner district that effectively performs for the Native American candidate of choice.”
In a statement provided by the ACLU of Montana, Chippewa Cree Tribe Chairman Harlan Gopher said it’s time for the county to respect the rights of its Native voters.
“We’re filing this lawsuit because Chouteau County continues to hold elections in which the Native votes don’t count,” Gopher said in a statement. “The Chippewa Cree Tribe filed this lawsuit to prevent this local government from trampling on the civil rights of our people. A fair redistricting process must respect the boundaries and voice of our Nation.”
The Native American Rights Fund and ACLU Foundation also are representing the plaintiffs.
The Chouteau County Attorney was out of the office Friday and unavailable for comment until Monday; he could not be reached Monday morning before publication.
The complaint said Montana law requires at-large elections unless a court orders otherwise, and Chouteau County meets the conditions for a claim of vote dilution under the Voting Rights Act.
Those conditions are that the minority group is sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a single-member district; that the minority group be politically cohesive; and that the majority vote usually defeat the minority’s preferred candidate, the lawsuit said.
“Native Americans in the county are sufficiently numerous and geographically compact to constitute a majority of the voting-age population in one single-member district,” the lawsuit said.
  (Screenshot from complaint)
The county overlaps with roughly one third of the reservation, the lawsuit said. It said in the county, 25.8% of the population is Native American (“alone or in combination”), as is 20.71% of the voting-age population.
But “to plaintiffs’ knowledge, no Native American has been elected to the Board of Commissioners nor to any other countywide office for at least the past ten years,” the lawsuit said.
The results mean Native Americans in the state and Chouteau County continue to experience the effects of discrimination, tribal members allege.
“Native Americans have a lower socioeconomic status and lag behind non-Hispanic white residents in a wide range of areas, including employment, income, education and access to health care,” the lawsuit said.
Ken Morsette, a plaintiff and member of the Chippewa Cree Tribe, said Native voters need a fair election system, and they need the ability to elect a commissioner who understands Native issues and is willing to collaborate with the tribe.
“The three local representatives currently in power do little that benefits the Native taxpayers in this part of Montana and adopted a system that prevents us from being able to vote them out,” Morsette said in a statement provided by the ACLU of Montana. “Until our votes matter, too, we’re stuck under their thumb.”
The lawsuit said the tribe notified commissioners in November 2023 that at-large elections were in violation of the Voting Rights Act, and the tribe offered to work with the county on a solution “to avoid unnecessary expense to the county’s taxpayers.”
The tribe wanted to create a district map with commissioners that complied with the Voting Rights Act and could be jointly submitted to Montana’s federal district court for approval, the lawsuit said.
  (Screenshot from complaint)
On Dec. 5, 2023, legal counsel for the tribe met with commissioners, the county clerk and the county attorney “to discuss a simple resolution,” and the tribe’s counsel followed up by email on Dec. 11, 2023, and again on Jan. 19, 2024, according to the complaint.
“To date, the county has not responded to the Tribe’s proposal,” the lawsuit said.
As such, the complaint said the court’s intervention is necessary. 
The lawsuit also argues the “totality of the circumstances” supports the plaintiffs’ claim they have less opportunity to participate in electing commissioners.
For one thing, it said, Montana has a “long and well-documented history of voting discrimination” against Native Americans, including that it passed a law as soon as it became a territory to limit voting to “white male citizens.”
It said legislators have continued attempts to restrict Native Americans from voting in Montana in the current day, and tribal members are boxed out of decisions in the county.
“To Plaintiffs’ knowledge, the county has never consulted the Chippewa Cree Tribal Council on policy decisions that affect the tribe,” the lawsuit said. 
The lawsuit asks the court to permanently stop the county from conducting at-large elections and order it to implement a plan that protects the rights of the Native American voters.
“Fair representation isn’t just about numbers on a map — it’s about the dignity of knowing our voices count,” said plaintiff and voter Tanya Schmockel, of the Chippewa Cree Tribe, in a statement. “Without that, we remain invisible in decisions that affect every part of our lives. This case is about making sure our community finally has the same say in who serves as commissioner as every other voter in the county.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-3521-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-18 13:56:56.867223

(Courtesy of Applied Digital) Applied Digital, the company operating data centers near Ellendale and Jamestown, on Monday announced plans to build a $3 billion data center at Harwood, north of Fargo. 
Applied Digital plans to break ground in September on what it calls Polaris Forge 2, a  280-megawatt artificial intelligence computing center. 
The plan calls for two facilities with room for expansion. Applied Digital has contracted more than 900 acres for its campus and secured power through Cass County Electric Cooperative, a member-owned nonprofit. The data center is expected to employ more than 200 full-time workers, in addition to long-term contractors.
Applied Digital said in a news release that it is expanding in North Dakota because the state has abundant energy, available land and a pro-business climate.
“The demand for AI capacity continues to accelerate, and North Dakota continues to be one of the most strategic locations in the country to meet that need,” Wes Cummins, CEO of Applied Digital, said in the news release. 
Harwood is a town of about 800 people north of Fargo along Interstate 29. 
“Applied Digital’s investment reflects confidence in our people and our potential, and we’re proud to be part of this moment,” Harwood Mayor Blake Hankey said in the news release.
AI driving data center demand at accelerating pace 

Applied Digital has invested in housing and other infrastructure in Ellendale, a town of about 1,100 near the South Dakota state line, where it operates Polaris Forge 1.
“North Dakota wins when companies like Applied Digital choose to be more than an employer.” Gov. Kelly Armstrong said in the news release. “In Ellendale, they invested in people through workforce housing and created strong local partnerships that strengthen the community.” 
Applied Digital data centers house banks of computers owned by tech companies that provide artificial intelligence and other services. 
The tech companies lease space from Applied Digital, which builds climate-controlled facilities to keep the computers cool, clean and operating efficiently.
Data centers use tremendous amounts of power, which will be supplied by Cass County Electric Cooperative, a member of Grand Forks-based Minnkota Power Cooperative. 
“Our focus is on making sure it is integrated in a way that strengthens our communities, supports reliable and responsible power, and builds on the strong foundation we have established through more than 85 years of service to this region,” Mac McLennan, Minnkota Power Cooperative president and CEO said in the news release.

Nick Phillips, executive vice president of Applied Digital who works from the Ellendale campus, spoke last week in Fargo at an artificial intelligence summit organized by the Fargo Moorhead West Fargo Chamber. 
He said data centers are beneficial to communities, providing good jobs for people in the skilled trades, such as electricians, and adding to the tax base.

Applied Digital, with a campus just outside of Ellendale, requested to be annexed into the town to increase tax revenue for Ellendale.
At the same Summit, U.S. Rep. Julie Fedorchak said North Dakota’s ability to provide power and a home for data centers is important for national security. 
“Where I see incredible opportunity for North Dakota is using that resource, the incredible energy resources we have to help provide the power to develop this incredible industry here in America, not over in India and China,” she said.

Bowyer admitted to operating an illegal gambling business, money laundering, and filing a false tax return. He failed to report more than $4 million in income in one tax year, according to the government’s motion to the judge, filed Friday, to impose a sentence outside federal guidelines.
Bowyer’s business “placed and accepted bets on sporting events for its clients, and employed agents and sub-agents, including casino hosts, who referred and recruited clients, demanded and collected on bettors’ losses and distributed winnings, and were paid a portion of the losses bettors incurred and paid,” says the government’s motion.
The proposed sentence, scheduled to be imposed next week, is far less than the 41 to 51 months calculated in the government’s presentence report, and rewards Bowyer for his lack of criminal history and “substantial assistance to the government,” including in its prosecution of Ohtani’s interpreter, Ippei Mizuhara, and fellow bookie Damien LeForbes.
Mizuhara is serving a 57-month sentence for stealing $17 million from Ohtani. LeForbes is awaiting sentencing for operating an unlawful gambling business and money laundering.  
Bowyer’s information “contributed to the government’s ability to interpret recovered text messages and execute a search warrant on Leforbes in December 2023,” the motion says, adding he provided additional information in January 2024. 
LeForbes declined to comment on the record on the revelation that Bowyer cooperated against him. 
“I met with Matt Bowyer over a year ago and he said he told his lawyer he wasn’t giving up his players or his friends, just the dirty casino executives,” high stakes gambler Robert (R.J.) Cipriani, who worked as a confidential source for the government, said Monday. 
LeForbes, Bowyer, and another gambler lost an estimated $24 million, much of it laundered gambling proceeds, at Resorts World Las Vegas. 
The Current was first to report two years ago that federal authorities out of California were investigating allegations that gamblers with questionable sources of income were gambling at Resorts World and MGM Grand. 
MGM paid a $7.45 million fine as part of a non-prosecution agreement with the feds, and paid $8.5 million to Nevada regulators. Resorts World paid a $10.5 million fine to the Nevada Gaming Commission. An anticipated nonprosecution agreement between federal prosecutors and Resorts World has yet to materialize. 
“It’s unconscionable that two bookies are likely going to jail yet the Resorts World executives who got caught up in it move down the street to another casino,” Cipriani said. 
Bowyer, the government says, has accepted responsibility for his conduct and is making restitution on unpaid taxes as part of his plea agreement. His sentencing is scheduled for next week.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/resorts-world_exterior_hero-expanded-1-e1723756620194-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-08-18 12:58:15.399001

Patrick Morrisey’s executive order allowing religious exemptions to the state’s strict school vaccination requirements. 
The organizations refiled the complaint Friday in Kanawha County Circuit Court. They originally filed the lawsuit May 23 on behalf of Marisa Jackson, of Kanawha County, and Dr. Joshua Hess, of Cabell County. Jackson and Hess are both parents of immunocompromised students. Hess is also a pediatric hematologist and oncologist practicing at Marshall Health’s Cabell Huntington Hospital. 
It names as defendants the state Department of Health, Bureau for Public Health along with Justin Davis, interim commissioner for public health and Arvin Singh, the state’s cabinet secretary for the health department. 
In July, Kanawha Circuit Judge Kenneth Ballard dismissed the lawsuit for procedural reasons, agreeing with an attorney for the state who argued that the organization failed to give the 30-days notice required by state law when suing a governmental agency. 
In the refiled complaint, the organizations note that the judge originally dismissed the lawsuit because of its failure to “adequately articulate a claim for injunctive relief” rather than a deficiency with its constitutional claims.  
“This action is now ripe for re-filing with pleadings that cure the procedural deficiencies identified by the court,” they write. “The underlying constitutional violations that prompted the original litigation remain unaddressed and continue to cause ongoing harm. Additionally, Plaintiffs/Petitioners have gained substantial insight into the unconstitutional manner in which 
Defendants/Respondents are interpreting and applying the relevant statutory provisions,  strengthening both the factual foundation and legal theories supporting this renewed challenge.” 
In a news release Monday, the organizations said they’re seeking emergency relief to protect students as the new school year begins. 
“Time is running out to protect West Virginia’s schoolchildren from a dangerous and unconstitutional policy,” ACLU-WV Legal Director Aubrey Sparks said in the news release. “While our previous case was dismissed on procedural grounds, the core of this issue is clear: What the state is doing violates the law and the West Virginia Constitution. We’re asking the court to act immediately before more children are put at risk.”
“This isn’t just about policy — it’s about protecting real children who will be sitting in classrooms next week,” Mountain State Justice Director Sarah Brown said in the news release. “Gov. Morrisey is gambling with children’s lives to score political points. We’ve seen what happens in other states when vaccine requirements are weakened, and we won’t let that happen here in West Virginia.”
The ACLU’s lawsuit is at least the second lawsuit filed in regards to the question of Morrisey’s executive order and the state’s school vaccination requirements. Morrisey’s executive order is still in place after the Legislature this year voted down a bill that would have inscribed religious exemptions into state code. 
A Raleigh County judge last month ruled in favor of the parents of three students who were issued a religious exemption to the vaccination requirements and sued the state Board of Education for instructing school boards not to accept the exemptions. 
Morrisey has argued the state’s school vaccination law should be read alongside the state’s 2023 Equal Protection for Religion Act to mean that families should get religious exemptions to the immunizations.
As West Virginia students head back to the classroom for the year, rules about vaccination requirements may vary by school.
The state Board of Education has not changed its guidance that public schools should accept only medical exemptions to vaccines. 
The governor’s executive order does not apply to private schools, leaving them to decide whether to follow state law or the executive order. 
The West Virginia Professional Charter Schools Board earlier this month voted to tell the state’s seven charter schools to follow the executive order and accept religious vaccination exemptions. That action led the state Board of Education last week to send a letter to the charter school board instructing it to follow the state’s school vaccination law, not the executive order. 
Morrisey and the state Department of Health did not immediately return an email seeking comment. 
In a post on the social media platform X last week, Morrisey promised that families seeking religious exemptions would win either in court or through legislative action. 
‘Hold strong. I recognize that the Board [of Education] is creating hardships for families but we will keep pushing,” he wrote.

(Getty Images)Glencoe Public Schools filed a suit in Payne County District Court Thursday against the Oklahoma Secondary School Activities Association over its decision to disallow some students from playing basketball due to an alleged rule violation.


According to the lawsuit, the OSSAA says the students violated Rule 24, also known as the “Linked Rule,” a controversial provision intended to keep students from transferring from following a coach to a new school district.
Three of the four named students in the lawsuit attended a team camp in May at Glencoe with Coach Garrett Schubert. The students later applied through the transfer portal when it opened in June.
But, according to the lawsuit, OSSAA said the students should have unenrolled from their previous districts first.
Glencoe’s attorney, Hannah Whitten with the firm Whitten Burrage, said there is no OSSAA provision requiring that.
“There’s been no requirement to unenroll your kid before the school year starts and before the transfer portals open,” Whitten said. “So they did everything to the letter of the law.”
The plaintiffs appealed OSSAA’s decision at a Wednesday hearing, but the Board of Directors voted unanimously to uphold its ruling.
The suit requests an order from the court determining the OSSAA’s ruling to be unreasonable, as well as a temporary restraining order and permanent injunction against OSSAA’s enforcement of the rule on the students.
The plaintiffs in the suit are the student athletes’ families, Glencoe Public Schools and Coach Garrett Schubert.
Plaintiffs have submitted sworn testimony that no recruiting occured. Whitten also said OSSAA released guidance on May 20 that said summer participation before June 1 would not affect student eligibility.
Rule 24 has been the target of Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond. Drummond ordered the organization to end its enforcement in September. In response, OSSAA temporarily suspended its enforcement of the rule.
Lawmakers voiced support for the students in a Thursday news release.
“Oklahomans believe in fairness and opportunity. OSSAA’s decision here undermines both, and it’s why the Legislature must look closely at reforming how these decisions are made,” Sen. Avery Frix (R-Muskogee) said.
In a statement to StateImpact, Gov. Kevin Stitt urged the OSSAA to reconsider its position and let the students compete.
“When I fought for open transfer, it was to ensure that every student in Oklahoma had equal opportunity to succeed. For many students, athletics are an essential part of a well-rounded education,” Stitt said. “It is disappointing that OSSAA would continue to perpetuate a system that bars students from the opportunity to compete — especially when many students rely on the opportunity athletics provides to pursue higher education.”
A spokesperson for OSSAA declined to comment, citing the litigation.

Fagan Harris, Moore’s chief of staff, will leave his post Jan. 5 to become the next president and CEO of the Abell Foundation, according to a statement issued by the philanthropic nonprofit.
“Fagan shares the Abell Foundation’s steadfast commitment to the people of Baltimore, and he will honor our organization’s legacy while leading the next chapter of our work,” Christy Wyskiel, chair of the Abell Foundation Board of Trustees, said in a statement Monday.

“Abell has spent decades investing in Baltimore – its people, its neighborhoods and its future, and Fagan shares our unwavering belief in the potential of Baltimore,” her statement said.
A spokesperson for Moore did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.
Talk of Harris’ departure — specifically to the Abell Foundation — has circulated for weeks.
Harris, 38, grew up in Bowie and in Anne Arundel County, and attended local public schools.
After graduating from Stanford University, Harris, like Moore, became a Rhodes Scholar. That connection led to Moore later becoming a mentor.
He and Moore launched Baltimore Corps in 2013, a nonprofit employment and grant-making agency.
The organization connects overlooked job seekers with positions in public service, nonprofits and the private sector. During the pandemic, the nonprofit focued on recruitment in the city’s public health workforce.
Moore tapped Harris as his chief of staff in 2022, soon after the election.
Harris will succeed Robert C. “Bob” Embry Jr. in leading the Abell Foundation. Embry joined the nonprofit in 1987.

(David Stephenson/Kentucky Lantern)SHELBYVILLE, Kentucky – A Kentucky church is urging its members to permanently remove books from the Shelby County Public Library by checking them out and never returning them. The books portray gay characters and historical figures or explore LGBTQ+ themes.
Pamela Wilson Federspiel, who has been director of the library in downtown Shelbyville for 34 years, says the action is tantamount to “stealing.”
But three leaders of the Reformation Church of Shelbyville defend what they call an “act of civil disobedience.”

  Austin Keeler
“Yes — we have urged Christians, both locally and across the country, to search their libraries for books that promote sodomy, gender confusion and rebellion against God — and if found, to check them out and never return them as an act of civil disobedience,” pastors Jerry Dorris and Tanner Cartwright and Austin Keeler, an evangelist with the church mission, Reformation Frontline Missions, recently told the Lantern in an email.
The library has “lost” 16 books valued at $410.85 since a member of the church checked them out last year with due dates in late June 2024, said Federspiel. Some of the books were written for children, some for adults. (The list of books is at the bottom of this story.)
Federspiel did not identify the library patron and said the books were never returned after several notices.
The titles include “The Art of Drag,” “My Two Moms” and “My Two Dads.”
Chris Hartman of Louisville, executive director of the Fairness Campaign, said he has never considered “theft to be a form of civil action.”
He also said he has never heard of a church encouraging its members “to steal from a public institution. It is shameful, unfortunate and disrespectful.”
Such activity often backfires by making people, especially young people, curious about the books and giving them more attention, he said.
  Author Sarah Prager
Sarah Prager of Boston wrote one of the 16 books the Shelby County Public Library has “lost.” It is called “Kind Like Marsha: Lessons from LGBTQ+ Leaders”  and  is for juveniles. Amazon.com says it celebrates 14 LGBTQ+ people throughout history, like politician Harvey Milk, scientist and painter Leonardo da Vinci, Mexican artist Frida Kahlo and Marsha P. Johnson, who took care of her trans community on the streets of New York City.
“My book is not about sexual acts. It is about real, caring people — and what is wrong about that? A library must always have a diverse inventory.  We can never let that change,” Prager said.
Complaints about books increase
The church posted its recommendation to check out certain library books and not return them in a 2 minute, 57 second video on its Facebook page on June 1, 2024.  Church leaders said recently their message has not changed.
“Friends, the Shelby County Public Library is promoting the vile LGBTQ agenda to groom and trans children in Kentucky,” a script accompanying the video says.
“Would you help us expose what’s happening here?” it asks before providing contact information for two library officials and listing books the church found objectionable.
Complaints about books to public libraries are not new but are growing in Kentucky and the United States. There were 302 challenges to Kentucky public libraries in 2024, up from only 26 in 2023, according to the state Department of Libraries and Archives annual Statistical Report of Kentucky Public Libraries released in April.
But rare, if ever, is the practice condoned by the Shelbyville church for making books disappear from the shelves.
“Strategically checking out books with no plans to return them as a method of permanently removing certain books from local public libraries is not a common practice, at least not one that has been reported to KDLA,” said Jill Midkiff, a spokesperson for the  Kentucky Education and Labor Cabinet and the Kentucky Department for Libraries and Archives (KDLA).
  Suzanne Trimel
PEN America, based in New York, tracks book bans and fights censorship across the country. Spokesperson Suzanne Trimel said she has never heard of the  book-removal tactic recommended by the Shelbyville church, though some conservative churches have urged members to seek public office to be in a position to censor LGBTQ+ books. She’s also heard of hiding controversial books where they aren’t likely to be found on library shelves
PEN America has seen censorship activities in public schools and public libraries intensify, she said, as public libraries have responded to pressure by canceling author visits and drag story hours.
Trimel said public libraries also have been under pressure from the “Hide the Pride” campaign, largely led  by a conservative Catholic advocacy organization called CatholicVote.  In 2022, the leaders of CatholicVote estimated 50 to 100 libraries were targeted for “Hide the Pride.”
The campaign instructs parents to go to the children’s section of a public library and check out all “Pride Month” books on the display shelves. The parents return the books on time but place them on other shelves out of reach of children.
The Reformation Church of Shelbyville does not return controversial books removed from the Shelby County library.
The church’s stance
Pastor Dorris said the church became aware of the controversial books when a member took their children to the library and the “children were exposed to some of them. Upon investigation they discovered the remaining books.”
Like librarian Federspiel, Dorris declined to identify the patron. He said the family did not want any public attention. Records of books checked out by patrons of public libraries are not subject to Kentucky’s Open Records Act, said Amye Bensenhaver, co-founder and co-director of the Kentucky Open Government Coalition.
  The Shelby County Public Library in Shelbyville, Aug. 5, 2025. (David Stephenson/Kentucky Lantern)
Dorris said he is uncertain where the checked-out books are now. “They have not been destroyed to my knowledge.”
He said his independent church, which “shepherds 357 souls,” is taking a “public stand against sexual perversion being pushed upon children through taxpayer-funded institutions.” It will continue to take that stand without apology, he said.
“This is not literacy — it’s grooming,” Dorris said.
Asked about the removal of public property, Dorris said, “We reject the idea that civil rebellion is only legitimate when it’s done with rainbow flags or Marxist slogans. Civil disobedience is a biblical category when obedience to God and love for neighbor demand it.”
Dorris said that when the church discovered the controversial materials in the local library, it contacted Shelby County’s state senator and representative. It also contacted the library’s staff and its board members “to express our deep concern and call for action.”
“No library staff or board member ever followed up with us, no request has been made for the return of these books, and — tellingly — the books themselves have not been replaced. Not that we would return them — but the silence itself speaks volumes,” said Dorris.
Matt Burgin, president of the library’s board of trustees, said Federspiel told the board about the situation but no one else has ever contacted him about the books.
The library has handled it like other cases of overdue books, he said.

Dorris said he did talk to then-state Sen. Adrienne Southworth, R-Lawrenceburg, but he would not divulge their conversation. She could not be reached for comment. State Rep. Jennifer Decker, R-Waddy, did not return phone calls to her Frankfort office seeking comment.
Dorris stressed that the book action is not a formal position of the Reformation Church and “not every member of our church is aware of and agrees with these actions, and that’s acceptable. We don’t discipline or pressure members over strategy. These actions — like the permanent removal of library books — were taken by individual Christians under personal conviction. We support their right to act or refrain in good conscience.”
The library’s stance
The 16 books director Federspiel says are “lost” due to the efforts of the Reformation Church range in cost from $19.99 to $35.
The library offers a variety of books for a diverse community, she said. “All are library property.”
Library materials that are not returned are not available for other patrons, said Federspiel, who declined to have her photo taken for this article. “The library is committed to providing materials that meet patron needs. Materials that are not returned are not available for other patrons. Replacing lost material is costly.”
Amanda Perry-Davis, the library’s collection manager, said the library acquires books generally based on their popularity. That can be determined by various book reviews, journals and magazines. Library professional journals recommended the “lost books” as appropriate titles for each age level.
Patrons also suggest specific books to acquire, said Perry-Davis.
Federspiel, who is retiring at the end of the year, said several staffers also provide their input on what books to buy but the final decision is hers.
  Shelby County Public Library, Aug. 5, 2025. (David Stephenson/Kentucky Lantern)
Federspiel said that most of the “lost books” had not been in high demand by library patrons. 
The library left a voicemail message with the patron about the overdue books and issued three other notices before turning the matter over to a collection agency, Unique Management, after 60 days, she said. The replacement cost is added to the patron’s card but so far the books remain missing.
Church has other targets besides library
The church has engaged in more public protests, including against a now closed Shelbyville bar and a fall fundraiser in Cynthiana in which people dress up as witches.
The church protested The Barrel Room, formerly a bar in downtown Shelbyville, for holding drag shows and the city’s conference center for allowing “drag queens to dance in front of children.”The church branded Cynthiana “a hotbed of witchcraft” in response to the Harrison County seat’s Witches’ Day Out event.
“These displays grieve the heart of God and signal our community’s descent into spiritual decay,” said Pastor Dorris. “We do not hate the men who perform in drag, nor the librarians, nor the critics who accuse us of being hateful. We love them enough to tell the truth — that Jesus Christ is Lord, that sin leads to hell, and that the gospel alone can set people free.”
The Barrel Room closed in October. Vicki Jones Lee, a local gay rights advocate, said she saw several drag shows there. “We would hear the protesters outside, making a lot of noise. The shows would just go on,” she said.
A spokesperson for the conference center said the center became the site for a Pride event in the summer of 2023 “to help it find a public venue.

James Smith, executive director of the Cynthiana-Harrison County Chamber of Commerce, said “Witches Day Out” is part of the community’s annual Halloween festivities. Participants dress like witches and try to raise money for a needy cause such as helping a family whose child had brain cancer
“It’s not a cult, it’s not a religion. Cynthiana’s Witches Day Out is a fun, community event with 130-plus vendors, food, readings, and a Victorian seance-themed Crystal Ball on the first Saturday in September in downtown Cynthiana to kick off the fall season,” said committee member Sam Lunger.
“But it is disappointing to hear anyone say it involves witchcraft. Everyone is entitled to free speech but this is misleading and out of bounds. We do provide a free space for the church protesters.”
Drag shows and witches are taboo to the church but it has given most attention to books.
Consequences
Dorris, the pastor, expects “some sort of reaction against the church” for its book removal efforts but does not know exactly what that will be.
“We know there will be consequences for saying what others are afraid to say. We will not be silent. We will not comply. We will not flinch. Our duty is to God, and our aim is the good of our neighbors — even those who revile us,” he said.
Madison Markham, a staff member on PEN America’s Freedom to Read team, said, “The alarming rise of book bans and censorship in the country is and will continue to have devastating consequences in our communities in the years to come.
“Regardless of whether you are a student, a parent, a librarian, an author, or a community member, this is an issue that affects all of us. Access to books with LGBTQ+ representation helps LGBTQ+ people and their families feel seen, and builds empathy. Everyone deserves the right to read and to be exposed to diverse ideas and experiences.”
Mark Adler, director of the Paris-Bourbon County Public Library and last year’s winner of the Kentucky Public Library Association’s Intellectual Freedom Award, acknowledges that community members have the right to voice their concerns about materials in a public library but suggested it be channeled through a reconsideration request.
Each individual library has its own reconsideration process, as each community is unique in its makeup just as the local library collections are, he said. “These reconsideration requests provide an avenue for community members to file objections while also providing a structured, consistent process for libraries to follow when requests are filed. We encourage community members who have questions to bring those directly to their local libraries so we can work with the affected citizens to address their concerns.”
Shelby County’s Federspiel concurred, adding a public library should always celebrate books for all kinds of people.
In 1903, when Andrew Carnegie built the library in Shelbyville and donated $10,00 to it  “he had inscribed on the floor as you enter …  ‘A University for the People,’ showing his dedication to unite communities,” she said.
“To this day, we proudly honor these words by acquiring acquisitions that celebrate both inclusiveness and diversity of our community.”

As he and the other driver exchanged information, a Georgia State Patrol officer pulled up and asked for their licenses. Madrid, who arrived in the U.S. from Honduras as a teenager and was awaiting a court hearing for his asylum claim, didn’t have one.
“There’s no public transportation where we’re at, no Uber or Lyft,” said his wife, Jacqueline Maravilla, about his choice to drive. “Everything’s 45 minutes from everything. It’s a calculated risk we have to take to support our family.”

This story is part of “Trump Two: Six Months In,” a series from The Marshall Project that takes stock of the administration’s efforts to reshape immigration enforcement and criminal justice.

That risk has grown even greater for thousands of immigrant families under the Trump administration, as officials expand efforts to deport people with little or no criminal history.
The monthly number of people deported whose most serious conviction was a traffic violation — such as driving without a license — has more than tripled in the last six months, hitting almost 600 in May, according to new estimates by The Marshall Project. In total, over 1,800 people with traffic violations have been deported this year.
People with no criminal convictions at all make up two-thirds of the more than 120,000 people deported between January and May. For another 8%, the only offense on their record was illegal entry to the U.S. Only about 12% were convicted of a crime that was either violent or potentially violent. The numbers contradict officials’ continued claims that immigration enforcement is focusing on the “worst of the worst” criminal offenders.
The numbers are estimates from a Marshall Project analysis of Immigration and Customs Enforcement data, provided to the Deportation Data Project in response to a FOIA request. The group noted the dataset may be incomplete and could undercount the true numbers of deportations.
ICE officials did not respond to a request for comment.

For many facing removal, the crimes on their records are years old. So far this year more than 600 people have been deported whose most serious convictions were marijuana-related offenses, and in three out of four cases, the offense occurred at least five years ago.

“It’s not at all about convictions anymore,” said Tim Warden-Hertz, a directing attorney of the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, a Washington-based legal organization. “There is no discretion. It’s just trying to get as many people as they can, any way that they can.”
Historical data from the Deportation Data Project shows that previous administrations also deported people with no convictions or only minor offenses, but the numbers have increased under Trump. From President Biden’s inauguration through the end of fiscal year 2023, the last day with available data, over half of the people deported had no criminal conviction. During that period, an average of 80 people a month were deported with only traffic offenses, compared with an average of over 350 per month so far under Trump’s second term.
Some of Trump’s advisors have said publicly that the administration’s goal is for 3,000 ICE arrests each day. But in recent court filings, immigration officials have denied having a quota.

Some attorneys worry this pressure to deport more people is leading to an increase in racial profiling, and that more drivers of color are being pulled over for minor traffic violations as a way to check their legal status. Twenty states have recently passed laws that increase local police’s involvement in immigration enforcement. And a growing number of police departments are signing agreements with the Department of Homeland Security to enforce federal immigration laws during encounters like routine traffic stops.
“We hear people pulled over for minor reasons, like a broken blinker, crossing the yellow line, or the tint is too dark on windows,” said Paul R. Chavez, director of litigation and advocacy for Americans for Immigrant Justice, a Miami-based nonprofit. “People are arrested for those very minor things, brought to jail, fingerprinted, and then handed over to ICE.”
Chavez noted that many people are being charged solely with driving without a license, a crime police generally discover only after making a traffic stop. “If you’re pulled over and that’s the only accusation, in my mind that’s pretty clear evidence of racial profiling,” he said.
The number of people deported with only nonviolent offenses — like trespassing, failure to appear in court, marijuana offenses, shoplifting and traffic violations — has almost doubled since January.
After Madrid’s accident, he says he passed a breathalyzer test. But he admitted he had smoked weed the night before, 18 hours prior. The Georgia State Patrol officer arrested him on charges of driving without a license and driving under the influence.
Madrid’s only existing conviction was for driving without a license in 2019, he said. Back then, “He got arrested, I bailed him out, he had a court date, he paid the fine,” Maravilla said. “And that was the end of it.”
Things went differently this time. After Maravilla paid Madrid’s bond, ICE officers picked him up and ultimately took him to Stewart Detention Center, south of Columbus, Georgia. A judge denied his release from detention, citing the DUI charge for marijuana use the night before the accident. But the hearing in his criminal case wouldn’t happen until the following summer. Madrid had to decide between spending at least a year stuck inside a remote, overcrowded detention center — or leaving his wife and family behind.
In early July, Madrid opted to self-deport to Honduras. Maravilla, a U.S. citizen who has never been on a plane and doesn’t have a passport, is working to save enough money to visit him and bring him some of his belongings. The two were married just three weeks before his arrest.
“It’s a deep pain,” Madrid told The Marshall Project in Spanish. “I am not there with my wife, cannot see my mother and give her a hug, or help them with what I earn from my work. Listening to my wife cry on the phone has been something I do not wish for anyone.”

The stage at the north end of the Green featured a variety of live bands, DJs, and MCs that kept a small dance floor’s worth of people moving in front of them, while others lounged in lawn chairs nearby. 
The aisles among the dozens upon dozens of vendors, meanwhile, buzzed with conversation, as potential patrons checked out streetwear, African imports, beauty products, small business services, resume help, event planners, and even the chance to have an ultrasound party. 
One vendor sold posters with portraits of the businesspeople of Black Wall Street in Greenwood, in Tulsa, before it was burned to the ground in a race massacre in 1921. ​“Black Wall Street: We Did It Before, and We Can Do It Again,” his t‑shirt read.
That was the scene Saturday at an event that has become a staple of late summer in New Haven. 
The Green was a maze-like bazaar of vendors, offering everything from clothing and jewelry to mental health and legal services. Throngs of people walked the aisles, perusing what the vendors had. It was also a chance for friends to run into one another, and a chance for families to hang out on the Green, listen to live music, and get a meal from a row of food trucks that lined the curb along Temple Street. It was a celebration of Black entrepreneurship and community, and with the event seeing its biggest year yet, it showed how the two easily went hand in hand.
“Honestly, it feels amazing,” said David Burgess of The Breed, which organized the event with the city’s Economic Development Administration as a partner. Citing Breed founders Aaron Rogers and Rashad Johnson, among others, Burgess said ​“it was just a team coming together,” but ​“bringing people together like this is really a blessing.”
“The Breed has been a great partner over all four years,” said Michael Piscitelli, the city’s economic development administrator. ​“The logistics have worked really well again this year, to stage this many vendors on the Green.” He noted that Black Wall Street had under 30 vendors in its first year, about 100 in its second year, about 200 last year, and more than 200 this year. ​“People are out here spending money, enjoying the time, the music, and celebrating a really cool event here in the city.”
Burgess cited the trust The Breed has worked to build in the community as one ingredient in Black Wall Street’s growth. ​“We try to bring people together, and we try to support as many Black businesses as we can that we see in the city because there’s a need for it,” he said.
Among the vendors was painter Kayla Staples, whose business went by the name Black N Artsy. Staples got into art as a child in Stockton, Calif., ​“as a way to create, get my hands on things, then make my own little reality, and I’ve been hooked ever since,” she said. She made her way to New Haven, she said, for love (and school) by way of Texas and upstate New York. The diversity of her experiences is reflected in her art, which runs the gamut from still lifes and landscapes to more surreal and collage-like pieces.
“I really like the 3‑D side of things,” she said of a series of portraits depicting people in ski masks. Usually, she said, it’s taboo to touch art; ​“I wanted something you could literally feel,” she said, and ​“I wanted to show the unity behind the masks.” People may be very different from one another, but ​“we’re still people, whether Black, brown, a hunter, or from the street.” A portrait of a melting face, she said, is ​“an embodiment of how I was feeling at the time,” suffering a sadness. 
Staples got interested in Black Wall Street because ​“I am a Black artist, and I figured it would be the right audience for me. I get a lot of inspiration from my culture.” She motioned toward a series of portraits she did of people’s mouths, each decorated with elaborate grills. Additionally, a few friends encouraged her to try vending. She participated in her first Black Wall Street last year and it went ​“amazing,” she said. It was her first time being a vendor anywhere, ​“so I was a little nervous, but it went so well. That’s what brought me back again this year,” which was going ​“equally well.” She looks forward to keeping on developing as both an entrepreneur and an artist.
“AI can’t do this,” she said.
Nearby was a booth for Melanin Skein, where Alexa Monrose was on hand selling crocheted hats, tops, dresses, and other items. Monrose started crocheting as a hobby in 2022 as a ​“Christmas gift to myself,” she said. She bought supplies from JoAnn Fabric. She took a trip to Jamaica with her family and decided to make her own clothes for that. She started making things for other people ​“kind of randomly,” she said. This April, a cousin’s hairdresser asked her to make a piece for her daughter after striking up a conversation and seeing pictures of what she’d made. The daughter came to pick up the piece and loved it, and ​“that’s when she told me about Black Wall Street.”
She spent the summer making an array of pieces to sell, following her own tastes of leaning toward bright colors while also keeping an eye on what current fashion trends were. She figured she might have made it a business in time, but ​“Black Wall Street probably got my face out there for people to know.”
“I’m a proud, first-generation Haitian girl trying to make it,” she said. ​“I’m trying to take my crochets, my talents, into the fashion world,” and ​“I’m trying to make a deal with myself.”
As afternoon moved into evening, Black Wall Street showed no sign of slowing down. The Breed hopes to make the event even bigger next year. ​“I’m always a go bigger and better man,” Burgess said. ​“We love our city and we love the people. Keep God first and we’ll continue to keep striving and keep growing.”

Missouri lawmakers are poised to return to Jefferson City next month to redraw the state’s eight congressional districts in order to gerrymander the Kansas City-based seat of Democratic U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver. They’re also considering changes to the initiative petition process to make it harder for Missourians to change the state constitution.
Both have been longtime priorities of the Freedom Caucus, a group of hard-right GOP state lawmakers whose quarrels with party leaders led to years of Missouri Senate gridlock.
Yet after years of holding outsize sway in Missouri politics, the Senate Freedom Caucus is down to only two members.
State Sen. Rick Brattin, a Harrisonville Republican and former caucus chairman, quit in June following a break with the group over a $1.5 billion incentive package to finance stadiums for the Chiefs and Royals.
State Sen. Brad Hudson of Cape Fair, who also voted in favor of the stadium bill, soon joined him. He told The Independent last week that his differences with the caucus focused on tactics, not policy.
Right-wing ‘Freedom Caucus’ launches at Oklahoma Capitol

“I’ve got nothing but respect for my friends in the Freedom Caucus,” Hudson said.
The departures mean only two state senators from St. Charles County — Nick Schroer and Adam Schnelting — are still aligned with the Freedom Caucus.
Schroer, who took over as caucus chairman after Brattin stepped down, insists the group is “stronger than ever” despite the loss of half its Senate membership.
There are 11 members of the caucus in the House, Schroer said, and numerous candidates likely to join the group who are running in GOP primaries for open Senate seats next year. Not to mention, he said, Missouri’s secretary of state and two congressmen are Freedom Caucus alums.
“I’m not concerned whatsoever that at this moment we only have two very strong senators,” he said. “And I think those numbers are going to grow. But just like in years past, there are going to be senators who may not be wearing the Freedom Caucus insignia, but they are going to be with us on 99.9% of issues.”
But the caucus’ dwindling numbers in the Senate, where its influence was always most acutely felt, has some wondering if its days in the center of the Missouri political spotlight are drawing to a close.
It began in 2018, when a group of GOP senators formed what they called the conservative caucus.
The group’s formation set off an escalating war with Republican leadership that culminated four years later when acrimony became so bad that the Senate adjourned a day early for the first time since a fixed adjournment date was set in the state constitution in 1952.
Soon after, the conservative caucus announced it was disbanding.
A year later, six Republican senators — most of whom were part of the conservative caucus — announced the formation of the Missouri Freedom Caucus.
And the Republican civil war resumed almost immediately.
The 2023 legislative session saw Freedom Caucus members using near-daily procedural maneuvers to gum up the Senate. Republican leadership responded by stripping caucus members of committee assignments and musing about their expulsion.
The 2024 session saw no improvement, resulting in fewer bills passed than any year in living memory, including the COVID-shortened session in 2020.
Throughout the turmoil, the group kept losing members.
State Sen. Cindy O’Laughlin, a Shelbina Republican, quit in 2021, telling The Independent at the time that she grew tired of the group’s disruptive tactics. She went on to become majority leader and president pro tem of the Senate, routinely squabbling with her former caucus colleagues.
GOP state Sen. Jill Carter of Granby left the group last year, saying she could no longer in good conscience be a part of “actions behind the scenes that defame grassroots and violate the needs of my constituents.”
Tensions in the Senate cooled this year, with term limits pushing key figures on both sides of the fight out of the chamber. The detente led to a much more productive session, marked more by partisan squabbling than GOP infighting.
That changed after Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe called lawmakers back into special session in June to pass incentives aimed at keeping the Chiefs and Royals from moving to Kansas.
The Freedom Caucus vowed to oppose the funding scheme, which it decried as a “handout to billionaire sports team owners.” But Brattin and Hudson voted in support of the plan after a provision was added making changes to local property tax bills.
Both were accused of betraying the caucus’ principles, with the group’s longtime political adviser publicly calling for the Freedom Caucus to “disband and join the uniparty that runs Jefferson City.”
Brattin quit soon after, saying he opposed the stadium funding but voted in favor after the property tax provisions were added that he believed would benefit his constituents.
Hudson quit a month later.
“I agree with the caucus probably on 95% of the issues,” Hudson said, “and I intend to continue to be allies with them and work with them on issues that we agree on. There have been some times where tactically, there may have been some disagreements where I may have wanted to go a different direction.”
Schroer said the fact that the legislature is poised to debate a congressional map that seeks to eliminate the Democratic-leaning seat in Kansas City shows the Freedom Caucus is anything but dead.
“Back in 2022, the Freedom Caucus pushed for a 7-1 map and couldn’t get enough Republicans to help us,” he said. “Now we’re going to do it.”
The overarching goal, he said, is that the Freedom Caucus will pull the party to the right so the caucus will no longer need to exist at all.
“When we’ve got enough of these strong-willed conservatives that are able to stand up to the establishment and stand up to special interest groups, hopefully at that point we’ll have a majority of the majority,” he said, “ and there will be no need for the Freedom Caucus.”

U.S. Army National Guard and Navy Veteran Tripp Adams announced in late July he would be suspending his campaign in order to prioritize his mental health. On Monday, Adams offered his support to former special victims prosecutor Christina Hines. 
“I want to endorse Christina as a friend, and as the leader that Macomb and Oakland counties need,” said Tripp Adams, “As a veteran and as a small business leader, when I sat down with Christina, I felt heard and seen. Christina has the plan, the leadership, and experience as a warrior fighting for us as a prosecutor to win this race and take care of the people in our community – not just Democrats, but people from all walks of life. That’s why I’m excited to endorse her campaign today.”

Hines noted her gratitude for Adams’ endorsement, with the two becoming friends in their time on the campaign trail. 
“I have deep respect for Tripp’s service to our country, his commitment to our democracy, and his determination to fight for everyone in our community. I’m glad to have him as an advisor and friend,” Hines said. 
While Michigan’s 10th Congressional District is held by U.S. Rep. John James (R-Shelby Township), James’ decision to seek the governor’s seat in 2026 has left the battleground seat open to competition. 
According to the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, the seat leans Republican, however Michigan 10 has been listed as a key target for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
Two Republicans have stepped up to succeed James in holding the district for Republicans: Michigan Open Carry Inc. President Casey Armitage and former Macomb County Assistant Prosecutor Robert Lulgjuraj.
With Adams exiting the race, four candidates are expected to face off in the Democratic primary. Alongside Hines, former state Rep. Tim Greimel, attorney Eric Chung and U.S. Army veteran Alex Hawkins are vying for the nomination.

HOLLAND — Ottawa County residents continued to call for the closure of the coal-fired J.H. Campbell coal plant on Friday, decrying a Trump Administration order in May that prevented the facility from closing as planned earlier this year.
“The Campbell coal plant is Consumers Energy’s last coal power plant (in Michigan), and it’s one of the biggest contributors to pollution in our entire state,” said Indigo Umlor, of the Michigan League of Conservation Voters, which organized the protest along with the Sierra Club and other local activist groups.
The 18-year-old Byron Center resident said the majority of county residents don’t want the plant to continue operations because it’s driving up energy bills for residents and remains a major contributor to air pollution in the area.

Campbell coal plant in Port Sheldon Township to close. [ONN photo/Dirk Wierenga]“We don’t want that by our lakes. We don’t want that by any of us,” Umlor said. “The closure of the plant was planned for years and years, and it was projected to save Michiganders $600 million by 2040, but instead, Bill Huizenga has chosen to align with MAGA politicians and align with keeping this plant open for longer. This plant is costing about $1 million per day to stay open, and in the last five weeks, has cost taxpayer dollars about $30 million.”
 How we got here

The protest, which marched from downtown Holland’s Window on the Waterfront to U.S. Rep. Bill Huizenga’s Holland office, was the second protest this week over the controversial continued operation of the Campbell plant, which has become the epicenter of a legal battle between the U.S. Department of Energy and Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel.
On Tuesday, a group of lawmakers, health professionals and other officials held a press conference in the shadow of the Campbell plant, calling on federal officials to withdraw a May 23 federal order exercising wartime powers to force Consumers to keep the plant available for operation for 90 days.
The plant, operating since 1962, was originally scheduled to close partially in 2030 and wholly in 2040. But the utility announced in 2021 it was moving the plan up by 15 years for an operations end date of May 31, 2025.
Consumers has said closing the plant was expected to save Michigan ratepayers $600 million by 2040.
The utility was seeking to end coal use altogether by 2025 as part of its goal to achieve carbon neutrality.
  The J.H. Campbell plant in Port Sheldon Township, operating since 1962, was scheduled to close partially in 2030 and wholly in 2040. Consumers Energy, however, announced in 2021 it was moving the plan up by 15 years for May 31, 2025. [ONN photo/Sarah Leach]On May 23, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright directed the Midcontinent Independent System Operator in coordination with Consumers to ensure that the 1,560 megawatt plant “[remain] available for operation, minimizing any potential capacity shortfall that could lead to unnecessary power outages.”
The Energy Department said the emergency order is authorized by Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act and is in accordance with President Trump’s Executive Order: Declaring a National Energy Emergency to ensure that power generation availability in the region does not “dip below 2024 capacity levels.”
The order came just eight days before the plant was scheduled to shut down.
Wright said the move was intended “to minimize the risk of blackouts and address critical grid security issues in the Midwestern region of the United States ahead of the high electricity demand expected this summer.”
“This administration will not sit back and allow dangerous energy subtraction policies threaten the resiliency of our grid and raise electricity prices on American families. With President Trump’s leadership, the Energy Department is hard at work securing the American people access to affordable, reliable, and secure energy that powers their lives, regardless of whether the wind is blowing or the sun is shining.”
In June, Nessel — along with a collective group of public interest organizations, Minnesota and Illinois, Maryland Office of People’s Counsel, and the Organization of Midcontinent Independent System Operator States — challenged the DOE’s order to keep the Campbell plant in Port Sheldon Township to remain open for 90 days, arguing that the move will force customers to absorb exorbitant costs.
Nessel filed a request for rehearing with the DOE, challenging what she described as an “arbitrary and illegal order seeking to stop the planned retirement of Consumers Energy’s J.H. Campbell coal-fired power plant in West Olive, Michigan, under the pretense of a fabricated energy emergency.”
She said the order “will burden Michigan utility customers with unnecessary costs and needless additional pollution from the 60-year-old Ottawa County coal plant that was scheduled to close May 31.”
When the DOE didn’t respond to Nessel’s request within 21 days, she filed a petition for review July 24 with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Washington, D.C., Circuit, challenging the U.S. Department of Energy’s order, claiming the “arbitrary and illegal” move forced the continued operation of the plant “under the pretense of a fabricated energy emergency.”
“This unprecedented order by the Department of Energy declares an emergency without evidence, completely ignores state and federal regulators that approved the plant’s retirement, and will potentially put enormous costs onto utility customers who receive no real benefit,” Nessel said. “I will continue to fight to protect Michigan customers from unreasonable costs imposed by the federal government.”
Last month, Nessel also filed a pleading before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in response to Consumers’ request to recover the costs from running the Campbell plant beyond its initial retirement date. That proceeding is still ongoing.
Katie Carey, director of media relations for Consumers, said Tuesday that the utility is continuing to comply with the DOE order and has requested “the timely recovery of costs associated with plant operations.”
“We expect FERC will take timely action on our request. Our FERC filing from Friday, June 6, requests approval of a mechanism to recover and allocate those costs through MISO.
 Frustration mounts with residents

“This is a clear example of how the Trump Administration doesn’t care about what the constituents want. This is why we’re out here protesting,” Umlor said. “We need to show Bill Huizenga and the rest of the MAGA party that we don’t support their actions. As a matter of fact, we support our Earth.”
Friday’s protest drew nearly 100 participants, who displayed signs with slogans like “Huizenga: Listen to the people,” “Leave coal in the ground” and “My asthma and my wallet can’t afford coal.”
Dr. Steven Ashmead, a family physician and a member of the Michigan Clinicians for Climate Action, said coal-fired plants pose serious negative health effects to residents, which is part of well-settled science.
“Public health of Michigan is more important than the political favors the Trump administration owes in coal, in the fossil fuels for over 60 years,” Ashmead said.
He said the burning of fossil fuels has caused pollution that has led to widespread health issues for many Michigan residents.
“We cannot stress that enough pollutants like carbon dioxide, particulate matter, nitrous oxide, sulfur dioxide and toxic metals such as arsenic, lead, mercury and radioactive radon exposure is highest to those of us living closest to the plant right now,” he said. “However, those westerly winds blow those emissions straight to Grand Rapids and beyond. The coal ash contains at least 17 toxic heavy metals, including lead, mercury, cadmium, all of which damage human health and at least six neurotoxins and five known or suspected carcinogens.”
Ruby Muehlenz, a local youth activist who grew up in Holland, said keeping the Campbell open is a short-sighted move that perpetuates bad energy policy.
“Energy bills are just too damn high, guys,” Muehlenz said. “I’m in college, I’m at an apartment, I’m paying my own bills. It’s cost us already almost $30 million … energy prices will rise across the Midwest. Young people … we’re trying to create our own future.”
 Local politics involved

In February, the Ottawa County Board of Commissioners approved a resolution in a 10-1 vote urging a delay in the plant’s closure pending a second look by state regulators; however, they stopped short April 22 of approving a resolution that would have brought litigation to prevent the closure altogether.
At the time, the 10 Republicans on the board cited concerns over reports from energy watchdog agencies that warned of possible brownouts and blackouts in summer 2025 if more generating facilities were taken offline.

[ONN photo/Cathy Seaver]Board Vice Chair Josh Brugger, who voted in favor of the board’s May resolution, said earlier this week that commissioners merely intended to protect county residents from potential grid instability.
“My intention was that we were deferring to the state of Michigan’s authority and for them to weigh in and provide a second opinion on whether it should or should not be closed. Like, full stop right there,” he said Tuesday.
Board Chair John Teeples echoed his colleague’s comment.
“The resolution was to ask the [MPSC] to relook at this issue, in light of the concern that the grid was in jeopardy, at risk. That’s all it was, and that’s where it ended, even though other people wanted to go beyond that,” Teeples said Tuesday.
“Some wanted to start a lawsuit, which I thought was absolutely ridiculous and a waste of taxpayer dollars without any foresight about what it could mean,” he said. “So, all we were doing was raising the flag and that was it. That’s the extent. From my perspective, the county should go no more, no less. There’s nothing wrong with asking our elected officials or regulators to make sure you’ve got your T’s crossed, your I’s, dotted. That’s all this was, and that’s where it should stay.”
 What’s the cost?

In a June 3 statement, a Consumers spokesperson said the company is currently complying with the order.
“We are currently in compliance with the order, have arranged for new shipments of coal, some of which arrived last week, and will continuously operate the Campbell Plant,” Trisha Bloembergen, West Michigan media relations specialist, said in a June 3 email. “We are still determining the overall cost, but want to ensure those costs are shared across MISO and not all on Consumers Energy customers.”
Generating power at the Campbell plant is likely to be costly for ratepayers, experts from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis wrote June 5.
Campbell Units 1 and 2, which are 63 and 58 years old, respectively, were already increasingly uncompetitive in the MISO market, meaning it cost more to generate electricity than what it could be sold for, said energy data analysts Seth Feaster and Dennis Wamsted.
According to data filed by Consumers at FERC, the operation and maintenance costs for the two units totaled $45.80 per megawatt-hour (MWh) in 2023 (the most recent data available). That puts both units in the red almost all the time in MISO: S&P data shows that the monthly around-the-clock price at the Michigan hub has been above $40/MWh just twice in the past two years, and never during the summer.
“In other words, the plant would lose money on virtually every MWh generated if past prices hold this summer, costs that could add up to many more millions of dollars if the units at Campbell are run for any substantial amount of time,” Feaster and Wamsted said.
Beyond operational costs, there are fuel and staffing costs as well.
“Coal itself has gotten more expensive,” said Frank Rambo, executive director at Horizon Climate Initiative, a nonprofit organization that works to use cost-saving energy market reforms to address the causes and impacts of climate change.
“That fleet has gotten more expensive to run. It’s coal, which used to be synonymous with cheap power. It’s now among the most expensive power … and then the excess costs that are incurred because they’re running more expensive resources.
Ultimately, it will be residents who foot the bill, Rambo said.
“They run those coal plants, and then they turn around, go to their commissions and recover those excess costs from their customers,” he said.
Rambo said the price could be even higher than normal because Consumers would need to buy coal on the open market rather than enter into a new contract with a mine.
“We don’t need to sign a new long-term coal supply contract because we’re shutting the plant down,” he said. “Now they may have to buy coal on the spot market.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-17-080620-1024x688.png,,,2025-08-18 10:24:13.711171

Roger Marshall and President Donald Trump.","Christy Davis, one of three candidates seeking the Kansas Democratic Party's nomination for U.S. Senate, is eager to challenge in 2026 incumbent U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall, a Republican loyal to President Donald Trump. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Democrat Christy Davis’ campaign for U.S. Senate is steeped in the politics of incumbent Republican Sen. Roger Marshall and President Donald Trump.
But the resident of Cottonwood Falls is also driven by frustration that many folks holding power in Washington, D.C., have been quick to disenfranchise Kansans with no interest in placing a Marshall sign in the yard or branding themselves by wearing a MAGA cap.
“All Kansans are served by their elected officials, or should be,” Davis said on the Kansas Reflector podcast. “When you’re elected to the U.S. Senate, you’re representing everyone in the state regardless of who they voted for.”
“Kansans deserve the best representation, and we’re not getting it in Washington,” she said. “Register to vote, show up at the polls and help however you can.”


Davis said Marshall, who won a competitive race in 2020 and has committed to seek reelection in 2026, chose to be among the Senate GOP’s most partisan members rather than bring civility to the job.
“There’s not enough resources in the world … for us to be spending all of our energy fighting each other,” she said. “Kansans need to know that they’re being heard, not just the ones who are invited to private meetings.”
Davis, who hasn’t held elective office, launched one of three bids for the Kansas Democratic Party’s nomination for Senate. In terms of the August 2026 primary, her rivals would include Michael Soetaert of Wellington and Anne Parelkar of Overland Park.

‘Fight for what’s right’
Davis grew up in Harvey County and earned degrees at Kansas State University and Wichita State University. She worked as a preservation planner for the city of Newton and was a preservation officer with the Kansas Historical Society. She moved to Chase County in 2013 to become executive director of Symphony in the Flint Hills.
“The Flint Hills is one of the most endangered landscapes on the planet and so we were really focused on conservation of that landscape,” Davis said.
From 2023 until January, she was state director of rural development for the U.S. Department of Agriculture in the administration of President Joe Biden. The job was to deliver hard-to-fund projects important to communities, she said.
“During the Biden administration, we invested about $1.3 billion in projects in Kansas and worked on housing, local business, energy efficiency in agribusiness and also a lot of hospitals, clinics, child care, those sorts of projects,” she said.
Davis is married with a son. She said her grandfathers served in World War II, one as a surgeon and the other with soldiers who helped liberate concentration camps. She said their service wasn’t easy, but they did it because they “understood the importance of right and wrong, and they believed that it was an American value.”
Davis said her sister was a physician who died while advocating for the Affordable Care Act, the landmark law signed by President Barack Obama that reshaped health care in the United States.
“I tell people I’ve survived 36 hours of labor, and I’ve survived a double mastectomy, and after that, it doesn’t seem so hard to fight, to fight for what’s right,” Davis said.

‘It’s an embarrassment’
Davis ran for the U.S. House in 2020 but lost the Democratic primary. That 1st District campaign was won by U.S. Rep. Tracey Mann, a Republican who still serves a district stretching from Dodge City to Lawrence.
The last time Kansas elected a Democratic candidate to the U.S. Senate was in 1932. Both of the state’s Senate seats have been held by Republicans since 1939.
“Sometimes there are other factors at play besides who the best candidate is,” Davis said. “The key is garnering that support, raising enough money early to get, you know, on the ground and begin the hard work.”
She said one of her strengths as a candidate was that she had worked in every county in Kansas and understood issues relevant to a diverse constituency. She said Congress wasn’t fighting battles that needed to be fought for Kansans, including affordable housing and the rising cost of living.
Congress should stand up for fundamental rights, including due process, amid the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, Davis said.
She said she was an unwavering supporter of public education and was convinced the effort to close the U.S. Department of Education would make education a significant campaign issue in 2026. She opposed appropriation of tax dollars to private schools.
“I believe that we should be doing everything we can to shore up public education,” she said.
Davis denounced the proposed amendment to the Kansas Constitution that would have laid the foundation for more stringent restrictions on abortion. In 2022, Kansas voters rejected the amendment to nullify a Kansas Supreme Court opinion that said the state constitution guaranteed women bodily autonomy and the right to end a pregnancy.
Votes in Congress to remove millions of people from Medicaid could jeopardize dozens of rural hospitals in Kansas, she said.
Davis said work by Republicans to demolish the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, was a tragedy.
“It’s an embarrassment that we have cut funding to USAID, that we have had opportunities to help people who are experiencing food insecurity, and that we have cut those programs off at the knees,” she said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/P8120676-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-08-18 09:57:21.612515

Pregnant women are more vulnerable to developing severe illness from COVID-19.","In this photo illustration, Ruth Jones, Immunization Nurse, holds a Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (brand name: Comirnaty) at Borinquen Health Care Center on May 29, 2025 in Miami, Florida.  (Photo illustration by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Heading into the respiratory illness season, states and clinicians are working to encourage pregnant patients to get COVID-19 vaccinations, even though the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services no longer recommends that they should.
Along with being older and having an underlying health condition, pregnancy itself is a risk factor. Pregnant women are more vulnerable to developing severe illness from COVID-19. They’re also at high risk for complications, including preterm labor and stillbirth. The vast majority of medical experts say getting the shot is safe and effective — much safer than having the illness.
But HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced in May that the agency would no longer recommend that pregnant women get the vaccine. Before testifying before Congress in June, Kennedy circulated a document on Capitol Hill claiming higher rates of fetal loss after vaccination. But the authors of those studies told Politico that their work had been misinterpreted.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Experts say the federal shift puts the onus on state health agencies to ramp up vaccine guidance and outreach. Clinicians and public health organizations are trying to dispel misinformation and make sure information reaches low-income people and people of color, who had higher maternal death rates during the pandemic. During the first two years of the pandemic, the virus contributed to a quarter of maternal deaths, according to federal data.
“We are severely disappointed,” said Dr. Neil Silverman, a professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California, Los Angeles David Geffen School of Medicine. He has studied vaccines and pregnancy for the past 15 years and specializes in high-risk pregnancies.
Silverman called the federal shift a “public health tragedy on a grand scale.”
Health groups urge insurers to cover COVID-19 shots for pregnant women

Vaccinations against COVID-19 help prevent severe illness in pregnant people as well as their newborns, who are too young to get vaccinated, Silverman said. In what’s called passive immunity, vaccinated mothers pass on antibodies to their babies through the placenta and through breast milk.
“State public health agencies are probably going to have to implement vaccine guidance that differs from the federal recommendations. And that’s going to be an interesting can of worms,” said OB-GYN Dr. Mark Turrentine, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas.
Turrentine serves on a board of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists that focuses on immunization and infectious diseases. He said his recent pregnant patients who had COVID-19 hadn’t gotten the vaccine.
“The change in guidance on the federal level just really makes a lot of confusion, and it makes it very challenging to try to explain to individuals why all of a sudden the difference,” Turrentine said.
A slew of public health organizations have been making a concerted effort to dispel vaccine myths. They include the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit organization of maternal-fetal experts. At a news briefing the society held this month, clinicians stressed the safety and long-standing science behind COVID-19 vaccines, as well as the shots for RSV and the flu. Cases of RSV and the flu tend to peak in the winter months, while in recent years COVID-19 cases have spiked in the summer and the winter.

Dr. Brenna Hughes, an OB-GYN who chairs the organization’s infectious diseases and emerging threats committee, pointed to survey data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing that less than a third of eligible pregnant patients received COVID-19 shots, and only 38% received RSV shots for the 2023 to 2024 season. Less than half — 47% — received flu shots, and 59% received TDAP (whooping cough) vaccines.
CDC data shows that for last year’s and this year’s season, only between 12% and 14% of pregnant patients got the COVID-19 vaccine.
“The complications from the infection are so much greater than the complications and the very few and typically minor adverse events that might occur from the vaccine,” said microbiologist Sabra Klein, a professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
In June, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and 30 other professional health organizations signed a letter urging insurers to continue covering the COVID-19 shot for pregnant women, and have continued to urge coverage since then.
CVS Caremark, one of the nation’s three major pharmacy benefit managers, told Stateline it will continue covering the vaccine for pregnant women. The Arizona, California and North Carolina state Medicaid agencies also told Stateline they are still currently covering COVID-19 vaccines for pregnant women.
Dr. Kimberly Fortner, president-elect of the Infectious Diseases Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology, said during the maternal-fetal medicine briefing that she hopes medical groups’ joint messaging will bolster insurers.
“Hopefully by us linking arms, that can then help develop consistency so that insurers will continue to pay for the vaccine,” she said.

Exacerbating disparities
Dr. Ayanna Bennett, director of the District of Columbia Department of Health, said the federal government’s new stance has upended “a system that’s been stable for a very long time.”
Bennett said her agency used federal pandemic aid to shore up vaccine outreach efforts to communities of color. Now that flow of money is ending.
The changes in federal guidance and funding will “almost certainly exacerbate” maternal health disparities, said Marie Thoma, a perinatal epidemiologist and an associate professor in the University of Maryland Department of Family Science who researches pregnancy and COVID-19.
Black and Indigenous women died at higher rates. The virus exacerbated existing racial disparities in maternal health — and created new ones: Latina mothers, who generally see low rates of maternal mortality, saw deaths surge to 28 per 100,000 in 2021. Their rate was about 12 per 100,000 in 2018, according to federal data.
“We are going in with some exposure already that we didn’t have during the start of the pandemic. So, there will be some protection, but now that will erode,” said Thoma. “If we’re not getting vaccines, or if people are hesitant to take them, we could see some increase.”
Silverman said the administration’s efforts to strip mentions of race from government policies makes it difficult for institutions to reach populations at greatest risk. He called the dismissal of decades of data “saddening and infuriating.”
“The politicization of the vaccine process, or access to it, is what concerns me the most,” said Dr. Yvette Martas, a Connecticut OB-GYN who chairs the board of directors of the Hispanic Health Council.
Many women “are trying to navigate an economic system that’s not always in their favor in terms of also providing access to the kind of educational material that they need,” she said.
Not just COVID-19
In June, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee, replacing them with some members who are vaccine skeptics.
The change is creating chaos. Some states have vaccine laws, such as mandates for kids and coverage statutes, that are specifically tied to the committee’s decisions.










The politicization of the vaccine process, or access to it, is what concerns me the most.


– Dr. Yvette Martas, a Connecticut OB-GYN who chairs the board of directors of the Hispanic Health Council


The Vaccine Integrity Project at the University of Minnesota called on frontline health workers, health officials and professional societies to “counter the spread of inaccurate and confusing vaccine information.”
At a news briefing this month held by the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, representatives from Alabama, Connecticut and Washington, D.C., said they will continue to recommend vaccines.
Alabama’s state health officer, Dr. Scott Harris, said clinicians will be instrumental in getting correct vaccination information to patients.
“We don’t think that we necessarily have the same authoritative voice that we might have had a decade ago in trying to guide people in what to do, but we do believe that people trust their health care providers in most cases and are certainly willing to listen to them,” he said at the briefing.
Bennett said she is hopeful that strong, consistent messaging from respected medical organizations will help combat confusion.
“Having established groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics or the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology make very firm recommendations that keep us essentially not changed from where we have been, I think, should reassure families,” she said.

Gov. Gavin Newsom’s effort to redraw California’s congressional maps is the marquee item on the state Legislature’s agenda, now that lawmakers are back today from summer recess and eyeing a frenetic schedule to decide the fate of more than 200 other bills in the next few weeks.
As CalMatters’ Alexei Koseff explains, Democratic officials released new maps on Friday that would give the party a greater chance of picking up five more seats currently held by Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives during the 2026 midterm elections. The maps would also help shore up seats barely held by Democrats in five other districts.
Before the end of this week, state lawmakers plan to hold a vote that would place the new maps on the ballot in a statewide special election. If passed, California voters would then decide on Nov. 4 whether to approve or reject the maps.
Newsom’s plan — which is in direct response to Texas’ own redistricting efforts — is being slammed by Republicans as an illegal power grab by Democrats. The National Republican Congressional Committee said in a statement that it was prepared to fight Newsom in court.
An estimate by Assembly Republicans calculated that the special election would cost taxpayers more than $235 million. The last special election, in which voters rejected recalling Newsom in 2021, cost about $200 million. 
The state has pledged to cover the cost for counties for this election, and some early numbers have come in: Fresno and Riverside counties, for example, estimate it would cost them up to $4 million and $16 million, respectively.

Speaking of the maps: Alexei and CalMatters’ Jeremia Kimelman built a lookup tool that enables you to check if you could be affected by the redistricting plan. Though the new maps aim to give Democrats five more seats in the House, more districts could be altered. Check it out here.

Some news affecting California’s cost of living:

Gas prices: Despite ambitions to wean the state from fossil fuels and a campaign last year cracking down on oil companies over alleged gas price gouging, Newsom and Democratic leaders now find themselves negotiating a plan with oil companies to boost in-state oil production. The move comes after two California fuel refineries said they were shutting down sooner than expected, which could lead to gas prices rising to more than $8 a gallon by the end of 2026, according to a hotly contested estimate by one professor at University of Southern California. Democratic leaders are facing increased pressure to make the state more affordable. Read more from CalMatters’ Alexei, Alejandro Lazo and Maya C. Miller.


Health insurance: If you’re one of the nearly 2 million Californians covered by health insurance through Covered California, you will see your premiums increase by an average of 10.3% next year. This is the first time the marketplace’s rate will increase by double digits since 2018. While Covered California’s director cited a number of factors, including rising health care costs, about 2% of the rate increase is due to expiring federal aid that President Donald Trump did not extend in his federal budget bill. These enhanced subsidies were used by more than 90% of Affordable Care Act enrollees nationwide, and California stands to lose about $2.1 billion because of Trump’s changes.

Colorado River water shortages

Federal officials last week said the country’s two largest reservoirs could see steep declines in water levels within the coming years — a prospect that would severely affect the water supply of seven states, including California, writes CalMatters’ Rachel Becker.
The Colorado River’s Lake Mead and Lake Powell are each only 31% full, and are projected to dip to levels that would further tensions among the states in the Colorado River basin that must agree on new river management standards after 2026, when current guidelines expire. 
Based on two-year projections by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, some states could see their total annual allotment of Colorado River water cut by 5% to 18%. Because California has senior rights to the water, it has been spared from mandatory conservation.
Still, the risk of overdrafting the reservoirs underscores California’s dependency on them: The state takes the biggest share of Colorado River water, which it uses to irrigate crops in the Imperial Valley and to supply water to Southern California. 
Officials have warned that states must reach a broad agreement by Nov. 11 or risk having the federal government step in.

(Commonwealth Media Services)*This story will be updated*
The 2026 race for governor has begun in Pennsylvania.
After months of speculation, state Treasurer Stacy Garrity formally announced her candidacy for the Republican nomination for governor on Monday. 
Garrity, a combat veteran and Bradford County native, was first elected to statewide office in 2020 by defeating incumbent state Treasurer Joe Torsella by just under one point. Her victory over the Montgomery County Democrat was seen as an upset. 
She secured a second term in 2024 by defeating Democrat Erin McClelland by six points. During the campaign, she broke the record in Pennsylvania for most votes won by a candidate for statewide office. That record was previously held by Gov. Josh Shapiro’s 2022 landslide victory over GOP state Sen. Doug Mastriano, a potential challenger to Garrity for the 2026 nomination.
Garrity is the first Republican to announce her intentions for the statewide office.
Her announcement did not come as a surprise to political observers. During a conservative gathering in April, she told the Capital-Star that she was considering a run for the office. 
“I think right now…millions of Pennsylvanians feel that we’re at a crossroads in Pennsylvania and we have to decide what kind of state we’re going to be,” she said.
Just last week, she released a video sharply criticizing Shapiro and added that “help is on the way.” 
The Pennsylvania Republican Party is set to meet in September to endorse a candidate in the race. During the previous gubernatorial campaign in 2022, the party did not endorse a candidate in the crowded field, while Donald Trump delivered a last-minute endorsement to Mastriano.
Garrity and Mastriano have both been vocal supporters of President Trump.
The last time a Republican candidate won the race for governor in Pennsylvania was then-Attorney General Tom Corbett’s victory in 2010. Since then, three Democratic candidates – Tom Wolf (twice) and Shapiro – have won by nearly double digits.
Shapiro has not formally announced his bid for a second term, but is widely expected to run for re-election. He has a 61% approval rating, according to a Morning Consult poll released last month.
During an appearance in Luzerne County on Friday, Shapiro was asked about potentially facing Garrity in 2026. 
“Look, the Republicans are going to deal with their intramural fight. I’m not going to get into their parlor games,” Shapiro responded. “You know what I’m going to do? I’m going to keep creating jobs here in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. I’m going to fund our kids’ schools. I’m going to make sure that we have more cops on the beat, and I’m going to focus on doing my job of bringing Republicans and Democrats together to get stuff done. That’s my focus.

(Photo by Madison McVan/Minnesota Reformer.)President Donald Trump’s campaign to deport immigrants en masse has reached the southeast Asian community in East St. Paul and beyond.
More than 150 southeast Asians have been deported from Minnesota since May, according to MN8, a Southeast Asian political advocacy group. More are awaiting deportation at an Immigrations and Customs Enforcement facility in Louisiana.
Many of those deported were brought to the U.S. as children as their parents fled the destruction of the Vietnam War and what’s known as the Secret War in Laos. The CIA recruited Hmong people in Laos to fight against the North Vietnamese army; many of the surviving soldiers fled with their families to the U.S. after the war. 
Activists gathered at the East Side Freedom Library in St. Paul Sunday to call attention to the deportations and discuss how to respond.
“Those same children who came as refugees are being sent back to the countries their family originally fled from by the same government that was responsible for their displacement 50 years ago,” said Montha Chum, executive director of MN8.
The Trump administration has highlighted the criminal records of the southeast Asian deportees. Many of those deported had served their sentences and became productive members of society, said Mai Neng Moua, an immigration attorney and board chair of MN8.
Rep. Kaohly Vang Her, DFL-St. Paul, was three years old when her parents joined the initial wave of Hmong refugees fleeing Laos for the U.S.; her grandfather was a colonel in the Secret War. 
Her — also a candidate for mayor of St. Paul — and MN8 supported reforms to the state pardon and clemency process that were passed by the DFL-controlled Legislature in 2023. Those reforms are of particular importance to immigrants with felonies on their records, who may be subject to deportation. 
Her said after Trump was elected to a second term, she and Rep. Liz Lee, DFL-St. Paul, met with staff from the administration of Joe Biden to ask for expedited pardons — including for those who could be at risk of deportation due to prior convictions. But the administration didn’t have enough time to issue the pardons, according to Her. 
“We felt so hopeless because we knew what was going to be coming for our communities,” Her said.
MN8 is working with other organizations to gather information on deportees, connect deportees to their families and send care packages upon their arrival in their new — often unfamiliar — country, Chum said.

After years of cracking down on California’s oil industry, Gov. Gavin Newsom and legislative Democrats are moving to get Kern County wells pumping again to avoid soaring gasoline prices.


The oil industry is having an I-told-you-so moment in California.
For decades, the state has raced to end its reliance on fossil fuels and prioritize clean energy. Its relationship with oil companies became particularly contentious in the past two years, as Gov. Gavin Newsom and Democratic legislators held two special sessions to crack down on alleged price gouging at the pump.
But now two of its last remaining fuel refineries are closing sooner than California expected, tossing a simmering emergency into officials’ laps. With a hotly debated forecast that $8-per-gallon gasoline might be on the horizon, there has been a remarkable shift at the state Capitol. Led by Newsom, who just last fall was lambasting oil companies for “screwing” consumers, California may soon let its black gold flow again.
“We are all the beneficiaries of oil and gas. No one’s naive about that,” Newsom said at a press conference last month. “So it’s always been about finding a just transition, a pragmatism in terms of that process.”
Newsom and Democratic legislative leaders are now negotiating a plan with the industry to boost stagnating production in California’s oil-drilling hub of Kern County — and avert a nightmare scenario for a governor with national ambitions and a party that has promised to focus on affordability. Lawmakers could pass a measure before the end of their annual session in mid-September, though the details remain unsettled and environmental groups are raising alarms.
The headspinning realignment potentially heralds a new era in California’s transition to a carbon-free future, as high costs, technological impediments and flagging political will force Democrats to recalibrate their ambitious climate goals. President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans are also taking aim at the state’s vast powers to regulate its greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, including revoking California’s mandate to phase out gas-powered vehicles and slashing renewable energy tax credits.
“We all need to kind of evolve. Maybe that’s just the lesson on climate. There’s not really a purity test on this. It’s not like civil rights,” said state Sen. Henry Stern, a Calabasas Democrat who five years ago was publicly advocating for keeping more California oil in the ground. 
As both a staffer and a legislator, Stern worked on major laws to require buffer zones around oil wells in sensitive areas and restrict the well stimulation technique known as fracking. But he said he does not want California to see the same backlash to climate action as western Europe, where environmentally focused Green parties have recently been crushed electorally by far-right populists.
“We can perform a muscular version of climate policy that doesn’t have to be so all-or-nothing,” Stern said.
Oil industry forces Newsom’s hand
Refinery closures are accelerating the pressure in Sacramento. Two days after Newsom signed a law increasing state oversight of maintenance, Phillips 66 announced in October that it would shut its Los Angeles facility by the end of 2025 because of concerns over the sustainability of the California market. Then in April, Valero declared it would close its Benicia refinery next year, citing a challenging regulatory environment.
That would leave only six major facilities to refine crude oil into transportation fuels in a state that remains the country’s second-largest gasoline consumer after Texas, as well as a major user of jet fuel, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. A business professor at the University of Southern California projected the loss of refining capacity, which will be offset with more expensive imports of finished fuel, combined with additional state actions, could send gasoline prices spiraling past $8 per gallon by the end of 2026.
Republicans pounced on that figure to criticize Newsom for fomenting an energy crisis in California, sparking fierce pushback from the governor’s office, which has dismissed the report as an “unscientific analysis” by a professor with close ties to the oil industry. Other experts have estimated a smaller effect on prices, which currently average about $4.49 per gallon in California, according to AAA, $1.33 higher than the national average but lower than they’ve been since January. 
The Western States Petroleum Association — the powerful Sacramento-based lobby for the oil and gas industry that has donated more than $330,000 to lawmakers in the past decade — blames taxes, fees and regulations for California’s high prices. Decades of state rules, including strict emissions targets, a ban on the additive MTBE, and requirements for a special gasoline blend, traditionally make refining more expensive. Drilling in California is also in what the industry calls “terminal decline” as the Newsom administration has largely stopped issuing new permits, forcing a greater reliance on foreign countries such as Brazil, Iraq, Guyana and Ecuador with looser labor and environmental standards.
“At some point, are you going to have enough supply to meet California’s demands?” said Catherine Reheis-Boyd, CEO of the petroleum association, who evoked the fuel shortages and long lines at gas stations that followed a 1973 embargo against the United States by other oil-producing nations. “People’s lives were completely disrupted.”
Industry leaders argue pumping more crude oil in California, particularly in Kern County, could help meet demand at a lower cost. But if the state doesn’t act quickly, they warn that production could drop so low it would shut down pipelines between local oil fields and refineries, further exacerbating a crisis of California’s own creation.
“For me, I don’t care if the motivation is political or policy. I’m very happy that we’re having a conversation about something that’s really impactful to the consumers of California,” Reheis-Boyd said. 
Climate commitment meets reality
After years of making the oil industry into a political boogeyman, Newsom has become surprisingly receptive to its message.
Gone is the bombastic governor who declared to a United Nations summit in 2023 that “this climate crisis is a fossil fuel crisis,” or strong-armed the Legislature that same year into adopting a law that could penalize oil companies for excessive profits.

In April, after Valero said it would close its Benicia refinery, Newsom directed Siva Gunda, vice chair of the California Energy Commission, to “redouble the state’s efforts to work closely with refiners on short- and long-term planning” and ensure a “reliable supply of transportation fuels.”
Gunda returned a series of recommendations in June that closely aligned with the industry’s wishlist, including stabilizing in-state crude production, rolling back regulations that limit imports and improving investor confidence.
While the commission is exploring delaying implementation of the profit penalty and refinery maintenance oversight laws, Newsom began circulating a draft bill that would provide blanket approval for environmental reviews of Kern County wells to sidestep litigation that has stalled drilling. That proposal is now at the center of negotiations over a legislative package that could simultaneously create new standards for restarting offshore drilling, require the industry to plug more idle wells and end the use of fracking. 
“We’re in the ‘how’ business. We move to a low-carbon, green-growth future, change the way we produce and consume energy,” Newsom said at the press conference last month. “At the same time, we have enough available fuel supplies, a stable fuel supply and address the anxieties around cost. Both and.”
Matt Rodriguez, a longtime Democratic consultant who has worked in California and on several presidential campaigns, said Newsom is caught between a commitment to climate action that is important to the left and a substantive problem that could hurt both the economy and individual voters.
“The reality is that gas prices are higher here than the rest of the nation. That’s just undeniable,” he said. “If there are storm clouds on the horizon, you can’t just sit there and ignore it.”
The larger the gap between the price at the pump in California and in other states, Rodriguez said, the greater the liability it poses in a future presidential campaign for Newsom, who will likely also face criticism for how his own policies contributed to the problem. But Rodriguez said there is a potential upside if the governor can negotiate a solution with the oil industry, allowing him to tout himself as a pragmatist rather than an ideologue.
“Any way that he can keep gas prices from ballooning, that’s his imperative,” Rodriguez said.
‘We didn’t have a champion’
Environmental groups, meanwhile, are up in arms. More than 120 signed a letter earlier this month opposing Newsom’s push, which they characterized as an industry giveaway that would “gravely harm the air we breathe and water we drink around the state, but have no impact on refinery closures or gas prices.”
Hollin Kretzmann, an attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity, called the governor’s proposal to streamline approval of new Kern County wells a “drill, baby, drill” plan that would “eviscerate” California’s bedrock environmental review law for one of its core purposes: reining in a polluting industry.
He noted that courts already struck down earlier versions of the idea when Kern County tried it, because the environmental review was deemed insufficient. Last month, the county passed a third version of the plan, which Newsom’s bill would enshrine into state law.
“It’s a very misguided and ill-conceived proposal,” Kretzmann said.

Martha Dina Argüello, executive director of the Physicians for Social Responsibility Los Angeles, remembers attending a press conference last September, outside the Inglewood Oil Field, where Newsom signed a trio of new laws aimed at cleaning up idle wells and restricting oil and gas operations. She said she was “stunned” by the governor’s rapid reversal and warned that it would allow the oil industry to gut public health protections under the guise of affordability, passing the costs on to low-income communities near oil fields and refineries that have higher asthma and cancer risks from exposure to toxic chemicals.
“You don’t often get champions who are consistent — and it’s very sad that we didn’t have a champion that was really going to do the difficult thing and tell us the changes that we need to make to actually address climate change and air pollution,” she said. “That’s what our communities still need.”
Landing a deal will be tricky
The governor’s office is working to find an approach that can get through the Legislature in a short time frame. Lawmakers return from their summer recess on Monday for the final month of session.
That could necessitate making tradeoffs between priorities for environmentally minded lawmakers on the left, such as protecting the buffer zones around oil wells, and moderates more sympathetic to the industry’s arguments. It’s possible the proposal will be merged with a separate effort to extend California’s cap-and-trade system for greenhouse gas emissions, because oil refiners are seeking a more gradual decline in the credits that allow them to emit carbon pollution without paying.
Stern described the mood among lawmakers as “begrudgingly practical,” but also grumpy about having to take on yet another fight over oil, “so nothing feels like a win.” Given the political sensitivities, he said it was possible the Legislature would pass only the provision to boost drilling in Kern County and carry over the rest of the discussion into next year.
Nevertheless, the boundaries of the debate around domestic oil production have completely shifted in Sacramento, with affordability taking on a more prominent role.

Assemblymember Cottie Petrie-Norris, an Irvine Democrat who chairs the Assembly’s utilities and energy committee, said the Legislature could no longer afford to treat California’s energy transition like a future aspiration, as previous generations of officials have. Instead, lawmakers must be pragmatic and retain the support of everyday Californians, she said, because without their buy-in, the state will cease to be a climate leader.
“There are some advocates who continue to think that you can somehow just wave a magic wand and end oil production in California without terrible consequences,” she said. “We need California to be an inspiration, and not a cautionary tale.”
An agreement to expand drilling would be a hard-fought victory for Sen. Shannon Grove, a Bakersfield Republican who has spent the majority of her 10-year legislative career repeatedly warning that cutting oil production in California would only increase reliance on imports from countries with lower environmental and labor standards.
“Do I wish that companies and businesses would not have left my district and taken their jobs with them and created a vast unemployment rate? Do I wish that the people who lost their jobs still had their jobs? Do I wish it would have happened sooner?” Grove said. “Yes. But I’m grateful that it’s happening.”
Grove said Kern County, which also is home to some of the state’s largest solar and wind projects, has the potential to be the “energy capital of the United States.” She argues the county has done its due diligence with environmental reviews to ensure that future drilling projects are more climate conscious than importing oil from other countries. 
“If you’re going to do it, you have to do it right,” she said, “and Kern County does it right.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/070622_Oil_Field_LV_CM_006.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-18 08:56:48.562036

Take a peek inside one ideal classroom scenario,Carolyn Jones,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/k-12-education/2025/08/california-tk/,"This fall at least 200,000 California students are expected to enroll in transitional kindergarten, which serves as a bridge between preschool and kindergarten.","In summary
This fall at least 200,000 California students are expected to enroll in transitional kindergarten, which serves as a bridge between preschool and kindergarten.


Break out the crayons and finger paint: Every 4-year-old in California is now eligible for transitional kindergarten.
Fifteen years after a handful of school districts opened the first TK classrooms, California now has the largest — and fastest growing — early education program in the country. At least 200,000 youngsters will attend TK this fall, enjoying low teacher-student ratios, age-appropriate curriculum and plenty of music, art and circle time.
“This really is something to celebrate,” said Carolyne Crolotte, policy director for Early Edge California, an advocacy group. “Now, there’s no question about who’s eligible and who isn’t. Everyone is eligible.”
TK is meant to be a bridge between preschool and kindergarten, preparing 4-year-olds for the routine and expectations of elementary school while honing their social skills and self-confidence. In TK, children learn how to make friends, write their names and do basic math. Mostly, they’re supposed to fall in love with learning.
Holding frogs and counting marshmallows
That was the case at Silverwood Elementary in Concord last week as a dozen bright-eyed 4-year-olds hovered around their teacher, Elizabeth Swanson, as she gingerly held out a tree frog for their inspection.
Several got a chance to hold the docile, turquoise amphibian.
“What does the frog feel like? What do you wonder about the frog?” said Swanson, who was recently named Mt. Diablo Unified’s Teacher of the Year. “How does he use his hands? How do you use your hands?”
But the tree frog — one of several critters in her classroom — was not the most popular attraction that afternoon. That honor belonged to the “home living” station, a corner of the classroom dedicated to costumes, dollhouses, a mini kitchen and everything else an imaginative youngster would need to play house.

Last year, an enterprising group of students, inspired by the opening of a Dutch Bros. near the school, used the home living station to open their own coffee shop. They ordered lattes and made coffee and collected money. Swanson turned it into a math lesson by asking them to count marshmallows and decide how many should go into each cup of hot chocolate.
“One child would be the barista and one would be the customer, so they learned how to share and take turns,” Swanson said. “They were getting so much practice with social language and communication. And everything was integrated into play.”
Importance of fun
Judy Krause, executive director of early childhood programs at Pacific Oaks College in Pasadena, said that’s exactly what a TK classroom should be like. The focus should be on experimentation and hands-on activities, based on students’ interests. TK, she said, is not a version of kindergarten; 4-year-olds have unique developmental needs. The main one, she said, is having fun.
If children are enjoying themselves, they’ll learn naturally, she said. If they feel overly pressured or bored, they’ll lose interest and miss out on valuable skills they’ll need for kindergarten and beyond.
“It’s a really big deal that we have this opportunity for all 4-year-olds,” Krause said. “But we have to make sure we’re doing it right.”
15-year rollout of TK
California introduced TK in 2010, and a decade later began expanding it to all districts. This year is the culmination of that effort, with all 4-year-olds now eligible and 91% of districts offering the program. The only districts that are exempt are those that don’t receive money through the state’s funding formula because they receive more money through their local property taxes. 
Like kindergarten, TK is optional. But many districts, including Mt. Diablo Unified, have seen strong interest from families. A recent report from the Public Policy Institute of California predicted that about 70% of 4-year-olds will enroll in TK this fall, with waiting lists in some districts. Black, Latino and Native American students have been slightly underrepresented so far, although those not enrolled might be enrolled in other programs. The state doesn’t track that data.
Nearly everyone agrees TK is a good idea. Children who’ve attended TK tend to do better in reading and math, and those with disabilities can be identified early and receive services, research shows. 
TK, which is free, can be a financial boon for families. Because of California’s high cost of living, child care and preschool costs are among the highest in the country, with families paying up to $20,000 annually — more than the cost of in-state tuition at the University of California. 
Gov. Gavin Newsom has long championed TK, setting aside more than $2.7 billion in the years when the state had a budget surplus. The money is to help school districts pay teachers, keep class sizes small and provide other services to the new learners. Ongoing funds will come from the state’s Local Control Funding Formula.
“California is making a big commitment to making transitional kindergarten free and accessible to all 4-year-olds,” Newsom said in a 2023 video. “When we’re finished, California will have the largest free preschool program in the country, where every 4-year-old can start their schooling on the right track, setting them up for success further down the road.”  
Teacher shortage and other challenges
But the TK rollout has had some hiccups. The chief one is finding enough qualified teachers. Because of the small class sizes and the extra qualifications required to teach 4-year-olds, there’s a shortfall of at least 12,000 TK teachers, according to Early Edge California. Last year the state introduced a new TK-through-third-grade credential and more districts are partnering with local colleges to recruit and train future teachers, which has eased the shortage somewhat.
Another obstacle has been finding classroom space. Like kindergarten classrooms, TK classrooms must contain bathrooms, which means that districts had to find money to remodel existing classrooms, or build new ones altogether. Last year’s $10 billion school construction bond has funding available for TK projects.
TK has also had an impact on preschools. Families in California have several early education options: state-funded preschools for low-income families, federal Head Start preschool for very low-income families, and private preschools. Now that 4-year-olds have a free option, existing preschools have seen an enrollment decline that, in some cases, has led schools to raise prices or even close. A recent report from UC Berkeley showed that TK expansion has led to “pre-K deserts” in some parts of the state.

Bruce Fuller, an education professor at UC Berkeley who’s researched TK, said it’s too early to tell who’s benefitting from the program. 
“We’re seeing a shift away from preschool and toward TK, but we don’t know if TK is actually reaching new families,” Fuller said. “We might just be seeing families who would have enrolled anyway.”
Dual-language programs
A handful of districts offer dual-language TK classes, which have been popular with parents. Karina Galustians, a parent in the Tujunga neighborhood of Los Angeles, enrolled her daughter Julianna last fall in an Armenian-English TK class in Los Angeles Unified’s Pinewood Early Education Center.
Galustians’ husband speaks fluent Armenian, and the couple was eager for Julianna to be able to communicate with the extended family and learn more about the culture. 
“The more languages you know, the better off you are,” said Galustians, whose first language is Spanish. “To find a school where she can get those academic skills and practice her Armenian — me and my husband were beyond grateful. We hit the jackpot.” 
Julianna starts kindergarten this fall at another Los Angeles Unified school, where she’ll be part of the Armenian dual language program. “We feel like she’s very well prepared,” Galustians said.
‘Everyone feels included’
Meanwhile, at Silverwood Elementary in Concord, Swanson ended the day by having students put away the blocks and plastic bugs and Eric Carle books. Then she sat with them in a circle and praised each child’s efforts and told them how excited she was to see them again tomorrow.
“David, you were super responsible today,” Swanson told an awed 4-year-old as she handed him a personalized certificate. “Lindsay, you were a good friend. Zaire, you were so respectful.”
Then it was time for the children to go meet their parents, who were waiting at the side of the playground. Swanson chatted with nearly every parent, telling them how much she enjoys their children.
“I think TK should be the same as what we want for society generally,” Swanson said. “It should be a place where everyone feels included and valued. We want everyone to be curious and non-judgmental and happy to be here.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/081125-TK-Class-Concord-LE-CM-04.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-18 08:56:48.562036

California has an overwhelmingly Democratic delegation in Congress. Gov. Newsom’s plan could give his party five more seats and offset a Texas gerrymander.


The fight over redistricting is about to hit overdrive in California.
As the Legislature returns to Sacramento today for the final month of session, Democrats are racing to finish a plan that could tilt the state’s congressional map in their favor — and thrust California into another confrontation with President Donald Trump.
Republicans, who stand to lose more than half their seats in the state, decry the scheme as a self-serving power grab. But supporters, led by Gov. Gav Newsom, contend they are saving democracy by stopping Trump from rigging the outcome of the 2026 midterms.
Ultimately, California voters will likely decide in a special election this November.
Here’s what you need to know:
Wait, what is Newsom trying to do?
The governor is leading the charge for the Democratic response in a burgeoning partisan showdown that could effectively determine control of the U.S. House of Representatives before a single vote is cast next November.
This kicked off thousands of miles away from Sacramento — in Texas. Earlier this year, Trump began pressuring Republican leaders there to redraw its congressional lines to shore up the GOP’s narrow majority in the House. As his approval rating sinks, the president is worried Democrats could win back Congress in the 2026 election and disrupt the final two years of his term.
Even as dozens of Democratic members have fled the state in protest, the Texas Legislature is advancing a new map that could flip five Democratic House seats to Republican control. Other conservative states, including Ohio, Missouri, Indiana and Florida, are considering similar actions.
So, channeling the anger of Democratic voters, Newsom has launched California into a retaliatory redistricting that would offset the Texas map with five new Democratic-leaning seats.
“Donald Trump, you have poked the bear and we will punch back,” Newsom said during a rally last week formally kicking off the campaign. “Don’t mess with the great Golden State.”
How would it work?
It’s complicated!
Unlike Texas, where the Legislature determines congressional lines, California voters in 2010 gave that power to a bipartisan citizen commission. The commission draws a new map once each decade, after the U.S. Census, to ensure each congressional district has roughly an equal number of people. It last did so in 2021.
Newsom is proposing to temporarily override the commission and create districts more favorable to Democrats until after the 2030 Census. That requires going to the voters for their approval.
Democratic officials already drew a new map in secret, which they finally shared publicly on Friday. The Legislature, where three-quarters of members are Democrats, plans to vote before the end of this week to put that map on the ballot in a statewide special election on Nov. 4.
“Voters will see the maps and have the final say,” Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas, a Salinas Democrat, said in a statement.
Why the rush?
California’s primary election is in June, so work backwards from there. The deadline for candidates to declare is in early March. Those who want to collect signatures to qualify, instead of paying a filing fee, can start in December.
That means new congressional lines need to be in place by the end of the year, so candidates actually know which voters they need to reach.

Newsom is eyeing Nov. 4 for the special election to consolidate it with municipal elections across the state that day. State law requires elections officials to mail a ballot to every voter starting 29 days before the election, and to military and overseas voters 45 days before, which means ballots must be ready by late September.
The secretary of state’s office has said the Legislature must act by Friday to leave enough time for local elections officials to meet those deadlines for a Nov. 4 election. Even then, the next month will be extremely busy for them.
How much will this cost?
The state has promised to cover the expenses counties incur running this unexpected election, which won’t be cheap. The last state special election, an unsuccessful recall of Newsom in September 2021, cost about $200 million.
Newsom has said consolidating the election with already scheduled local elections on Nov. 4 could save money. But early estimates from counties — up to $4 million in Fresno and up to $16 million in Riverside — are higher than they were for the recall.
“No price tag for democracy,” Newsom told reporters last week following the kickoff rally.
Will this plan succeed?
Democrats feel good about their chances, but it’s a heavy lift.
A Politico poll found that nearly two-thirds of California voters prefer retaining the state’s independent redistricting commission over returning authority to the Legislature to draw congressional lines.
That is not exactly what Newsom’s plan would do, however. His messaging has emphasized that the commission would only be sidelined temporarily, because of what he calls a Trump-induced political emergency. It’s reflected in the name of the measure: the Election Rigging Response Act. Internal polling shared with lawmakers put support, when framed along those lines, at 52%.
While that’s enough to win in November, it may not be enough to withstand an intense campaign this fall that is expected to draw hundreds of millions of dollars in spending. Charles Munger, Jr., the longtime Republican donor who poured more than $12 million into the campaign to pass independent redistricting, has said he will open up his wallet again to defend it.

On August 12, 2025, just days after his 83rd birthday, Richard E. Tarrant Sr. passed away at his home in Hillsboro Beach, Florida surrounded by his family. Born in Newark, New Jersey on August 6, 1942, Rich was proud to be a first-generation Irish-American. The oldest of four boys, he graduated from St. Benedict’s Preparatory School in Newark before enrolling at New York basketball powerhouse Saint Bonaventure University in 1960.
After his freshman year at St. Bonnie’s, Rich realized he’d need a scholarship to continue his education. Disappointed to learn St. Bonnie’s would not guarantee a scholarship, he applied for a transfer to several other colleges. St. Michael’s College in Winooski, Vermont came through with a full scholarship, and the rest is basketball history. Leading St. Mike’s Purple Knights to multiple titles, “Richie the Robot” was named to the All-American Team in 1965 and drafted by the Boston Celtics as a fourth-round draft choice immediately after graduation. He played with Celtics greats Casey Jones, Sam Jones, John Havlicek, and Bill Russell. After being released at the end of pre-season, Rich went directly from the Celtics’ offices to IBM’s Boston Regional Headquarters, and although he didn’t have an appointment for an interview, the Regional Director met with him and hired him on the spot, thus setting the stage for Rich’s next chapter.
Rich excelled at selling computers in rural Vermont in the mid-1960’s – no easy feat. He was repeatedly named Salesman of the Year before leaving IBM in 1969 to start what became IDX Systems Corporation. With thousands of employees and offices worldwide, under Rich’s guidance, IDX flourished in early healthcare information technology. The company began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in 1995, and in 2005 was acquired by GE Healthcare.
Rich then turned his attention to national healthcare. Hoping to impact the broken American healthcare system through a national pulpit, he ran unsuccessfully for Vermont’s U.S. Senate seat in 2006. Never one to let adversity get in his way, Rich went on to found Marathon Health based in Winooski, Vermont. The company’s on-site clinics for corporations and government entities proved that managing healthcare on a personal level was far more effective than the existing American healthcare bureaucracy. To encourage entrepreneurship, Rich also invested in and mentored many other fledgling companies.
Rich felt strongly that his good fortune came with responsibilities. Along with his wife Deb, he established the Richard E. and Deborah L. Tarrant Foundation in 2005. Hundreds of non-profits have received funding from the Tarrant Foundation. In addition, the Foundation made a lasting impact on Vermont’s education system through the Tarrant Institute for Innovative Education. As Rich’s brainchild, the Institute partnered with the University of Vermont to train teachers across the state using interactive technology in the classroom and allowing students to learn and excel in non-traditional ways. Through the Foundation, Rich was also the creative force behind the recently released documentary “Gone Guys”. The film highlights the disenfranchised state young men across America face due to the current social climate and the lack of clear paths to successful manhood. “Gone Guys” was received to critical acclaim, winning the award for Best Documentary Feature at the Vermont Film Festival on the very day of Rich’s passing.
Rich was a master jokester with a zest for life that was contagious. As a member of the Boca Raton Economic Roundtable (aka Scuttlebutt) since 2006, he especially relished his role as unofficial court jester while sharing insights on economic and world issues.
Although Rich was tremendously successful in business and philanthropic ventures, his family is what brought him true joy. He is survived by Deb Tarrant (nee Deborah Miles Messner), his wife and partner of 28 years, his former wife Amy Tarrant (nee Amy Fayette), and seven children – Jerry Tarrant (Lori), Rich Tarrant Jr. (Tracy), Brian Tarrant (Christina), Ellen Ludwig (Derek), Audrey Williams (Basil), Tori Messner (Natalia), and Kyle Messner (Amanda). His 12 grandchildren (with number 13 on the way) meant the world to him and gave him endless delight – Gretchen, Claudia, Anisa, Cole, Lily, Nina, Vera, Eva, London, Ariana, Jasmine, and Miles.
Rich leaves a legacy of profound impact on thousands of lives. With a ready smile and a giving heart, at 6’6” he was larger-than-life with charisma to match. He was truly a “giant among men”.

Energy Alabama, a renewable energy advocacy group, has appealed a lower court ruling allowing the Public Service Commission to exclude it from a process determining the rate Alabama Power may charge customers to recover fuel costs. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)Renewable energy advocates Wednesday appealed a Montgomery County circuit judge’s ruling excluding them from consideration of customer rates set by Alabama Power.
Energy Alabama, a renewable energy organization, is seeking to join a docket to set the Energy Cost Recovery (ECR) rate, a price that Alabama Power can charge customers to offset the money they pay for fuel that the Public Service Commission allows.
“We believe decisions that affect customers should be made in the open,” said Daniel Tait, executive director of Energy Alabama. “Not in secret. Fuel costs have a major impact on monthly bills, and they are changed with virtually no transparency or public scrutiny. We are asking the Alabama Supreme Court to recognize that customers have the right to be heard when decisions about their energy costs are being made.”

The PSC adjusts the rate as often as every month to align with the price of oil, natural gas and uranium in the market. To update the rate, the PSC issues interim consent orders based on recommendations from Alabama Power but has not allowed public input on the measure since 2008 and considers the docket closed.
The ECR rate is updated on an ongoing basis depending on the market rate for the different sources of fuel. Typically, Alabama Power submits a request to allow it to charge customers a specific price for the fuel that it buys that the PSC can either approve or change.
The issue of whether the PSC allows for the rate adjustments amounts to a proceeding is a critical issue because the regulations allow other parties to intervene and be part of the docket if there is a proceeding.
Energy Alabama’s position is that the updates are, in fact, proceedings, and that the public has a right to be part of the docket and weigh in on the appropriate rate ECR that Alabama Power should charge.
Montgomery Circuit Court Judge Brooke Reid ruled in July that the PSC could prevent Energy Alabama from intervening in the docket because the case does not involve fraud or reach a decision in which the evidence did not align with the decision, the only two instances that Alabama law allows the court to intervene.
Energy Alabama now wants the Alabama Supreme Court to decide whether updates to the rate ECR amount to a “proceeding” that would allow Energy Alabama to be part of the docket and weigh in on the decision.
A message was sent to Alabama Power and the Public Service Commission on Thursday seeking comment.
Energy Alabama filed a petition in May 2024 requesting to be part of the docket for deciding the fuel cost. In response, Alabama Power said in filing to the PSC that the rate adjustments are not proceedings that allow Energy Alabama to intervene and be party to the docket.
In the end, the PSC sided with Alabama Power and ruled in August 2024 that Energy Alabama could not intervene and be part of the docket. Energy Alabama requested the PSC reconsider its decision, but the PSC affirmed its decision in September that same year.

The Trump administration in July announced changes to long-standing federal guidelines that allowed social safety net programs including community health centers, homeless shelters, and child care programs to offer services without verifying immigration status. 
“Currently, no individual is being denied services at the Health District or Southern Nevada Community Health Center under this reinterpretation,” Jennifer Sizemore, a spokeswoman with the Southern Nevada Health District, said in an email. “We are closely monitoring developments, providing input, and preparing for potential operational changes should the policy take effect. Our priority remains protecting the health of all residents and maintaining access to essential public health services.”
SNHD couldn’t answer additional questions about the potential impact of the federal policies changes on undocumented people accessing health services, since the issue is being litigated. 
Days after the Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford joined 19 other states and the District of Columbia, have signed onto a lawsuit challenging the rule, arguing it’s already sowing chaos in communities.
Dr. Cassius Lockett, the District Health Officer for the Southern Nevada Health District, told district board of health members at a July 24 meeting that “a little over 50% of our clients in the Southern Nevada Community Health Center are undocumented” and could lose access to primary care services, behavioral health services and family planning under the rule change as written. 
Lockett didn’t specify an exact figure of the number of undocumented patients who could lose access to health services at the district. 
The district is conducting an analysis to understand the fiscal impact from the federal changes, he said. 
The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 had a long-standing practice of allowing various community based programs that rely on federal funds to serve people regardless of immigration status.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced July 10 it would reverse that policy and require agencies to check immigration status. 
“For too long, the government has diverted hardworking Americans’ tax dollars to incentivize illegal immigration,” said Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr in a statement.
In their suit challenging the policy reversal, attorneys general argued multiple programs “cannot realistically conduct verification at the door, such as 24/7 crisis hotlines, emergency services for individuals suffering an overdose, and homeless shelters.” 
“Even if some programs could implement such verification with time and resources, vulnerable people lack government identification when accessing these services for myriad reasons—some may be undocumented immigrants, but many others are U.S. Citizens or permanent residents,” the suit contends. “For the first time, millions of people are facing a new demand before they can access the Nation’s most essential programs: ‘show me your papers.’
Dr. Frank Nemec, the vice chair for the health board, said during the board’s July 24 meeting that the decision wasn’t just cruel but could have a “devastating economic impact on an already fragile medical infrastructure” in Nevada. 
Another “unintended consequence” could mean emergency rooms and trauma systems seeing an uptick in people who normally seek health services through community clinics, Lockett said.  
Federally Qualified Health Centers, which receive federal funding to provide primary care to underserved populations, are still unclear on the full impact of the rule change, said Randy Smith, the CEO of Southern Nevada Community Health Center.
“The individuals that we’re talking about are some of the most vulnerable members of our community,” he said. “There’s also a public health implication. They may have communicable diseases that are going to go untreated. Certainly on the individual level, it’s about quality of life … It’s a whole system of care really impacted in a very significant way in terms of access to care and the costs associated with that care.”
While roughly half of the patients coming into the Southern Nevada Community Health Center are uninsured, Smith said he wasn’t sure how many lacked health insurance because they didn’t have legal status. 
“The health center program has never had a requirement to collect eligibility documentation,” he said. “What I do know is a significant portion of them are and that’s because we’ve made efforts to help folks get on insurance and they’ve been unable to do so.”
There are also public health implications around the spread of communicable diseases.
The guidelines, if fully implemented, would mean immunizations, communicable disease testing and screening could be carried out without checking immigration status, Lockett said. 
Some in the board worried that many people, even those who are legal permanent residents or have Green Cards, aren’t seeking care, including vaccinations. 
Lockett said the district is working on doing more outreach to “make it clear they still have access to immunization services at the health district and they still have access to communicable disease services.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Image-8-15-25-at-12.01 PM-1024x572.jpeg,,,2025-08-18 08:56:48.562036

Santiago/Getty Images)BILOXI, Miss. — The Trump administration is developing a powerful data tool it claims will let states identify noncitizens registered to vote. But Democratic critics and data experts warn it could allow the federal government to vacuum up vast quantities of information on Americans for unclear purposes.
Some Democratic election officials and opponents of the effort fear President Donald Trump wants to build a federal database of voters to target political opponents or cherry-pick rare examples of noncitizen voters to fuel a sense of crisis. Republican election officials allied with the president counter that he’s helping states to maintain accurate voter rolls.
The Trump administration has rolled out changes to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, tool at the same time the U.S. Department of Justice is asking states for copies of their voter rolls. The timing, combined with questions about what happens to voter data uploaded to the program, has alarmed critics.
Trump wants Congress to pass a national proof of citizenship voter registration requirement and in March tried to unilaterally impose one for federal elections through executive order. But with the legislation stalled and the order halted by the courts, the citizenship data tool may offer a backdoor way to accomplish the same goal.
SAVE was originally intended to help state and local officials verify the immigration status of individual noncitizens seeking government benefits. But U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, this spring refashioned it into a platform that can scan states’ voter rolls if election officials upload the data.

The changes to SAVE, rolled out over just a few months and with little public debate, are “tinkering with sort of the bones of democracy,” said John Davisson, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington, D.C.-based research and advocacy group that argues privacy is a fundamental right.
“You’re talking about the voting process and who will be eligible to vote,” Davisson said. “And to take a system that is not designed for use in that process and repurpose it, really on the fly, without a formal comment process, without formal rulemaking, without congressional intervention — that’s pretty anomalous and pretty alarming.”
Previously, SAVE could only search one name at a time. Now it can conduct bulk searches, allowing state officials to potentially feed into it information on millions of registered voters. SAVE checks that information against a series of federal databases and reports back whether it can verify someone’s immigration status.
Since May, it also can draw upon Social Security data, transforming the program into a tool that can confirm citizenship because Social Security records for many, but not all, Americans include the information. NPR reported earlier on changes to SAVE.
“It is incredible what has been done, really since March,” Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray, a Republican who supports proof of citizenship requirements and the SAVE tool, told a gathering of state secretaries of state in Biloxi, Mississippi, last week.
Individuals registering to vote in federal elections must already sign a statement affirming they are citizens under penalty of perjury, and those who cast a ballot face criminal penalties and deportation. One study of the 2016 election placed the prevalence of noncitizen voting at 0.0001% of votes cast.
But as Trump has spread falsehoods about elections, Republicans have made purging noncitizens from voter rolls a central focus.

	Democratic concerns were on display last week at the National Association of Secretaries of State conference, held at the Beau Rivage casino-resort in Biloxi. In interviews on the sidelines of the conference, Democratic secretaries of state voiced deep reservations — or outright opposition — about plugging their voter data into SAVE.
Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said Aug. 6 that the federal government appeared to be trying to take over election administration. She formally rejected the Justice Department’s voter roll request two days later.
Bellows said the Department of Homeland Security told her in a recent phone call that it planned to retain SAVE data for 10 years for “audit purposes only.”
“Just like the [Justice Department] is asking us to hand over an electronic file of all the voters in our state, it seems like the Department of Homeland Security is through this backdoor system also asking us to share voter information about every voter in our state,” Bellows said.
At least one state appears to have granted the federal government sweeping authority over any voter data it provides to SAVE.
Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales announced in July he had reached an agreement with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to access the newly expanded system for voter list maintenance. Indiana’s agreement allows the federal agency to use information the state provides for any purpose permitted by law, including criminal prosecutions.
Morales, a Republican, said in a news release that SAVE represented “another step in safeguarding the rights” of eligible voters. His office didn’t respond to Stateline’s questions.
The Trump administration has ramped up efforts to encourage state election officials to use the expanded program. The White House hosted a bipartisan “fly in” event for state secretaries of state on July 29. Multiple secretaries of state told Stateline that USCIS Director Joseph Edlow, who was confirmed on July 15, spoke at the event.
“The president is very much keyed in on voter list maintenance,” Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, a Republican, said in an interview — echoing other GOP secretaries of state who released statements praising the Trump administration after the meeting.



When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances.


– Minnesota Democratic Secretary of State Steve Simon


Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, a Democrat who attended the meeting, said he questioned how the federal government would handle voter information provided to SAVE. He added that the Justice Department’s request for his state’s voter rolls raised his level of concern about how data would be used.
“When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances,” Simon told Stateline.
The White House referred questions about SAVE and the event to the Department of Homeland Security and USCIS.
In response to questions from Stateline, USCIS didn’t directly answer whether the agency would share voter roll data with other parts of the federal government but confirmed it disposes of records after 10 years.
“The SAVE application is a critical tool for state and local governments to access information to safeguard the integrity of elections across the country. It’s no wonder many states have quickly adopted it, and we continue to promote the tool to other states and counties not using SAVE,” USCIS spokesperson Matthew Tragesser said in a statement.
“We look forward to continued optimization efforts and implementing more updates to SAVE.”
GOP pressure
Some Republican election officials and Trump allies have long wanted the federal government to take an expanded role in searching state voter rolls for noncitizens.
Last summer the Trump-aligned litigation group America First Legal, co-founded by Trump adviser Stephen Miller, encouraged states to submit to the Department of Homeland Security the names of individuals for citizenship or immigration status verification.
Some states did just that. Texas, for example, asked USCIS to verify the citizenship of some voters in September, and Indiana asked the agency to verify 585,774 voters in October. The same month, 16 Republican state attorneys general signed a letter criticizing Homeland Security, then under the Biden administration, for failing to work with states on verification.

After Trump took office, GOP state officials kept up the pressure. Twenty-one Republican secretaries of state urged Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in February to prioritize SAVE improvements.
On April 16, Indiana sued the department in federal court for not responding to its verification request last fall. USCIS announced an overhaul of SAVE less than a week later.
As the agency continues to remake SAVE, the tool will soon allow searches using the last four digits of a Social Security number, multiple state secretaries of state told Stateline. The agency confirmed the feature is under development and will be available soon but didn’t provide an exact date.
The change would mark another significant expansion of the program because most states collect the last four digits when individuals without a driver’s license register to vote.
Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican, said SAVE represents a better way to verify citizenship than a state law requiring voters to produce documents. “I think there’s a real opportunity for us to do a lot of this through just sharing of information and I think that’s what we’re seeing happen,” McGrane said in an interview.
Unreliable data?
But some voting rights advocates and experts on government data caution against an overreliance on Social Security data.
The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, a progressive policy nonprofit, has noted that Social Security only began tracking the citizenship status of all applicants in 1978 — meaning the database doesn’t include comprehensive citizenship information for older Americans. Additionally, Social Security may not always have up-to-date information on the status of naturalized U.S. citizens.
The nonpartisan Institute for Responsive Government also warned in May that since SAVE hasn’t used Social Security numbers to verify citizenship in the past, its accuracy and effectiveness are unknown. The success of the expanded SAVE program may also partially depend on whether it has adequate staff and resources, it said.

A 2017 Government Accountability Office report found that between fiscal years 2012 and 2016, about 16% of the nearly 90 million SAVE searches required additional verification, which the institute says often translates into federal workers manually checking files. Now that SAVE allows bulk searches, the need for manual checking could rise dramatically.
Nick Doctor, director of implementation at the Institute for Responsive Government, said in an interview that a tool confirming the eligibility of registered voters in a way that doesn’t burden individuals can be a good thing. But he emphasized that it depends in large measure on SAVE’s implementation.
“The changes that have been made to SAVE happened very quickly and, to my knowledge, we haven’t seen releases on the level of accuracy of that information,” Doctor said.
During interviews, Republican secretaries of state stressed that voters aren’t kicked off the rolls because SAVE can’t verify their citizenship. Instead, an inability to verify would likely trigger a follow-up process with the voter.
“Just because we get something back from the SAVE database, it’s not a cut and dry, especially on those they’re not sure about,” Hoskins, the Missouri secretary of state, said.
Still, Arizona illustrates why some Democrats worry about any large-scale effort to ask voters — especially longtime, older residents — to prove their citizenship. After the state discovered errors in how it tracked voter citizenship dating back years, election officials are contacting some 200,000 voters seeking proof of citizenship documentation.
Some have been casting ballots for decades without incident and many feel targeted, Arizona Democratic Secretary of State Adrian Fontes said during a presentation at the state secretaries of state conference. “They feel insulted when they get that letter,” Fontes said.



There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside.


– Charles Stewart III, professor of political science at MIT who studies elections


Charles Stewart III, a professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies elections, said Arizona may actually point to the potential usefulness of SAVE. If Arizona runs its voter roll through the program, a list of 200,000 voters needing citizenship verification would perhaps drop into the hundreds, he suggested.
“There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside,” Stewart said.
Connecticut Democratic Secretary of State Stephanie Thomas told Stateline that every secretary wants tools to keep voter lists as clean as possible. But the details are important.
When she hears of something new, Thomas said she asks whether it’s the best option available and whether “the i’s are dotted, the t’s crossed.” She said she’s asked USCIS a series of questions about SAVE and is waiting on some responses.
“When it comes to voter lists,” Thomas said, “I don’t want Connecticut voters to be a guinea pig.”

The university is fighting a lawsuit brought by UA System professors and students to overturn a state anti-DEI law passed in 2024. (Laura Chramer for Alabama Reflector)What on Earth is the University of Alabama doing?
To be more precise: Why is university leadership letting federal and state officials shove Black and LGBTQ+ students out of public life? With no objection?
The UA system, as you might know, is fighting professors and students suing to overturn SB 129, Alabama’s anti-minority law — I’m sorry, “anti-DEI” law. The plaintiffs allege the statute intimidates instructors and prevents students from marginalized groups from organizing as they have a right to do.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Exhibit A: UA last year closed down a dedicated space for the Black Student Union and and another for LGBTQ+ students, known as the Safe Zone. Now UA’s attorneys say that the university can’t reopen them because of guidance the Trump administration.
“The guidance states that it would be an unlawful practice for ‘[a] university’s DEI initiative [to designate] a ‘safe space’ or lounge exclusively for students of a specific racial or ethnic group,” attorneys for the UA system wrote in a filing earlier this month.  “[E]ven if access is technically open to all, the identity-based focus creates a perception of segregation and may foster a hostile environment’ in violation of federal antidiscrimination laws.”
This is ludicrous, as attorneys for the professors and students suing UA pointed out last week. The Trump administration guidance is not binding on the school. And access to the groups was not “technically” open to all; it was open to all.
“There is not a shred of evidence in the record that either the BSU space or the Safe Zone created a perception of segregation or fostered a hostile environment,” the plaintiffs’ attorneys wrote.
I’d add that it’s a lot easier to join the Black Student Union than any of the UA Greek chapters HBO keeps shoving in our faces. The BSU doesn’t charge up to $5,532 for membership.
Ah, but following the argument of UA’s attorneys to its logical conclusion, if the most brittle white heterosexual at UA thinks the existence of Black and LGBTQ groups means segregation, segregation exists. And taking 40 seconds to explain basic concepts of association to Mr. Comeapart is too much work. Better to tell Black and LGBTQ+ students to hide themselves.
If this sounds like discrimination to you, it does to me, too.
The attorneys’ argument also will repeat UA’s shameful history. The school was built by enslaved people, some of whom were rented out by faculty members who pocketed the earnings of those who did the work.
Like every other public school in the state, UA excluded Black students through the early 1960s. When Autherine Lucy, a Black student, enrolled in a graduate library science course in 1956, a white mob stoned her car and tried to kill her. The university suspended and later expelled Lucy. When Vivian Malone and James Hood enrolled at the school in 1963, UA students made their lives hell. Hood transferred out.
One would hope this history would inspire UA’s leaders to break from it and make a campus that reflects its state and country. And by some measures, it has. There were nearly 5,000 Black students enrolled at the school in the fall of 2024, about 12% of the student body. That’s not 27%, like the Black population of the state, but a far better percentage than Auburn University (under 5%). (Schools do not track the number of students identifying as LGBTQ+.)
Yet UA leaders now seem to view that progress as a liability.
It’s hard to understand their choices over the last year if they didn’t. UA could have used its unique constitutional status to fight SB 129. It could have formed an alliance of schools to defend the mission of higher education in our state. Instead, it knuckled under and punished Black and LGBTQ+ students.
Administrators could have said something — anything — about Alireza Doroudi, a graduate student from Iran kidnapped by Immigration and Customs Enforcement earlier this year. Not only did they stay silent about Doroudi’s plight, UA leaders welcomed President Donald Trump to campus as Doroudi’s vision, hearing and mental health deteriorated in a Louisiana prison. All thanks to Trump’s actions.
Now UA’s leaders hide behind the White House to justify their craven behavior.
The school faces a choice. UA is a vital institution of research and education in our state, one that’s still relatively affordable and open to all Alabamians. UA can continue down that path, serving as engine of personal growth, social mobility and economic development.
Or it can become what the Trump administration and the Alabama Legislature want it to be: A finishing school for white Mountain Brook teenagers, subsidized by tuition payments from Dix Hills, New York and Winnetka, Illinois. A playground for rich young Alabamians, protecting them from new ideas and reinforcing their sense of privilege.
In short, it would be the old University of Alabama. A school whose mission is not educating the young, but doing what the powerful tell them.
And UA administrators keep showing their preference for the latter.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Donald-Trump-UA-commencement-May-1-2025-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-08-18 08:56:48.562036

(Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama Department of Education plans to change the requirements for hiring directors for the state’s Child Nutrition Program.
Currently, a child nutrition program director must have a bachelor’s degree in food and nutrition, food service management, or home economics; a minimum of 1,400 hours in compensated food management or an approved alternative and 15 hours of professional development.
The proposed changes would only require candidates to have a high school diploma, three years of food service management experience, state approved training and a level four certificate from the School Nutrition Association. The aim, said State Schools Superintendent Eric Mackey on Thursday, is to make it easier for school districts with less than 2,500 students to hire directors.

“One of the big issues is, especially in small school districts, they may have somebody who’s really good, who has been the high school cafeteria manager for forever, but she doesn’t have a college degree and therefore doesn’t qualify for a promotion,” Mackey said.
Under the proposed changes, Child Nutrition Program directors in school districts with 2,500 students or more will still be required to have a valid Alabama Professional Child Nutrition Program Director Certificate issued by the state department and a bachelor’s degree.
The Child Nutrition Program isn’t limited to serving meals during the academic year. In addition to providing breakfast and lunch, ALSDE also oversees weekend, nighttime and summer feeding programs.
“It’s not just school lunch. School lunch is a big piece of it, but it’s a huge operation that provides for many families whose children are getting most of their meals through our department,” Mackey said.

Wes Moore says he didn't inherit a $5 billion budget surplus in 2022, but a structural deficit propped up with COVID money. But longtime GOP adviser Jim Burton says there's still no getting around the bottom-line numbers.","Gov. Wes Moore hands a pen used to sign the state's $67 billion fiscal 2026 budget to House Appropriations Chair Ben Barnes in May. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Recently, Gov. Wes Moore appeared on Special Report with Bret Baier on Fox News. When questioned about Maryland’s growing budget deficit, Moore dismissed the premise outright, stating, “That’s been debunked over and over.”
But has it really?
In January 2023, just days into his administration, Moore himself said, “We anticipate ending the current fiscal year 2023 with more than a $2 billion General Fund balance and an additional $2.9 billion in the Rainy Day Fund — $5 billion in combined General Fund cash reserves.”
It’s on tape. So, what’s been “debunked”?
Here’s the math every Marylander understands: Moore inherited a $5 billion surplus from Gov. Larry Hogan. Now, just two and a half years later, the state is staring down a projected $3 billion deficit by fiscal year 2027. That’s an $8 billion fiscal swing in the wrong direction — an alarming number, especially for working families trying to stretch every dollar in the face of rising costs and tax hikes.
Ironically, the news of Maryland’s looming deficit in 2023 broke around the same time Moore held a high-profile ceremony to unveil the official portraits of former Gov. Martin O’Malley and first lady Catherine O’Malley. Former Gov. Parris Glendening even attended. The moment was steeped in symbolism. These three governors — Glendening, O’Malley and now Moore — share more than just Democratic politics. They share a pattern of running up budget deficits and resorting to tax hikes.
As Yogi Berra once said: “It’s déjà vu all over again.”

O’Malley famously raised taxes or fees over 40 times, totaling $9.5 billion in new revenue. That record helped pave the way for Larry Hogan’s election in 2014.
Moore now seems to be following a familiar playbook.
The FY 2026 budget introduces $1.6 billion in new taxes and fees, including:

A new tech tax
Increased car registration and tire fees
Higher fishing license costs
A new capital gains surcharge

It’s no wonder Moore wants to distance himself from his once-celebrated surplus. Acknowledging it would expose just how far off track his fiscal management has taken the state.
Maryland voters have seen this movie before. In 1994 (almost), 2002, and 2014, Democratic governors overreached, and voters responded by giving Republicans their shot at leadership.
Even Moore’s own approval numbers — while not disastrous — are softening. The most recent UMBC poll showed 55% approval, 36% disapproval. That’s good, not great, especially considering the media praise and national attention he’s receiving.
After the GOP’s disheartening showing in 2022, the current fiscal crisis offers a path forward. But success isn’t automatic — Republicans must do the hard work:

Stay disciplined on message
Organize locally and statewide
Recruit strong candidates
Expand voter registration
Knock on doors and engage voters directly

Republicans need to make it clear: Moore and Democratic leaders are spending tax dollars without proper accountability or program effectiveness. Instead of making tough choices or cutting failing initiatives, their default solution is to raise taxes on hardworking Marylanders.
The gas tax is up. Fees are up. Inflation is real. And the state budget is headed into the red.
Moore can try to rewrite the history of the $5 billion surplus. But voters remember. And come 2026, they may once again decide it’s time to change the script in Annapolis.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DSC_0169-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-08-18 07:58:03.330138

(Photo: Scott Olson/Getty Images)As wildfire crews battled the Dragon Bravo Fire on the Grand Canyon’s North Rim in July 2025, the air turned toxic.
A chlorine gas leak had erupted from the park’s water treatment facility as the building burned, forcing firefighters to pull back. The water treatment facility is part of a system that draws water from a fragile spring. It’s the only water source and system for the park facilities on both rims, including visitor lodging and park service housing.
The fire also damaged some of the area’s water pipes and equipment, leaving fire crews to rely on a fleet of large water trucks to haul in water and raising concerns about contamination risks to the water system itself.
By mid-August, Dragon Bravo was a “megafire,” having burned over 140,000 acres, and was one of the largest fires in Arizona history. It had destroyed more than 70 structures, including the iconic Grand Canyon Lodge, and sent smoke across the region.
Wildfires like this are increasingly affecting water supplies across the U.S. and creating a compounding crisis that experts in water, utilities and emergency management are only beginning to wrestle with.
 A pattern across the West

Before 2017, when the Tubbs Fire burned through neighborhoods on the edge of Santa Rosa, California, most research on the nexus of wildfire and water had focused on issues such as drought and how climate change effects ecosystems.
The Tubbs Fire destroyed thousands of buildings and also melted plastic water pipes. After the fire, a resident’s complaint about the taste and odor of tap water led to the discovery that the fire’s damage had introduced contaminants including benzene, a carcinogen, into parts of the public water system.
It quickly became obvious that the damage discovered at the Tubbs Fire was not unique.
Similar damage and pollutants were discovered in another California water system after the 2018 Camp Fire destroyed much of Paradise, a town of over 25,000 people.
Nevada wildfires will result in more water quality challenges, study shows

The list of incidents goes on.
In southern Oregon, the 2020 Almeda Fire damaged water pipes in buildings, leaving water to flow freely. That contributed to low system pressure just when people fighting the fire needed the water.
In Colorado, the 2021 Marshall Fire burned through urban water lines, damaging six public drinking-water systems along with more than 1,000 structures in the Boulder suburbs. All six systems lost power, which in some cases led to a loss of water pressure, hampering firefighting.
As firefighters worked on the Marshall Fire, water system operators raced to keep water flowing and contaminants from being transported into the water systems. But tests still detected chemical contamination, including benzene, in parts of the systems a few weeks later.
Then, in January 2025, the Los Angeles fires supercharged concerns about water and wildfire. As firefighters raced to put out multiple fires, hydrants ran dry in some parts of the region, while others at higher elevations depressurized. Ultimately, over 16,000 structures were damaged, leading to insured losses estimated to be as high as US$45 billion.
Water infrastructure is not merely collateral damage during wildfires – it is now a central concern.
It also raises the question: What can residents, first responders and decision-makers reasonably expect from water systems that weren’t designed with today’s disasters in mind?
 Addressing the growing fire and water challenge

While no two water systems or fires are the same, nearly every water system component, ranging from storage tanks to pipelines to treatment plants, is susceptible to damage.
The Grand Canyon’s Roaring Springs system exemplifies the complexity and fragility of older systems. It supplies water to both rims of the park through a decades-old network of gravity-fed pipes and tunnels and includes the water treatment facility where firefighters were forced to retreat because of the chlorine leak.
Many water systems have vulnerable points within or near flammable wildlands, such as exposed pump houses that are crucial for pulling water from lower elevations to where it is needed.
In addition, hazardous materials such as chlorine or ammonia may be stored on-site and require special considerations in high fire risk areas. Staff capacity is often limited; some small utilities depend on a single operator, and budgets may be too constrained to modernize aging infrastructure or implement fire mitigation measures.
As climate change intensifies wildfire seasons, these vulnerabilities can become disaster risks that require making water infrastructure a more integral part of fighting and preparing for wildfires.
 Ways to help everyone prepare

As a researcher with Arizona State University’s Julie Ann Wrigley Global Futures Laboratory, I have been working with colleagues and fire and water systems experts on strategies to help communities and fire and water managers prepare.
Here are a few important lessons:

Prioritizing fire-resistant construction, better shielding of chemicals and, in some cases, decentralizing water systems can help protect critical facilities, particularly in high-risk zones. Having backup power supplies, mobile treatment systems and alternate water sources are essential to provide more security in the face of a wildfire.
Emergency command protocols and interagency coordination are most effective when they include water utilities as essential partners in all phases of emergency response, from planning to response to recovery. Fire crews and water operators can also benefit from joint training in emergency response, especially when system failure could hinder firefighting itself.
Longer term, protecting upstream watersheds from severe fire by thinning forests and using controlled burns, along with erosion control measures, can help maintain water quality and reduce water pollution in the aftermath of fires.
Smaller and more isolated systems, particularly in tribal or low-income communities, often need assistance to plan or implement new measures. These systems may require technical assistance, and regional support hubs could support communities with additional resources, including personnel and equipment, so they can respond quickly when crises strike.

 Looking ahead

The Dragon Bravo Fire isn’t just a wildfire story, it’s also a water story, and it signals a larger, emerging challenge across the West. As fire seasons expand in size and complexity, the overlap between fire and water will only grow.
The Grand Canyon fire offers a stark illustration of how wildfire can escalate into a multifaceted infrastructure crisis: Fire can damage water infrastructure, which in turn limits firefighting capabilities and stresses water supplies.
The question is not whether this will happen again. It’s how prepared communities will be when it does.

“This memorial will honor those affected and will stand as a lasting tribute to the loss and resilience of the Spartan community,” the agenda materials said.
Even as the university navigates financial “uncertainty” and a 9% budget reduction announced by MSU President Kevin Guskiewicz  in June of this year, plans for a memorial on campus have been under discussion since fall 2023, prompted by the Spartan community’s demand for a space to commemorate the tragedy.
The total construction costs are estimated at $3.2 million with $300,000 provided by the Spartan Strong Fund and the remainder from capital reserves. Additionally, according to the agenda materials, the maintenance of the memorial will require an annual cost of $22,500 for the upkeep of the fountain and surrounding landscape, which is described as the “highest level of service.”

In an email statement to the Advance, a MSU spokesperson, Mark Bullion, said “the memorial will be funded by $300,000 set aside from the Spartan Strong Fund, and the rest will come from the university’s capital reserves, not general fund dollars.”
The memorial’s approval followed MSU’s decision earlier this month to pause its plan to lay off psychiatric providers and transition those services to MSU Health Care as part of previously announced university-wide budget reductions.
Following the announcement of the proposed changes, an unsigned online petition circulated, calling for the reinstatement of Dr. Swapna Hingwe, the first woman of color to lead the university’s counseling and psychiatric services.
While the petition, with approximately 1,500 signatures, applauded the decision to suspend the dismissal and other changes, it also expressed apprehension about future actions. 
“We remain concerned about the damage already done and the lack of transparency surrounding the future leadership and direction of Mental Health and Trauma Support Services,” the petition stated.

Seeking to delve into healing and memory, the approved project, named the “Permanent February 13th Memorial,” as stated in the agenda documents, was designed by artists Carlos Portillo and Jessica Guinto, who described it months ago as a “communal space that fosters healing, honors, and respects the process of grieving and remembrance.” 
Bullion also highlighted the importance of the memorial for the MSU community in offering a place for reflection, healing and remembrance. “A space where our community can honor the lives lost and those who were injured and affected,” he said.
The memorial will be located between the Student Services and Natural Sciences buildings on the east side of campus. It will replace an existing fountain in the former horticulture garden, and benches and seasonal plants will be added, as illustrated in the project models.
About 5,000 people participated in the process to choose the design for the future memorial, highlighted MSU Vice Provost for University Arts and Collections, Judith Stoddart, who congratulated the community for their support and involvement. 
“From the earliest stages of this project, including input from those most directly impacted, through the final design selection, the MSU and surrounding communities played a vital role in shaping the memorial,” Stoddart said.
Guskiewicz emphasized the impact on the Spartan community of the violence experienced on the cold night of the shooting.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-18 11:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,What to know about the CT Alert emergency notification system,Janhavi Munde,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/18/ct-alert-emergency-notification-system/,"CT Alert allows towns to reach residents who have signed up with information related to evacuations, safety measures or general alerts.","In a recent interview with MSNBC focused on the state’s preparation for hurricane season, Gov. Ned Lamont referenced the deadly flooding that took place in Naugatuck Valley last August. He said Connecticut is preparing for severe weather and public safety emergencies by taking a number of steps, like setting aside money in case of major storm damage.
“I just don’t know if I can count on FEMA right now,” Lamont said, referring to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is one of the federal agencies President Donald J. Trump has been working to dismantle. 
He also urged residents to sign up for the state’s “early warning system.”
In Connecticut, several emergency notification systems operate under state and regional authorities to notify residents with important information in times of public safety and health emergencies. One relatively modern statewide system is CT Alert.
Powered by software company Everbridge, CT Alert allows participating towns’ 911 call centers to reach residents who have signed up with information related to evacuations, safety measures or general alerts via cellphone, email or text message.
In times of critical emergencies, the system, operated by the state Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection, or DESSP, may try multiple methods to reach a resident if it requests but does not receive confirmation that the person got the notification.
How many people does CT Alert reach?
Less than 10% of CT residents have signed up for CT Alert, but Connecticut’s DESSP has over 4.8 million statewide contacts in the system, which allows it to amplify reach should an emergency demand it.
In an average year, anywhere between 3,000 to 5,000 individuals sign up to be alerted through the system.  This year to date, approximately 9,000 people have signed up.
Each alert is customizable, where 911 dispatchers can choose how localized the notification is and how many people to reach.
Last year, CT Alert was used 97 times. This year, it has been used 25 times. The system sees signup spikes after events like floods, fires, and other emergencies.
How do I sign up? 
Residents can sign up on CT Alert’s website by providing their name, email address, phone number and work or home address. Residents and businesses that have listed telephone numbers are already registered for the system.
Although the system is available to all towns, its usage depends on your given town or region’s 911 centers. Some towns might use more enhanced or specific notification systems, like Reverse 911.
When a town chooses to use CT Alert it means its emergency dispatch center will utilize the system to send out emergency alerts to residents. However, a registered individual will still get statewide and regional CT alerts even if their town does not actively use the system.
Although DESPP has access to Whitepages data for landlines numbers and purchased cellphone data through Everbridge, signing up to be alerted is the most effective way to be updated by the system, officials said.
Registered data can be disclosed to third parties for the purpose of emergency notification, or as required by the law, according to CT Alert’s FAQ page.  
How is CT Alert different from other emergency notification systems? 
The driving idea behind CT Alert was to warn residents preemptively before danger is imminent. Some statewide notifications are sent out to warn of incoming, and not always expected, danger.
Reverse 911 is another commonly used emergency notification system in Connecticut, which allows local authorities to reach specific neighborhoods, zones or towns by contacting registered landlines and cellphones for localized threats.
Nationwide notification systems, tailored regionally by local law enforcement, like FEMA’s Integrated Public Alert & Warning System or AMBER alerts notify the broader public about more specific emergencies, like only natural disasters or only missing children, respectively, often using broadcasting on radio and TV in addition to cellphones.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/49805592_1315199508620985_7928512067957424128_n.jpg,,,2025-08-18 07:58:03.330138

Through providing youth with evidence-based, relationship-centered mentoring programs we can help youth feel like they matter and instill a sense of belonging. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Jen Colman: Mentors help Vermont youth feel like they matter.","This commentary is by Jen Colman, of Burlington. She is a mental health provider for children and adolescents, and collaborates with youth-based organizations and schools to provide direct mental health services. Colman is also the executive director of Green Mountain Mobile Therapy, a nonprofit organization that provides accessible mental health and social emotional resources for children and adolescents.


As a mental health professional who works with Vermont’s youth, I see how our students are struggling everyday. 
Nationally, young people have reported a dramatic increase in conflict and divisiveness in our communities. A constant barrage of media, combined with social disconnectedness, creates a systemic feeling of hopelessness. 
Earlier this year, Vermont This Week on Vermont Public hosted a panel discussion on the state of youth mental health in Vermont. The conversation focused on the Vermont Department of Health’s 2023 Youth Behavior Risk Survey, released in November 2024, and the results showed that Vermont youth’s mental health is still in crisis with little improvement since the Covid-19 pandemic. 
One of the questions asked in the panel was “What do kids need?” and the collective response was that kids need to be believed and listened to. They need to feel like they belong and that they matter. It’s time for Vermont to get creative in how we approach our youth mental health crisis. 
Through providing youth with evidence-based, relationship-centered mentoring programs, we can help youth feel like they matter and instill a sense of belonging. 
Mentoring programs play a crucial role in supporting youth mental health by providing individualized, one-on-one attention and fostering meaningful relationships between youth and trusted adults. In Vermont, 96% of mentees in mentoring programs funded by the nonprofit organization MENTOR Vermont reported that their mentor made them feel like they matter, and 92% said having a mentor made a positive difference in their lives. 
MENTOR Vermont leads, expands and strengthens the mentoring movement, building capacity to make high-quality relationships accessible to all young people, so every young person in Vermont has the supportive relationships they need to grow and thrive.
Mentors offer emotional support, guidance and encouragement, which are particularly beneficial for youth struggling with mental health issues. They help young people engage in their schoolwork, think critically about their future and navigate personal challenges. This support is essential in preventing risky behaviors among young people. 
Moreover, mentoring meets youth where they live, learn, work and play, providing them with a consistent person outside of their family that they can turn to for support. 
Despite this data, 1 in 3 youth will grow up without a mentor and without the support of a trusted adult. According to the National Mentoring Partnership, young people who have mentors are more likely to improve in areas such as emotional regulation, social skills and overall life satisfaction. A study by the Journal of Primary Prevention found that mentoring can lower the likelihood of depressive symptoms and suicide attempts by providing emotional support, positive role models and a sense of belonging. 
Overall, mentoring programs are a proven tool in promoting mental well-being and ensuring that young people have the supportive relationships they need to thrive. 
Although the Vermont youth mental health crisis may seem overwhelming, it can be addressed by being proactive and putting in place proven early intervention programs such as mentoring. 
Thanks to the work of MENTOR Vermont, such programs already exist in many communities throughout the state, but they need sustainable investment to adequately meet the needs of youth across Vermont. This investment will ensure that every child who needs a mentor has access to one, and the path toward stabilizing and moving out of this crisis will become clear.

(Getty Images)Students identified with Autism Spectrum Disorder or ASD are a rapidly growing exceptionality category of students who display a very individualized and complex set of needs. Many families choose to supplement the educational services offered by their school with private ABA therapy. 
Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) therapy is a commonly used technique for autism symptoms. When implemented with fidelity per research based best practices in combination with a school experience, ABA therapy can be a powerful tool for early intervention to support students navigating ASD. 
In 2024, the US Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General released a blistering report of Indiana’s growing ABA clinic landscape. The report tells a cautionary tale of a field with no billing caps, no quality control, no oversight, no parent voice, and audacious fiscal improprieties. According to the report, Indiana made at least $56 million in improper fee-for-service Medicaid payments for ABA therapies from 2017-2020. 
The report cited Indiana’s ABA clinics ballooning their Medicaid billing from $14.4 million to $101.8 million in just three years, the second highest in the country. The report documented examples such as an individual student receiving more than $677,000 in individual services in a three year period. Another example documented an individual student receiving more than $28,000 in services per month over multiple years. All while not preforming background checks on service providers or showing any impact on student growth. 
Autism spectrum disorder as a disability category has experienced an unprecedented level of advocacy, funding, research, and attention in the mainstream over the last 20 years. Indiana’s own Rep. Dan Burton made advocating and funding autism his own personal issue. While in office, he funneled millions to our state to better understand ASD and serve this population. As a grandfather of a child with autism, he fought tirelessly for the right of families to have high quality support.
Indiana panel to consider ABA therapy cost controls

Based on his efforts, our state has an unusually high level of expertise in this area including the Autism Center at Riley Children’s Hospital and the Indiana Institute on Disability and Community at Indiana University. Given our state’s history with ASD funding and expertise, the 2024 report is all more concerning. We are a state that should have known better than to allow this to happen to our families. 
There are multiple layers of special education accountability that schools must navigate to serve students with ASD, including the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and Indiana’s Article 7. Currently, stand-alone ABA clinics do not have to adhere to any of the laws put in place to protect students with disabilities within educational settings. 
Schools are held accountable by the individual families via federally required annual meetings, where a child’s individualized education plan and progress toward annual goals are documented and discussed. They are held accountable for the academic progress of students with exceptionalities in their publicly accessible state reporting and accountability processes via the Indiana Department of Education, which includes reporting the academic achievement data of students identified as having exceptionalities. Charter schools have an additional layer of accountability as part of their authorizing processes to ensure services are provided, students are growing, and the law is being met. 
Private schools across the state offer special education support to their families in a way that matches their mission and traditions. Additionally, alternative schools, disability focused schools, recovery high schools, and adult high schools are all held accountable for the services they provide to students with exceptionalities.
Hoosier families that have children with exceptionalities deserve high quality and trustworthy options for their children. Hoosier taxpayers deserve for their tax dollars to help as many people as possible via the Medicaid system. Unfortunately, in Indiana we have not implemented an accountability process for ABA clinics, leaving the door open for predatory practices. While Medicaid, private insurances, and schools all have strict regulations and accountability processes in place to ensure quality; ABA clinics were allowed to operate with none. 
During his first few weeks in office, Gov. Braun released his executive order on ABA Therapies. His orders were clear, ABA clinics using Medicaid as a bottomless ATM must stop. The ABA Therapy commission was established to tackle this issue. 
The big question now is whether the commission will start protecting Hoosier families by holding ABA clinics just as accountable to policies and regulations as every other organization serving students with ASD.

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota State University is working to get back about $66 million in federal funding it lost when the Trump administration canceled a grant program it said was a “climate slush fund.”
The U.S. Department of Agriculture awarded South Dakota’s largest university $86 million in 2023 to research the impact of bison and cattle ranchers’ land management practices on soil health, and to open markets for farmers and ranchers using those practices. It was the largest research grant in South Dakota higher education history.
The grant came from the Partners for Climate-Smart Commodities program. Since 2022 during the Biden administration, the USDA had awarded 141 projects across the country a total of $3 billion. In April, the Trump administration terminated the grants and renamed the program Advancing Markets for Producers, saying “select projects may continue if it is demonstrated that a significant amount of the federal funds awarded will go to farmers.”


Federal Fallout
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and whether to make up the difference.
Read the latest > 


Brooke Rollins, head of the USDA, said at the time that the Biden-era version of the program “was largely built to advance the green new scam,” a reference to policies undertaken by Biden to address climate change.
SDSU had already spent about $20 million when the climate-smart grants were terminated. The university lost an additional $1.4 million in other grant funding from the program. Two other South Dakota institutions also lost grant funding: the University of South Dakota lost $223,892, and South Dakota Mines lost $1.3 million.
The new program requires at least 65% of funding to go toward producer incentives, instead of 35% under the earlier version of the program. Kristi Cammack, assistant dean for SDSU agriculture West River operations, said the university renamed the project from “The Grass is Greener on the Other Side: Developing Climate-Smart Beef and Bison Commodities” to “Producers first: incentivizing land management and advancing markets for US beef and bison operations,” and shifted some funding originally intended for research toward producer incentives.
“We learned quite a bit over the two years we’ve been working on this, so we’ve been able to make educated shifts from research to producers while still being able to answer research questions,” Cammack said.
SDSU resubmitted its research proposal at the end of June with the hopes of regaining the award by the end of the summer.
“Producers are at the crux of the whole project,” Cammack said.
The five-year program encourages bison and cattle producers to implement conservation land management and grazing practices. They collect soil samples measuring microbes and other indicators of soil health and carbon sequestration as a result of the changes. The program also has a goal of introducing those producers to new markets with customers interested in eco-friendly practices.

More than 100 producers, primarily raising cattle, were participating in the project at the time of termination. More were preparing to enroll this year. SDSU had eight faculty members working on the project, along with four other staff members and several graduate students, Cammack said. 
If re-awarded the funding later this summer, Cammack said the team will have a “busy fall” collecting soil samples before the ground freezes.
The grant cancellation is “interruptive,” she added, but her group is “nimble” and “research projects never go perfectly.”
The grant cancellation comes during a period of broader concern about university research funding. Federal funding for science is the lowest in years due to cuts made by the Trump administration and has been declining for decades as a share of gross domestic product.
President Donald Trump proposed “draconian cuts” this spring, said Daniel Scholl, vice president of research and economic development at South Dakota State, to federal research funding agencies such as the USDA, National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation – the three largest funding agencies from which SDSU receives research grants.
Scholl said he hopes Congress will resist the cuts, but is “uncertain where things will land.”
“We’re optimistic based on the efforts members of Congress are putting out to restore research funding and preserve the prowess of U.S. research and enterprise that’s largely driven by universities,” Scholl said.
If the university isn’t able to reinstate the remainder of its grant for the bison and cattle research project, Cammack said her team plans to apply for other grants and work with other partners to continue the program.

(Niki Kelly/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Two decades ago, after a prolonged and heavy lift through the 2005 legislative session, former Gov. Mitch Daniels signed a monumental piece of legislation into law: establishing daylight saving time in the Hoosier State. 
The vote was so contentious that former House Speaker Brian Bosma left the voting machine open for hours, whipping up the votes needed to advance the priority bill for Daniels. 
“We just almost had a majority, and then people would switch,” Bosma, a Republican, told the Indiana Capital Chronicle. “We went up to caucus and I had to press on.”

In the end, lawmakers advanced the measure through the house by a single vote — a decision that cost the voting lawmaker his seat in the body.
Hoosiers first sprung forward in 2006.
Prior to the law, Indiana had a hodgepodge mashup of time zones that varied from county to county. As with today’s dynamic, most Hoosier counties aligned themselves with Eastern Time, but a handful located in the southwestern and northwestern tips opted for Central Time.
Just over a dozen counties clustered near the state’s borders — including all of the counties following Central Time and at least five Eastern Time counties — voluntarily followed daylight saving time with the majority of the nation. But roughly 76 counties didn’t, which meant they switched from Eastern Time to Central Time and vice versa when other states sprung forward or fell back. 
“There are 13 states with more than one, but Indiana had three (time zones),” said Daniels. “… as a practical matter, we were in the Eastern zone during the winter, and in the Central zone during the summer.”
Synchronizing all of the time zones to make it easier to do business with national counterparts was critical to Daniels’ first-term agenda, which sought to “make Indiana, once again, a competitive state.”
“Economically, we were at the bottom of people’s lists of places where you might bring jobs and do investment. We did dozens of things: taxes, regulation, litigation, building, infrastructure. Everything that might make Indiana a more attractive place and more prosperous place,” said Daniels. “And daylight savings was a small part of that.” 
Because of the confusing time zone distinctions — which The West Wing mocked in a famous 2002 episode — deliveries were missed or rescheduled, conference calls were dropped and even airlines avoided locating hubs in Indiana, Daniels said. 
“It’s an interconnected world, more so today than twenty years ago,” Daniels said. “… It used to be you’d have to look at the calendar before you look at your watch.”
 Gettting it through the chamber

A 2005 story in the Fort Wayne Journal Gazette reported that 43 Republicans and eight Democrats pushed the proposal across the finish line. At noon, the vote stood at 49-48 but, 11 hours later, four Republicans changed their minds.
“I’ve introduced and closed on this bill so many times I’m running out of things to say,” said Rep. Jerry Torr, R-Carmel. Torr authored the 2005 measure and retired last year. “It’s past time for daylight saving time. Let’s get this bill passed.”
Bosma said his caucus identified five Republicans it believed could vote for the measure “without political consequence,” believing that Indiana was “losing economic development opportunities, big ones, because of the anomaly.”










I think that for those who were restless about the speed and the dimension of the changes that we were able to make, daylight savings time became a symbol.


– Former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels


“My clearest recollection is getting a call at about 10:30 (p.m.) from (Gov.) Mitch Daniels, while we were in caucus, and the governor saying, “Brian, just pull the plug on this,’” recalled Bosma. “And I said, ‘Governor, I’ve spent way too much capital on this not to complete the job.’”
Returning to the floor, the body still didn’t have the final votes needed, with the tally stuck at 50 votes. After some final debate, one vote flipped — and Bosma told the body’s parliamentarian to lock it in.
“And the 51st vote was the one person that I told, ‘Under no circumstances, are you to vote for this,’” Bosma said. “… Troy (Woodruff) was a Marine, and he saw a grenade and jumped on it despite instructions not to.”
Woodruff, a freshman lawmaker from southwestern Indiana, had a district split between counties observing daylight saving and those that didn’t. He said the final tally came after nearly a dozen rounds of voting, none of which were enough to either pass or kill the bill.
“More than anything, it was just … time to move on and move forward,” Woodruff told the Capital Chronicle. “I just thought, in my head, if this is one thing we can do for free that could help … we really need to do this.”
He went on to lose his seat, but Woodruff said he didn’t regret his actions — even if he still gets the occasional message about a decades-old vote.
“I still get emails to this day about daylight savings time,” he said. 
After his term in office, Woodruff was later appointed chief of staff to the Indiana Department of Transportation in 2012, resigning two years later before launching his own business and serving as president of a Fishers-based architecture firm.
 The conversation today

The tumultuous 2005 session left such scars that, decades later, some veteran lawmakers say they won’t touch the topic. 
“When I got to the General Assembly in 2010, there was a discussion where they said, ‘You can bring up bills for this, that and the other.’ But they said, ‘Whatever you do … don’t bring up the time zones,’” recalled Sen. Sue Glick, R-LaGrange. 
Still, there’s usually a bill filed each year on the topic — though they don’t advance. In 2025, three bills were filed to exempt Indiana from daylight saving time but none moved.
  Sen. Sue Glick addresses the Senate Chamber on April 7, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
Glick, whose district borders Michigan, acknowledged the difficulty for families navigating boundaries where crossing means gaining or losing an hour. Living at the western edge of the Eastern Time zone has its own drawbacks, with later sunrises and sunsets. 
“In the evening, it’s still daylight, and kids aren’t ready to go to bed,” Glick said. “… (or) your kids are standing out by the side of the road to catch the bus in the dark.”
Outside of potential safety issues for children, daylight saving time also appears to increase electricity consumption along with car emissions. In the weeks following a shift to and from daylight saving, health risks and accidents spike while productivity dips.
On the federal level, the biannual grumblings about changing the clocks revive the ongoing debate: should states move to a permanent standard time or a permanent daylight saving time? 
Moving to permanent daylight saving time would require federal permission — though both Arizona and Hawai’i use standard time year-round. In cases where the states made a change, like with Indiana, the U.S. Department of Transportation ultimately picks the time zone. 
But, perhaps due to the pushback from 2005, Indiana is one of just two states who haven’t advanced legislation or resolutions supporting a permanent, year-round time, according to NBC News. Nineteen other states support permanent daylight savings time while the remaining 27 favor standard time.
The Indiana Chamber of Commerce, a big supporter of the time zone legislation 20 years ago, said they wouldn’t be a fan of moving Indiana to permanent daylight saving time — as proposed by the federal “Sunshine Protection Act.”

Hooiers have to fall back one hour on Nov. 2.

“From our perspective, moving to that permanent observance is a significant departure from the established system that Indiana businesses have used since 2006,” said President and CEO Vanessa Green Sinders. “…If there was consensus around eliminating the semiannual clock change, our preference would be standard time because it better aligns with winter daylight patterns and supports morning operational needs for all of our companies.” 
Aligning all 92 counties with daylight saving time did bring a small, yet statistically significant job boost to the Hoosier state, but Daniels said it was also emblematic of a changing Indiana.
“I think that for those who were restless about the speed and the dimension of the changes that we were able to make, daylight savings time became a symbol,” Daniels said. “I can’t tell you how often people said, ‘Yeah, maybe (you’ll accomplish) the rest of all these plans, but you’ll never change that.’
“And I think when it did finally pass, it sent a message that we’d turned a corner here in Indiana and we intend to be a leader, not in the middle of the pack.”

They say recent state laws encouraging higher density development have led to more properties with multiple single family residences, or accessory dwelling units, squeezed onto them.
In some situations, the path to reach a front door is no more than 3 feet wide, too narrow to get a gurney through in a medical emergency and too little space to safely lean a ladder if there is a fire, they say.
Fire marshals are pressing the state Building Code Council to mandate a minimum 5-foot wide path to access any new home that does not face a street, alley or parking lot. 
“This poses a safety issue to firefighters, occupants and patients,” Dave Kokot, past president of the Washington State Association of Fire Marshals, told the council Friday.
Kokot filed a petition for an emergency rule change and hoped the Building Code Council would grant it in its Friday meeting. Instead, the panel opted to have one of its committees review the request. It will decide later whether to grant the request.
Some jurisdictions, like Vancouver, already have a 5-foot minimum standard.
The fire marshals’ proposal contains exceptions. For example, if a building has an approved automatic fire sprinkler system, a four-foot width would be allowed. If adopted, the new requirement would not be retroactive. Projects already submitted would not be subject to the change.
In Friday’s extensive debate, some council members questioned the degree to which this was an emergency. 
“It has not come into play in a lot of developments yet. We anticipate that it will,” Kokot said.
Others said they thought fire marshals already had the power to ensure adequate access into homes and buildings. Kokot said building officials can override fire officials but having a statewide requirement could make it harder.
Kokot said he realized this situation is an unintended consequence of the Legislature trying to come up with ways to address the housing shortage. “We are open to delaying implementation to a reasonable date to allow new projects to get through the process,” he said.
Patrick Hanks, codes and policy manager for the Building Industry Association of Washington, said the proposed change could be interpreted to require five feet of clearance around an entire accessory dwelling unit. That would choke off construction of ADUs because there would not be enough space to comply.
In an email, Hanks said detached accessory dwelling units, commonly called “mother-in-law” units, are often built within three feet of another structure, fence, or property line. This allows for increased density in areas that used to be zoned exclusively for single-family homes, he said.
“It’s one tool that helps improve housing affordability,” he said, adding BIAW will work on getting “more workable code language that will improve fire safety while reducing negative impacts to housing affordability, with a delayed implementation to give the industry time to adjust designs if they would be affected.”
Though the rule didn’t get adopted, Kokot said afterwards he’s glad they’re still talking about doing so.
“I am encouraged that the council, for the most part, acknowledges there is an issue,” he said. “I’d like to get the language done. I think we can.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/housing-construction.jpeg,,,2025-08-18 07:58:03.330138
,Mississippi Today,2025-08-18 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,‘Did it make me deserve what he did to me?’: How Mississippi denies domestic violence victims critical aid while letting their offenders off,Leonardo Bevilacqua,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/08/18/did-it-make-me-deserve-what-he-did-to-me-how-mississippi-denies-domestic-abuse-victims-critical-aid-while-letting-their-offenders-off/,Crime victim Cheryl Baier felt further victimized by a justice system that denied her critical aid while giving her abuser one of the lightest sentences possible for an attack that left her homeless and with failing sight,"FOREST – Cheryl Baier pushed her car key into the ignition when her boyfriend approached her passenger window in a Walmart parking lot in Forest. Bilbo Faulkner then pushed the passenger door open, sat down beside her and began to punch. 
Baier saw red and black. Blood dripped from where her vision grew blurry. She screamed but only choked. He pried the car keys from her grasp and strangled her with her seatbelt. She cried for help as he hit. She reached for the horn. No honk. She felt one of her eyes come loose after what seemed like 20 blows.
“I was hoping he’d just knock me out and put me out of my misery. So I didn’t feel it no more,” Baier remembers.
It was dark outside at 9 p.m. The car was parked yards from the main entrance underneath a lamp. She had agreed to meet her boyfriend in the lot because it was a public space. Few shoppers stopped to see his fist against her face or hear her cries, though. She saw a couple pull their child away before she lost vision in her right eye. That’s when she says Faulkner threatened to burn down her house before speeding off in his car. A witness eventually called the police, who instructed the fire department to rush to her home.
When she arrived at the hospital, she wasn’t sure if she was alive.
Victimized by crime, Baier later found herself victimized by a justice system that denied her critical aid because she had a more than decade-old drug conviction, even while the system gave her abuser one of the lightest sentences possible for an attack that left her temporarily homeless and with failing sight. Even though Mississippi has long boasted long sentences and high incarceration rates, domestic abuse cases still rarely rise to felony status – and offenders in those cases receive lighter sentences than other protected classes.

Unable to cover the over $12,000 in medical bills, Baier, a convenience store clerk, filed a claim for crime victims’ compensation through the attorney general’s office. The maximum payout to cover medical bills is $15,000. After her night stay at the hospital and 10 days of recovery, she was able to return to work. Paid $10 per hour at 45 hours a week, she knew it’d be several years before she could pay off her medical debt.
Weeks out from her surgery, she pulled a letter from the mailbox and squinted to make out the writing. The attorney general’s office denied her claim because of her felony drug conviction from 13 years ago. Victims, she learned, must be five years out from the last day of their probation to qualify for the program. Baier was weeks away.
“My pain is just the same. My loss is just the same,” Baier said in an interview with Mississippi Today. “What happened to me had nothing to do with what I did over a decade ago.”
While five other states deny victims’ compensation for prior felony convictions, Mississippi and Louisiana count all felonies, including victimless and nonviolent ones. Mississippi is also unique in counting probation, post-release supervision and court-ordered drug treatments, among other programs sponsored by the Department of Corrections, as part of their incarceration time.
Nearly a quarter of denied applications between 2021 and 2023 were based on prior felony convictions. The amount the AG’s office paid out to cover medical costs for assaulted crime victims decreased by half each year from 2021 to 2023, from a total of $1,424,475 in 2021 to $534,026 in 2023.

“The rules can unintentionally create barriers, and we must stay mindful of the fund’s original purpose,” said Stacey Riley, who provides shelter to 25 children and 30 adults through the Gulf Coast Center for Nonviolence in Biloxi. “Administrators should approach this work with an understanding of survivors’ trauma, their specific needs, and the often challenging environments in which they live.”
Some justice
In the months after her assault and the arson at her home, Baier lived out of a camper parked in her front yard. She wore a purse around her neck with a deer-skinning knife inside. Some nights she wet herself, too afraid to push open the RV door and use the restroom in her burnt home. She stayed up most nights with a pain in her mouth and eyes, unable to rest after working double shifts at the convenience store.

She lived for her day in court when restitution would be set and she could deliver her statement. She wrote out the facts on a piece of loose-leaf paper for the judge, jury and court officers to hear. She had June 2 marked on the calendar on her phone and in her kitchen. She called the district attorney’s office and the victim service coordinator each week, checking to make sure she had the date of the hearing correct.
She missed 15 days of work for court, many of them earlier trial dates that were bumped. She missed close to a month from surgery that eased her right eye back into its socket. In total, she estimates that she lost about $5,800 in wages.
When the hearing date arrived, Baier waited in a room in the courthouse with a printout of her victim impact statement. She was told to come back the next day when Faulkner would only plead. Restitution was set the next day, too. The victim service coordinator promised to let her know when she’d get a chance to tell her story in court and impress upon the judge the need for a substantial restitution payment. Baier waited for hours.
During the hearing, District Attorney Chris Posey remarked, “This does come with the approval of the victim in this case who I’ve spoken with many times and believe is actually in the courthouse today although not in the room at the moment.” But Baier said Posey never spoke to her about the plea deal.
The Victims’ Bill of Rights entitles victims to be present for all hearings before a judge. Baier wasn’t present to dispute the characterization of the attack she experienced. Posey attributed the attack to “some type of argument” between Faulkner and Baier.
Faulkner pleaded guilty to three years for aggravated domestic violence with time served for the 767 days spent in the Scott County jail for assaulting a jail guard. Restitution was set at $14,000 shy of the amount Baier asked for. She would get $2,000 at the end of the month – with the rest paid in $150 monthly installments once Faulkner’s court fines and fees were paid. The clerk then let her know she could leave.
Faulkner was also assigned an anger management course that he already took for a prior assault.
In an interview with Mississippi Today, Posey said that because the hearing took place in the courthouse while jury selection was happening for a separate trial, it would’ve been impossible for Baier to give her statement. The hearing was in the judge’s chambers, not the courtroom.
The victim service coordinator in the case refused a request for comment by Mississippi Today.
“What was said was further from the truth because that just makes it seem like he’s responding instead of the psychopathic behavior it truly was,” Baier said. “There was no foundation.”
Six percent of domestic violence cases were prosecuted as felony domestic aggravated assault in 2024, according to data from the Mississippi Administrative Office of Courts compiled by the Center for Violence Prevention.
“Too often, the gravity of domestic violence is misunderstood,” Riley said. “These are not simply individuals who ‘can’t get along’ with their partners — they are perpetrators of violence, many of whom will go on to commit even more serious crimes.”
On the street where she lives

Baier was pulling out of her driveway in Pulaski in Smith County when she saw a familiar face picking up a neighbor’s trash bin – and dumping the contents into the compactor. It was Faulkner. He was wearing the county jail striped orange pants. They locked eyes as she passed him on the gravel road by her house.
“There was no guard,” Baier said. “The way he beat me in the Walmart parking lot in front of God and everybody – you think he would hesitate in front of that trucker or another inmate?”
Mississippi Today was able to confirm that Faulkner, convicted of aggravated domestic violence along with two other prior violent felonies, was made a trusty at the Smith County jail — and was on work detail as a garbage collector on her street.
When Mississippi Today brought this to the Smith County Sheriff’s Department’s attention, the sheriff relayed that Faulkner was no longer in the program. He didn’t know Faulkner had been convicted, he was only going off the man’s criminal record in his county. 
Mississippi Department of Corrections policies prohibit inmates convicted of violent felonies, including aggravated domestic violence, from serving as trusties.
“Much of the problem comes down to communication,” said Riley, whose organization operates in 24 municipal justice courts in the lower six counties in Mississippi. “The issue isn’t that our justice system fails to act — it’s that it has long operated in silos. This entrenched way of functioning must change if we are to respond more effectively to interpersonal violence.”
In 2022, Attorney General Lynn Fitch established the Mississippi Domestic Violence Registry, which gives law enforcement access to information helpful for keeping law enforcement, victims and bystanders safe when answering domestic violence calls. It has been “a little slow” to get cooperation from agencies, said Michelle Williams, a spokesperson for the attorney general’s office, as officers have a lot of competing paperwork requirements. In an attempt to reduce this, Fitch’s office incorporated the registry into existing law enforcement reporting platforms.
Luke Thompson, former Byram police chief, said it was hard to convince his deputies to investigate domestic violence cases. He advocated for the attorney general’s office’s registry to be incorporated into the National Incident Based Reporting System, administered by the FBI.
Domestic violence cases require dual reporting and more paperwork than other cases. Officers are expected to determine a primary aggressor, which requires more discretion. Since 1992, just over a third of shootings of officers happened during domestic violence calls, Thompson found in his agency’s data.
Since retiring as chief, Thompson has been helping Mississippi agencies implement the Lethality Assessment Program, a questionnaire that helps law enforcement identify victims and serial abusers in their communities. The program helped his department connect victims with services faster and provide prosecutors with a more thorough history of abuse.
“It’s one of the hardest types of cases to sort through,” Thompson said. “Cops focus on ‘bad guys.’ We’re empathetic to victims. But sometimes we don’t always take that extra step to get a victim’s help.”
‘There was nothing in his eyes’
While the father of Baier’s children was incarcerated, he had sent Faulkner to be her protector. She felt taken care of by Faulkner, with his wide back and a muscular frame. She remembers the first day he arrived at the convenience store where she worked. She was drawn to the kindness he showed to another single mother. He provided money to her when she fell behind on car payments.
They were friends before they began dating. She enjoyed going on evening drives listening to “Good Ol’ Girl” by Frank Foster around Smith County when they were both off work. She knew he had been to prison, was first put off by his many tattoos, but was taken by his “big heart.”
For one month, he had been living with Baier, who was surprised when he announced he would be moving out. He had recently begun accusing her of cheating, which she thought was a joke. A relative of Faulkner’s attributes his behavior to untreated bipolar disorder. Baier said that he had been drinking alcohol. 
Before that day at Walmart, when he assaulted her, Baier had never seen his violent side. He asked to meet up while she was still working at the convenience store that night. She chose a public space because “there was nothing in his eyes.” He just looked different, she said.

“It was premeditated,” Baier said, clutching a charred family photo in her Smith County home. “That’s part of what’s gotten me all this time.”
Although she was able to clean her house, the smell of smoke persists. The fire damaged a photograph of four generations of her family. It was the last picture she had with her grandfather before he died from cancer.
Baier is well known in her community. She meets most locals as a clerk at a popular store in Forest where checks are cashed. She knows the farmhands who buy equipment and the waitresses at the local restaurants. Young and old, from out of town and native, they all chat with her at the store.
Lately, she’s been acting as her own investigator. She collected a list of witnesses from her assault as well as to the arson to hand to authorities. She helped the boss at her place of work transfer security footage onto a flash drive to capture the moment Faulkner entered the convenience store earlier in the night of her assault when he allegedly bought alcohol. The arson at her home has not gone to trial. No witnesses have been interviewed.
Her first eye surgery wasn’t considered a success because the muscles and tissues were damaged, pushing her right eye forward and causing pressure and migraines.
In a handwritten letter to the crime victim compensation director, Baier wrote, “After the fire, all I had was the torn, blood stained clothes on my back. My home was not habitable for four months. I’m telling you all this so you can understand the great financial strain, not to mention the physical and emotional damage that I will probably always suffer.”
Over half of completed victim compensation claims were denied in Scott County between 2021 and 2023, according to records obtained by Mississippi Today. Thirteen were denied and 11 were approved with an award. 
“When I got your denial and read the explanation, I felt abused and victimized all over again in a different way but just as damaging. Does a mistake from 13 years ago make me any less of a victim? Does it make what happened to me any less painful? Did it make me deserve what he did to me?”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/06081232/Shirley-Baier-1.jpg,,,2025-08-18 07:58:03.330138

Paul Sarlo, a Democrat who chairs the Senate’s budget panel. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)The $700 million-plus in projects state lawmakers added to this year’s budget favored competitive districts and those represented by Democrats, according to a New Jersey Monitor analysis of budget documents recently made public.
A review of the nearly 600 budget resolutions approved as part of this year’s $58.8 billion annual spending bill found that municipal and school district aid approved outside of the state’s formulaic awards and competitive grants flowed almost exclusively to areas represented by Democrats. The budget cleared the Legislature on June 30, but the resolutions were not made public until Aug. 8.
In New Jersey, lawmakers and officials with the other branches of government can seek changes to the budget the governor proposes in February by submitting requests for funding or language changes through budget resolutions.
Because funding introduced as a result of budget resolutions often skirts the public dialogue that surrounds New Jersey’s annual spending bill, they are sometimes derisively called “pork” or “Christmas tree items,” though some legislators view them differently.

“I look at budget resolutions through two very distinct lenses: One is what can be the most impactful things in partnership with my local leaders for their towns, and secondarily from a broader statewide perspective, things that fit not only the legislative agenda that we try to push, which is affordability and accessibility of state services,” said Sen. Troy Singleton (D-Burlington), the chamber’s Democratic caucus chair.
Legislators who secure budget resolutions that send money to their districts don’t hide that fact — they announce it.
Senate Democrats in recent days have boosted resolutions sponsored by Singleton and others that provided $8 million for Rowan University for what would be the state’s first veterinary school and $200,000 for lighting upgrades at Cinnaminson’s municipal complex. 
“We were having children and seniors coming out of that building into dark parking lots and dark avenues. We have a ballot box that sits right there,” said Singleton. “What we tried to do is listen and then be responsive to those we work for, and the local community said this is something that matters to them.”
Promoting state funding for local projects becomes especially important during election years. This November, Democrats are hoping to retain control of the governor’s seat and the Assembly.
Though budget resolutions that send money to specific projects, municipalities, or school districts often face criticism, they are seldom the largest tranches of spending approved this way.
This year, the largest items dealt with university funding or state revenue. Those included a $76 million resolution to boost financing of a fund that supports some costs related to NJ FamilyCare, the state’s Medicaid program, and $70 million to reverse a cut to aid for universities that graduate low-income students.
Either one of those appropriations alone exceeds the roughly $62.1 million sent directly to school districts as a result of budget resolutions.
 Most funding went to Democrats

Democratic legislative districts had a near monopoly on money disbursed to towns and school districts as a result of budget resolutions.
Legislative districts represented by Republicans received additional school funding via budget resolutions in only two cases, and in both, the investments touched on areas represented by Democrats.
West Essex Regional School District, which serves students from Essex Fells, Fairfield, North Caldwell, and Roseland, received $150,000 through a resolution sponsored by Sen. Vin Gopal (D-Monmouth) and other Democrats. The regional school district’s towns span the Republican-held 40th District and the Democrat-dominated 27th District.
The Lenape Regional School District received $1 million for capital improvements. Its towns fall fully within the 8th Legislative District, which is represented by Sen. Latham Tiver (R-Burlington), Assemblyman Michael Torrissi (R-Burlington), and Assemblywoman Andrea Katz (D-Burlington). The 8th is one of only two New Jersey legislative districts with split partisan representation.
Budget resolution funding to municipalities showed a similar dynamic. Towns in legislative districts with Republican representation received direct funds through budget resolutions in only three instances, including one covering the 30th District in Monmouth and Ocean counties, the other New Jersey legislative district with split partisan representation.
Together, those line items amounted to roughly $2.3 million. In total, nearly $83 million for municipalities was approved through the budget resolution process.
The New Jersey Monitor’s review singled out budget resolutions that sent money directly to school districts or municipalities. The tallies do not include money that went to counties or private institutions within a given legislative district that may have reduced some municipal costs for certain projects.
The New Jersey Monitor identified only one instance among the 585 budget resolutions approved this year where the first prime sponsor was a Republican.
Sen. Bob Singer’s (R-Ocean) resolution awarded $1 million for a Lakewood food and clothing assistance charity to purchase a warehouse (Singer’s district is also represented by a Democrat, Assemblyman Avi Schnall). GOP members appeared as co-sponsors on five other resolutions.
The imbalance is unsurprising. Democrats control both legislative chambers and the governorship, limiting Republicans’ influence in budget negotiations. To some degree, it is intentional, even on the side of GOP members.
 Sen. Declan O’Scanlon (Hal Brown for New Jersey Monitor)
Sen. Declan O’Scanlon (R-Monmouth), the chamber’s GOP budget officer, said he encouraged his members to avoid seeking budget resolution funding.
“The message to all our members was we need to not be part of the problem here,” he said, adding, “If everybody’s job in the Legislature is to bring home the bacon, the pig dies pretty quickly.”
Nor is the imbalance necessarily new. A more cursory review of budget resolutions approved for the 2023 fiscal year that did not measure appropriation levels revealed just three measures where a Republican was a prime sponsor. A review of resolutions from fiscal year 2018 found a single budget resolution with a GOP co-sponsor and none with Republican prime sponsors.
“They’ve been trying to say it’s always been like this. That’s bullsh*t. It has not always been like this. This is so blatant,” said O’Scanlon.
 Competitive districts

Competitive legislative districts were likely to benefit from budget resolution funding, though other districts received greater amounts of funding as a result of legislators’ requests.
The 28th and 29th Districts — which include portions of Newark and are considered safely Democratic — received a combined $24.7 million in school aid, chiefly due to a resolution that awarded Newark public schools $21 million for capital expenses.
The 36th District was the only one to see at least half as much budget resolution school funding.
The district, which is represented by Sen. Paul Sarlo (D-Bergen), the Senate’s budget chair, received roughly $17 million in school and municipal aid as a result of budget resolutions. More than half of that money was for school capital improvements in Wood-Ridge ($9.5 million), where Sarlo is mayor.
A similar dynamic played out in the 38th District, which got $9.5 million as a result of budget resolutions.
Though Democrats are perennially concerned about a Republican upset in the 38th District — a Bergen County district that includes towns like Paramus and Lodi — the 36th has generally not been considered competitive. There’s some reason to think that could change this year: President Donald Trump carried both districts in last year’s presidential race.
“If a legislator is threatened, if their district is more at risk, they get greater consideration,” said Marc Pfeiffer, a senior policy fellow at Rutgers University’s Center for Urban Research who has long experience in state and local government.
Pfeiffer added that other factors, like a legislator’s relationships with caucus leaders or an ability to fundraise, also play a role in how budget resolution funding could be spread.
“It’s that combination of factors that us mere mortals are not necessarily privy to or, in some cases, capable of understanding,” he said.

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Troubled venture capital company Elevate Ventures has been deemed “in breach of” lending language in all of its active loan agreements with the Indiana Economic Development Corp. after defaulting on an angel investment program this month.
David Watkins, IEDC’s senior vice president of entrepreneurship and small business, gave the firm 30 days to cure the breaches before it nears default on those agreements.
In a Wednesday letter, he asked Elevate Ventures to provide a detailed financial plan and schedule, also within 30 days, to “demonstrate how it will be able to fulfill all of its outstanding obligations” — and why the IEDC shouldn’t make all outstanding loans due immediately.
The agency has “unreconciled, ongoing concern” that the company, “in its current state, will be unable to fulfill any of its current or future obligations,” Watkins wrote.
Elevate Ventures did not reply to multiple requests for comments.
The firm operates the Indiana Angel Network Fund, intended to entice and aid angel investments to Hoosier startups. It nabbed the contract with IEDC on Aug. 2, 2011, with repayment due exactly 14 years later.
IEDC sent a request for repayment of nearly $17.2 million the day before. Elevate Ventures repaid about $12.9 million on Aug. 4 — falling more than $4.3 million short.
That prompted another letter, this time a notice of payment default that requested full payment within five business days. The Aug. 5 document warned that the unpaid principal balance would rack up interest at 8%, or about $956 daily.
Elevate Ventures failed to pay in full by Aug. 12, constituting an “event of default” under the contract. Watkins’ letter, sent the next day, noted more than $7,000 in interest had accumulated.
The company offered to repay with a new loan from the returns of the Indiana 21st Century Research and Technology Fund, according to Watkins.
“However, this proposal appears to merely utilize assets designated to pay back other future obligations to pay back the Loan, which would only impair the ability to repay those other obligations,” he wrote in the letter.
IEDC also froze all accounts related to Elevate Ventures. Monthly payments on a separate professional services agreement during the “period of open collaboration” and  specific investments that were allocated capital at an IEDC board meeting in June are explicitly approved, however.
The company’s repayment struggle comes about three months after it was dubbed an “entity of interest” — alongside IEDC and its nonprofit arm — in a forensic investigation of potential financial wrongdoing.
The contract with FTI Consulting began May 13 and lasts one year. It’s worth up to $800,000 and will be paid for by IEDC funds, according to Commerce Secretary David Adams.
Gov. Mike Braun promised an audit just days after Indiana Legislative Insight reported allegations of self-dealing, unreported side gigs and more among IEDC and its partners.

(Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)For years, Idaho state lawmakers have worried the federal government might cut Medicaid funds.
That’s partly why the Legislature didn’t expand Medicaid to more low-income earners. In 2018, voters approved that policy through a ballot initiative.
Now, as many states brace for federal cuts and policy changes to Medicaid under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed by Republicans in Congress and signed by President Donald Trump, Idaho is well-positioned to handle the changes, said Idaho Sen. Julie VanOrden, who chairs the state Senate’s Health and Welfare Committee.

The Pingree Republican pointed to a range of Idaho’s systems that other states are looking to set up, like a panel of state lawmakers to oversee contracts and an emergency fund to deal with higher-than-expected costs.
“A lot of it came from the rising cost of Medicaid. So I think we have that in common with what the federal government is looking at,” she told the Idaho Capital Sun in an interview. 
But the new law passed by Congress gets in the way of Idaho’s plan to tap into one tool to pay providers more for Medicaid services, by capping state-set payment rates.

 Medicaid pays a portion of what health care services cost. Mega bill caps payments to providers. 

Medicaid, which insures around one-fifth of Americans, often pays much lower than what it costs health care providers to give out services. 
That’s why in April 2024, the federal agency that regulates Medicaid allowed states to require private companies that manage Medicaid benefits to pay providers rates for services as high as commercial insurance plans pay. 
In the future, Idaho plans to use that structure, called state-directed payments, as part of a new large Medicaid cost-cutting bill approved by the state Legislature this spring that will shift all Idaho Medicaid benefits to being run by private companies. That model, called managed care, is used widely across the country. 
Idaho Medicaid to be privately managed in 2029, health officials expect

The bill didn’t spell out how high Idaho’s state-directed payments would be. But VanOrden said lawmakers were “banking on” getting the average commercial state-directed payment rates.
“Certainly, it’s a disappointment that we won’t be able to apply for those waivers anymore to get that average commercial rate, which we were banking on,” she said.
But she doesn’t think losing that higher rate will affect Idaho’s funding plans as part of the shift to managed care.
The new federal law caps Medicaid state-directed payments at as high as rates for Medicare, which reimburses more but still not as much as providers say the true treatment costs are. 
The mega law’s new cap on state-directed payments won’t affect the status quo in Idaho, Idaho Medicaid Deputy Administrator Sasha O’Connell told a state legislative panel last month. It could limit Idaho’s ability to raise that in the future, she added. 
But the status quo in Idaho — which has the worst doctor shortage in the nation — isn’t really ideal, Idaho Hospital Association CEO Brian Whitlock told the Idaho Capital Sun.
“Status quo is we’re still 50th in the nation in physicians per capita. Status quo means we’re still having a workforce shortage throughout the health care system,” he said. “Status quo still means that more than half of our rural hospitals have less than a 1% operating margin, which is razor thin. Status quo means some of our hospitals are well below the standard of days cash on hand to operate. Status quo means you’re going to wait months to get in to see a specialist.”

States with state-directed payment rates higher than the new cap will have to ratchet down over time. That means Idaho’s new ceiling for state-directed payments will be every other state’s floor, Whitlock said.
“It may take some states 10 years to ratchet down and get to the Idaho level of 100% of Medicare,” he said. “And in the meantime, every other state that is participating in state directed payment programs has a distinct competitive advantage over Idaho, including our neighboring states.”
 Idaho was already working toward Medicaid work requirements, more eligibility checks

But some other new Medicaid changes that are part of the new mega law might not affect Idaho as much.
The new federal law calls for Medicaid work requirements and twice-a-year eligibility checks. The Idaho Legislature already passed a law this year to ask the federal government for permission to do that.
And Idaho’s status quo won’t be affected by new federal limits on taxes on health care providers, which states use to access more federal funds, state health officials say. That’s because Idaho’s taxes on providers like hospitals and nursing homes are below the new caps, O’Connell said. 
How Congress’s megabill will impact Idaho: Cuts to taxes, Medicaid, SNAP and more

Idaho is also looking to tap into a new $50 billion, five-year rural health fund established through the new federal law. 
In a column published last month in the Times-News, Idaho’s U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo — a Republican who pushed for several aspects of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — said Idaho wouldn’t be affected by the new Medicaid reforms on provider taxes and state-directed payments.
“Instead, Idaho’s rural hospitals will benefit from a new Rural Health Transformation Program that allocates money to all states, not just those using gimmicks to draw down more federal money,” Crapo wrote.
For five years, Idaho could receive $100 million each year from the fund, he said.
“This is arguably the single largest investment in rural health care in more than 20 years,” Crapo wrote in the column for the Twin Falls newspaper. “While it provides a way for states that do rely disproportionately on federal funding to make a financial plan, states like Idaho can provide immediate relief to rural hospitals and establish the tools necessary to be successful in the future.”
Over the next decade, the bill is expected to cut federal funds for Idaho Medicaid by $4.3 billion and reduce Idaho Medicaid’s enrollment by as much as 40,000 people, estimates in early June from the group Manatt show. The analysis assumes work requirements will cut Medicaid enrollment and costs.

President Donald Trump’s administration has ordered some retiring coal plants to stay online, even as they have struggled to remain economically viable. (Photo by Liam Niemeyer/Kentucky Lantern) Mandates from President Donald Trump’s administration to retain aging coal plants could cause a massive spike in energy costs, according to an independent analysis commissioned by several environmental groups.
Orders from the U.S. Department of Energy to save coal plants from retirement could cost ratepayers more than $3 billion per year, according to a report from Grid Strategies, a power sector consulting firm. It was carried out on behalf of Earthjustice, Environmental Defense Fund, Natural Resources Defense Council and Sierra Club.
Under Trump, the agency has issued emergency orders to maintain operations at coal plants that were scheduled for retirement. While federal officials say the coal plants need to stay online to avoid blackouts, power plant owners and state regulators planned their closures because they were no longer economically viable or needed for reliability.
“DOE mandates override those well-informed decisions, inflating electric bills for homeowners and businesses and undermining the competitiveness of U.S. factories and data centers,” the Grid Strategies analysis found.
Across the country, coal plants have phased out as they’ve struggled to compete with cheaper renewables and natural gas. A 2023 analysis by Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan think tank, found that 99% of existing U.S. coal plants “are more expensive to run than replacement by local wind, solar, and energy storage resources.”
But Trump, who has pushed to unleash more fossil fuel development and to stymie wind and solar, has ordered a retiring coal plant in Michigan to stay online, along with an oil and gas plant in Pennsylvania.
“Based on the trend to date and indications that DOE has approached the owners of many retiring fossil power plants about potentially mandating their retention, DOE may attempt to mandate the retention of nearly all large fossil power plants slated for retirement between now and the end of 2028,” reads the Grid Strategies report.
The cost of keeping those plants online would be immense. By 2028, if Trump were to mandate the retention of all fossil fuel plants slated for retirement, the annual cost to ratepayers would be more than $3.1 billion, the analysis found.
The report also considers a number of aging plants that are not yet scheduled for retirement. It finds Trump’s actions could create a “perverse incentive,” causing plant owners to claim they’re planning to shut down, inducing the feds to step in and keep them open, with the cost borne by ratepayers.
Accounting for that possibility, the report found that ratepayer costs could reach $5.9 billion per year to keep the entire aging fossil fuel fleet online. California, Texas and Colorado would see the highest increases in electricity bills.

As lawmakers mull penalizing libraries that allow children to access inappropriate books, opponents have quoted the Bible and lawmakers have read lists of sex acts.
The post Debate over sexual material in Wyoming libraries is heating up… and getting awkward appeared first on WyoFile .","Rev. Dan Odell wore his clerical collar to address lawmakers on the Joint Judiciary Committee on Tuesday evening in Casper.
The Methodist pastor wanted the committee to know that if a bill to ban books containing sexually-explicit material from the children’s sections of Wyoming libraries passed as currently written, it could block minors from one book many lawmakers might say is their favorite: the Bible. 
To illustrate his point, Odell read aloud some of the religious text’s more graphic passages, like this one from the Book of Ezekiel: 
“She lusted after her lovers, whose genitals were like those of donkeys and whose emission was like that of horses,” Odell read. 
That passage was one of five containing what Odell called “frank descriptions of sexual acts,” that he read or cited for the committee. The reverend had more examples, he told lawmakers, than his allotted time for public comment on the bill would permit.
A notable swathe of Wyoming legislators have joined a nationwide movement of social conservatives who say sexually explicit content, mostly in books written for young LGBTQ+ readers, is corrupting children. They hope to keep minors from seeking out, or stumbling upon, sexual material in Wyoming libraries. As the packed committee room in Casper suggested, their opposition, largely led by the state’s educators and librarians, is growing larger and more organized.

And as demonstrated by Odell’s testimony, the debate is injecting an unusually carnal note into Wyoming politics. 
That includes the language of the bill draft itself, which requires public and school library employees to make sure sexually explicit materials aren’t available to minors, or face severe penalties. Like other conservative social issue measures the Wyoming Legislature has passed recently, the bill would let citizens sue institutions they catch violating the new rules. 
The draft contains a six-point definition of sexual acts that cannot be depicted in literature available to a minor. The definitions include graphic descriptions like “ejaculation onto the person of another” or “contact between the mouth and genitalia or mouth and anus,” that are a far cry from the often staid and technical language of statute. 
“Sorry if I get flush,” an embarrassed Rep. Jayme Lien said at the committee’s May meeting in Torrington, as the Casper Republican read the bill language, which mirrors statute passed in Iowa, to her colleagues. 
Staff attorneys from the Legislative Service Office have suggested that lawmakers could instead rely on a definition of “obscene materials” that already exists in Wyoming statute. That language describes obscene material as something the average person would find prurient or offensive — without getting into the detailed definitions proposed by Lien. But the existing language also notes that, to be considered legally obscene, the material in question, “taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.”
That definition borrows from a pivotal U.S. Supreme Court decision, Miller v. California. In that decision, the justices found that for material to be considered obscene under the law it had to lack those other societal values. Rep. Anne Lucas, the Cheyenne Republican who has been a vocal proponent of the legislation to ban books, says the Miller test was written for adults, not children. 
“The Supreme Court, when they heard that case, it never occurred to them, I suspect, that we would be talking about this in reference to children and obscene materials,” she told lawmakers in Casper on Tuesday, as she argued against using the language suggested by legislative staff. The high court heard Miller v. California in 1973. 
The bill’s opponents argue lawmakers are flirting with unconstitutional suppression of free speech in their quest to legislate what books are available where. 
Though Odell, the pastor, didn’t name the Miller case, he echoed the justices’ notion that sexual imagery or language can be embedded in texts with deeper meaning. 
“I mention these not for the sake of sensationalism,” the clergyman said of the graphic biblical passages he read lawmakers, “but because they’re a part of larger passages that reflect spiritual and moral truths.”
Rep. Marlene Brady, a Green River Republican who’s been outspoken on her belief that sexually explicit content endangers minors, took issue with Odell’s quoting of scripture. 
“The Bible is a book of history,” she said, “and some of those passages you’re referring to in my understanding of the Bible is the creator’s message to the beauty of the relationship, of a marriage, between a man and a woman… so to use it as support for what I would consider immoral material, I just take offense to that.”

Lawmakers did not act on the legislation in Casper. After hearing two hours of public testimony, nearly all of which was in opposition to the bill, lawmakers postponed a vote on whether to sponsor it as a committee bill until an October meeting in Cheyenne. 
Opponents of the legislation include advocates for LGBTQ+ Wyomingites. They accuse lawmakers of taking aim specifically at books that help gay youth understand their sexuality, in a state that isn’t always welcoming to them. Some of the definitions of sexually explicit material appear to originate from passages of a book called “Gender Queer,” which has generated outrage among conservatives nationwide.
“Wyoming already has obscenity laws that protect us from material with no redeeming value,” Marylee White, a Teton County library board member, told lawmakers. “This proposal goes further, allowing one group’s personal beliefs about morality to dictate what all families can access.”
The meeting drew a packed room of librarians, educators and other opponents who said the measure would stifle free expression and erode the role of the state’s libraries as places Wyomingites, including young people, can go to explore. 
“It ruins what the library is,” Lindsey Travis, president of the Wyoming Library Association and head librarian in Sweetwater County, told the committee. Despite the graphic definitions, librarians remain concerned that the general ban on “sexually explicit” materials was so broad that it would be nearly impossible for them to police all the books available to teens and children. 
Opponents asked legislators to respect library professionals’ processes for selecting books, and the existing avenues people can take to request a text’s removal. Those structures allowed local communities, not distant politicians, to shape their library collections, Travis said. 
But many legislators believe it’s within their purview to regulate library books. Sheridan Republican Rep. Laurie Bratten cited a section of the Wyoming Constitution that deals with protecting Wyomingite’s morality. 
“As the health and the morality of the people are essential to their well-being, and to the peace and permanence of the state, it shall be the duty of the legislature to protect and promote these vital interests,” reads the section of constitution Bratten quoted.
Travis offered to pair librarians with lawmakers in a working group to see if the two parties could reach a better compromise than the current legislation, which exposes libraries and schools caught violating the new rules to a $50,000 fine for each offense. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Jared Olsen, R-Cheyenne, told Travis the committee would not pursue the working group, she told WyoFile on Wednesday. 
The committee will also not hear further public testimony in Cheyenne, Olsen said at the Casper meeting. 
Lawmakers’ email inboxes, however, may not be so spared. Committee members received hundreds of emails asking them to vote down the bill ahead of the Casper meeting, lawmakers said. More than 850 people answered a call from the political organizing group Better Wyoming to write and oppose the legislation, executive director Nate Martin told WyoFile. 
“Those aren’t just librarians,” Martin said. “Those are parents, those are people who care about their libraries and those are people who are tired of watching the Freedom Caucus advance their extremist religious agenda.” 
A majority in the state House of Representatives aligns with the Wyoming Freedom Caucus, whose members have pushed for regulating library books both at the statehouse and at the local government level. The Freedom Caucus notched up legislative wins last year after taking control of the House, but Martin predicted the group will see increased opposition on this particular issue. 
The response to the group’s call to write lawmakers opposing the legislation was “overwhelming and frankly larger than that on most issues we deal with,” said Martin, who also serves on Laramie’s school board.

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)Our colleges and universities are supposed to be embracing policies and programs that provide skills and experiences that set their students up for success in the professional workplace.
That’s why it’s so puzzling that Oklahoma’s third largest public university has decided the best way to position their journalism and communication students for success is by eliminating the print edition of its student-run newspaper, The Vista.
Administrators at the University of Central Oklahoma insist that abruptly ending printing a publication with a 122-year history is necessary because it will save the university $12,000 a year.
Student outcomes be darned.
To be clear, $12,000 equates to a few pennies at an institution that had an annual budget topping $170 million. This university’s governing body in 2023 also agreed to hire and pay President Todd Lamb, a former lieutenant governor, a guaranteed annual salary of $325,000 plus other benefits.
So this seemingly random pennypinching makes me wonder if this university is truly vested in setting its students up for success or if this amounts to someone at the highest levels attempting to censor the press. 
It’s also odd that the administration seemingly waited until just before the start of the school year to disclose it is essentially canceling The Vista when it’s probably too late for students to transfer to other universities that can better support their goals. (Keep reading for the digital media part of the news equation.)
The dean of UCO’s liberal arts college evidently believes the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education and the Regional University System of Oklahoma, which both govern the school, have issued a “mandate” to be more efficient with resources. Leaders believe this is a good program to chop.
Late last week, a UCO student media governing board indicated it was under pressure, and that funding for other student-produced media would be withheld until they submitted a budget that didn’t include printing The Vista.
Our state regents, meanwhile, have been touting their blueprint for success, which they identify as a “bold strategic plan” that “emphasizes the key role Oklahoma’s public colleges and universities play in producing the state’s workforce.”
You know what my industry needs? College newspapers. 
But apparently higher education leaders don’t care about that.
Is this governing board actually envisioning an environment where we end hands-on learning and programs that give students real-world experiences that set them up for employment opportunities and internships?
If so, the public deserves to know that.
As someone who makes hiring decisions, I’m looking for employees that have training and experience. And I need higher education leaders who understand what my industry’s needs are.
In the journalism and communication fields, the building blocks for most future employees typically begin at the college paper.
For decades, student newspapers have served a tri-purpose. 
They give students the opportunity to try their hand at writing, editing and laying out the paper. It also doubles as a way to teach those who want to work in marketing, public relations or film how to write a usable press release, design and sell ads or make a pitch.
College newspapers also serve as a training ground for students who hope to land a professional internship or full-time job in the communications industry, and they signal to employers that schools are producing graduates that have some experience at that, which makes them marketable.
And, finally college newspapers inform their campuses about news that impacts them. Universities are their own miniature ecosystems, complete with housing, food services and education. It’s often the student journalists living or going to school who first hold their university leaders to account. UCO served over 12,000 students last year and is located in a community, Edmond, that no longer has a local daily news source.
Their media outlet is the one who revealed Lamb’s ridiculously large salary that I quoted.
Earlier this year, a UCO official reached out to me to ask if I supported a proposal to stop printing The Vista.
I told the university that I believed it should have at least one print edition a week to give students the experience of laying out papers, designing advertisements, writing punchy headlines that fit in small spaces and meeting deadlines.
While it’s true that more people are consuming their news online, print newspapers are still alive and kicking in communities across Oklahoma. Every community deserves to have talented journalists. And every paper is a business that has subscribers and people who rely on them to receive their news.
Last time I was on UCO’s campus, I picked up a copy of The Vista and looked through the articles to see if there might be someone who would be a good fit for our summer internship.
I was on campus because our newsroom is partnering with a UCO reporting class to give participants – many of whom are first-generation college students – an opportunity to have a story professionally published online and in print. That can give them a leg up in the hiring process after they graduate.
Imagine how disheartening it is to find out UCO’s administration doesn’t see the same potential.
I’ve also worked with papers in this state, which have struggled to find people to work at their publications with the basic skillsets, which includes the ability to lay out a print edition. I myself have had difficulty finding college students who have state government reporting experience.
That should be a clear SOS to leaders of our universities that there’s a disconnect and that scrimping isn’t working.
I did tell UCO that it needed to invest in and beef up The Vista’s website because it’s not very user friendly.
Either way, UCO has reached a point where it either needs to put up or shut up. If a college doesn’t want to invest in the tools needed to make this degree successful, they need to end it and stop accepting tens of thousands in tuition money from those students.
Because students need to know their degree will lead to opportunities, and they trust colleges and universities to have policies in place to help them achieve their goals. Employers desperately need an educated workforce that meets their needs.
We can’t cut our way to greatness. 
It’s unfortunate that UCO has resorted to prioritizing pennies over its students.

A committee voted to sponsor three failed bills from the 2025 session that would continue the overhaul of Wyoming’s elections system. 
The post As Wyoming lawmakers rehash election reforms, two familiar camps remain divided appeared first on WyoFile .","As they have before, lawmakers gathered Friday to debate a bevy of bills aimed at redesigning the state’s elections. And like before, hours of testimony before the Wyoming Legislature’s Joint Corporations, Elections and Political Subdivisions Committee appeared to do little to change anyone’s mind. 
Those who have aligned themselves with Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray and his election-reform agenda were steadfast, while those who have been skeptical of the years-long pursuit to revamp the state’s elections remained skeptical. 
Lawmakers filed 45 election-related bills in the 2025 general election — accounting for about 8% of all legislation in both the House and the Senate. A fraction became law. 
In May, the committee voted to reanimate 10 of the bills after Gray asked lawmakers to consider roughly 20 bills from the last session. Then an 11th election-related bill was added to Friday’s agenda. 
“It’s probably the thing that Wyoming gets right more than anything in the whole country, is our elections. And we have for a long time, and we keep messing with it,” committee co-chairman Sen. Cale Case, R-Lander, said at the meeting in Casper. 
Ultimately, a majority of the committee saw things differently from Case, voting to sponsor three pieces of legislation and draft a new version of a fourth to be discussed at a November meeting. 
As for the seven other bills revived in May, the committee voted to make the final decision on their fate at the November meeting. Lingle Republican Sen. Cheri Steinmetz offered that suggestion as the meeting ran long. 
“I really think these are important bills, and we have a lot of public testimony on some of these, and then we’ll also have to work them,” she said. 
One of the bills to earn the committee’s sponsorship would require counties to use pen and paper as the default method to mark ballots for elections in Wyoming. For 22 of the state’s 23 counties, the bill would have little effect.
In Laramie County, where touch-screen voting machines have long been used, the change could “completely upend” elections, according Debra Lee, the local county clerk. 
The committee also voted to sponsor a bill banning ballot drop boxes and to move a bill to the next meeting to ban ballot harvesting. Gray has had his sights on the two prohibitions since running for secretary of state in 2022. 
Lastly, lawmakers voted to adopt a bill to clean up language related to Wyoming’s new voter registration law requiring proof of state residency and U.S. citizenship during voter registration. A federal court recently tossed a lawsuit challenging the new requirements as unconstitutionally vague and imposing an undue burden on the right to vote. 
The committee’s next meeting is Nov. 3 in Cheyenne.

(Photo by Kevin Hardy/Stateline)BOSTON — During this year’s budget cycle, Oklahoma state Sen. John Haste said lawmakers had two major things on their minds.
“Number one was tax cuts. Number two, what the hell is going on in Washington?” he told a national gathering of state lawmakers last week in Boston.
While Oklahoma lawmakers secured another round of income tax cuts, they are still wrapping their heads around the fiscal impacts of President Donald Trump’s massive spending and tax law, Haste said. The measure slashes funding for health care and food assistance.
That legislation, and other Trump actions, proved a central theme of discussion during the National Conference of State Legislatures summit, which organizers said was the largest ever gathering of state lawmakers with more than 1,600 in attendance. Aside from cutting funding, the law imposes costly new administrative burdens on states.
States are still sorting through the long-term impacts of the legislation — and what, if any, actions they can take to soften the blow.
Haste, a Republican, said concern is highest in rural areas, where reduced Medicaid funding could threaten hospitals. He said that just one provision of the law will cut $209 million in funds that help Oklahoma cover the cost of Medicaid, and that the state will need to spend an estimated $30 million on the new cost of checking eligibility twice per year.
“All of those things added together come up to a really big number,” he said, but added: “We don’t know exactly what that is.”
Lawmakers from liberal and conservative states said they are still grappling with the implications of Trump’s signature legislation. With most states boasting solid fiscal positions, some expect to cover new up-front administrative costs by tapping into strong reserve funds. But many are considering reducing services.
Nevada state Sen. Fabian Doñate, a Democrat, said state leaders will have to cut Medicaid eligibility or services since Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo has said he will oppose any efforts to raise taxes.
“That becomes a challenge, right?” Doñate said during a panel discussion on Medicaid. “Do you cut the pregnant mom or the person that makes above 180% of the federal poverty level who’s under 50, or do you cut diapers for seniors?”
At the same time, states must gear up for new bureaucratic mandates from Washington.
“Regardless of how you feel about these provisions — whether these are opportunities or challenges, fantastic or awful — regardless, it’s going to be a heavy lift for states,” said Lauren Kallins, NCSL’s senior legislative director for state-federal affairs.
She said states and organizations, including NCSL, are still awaiting detailed federal guidance on all the changes, which are spread out over several years. But states will need to react quickly.
One provision in the law requires the 40 states plus Washington, D.C., that have expanded Medicaid to check paperwork at least twice a year to ensure those enrollees are meeting new work requirements. The legislation provided states $200 million, but experts question whether it will be enough to help states implement the changes by the end of 2026.
To meet that deadline, states will need to increase outreach to Medicaid recipients and make new investments in technology, Kallins said. Similarly, states must cover new administrative costs for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, commonly called food stamps.
Traditionally, the federal government has fully funded SNAP benefits and split administrative costs of the program with states. The new law requires states to fund 75% of administrative costs and requires some states, depending on the accuracy of their eligibility determination, to fund a portion of benefits.
“So that’s another very significant increase for states,” Kallins said.
 States in a ‘very, very strong position’

Though revenue growth is slowing, lawmakers and experts pointed out that many states currently enjoy strong budget fundamentals.
That’s true in Utah, which touts deep reserve funding and a rapidly growing economy.
Jonathan Ball, Utah’s legislative fiscal analyst, told conference attendees that the state could rely on some of its reserve for one-time administrative and technical costs associated with the federal legislation.
He said lawmakers and budget writers always have to find creative ways to solve their state’s budget puzzles.
“It’s a little bit maybe scarier, but it’s not a new sort of problem,” he said. “I think you all have the tools, we feel like we have the tools to fix it.”
Still, he said the potential for further federal funding cuts has raised many questions.
“The uncertainty about what happens in the future is huge,” Ball said.
At a separate session focusing on state budgets, financial analyst Geoffrey Buswick said most states have enviable credit ratings, meaning investors can be confident in a state’s ability to pay back debts, which affords it lower interest rates.
Buswick, the managing director and sector leader for public finance at S&P Global Ratings, said states likely have the budgetary cushion to adjust to federal policy changes.
“The states are in a very, very strong position — about the strongest we’ve ever seen,” he said.
Maryland Democratic state Sen. Karen Lewis Young didn’t buy that assessment.
She said her state touts strong reserve funds, but that those can only be used for one-time expenses and not to replace eliminated funding on an ongoing basis. Maryland is facing a huge decline in federal jobs, along with federal cuts in transportation, health and education funding.
“What am I missing in your optimism?” she asked the financial analyst.
Afterward, she told Stateline that Maryland may tout a stronger position compared with other states. But she added that even with low unemployment and a high average income, the federal legislation forces difficult decisions for lawmakers, who are constitutionally mandated to balance the state budget.
“You’ve got to cut from someplace else,” she said. “If you’re losing a pretty large share of your federal match, who do you cut?”
 A ‘substantial headache’

Across the country, Democratic lawmakers hope to underscore the cuts in Trump’s new law to weigh down Republicans in state races this year and next.
Hawaii Democratic state Sen. Ronald Kouchi said lawmakers need to ensure constituents understand where the spending cuts originated.
“Who’s going to be blamed when people are left out, when people are hungry and they lose out on educational opportunities?” he asked during a panel. “If we as state legislators do not convey that it is a result of the decisionmakers in Washington, D.C., they will be at our doorstep as the place of last resort.”
Kouchi, the president of the state Senate, said Hawaii leaders had socked away more than $1 billion in reserves. But he said the state cannot fill in all the financial gaps, especially during a time when officials are trying to set aside more in disaster funding and grapple with a slowdown in tourism.
“There is no current financial ability for the state to meet the needs of everyone who is currently being impacted,” he said in an interview.
New Mexico state Rep. Meredith Dixon, a Democrat, said her state should be somewhat insulated after directing surplus oil and gas revenues into a new Medicaid Trust Fund. But she said it’s still unclear how much pressure the federal legislation will put on the state.
“We are not protected by any stretch. So we are going to have to look at how we cover those costs. … We’re still digging into everything.”
West Virginia House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, a Republican, said no one in the federal government or at the state level seemed to have a full understanding of the implications of the legislation.
“I look at this bill as Obamacare 2.0: We have to pass this bill so we can find out what’s in it,” he told Stateline.
Hanshaw said the law has some provisions that will benefit West Virginia and others that will cause a “substantial headache.”
“We have no idea yet how we’re going to respond,” he said. “I don’t want to speak for any other state … but I would speculate that’s true for nearly every other state.”

Jim Pillen and State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood laugh after he signs a mock check signifying state investments in K-12 education. (Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A fund marketed as a sustainable source of state aid to Nebraska’s K-12 schools is on track to be completely depleted within five years of its creation.
The Education Future Fund (EFF) was designed in 2023 to lower property taxes while supporting school districts by providing resources that weren’t covered under Nebraska’s existing school funding formula. It launched with an initial investment of $1 billion and a commitment from state lawmakers to add another $250 million each year thereafter to keep it stable.
At the time, Gov. Jim Pillen said he hoped to build the fund to approximately $2.5 billion by 2029-30, but the state is spending money faster than it can grow. After that first $1 billion investment, expenses out of the fund have far exceeded revenue transfers into it by more than $150 million each year.
The Education Future Fund is now baked into Nebraska’s current school funding formula. Among other things, EFF offers per-pupil funding primarily to non-equalized school districts and assumes a higher level of state funding for special education.
Based on the fund’s projected ending balance in the state’s latest biennial budget and the trajectory of steadily increasing EFF expenses each year, if lawmakers only add the standard $250 million to the fund in fiscal year 2027-28, it will not have enough funds to cover its expenses by the end of that year, according to a Nebraska Examiner analysis.
This appears to be one of the worst-kept secrets among Nebraska state government and local education officials. Five school board members representing districts across the state told the Examiner that their boards had doubts about EFF’s lasting power when the fund was first introduced.
Barbara Baier, board member for Lincoln Public Schools, compared the state’s budgeting strategy of transferring revenues across different funds to “moving around deck chairs on the Titanic.”

Tim Royers, president of the Nebraska State Education Association, said lawmakers also know about this. When he approached Education Committee members in the Nebraska Legislature this session about adding resources to EFF, he said even his low-cost requests were rejected because lawmakers said there wasn’t enough money in the fund to support them.
Brad Wilkins, a board member for Ainsworth Community Schools, was on the task force that developed the idea for EFF. He said members of the governor’s staff claimed the fund would be sustainable for 10 years, but he said he questioned the estimate even then.
This touches on a longstanding lack of trust Nebraska’s education community has in the reliability of state government as a funding partner, Wilkins said. Lawmakers constantly ask school boards to lower their levy rates — and sometimes seek to cap them — while promising to take care of the districts if they comply, but they don’t always hold up their end of the bargain, Wilkins said.
“Some of those promises are hard to keep,” he said. “We need to keep this one.”
Despite the fiscal challenges, Pillen said he remains committed to ensuring the Education Future Fund remains alive. Lee Will, chief operating officer for Nebraska’s Department of Administrative Services, said the current plan is to increase the revenue transfers going into the fund.
“Fixing Nebraska’s property tax crisis while investing in our kids are my top goals as governor,” Pillen said in a statement. “We will ensure that the funding in the Education Future Fund is sustainable for generations to ensure we never give up on any kid in Nebraska.”
Where that additional revenue will come from, however, is a question that remains unanswered.
Foundation aid
The two biggest expenses out of the fund also come with the biggest statewide impacts: foundation aid and special education reimbursements.
Foundation aid was pitched as a way to support the vast majority of Nebraska’s 244 school districts that don’t receive equalization aid, what many know as state aid to K-12 schools. Foundation aid is a per-pupil funding mechanism that offers districts $1,500 for each student, minus any equalization aid the district already receives. Foundation aid costs roughly $112 million each year out of the fund.
Foundation aid’s impact largely depends on the district. At Lincoln Public Schools, Baier said they didn’t get much of a funding boost from foundation aid because the district already received a high amount of equalization aid.
But for smaller school districts like Ainsworth and West Point Public Schools, foundation aid makes a huge difference. Steven Blocher, board member at West Point, said the only state aid the district received prior to EFF’s implementation was allocated income taxes, which brought the district roughly $140,000 per year.
Foundation aid alone boosted West Point’s state aid by $1 million, Blocher said, and state special education reimbursements added another $360,000. He said the extra support helped the board approve an increase to teacher salaries.
In Ainsworth, Wilkins said foundation aid brought his district’s state aid from roughly $40,000 per year to about $450,000. He said that money was used nearly dollar-for-dollar to reduce the amount of property tax funds sought to operate their schools.
Special education reimbursements
Special education reimbursements make up an even larger chunk of the annual EFF payouts, ranging from $246 million in the fund’s first year to a projected $309 million in 2026-27. When the fund was created, lawmakers also approved increasing the state’s share of special ed costs covered from 40% to 80%. The program is largely split among federal and state funds, along with money from local school districts.
The demand for special ed services has been higher than both state and education officials expected, which is why the expenses have grown so much. Dave Welsch, board member for Milford Public Schools, said over the last decade his district’s special ed population has doubled.
Several other board members said their district’s special ed costs have increased much faster than they expected. This change is a factor in eroding the sustainability of the EFF in its current state, but it also brings the most consistent benefits from the fund to school districts, regardless of size.
Milford, for example, is “on the bubble” of Nebraska’s equalization formula, Welsch said, so the district can’t count on that support every year. But its reimbursements have raised the state aid the district receives by more than $600,000 each year.
LPS doesn’t receive much in foundation aid because of its equalization aid, but Baier said the special education funding has helped the district stabilize its budgets.

Levies
A big purpose of the EFF was to encourage school boards to lower local property tax asking — the amount of money sought from local property taxpayers to fund schools — by providing the additional state support. That strategy appears to have worked, to some degree.
All five board members who spoke with the Examiner said their local levy rates had either dropped or remained level since the EFF was created.

Will noted that since 2023, school district property taxes have risen 1.7% year-over-year. He argued this is a sign that the fund is working, because city and county property taxes have risen 5.5% and 4.7%, respectively.
Steve Koch, board member for Hershey Public Schools, said EFF aid helped his board lower the local levy rate by more than 15%, reducing Hershey’s overall tax asking by roughly $400,000.
At West Point, Blocher said the board was able to lower the district’s levy from over 69 cents in 2022-23 to 57 cents in 2024-25.
Milford’s levy rate has been rising over time from 84 cents in 2019-20 to 93 cents in 2024-25, Welsch said. He argued that due to rising property valuations and the district’s equalization aid dropping, Milford’s levy growth likely would have been much higher without EFF support.
At Omaha Public Schools, the largest school district in Nebraska, the district’s allocation of state aid remained relatively unchanged in the first year EFF was implemented in 2023-24. The following year, however, state aid to OPS jumped from roughly $285 million to more than $316 million, according to documents a district spokesperson sent the Examiner to review.
Over the same period, OPS also lowered its total levy rate from $1.21 to $1.10, the lowest it’s been in over a decade.
Multiple OPS board members either declined or ignored requests for comment in recent weeks.
What happens next?
If EFF were to suddenly dissolve, multiple board members said it would be “catastrophic” for their districts. Several board members said they would likely have no choice but to raise tax levies, though Wilkins noted that might be its own challenge due to levy caps state lawmakers also put in place that limit year-over-year increases.
Other board members said they may consider cuts to personnel costs, which consistently make up the biggest portion of school district budgets across Nebraska.

These worst case scenarios are unlikely, Will said, as he confirmed state officials remain committed to fueling the fund. At this point, he said the primary strategy is simply to increase the funds transferred into it.
While EFF was originally marketed as a largely self-sustaining system, Will argued it’s actually more sustainable for the state to control exactly how many dollars are going into it through transfers.
The only revenue source for EFF that isn’t a fund transfer is investment income, which is expected to drop from roughly $29 million in 2024-25 to about $16 million in 2025-26 and $11 million in 2026-27, according to state documents.
Many board members said they are nervous about the state having the money to make the fund whole, especially considering Nebraska’s current financial situation. This session, lawmakers grappled with a large projected deficit, which contributed to them reducing the amounts the state transferred into the EFF to $242 million for both years of the current biennium, rather than $250 million.
Nebraska is facing yet another projected deficit of about $95 million, according to the latest financial status, and Pillen has made clear his intention to cut the state budget an additional 10%, or roughly $500 million.
That prompts the question: If Nebraska is going to increase funding to EFF, where would that money come from?
Lou Ann Linehan, a former state senator from the Elkhorn area who helped develop the fund, had doubts that state revenues would actually be that bad when push comes to shove. She recalled during her first year in office in 2017 that revenue forecasts predicted a budget deficit of more than $1 billion.
This turned out to be an inaccurate reading, as lawmakers ended that year growing the state’s cash reserve, Linehan said. She said she feels Nebraska’s revenue forecasts are usually too conservative.
Will expressed confidence that raising the revenue transfers into EFF would be manageable. He said lawmakers have multiple years to figure this out and noted there are many outside factors that impact state revenues.
He further argued that on average, Nebraska’s tax receipts grow about 4.5% each year, although that hasn’t been the case so far in 2025.
“I don’t want to say that $100-$125 million isn’t a problem we [have] got to solve, but it’s definitely not our biggest one,” Will said.
Education officials, however, remain on edge. Royers, of the NSEA, said if lawmakers pull back on EFF aid, that would hardly be the first time that state officials have made lofty promises to schools they later rescinded.
Linehan pushed back on the lack of trust school officials have with the state. While in the Legislature, she said it was frustrating to hear school representatives say they don’t trust her or other lawmakers when they consistently increased education funding, including through EFF itself.
It’s worth noting, however, that there have been two years over the past decade that aggregate state funding to school districts has dropped, according to Legislative Fiscal Analyst Keisha Patent. However, the total amount of state aid to schools has continued its upward trajectory after those blips.
Trust issues aside, most people tend to agree that the biggest obstacle facing the fund is finding new revenues to support it. That is a challenge that will take time to overcome.
“The writing is on the wall if they don’t come up with new ways of raising income,” Koch said.

In an era when infrastructure backlogs are long and government funding is thin, a public-private partnership in Converse County gets a job across the finish line.
The post Ayres Natural Bridge Park gets makeover thanks to unconventional approach appeared first on WyoFile .","Scrubby plains and strafing winds dominate the landscape of central Wyoming. But from an Interstate 25 exit west of Douglas, a narrow road leads down a lush canyon where a natural stone bridge spans a serene creek. 
“It is a gorgeous park,” said Ayres Natural Bridge Park caretaker Christy Smith. “It is very, very tranquil.”
With red rock walls hugging a green expanse of lawns, campsites and leafy trees, the park attracts local visitors as well as tourists who marvel at Ayres Bridge — one of only three natural stone bridges in the U.S. that spans running water. But in recent years, the park facilities were showing their age, said Smith, who lives in the park and manages it with her husband, Traves. 
Cracks and rust appeared on decades-old playground equipment, and picnic tables weren’t up to Americans with Disabilities Act standards. The sprinkler system was ancient and the grills were run down. The Smiths started looking around for funding to help bring the park up to date, but funding isn’t easy to come by, Smith said. Grants are hard to get for established parks, she said, and the county has its own budget constraints. 
“And then I get this email,” Smith said. 
The missive proposed a grant to fund the park rehabilitation project. Smith was incredulous, she said. “At first I thought it was a scam.”
It wasn’t a scam. The author of the email was Lori McCullough, founder and CEO of the Great Outdoors Fund. The national organization is dedicated to expanding access to the outdoors and improving recreation opportunities through public-private partnerships. And she had zeroed in on the Ayres Natural Bridge Park as a candidate. 
Fast forward to June, and crews with project sponsor Occidental Petroleum, or Oxy, as well as Converse County commissioners and others spent two days pouring cement, installing playground equipment, replacing grills and building a new fire pit. 
The project has substantially improved the park, Smith said.

It also sets out a model for alternative funding for outdoor recreation infrastructure and access in an era when government resources are challenged, inconsistent or in flux. 
“As these other funding sources become in jeopardy, it just makes more sense” to look to alternative ways to fund the projects, McCullough said. Across America, she added, “the need makes for limitless opportunities.”
Creative solutions
Wyoming’s outdoor recreation crowds have been growing for decades, and the COVID-19 pandemic fueled the trend when it fueled new interest in getting outside. 
Federal land management agencies like the U.S. Forest Service have been unable to keep staffing levels up even as maintenance and infrastructure backlogs have grown. Federal job layoffs and funding cuts in 2025 further limited their bandwidth, and nonprofits have attempted to fill the gaps with measures like hiring personnel to assist forest crews. 
The model used for the Ayres Natural Bridge Park project is another untraditional strategy. 
McCullough’s Great Outdoors Fund acts as a facilitator between private donors and outdoor projects that need resources. The end goal is to make the outdoors accessible to all, she said. Oxy, an energy company that has a significant presence in Converse County, went to her looking to fund a project in its target area, she said.
When she started researching potentials, she discovered the Ayres Natural Bridge Park. “And it just so happened that the county had decided on a significant investment in the irrigation system … and they didn’t have funding for any other upgrades,” McCullough said. 
She got in touch with the county, and soon after, sent the email that Smith suspected was spam. Agreements were drawn up, and with Oxy’s donation, the Great Outdoors Fund provided more than $100,000 for concrete pads, picnic tables, grills, a new four-way teeter-totter and a playground set, among other things.

Though well used, playground and other equipment in the Ayres Natural Bridge Park in Converse County was outdated. An untraditional funding model was used to find the money and manpower to undertake a 2025 park rehabilitation project. (Great Outdoors Fund)
Over two days in June, work crews and volunteers gathered in the park to complete the project.
The county is “thrilled” to be a beneficiary of the project, Commissioner Robert Short said, “because we want everyone to have the opportunity to enjoy this park.”
Along with addressing backlogs, Short said, he sees the project as an example of industrial development folks giving back to the communities where they work. 
Benefits
“It has completely changed the look of that area, and we are so happy with it,” Smith said. 
Smith has spent time in Ayres her entire life; her grandparents ran the park when she was a child. When she and Traves became caretakers four years ago, their priority was improving it for users, she said. This project took care of a lot of that work.

The benefits of natural spaces like Ayres Natural Bridge Park are immeasurable, McCullough said. “We can calculate the economic impact of recreation, but the impact on our health and well-being is incalculable,” she said. 
The county has plans to continue Ayres improvements. Phase two will entail redoing the walking path that encircles the park.

Autocrats have historically used fear of violent crime to grow and consolidate their power, writes constitutional scholar David Adler.
The post Trump’s takeover of D.C. police force unleashes new legal and constitutional concerns appeared first on WyoFile .","To justify his deployment of the National Guard to the streets of Washington, D.C., in conjunction with FBI, Border Patrol, Secret Service, ICE and DEA agents, as part of his federal takeover of the city’s police force, President Donald Trump has declared a “crime emergency” in the nation’s capital. That declaration comes despite the fact that federal officials in his own administration recently announced that violent crime in the District of Columbia has hit a 30-year low. 

Opinion

In an Aug. 11 press conference, Trump announced that these forces “can do whatever the hell they want” to curb crime, an unprecedented presidential action, and another assertion of his belief that he enjoys absolute power under Article II of the Constitution.
Trump has invoked a provision of the 1973 Washington D.C. Home Rule Act, which permits the president to take control of the city’s police force for a temporary period, up to 30 days. After that period, Trump must receive authorization from Congress if he wishes to maintain control of law enforcement. Trump’s false pretext for deploying the guardsmen, one exposed by his administration’s report that violent crime in the nation’s capital is down 35% from 2023, and has fallen to its lowest point since before the pandemic, is the latest in a string of troop deployments for domestic purposes. 
Just two months ago, he sent 4,000 national guardsmen and 800 active-duty Marines to quell protests in Los Angeles over his immigration policies, despite the fact that the protests, which were overwhelmingly peaceful and efficiently handled by local law enforcement, had largely ended. Trump’s actions appear to have violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which sharply limits use of the military in domestic law enforcement, as well as the 10th Amendment, and are the subject of a federal trial underway this week.
Trump’s executive takeover of law enforcement in the nation’s capital — long a goal of his — is predicated on his baseless description of the city as an urban hellscape and reflects his authoritarian trajectory. Devoid of a factually based rationale, since there is no street crime epidemic in the District, the legality of Trump’s action is specious and raises questions about his motives. Historically, autocrats have painted wildly exaggerated portraits of violent crime in cities before taking control of local law enforcement, pursuant to national expansion.
Indeed, Trump announced that he may also deploy the National Guard to other cities, naming New York, Chicago, Baltimore and Oakland, among others. Each city is governed by a Democratic mayor and located within a “Blue State.” FBI statistics indicate that crime is down, however, in New York and Baltimore, and the National Mayors Association has confirmed the reduction of crimes in cities across America. Historically speaking, authoritarian leaders have deployed the military into civilian populations as projections of power and presence, aiming to intimidate local populations and suppress dissent. The infliction of fear among the people has been a common technique among autocrats in other nations and across the decades, as a means of cowing opponents, silencing dissidents and preventing protests. Residents of Washington have already expressed fear at the sight of military boots in their streets.  
While it is likely that the deployment of forces in the nation’s capital also represents an additional effort to divert the attention of Trump’s MAGA base, outraged by the president’s failure to deliver on his promise to release the Epstein Files — a political and moral scandal that has engulfed his administration’s time, resources and energies, and which seemingly defies resolution — the broader legal and constitutional concerns arising across our nation ask about state authority, in the event of forthcoming deployments, to respond to presidential acts that swallow up the 10th Amendment. Mindful of the fact that all governmental acts, including those of presidents, must be tethered to the Constitution, citizens are right to ask about measures to restrain the federal government and prevent, as former Chief Justice Marshall wrote, transgression of legal boundaries. 
As is often the case, history offers valuable insights for our time. In 1798, when Congress passed the Alien and Sedition Acts. Founders, including James Madison and Thomas Jefferson, wrote resolutions — the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions — that decried violations of the Constitution which they believed constituted a fundamental threat to the republic, federalism and American liberties. We turn next week to their response.

(Stills Congressional Campaign photo)The number of Democrats hoping to represent the party in the 2026 race for Wisconsin’s 1st Congressional District has grown to three, all from Racine County and all positioning themselves as working-class candidates who contrast sharply with the incumbent.
Gage Stills, a 25-year-old community activist, said he comes to the race with “a strong working-class perspective on things, and I know what a lot of these families are going through — I’ve lived it.”
Stills said Friday that he launched his campaign in mid-July, running “under the radar” without a mass media announcement but with a campaign website and a Tik-Tok account to which he posts videos once a week.
That made him the second entry into the Democratic field for the 1st District, following Randy Bryce, who ran and lost in 2018 and announced May 20 he would try again. A third Democrat, nurse Mitchell Berman, entered the race August 12.
Each of the three are seeking the Democratic nomination to run against U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil (R-Janesville), the incumbent now in his fourth term.
In an interview, Stills described his upbringing as one of a family “living paycheck to paycheck and not entirely certain where the next meal is going to come from.”
Even in those circumstances, however, he added, “My parents, they took good care of me and they raised me right and they raised me to care about the world and care about people.”
Stills said that “a big factor” in his decision to run was “the One Big Beautiful Bill and how much it does to hurt the working class and how much it does to hurt folks who are in the lower middle class.”
The “One Big, Beautiful Bill” is what Trump and the legislation’s GOP backers dubbed the mega-bill that extended tax cuts enacted during Trump’s first term in 2017. The legislation, which Trump signed on July 4, also made significant cuts to Medicaid and federal food assistance and rolled back clean energy tax breaks that Congress and then-President Joe Biden enacted in 2022, among a number of other provisions.
Stills said Trump’s policies that ramped up the deployment of federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers with arrests that have swept up immigrants, a number of whom were legally authorized to be in the U.S., were an additional factor in his decision.
“I have a lot of family who are Hispanic,” Stills said. “Some of my family members have married immigrants, and they came here legally, but you know, that’s not entirely guaranteed protection these days.”
He said his upbringing led him to believe “that it doesn’t make sense to complain if I’m not going to get in there and try to do the work.”
Stills said he as a cybersecurity analyst after working for about five months as a state corrections officer and before that in retail sales. He said he was active in Black Lives Matter demonstrations in Racine in 2020 and has volunteered with local environmental organizations and at a community homeless shelter.
The race for Congress is his first time running for a political office. While he acknowledged some voters might be wary, he said that he has “no political ties to anybody. I don’t owe anything to any corporation” — making him a fresh face that voters would appreciate.
“I think for too long we’ve seen politicians that, sure they’ve held political office, but they don’t use that office to help the people,” Stills said.
Steil is a corporate lawyer who previously worked as an aide to former U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, the Janesville Republican who represented the 1st District for 20 years after he was first elected in 1998.
Steil won his first term in 2018, defeating Bryce by a 12-point margin, and won subsequent races with a similar spread.
Stills said he believes he can overcome that gap. “I plan on speaking to the people’s needs,” he said.
While he didn’t attend a listening session that Steil held July 31 at which many constituents directed angry comments to the congressman, Stills said he followed news accounts of the event.
The people who attended “raised valuable concerns that it seemed that he just tried to brush off, or blame on Biden, which doesn’t work anymore,” Stills said.
“We know the votes that he’s casting,” he said of Steil. “We know that they’re not for us. And I think that the people are waking up to that.”
Stills said he wants to aim his message to people all across the political spectrum — left, center and right alike.
“I think that more and more people are going to look for an alternative,” he said. “I think that alternative should be a voice that speaks for them, that comes from the same place as them, a working class perspective.”

Holy Name Housing Corp. next will add on-site touches such as shingles, basement finishings and possibly a garage to the bungalow also designed by students at Metropolitan Community College.
If all goes as planned, the four-bedroom residence will be sold to a family for under $275,000, a homeownership opportunity in a high-rental pocket of one of the state’s more distressed areas.
Belying its swift, pop-up entrance — a captivating spectacle for onlookers — the house at 2452 Camden Ave. is the result of a lengthy and multi-organization process also involving an ‘at risk’ state housing fund intended to help ease Nebraska’s affordable housing shortage.
 Housing for middle income workforce  

Matthew Cavanaugh is executive director of Holy Name Housing, a grant recipient of the state’s Middle Income Workforce Housing Investment Fund, which since its 2020 creation by the Legislature has distributed about $42 million to help multiple nonprofits develop houses in qualified older and urban neighborhoods of the state’s three largest counties.

The fund for Douglas, Sarpy and Lancaster Counties is competitive. Holy Name over the years has been awarded a total of about $7 million, for which its private donors provide a partial match. The agency used recent grant funds to boost a revolving loan program that helps build homes such as the one that popped up in Miller Park. 
A relatively new partnership with Metro offers a different twist: Holy Name pays for building and materials while the students prepare architectural plans and housing components.
Holy Name covered the cost to transport the Camden Avenue house in sections from the college’s Fort Omaha campus a half-dozen blocks to the neighborhood. The bungalow was the second house produced via the partnership.
The idea is that repayment of loans into the nonprofit’s revolving fund will multiply the number of houses available for sale at relatively affordable prices. The targeted population of working-class homeowners is expected to help build stability and mixed-income neighborhoods. That ideally would lead to more jobs and economic prosperity in historically disinvested areas.
An even quicker benefit of the Metro partnership, said Cavanaugh, is hands-on training and enthusiasm-building provided to budding workers in construction trades — an understaffed industry he said is a key reason for high housing costs.
  The house is part of Holy Name’s effort to expand homeownership opportunities and help stabilize qualified urban neighborhoods. (Courtesy of MCC)
“They’ll be able to see the finished product, the contribution they made in a home that will be there for the next generations,” he said. “So hopefully it inspires students to continue to work in the trades … that’s what we’re excited about.”
The Middle Income Workforce housing fund has no income restrictions for homebuyers, but the Holy Name team says it screens applicants to weed out investors seeking to rent the property. Rules limit construction costs per house to no more than $330,000. A law change this year allows the grant funds to also be used to construct or renovate rent-to-own housing in qualified urban areas.
 ‘It’s all at risk’ 

Continued state funding for the program has been in jeopardy in recent years.
With the state budget facing major shortfalls, the Appropriations Committee sought to cut $4 million from each of the Middle Income and the separate Rural Workforce housing funds.
Instead, the Legislature approved a one-time $8 million transfer from the state’s longest-running housing program, the Affordable Housing Trust Fund, to help with budget woes. Unlike the two newer funds, that pot is fueled by a portion of the documentary stamp tax from real estate transactions.
“It’s all at risk,” Carol Bodeen, director of policy and outreach for the Nebraska Housing Developers Association, said of state funding for housing programs.

She said the last time the Legislature and governor committed new money for the housing funds was in 2022. Last year, the Legislature shifted $25 million from the Affordable Housing Trust Fund to put in the two workforce funds. 
State lawmakers have named affordable housing a priority, but less than a month ago the Legislature’s fiscal office confirmed Nebraska’s current two-year budget was back into a projected deficit of about $95 million.
Meanwhile, housing advocates hope philanthropy and other innovative housing programs will help fill gaps.
 ‘A win-win’ 

The Craftsman-style bungalow on Camden Avenue was the second house Metro has worked on with Holy Name, but the college’s students previously completed four similar residential projects.
Metro said 170 students were involved over the past year in creating the bungalow. The cross-section of students represented architecture, electrical, plumbing, building and construction science programs. Built in four modules, the house features a welcoming foyer with custom-built cabinets, a kitchen pantry and an open floor plan.
“Beyond the education and skills that they developed over the past year finishing the home, it’s a tangible place that can always be a source of pride for our students long after they complete their degrees at MCC,” said Andrew Henrichs, the faculty member who led the project.

Cavanaugh hopes for a continued partnership with Metro as Holy Name continues its focus on building up neighborhoods near the Fort Omaha campus.
He said Holy Name, which acts as developer and general contractor, is enthused to have fresh and creative student ideas complementing the agency’s other affordable housing models. 
“It’s a win-win,” said Cavanaugh. “It’s awesome to give students that opportunity — and we get to see a new style of house designed by their architecture program.”

Mike Flood, R-Neb., touted the news as “a message that they’re focused on strengthening the NWS for years to come.”","Nebraska U.S. Rep Mike Flood, R-Neb., during his town hall in Lincoln on Aug 4. 2025. (Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner) LINCOLN – The National Weather Service announced this month that it would hire back 450 meteorologists, hydrologists, and radar technicians after making sweeping cuts earlier in the year. 
The announcement came as the agency tries to recoup losses from the Department of Government Efficiency’s effort to reshape the federal bureaucracy. While the Weather Service faced staffing issues long before President Donald Trump’s second term, recent cuts required “urgent action,” according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 
Nebraska U.S. Rep. Mike Flood, R-Neb., touted the news as “a message that they’re focused on strengthening the NWS for years to come.”
“For decades, the National Weather Service has helped keep our communities safe with accurate and timely forecasts,” Flood said in a statement.

Flood led the push among Nebraska’s federal delegation to reverse a DOGE cut that caused a Weather Service office in the Omaha area and other Great Plains offices to pause the deployment of weather balloons in April. The station is launching two weather balloons a day, Flood has said, but the Omaha-area Weather Service office has said it still faces staffing issues. 
Retiring U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., also sent a letter to U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick expressing his concerns about the NWS cuts. The Trump administration fired roughly a combined  600 workers from both agencies earlier this year. The cuts contributed to two forecasting offices that cover some rural parts of western and southwestern Nebraska to no longer monitor local weather around-the-clock, which Nebraska and local rural weather experts said threatens public safety.
Flood has introduced bipartisan-backed legislation that would make it harder for National Weather Service employees to be fired in the future. 
“It doesn’t matter if you’re a Republican or a Democrat or an Independent,” Flood said in June. “Everybody wants accurate weather forecasting.”

Bill Lee confirmed the state will not require the Boring Company to pay for land it uses to build a series of tunnels under Nashville to the airport and other destinations.
Lee said recently final negotiations for the state’s inspection process for Boring haven’t been finalized, but he doesn’t expect the company to be required to pay for use of state property to construct tunnels. A business dubbed the “Music City Loop” is planning to use electric vehicles to ferry riders from downtown Nashville to a series of stations and the airport.
“The Boring Company’s going to do this at no cost to the state,” Lee said. “The state will give right of way for them at no cost to the Boring Company because of the enormous investment they’re making on the state’s behalf.”

The company hasn’t given an estimated cost for the project or said how much riders will be charged to use the electric vehicles.
Previously, state Sen. Becky Massey said the state would provide the right of way to Boring under state roads for tunnel construction through a long-term lease. Routes haven’t been finalized, and it’s unclear whether tunnels would go only under state routes or Metro Nashville streets as well.
The company started digging a test hole in a state-owned parking lot near the Capitol this week. Boring Company President Steve Davis previously projected the tunnel could be put into use within two years.
Facing myriad questions from skeptics of the project, as well as Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell’s office, Lee defended the proposal to reporters in a press conference, saying the Boring Company has a “history of tunnels,” mainly a Las Vegas “loop” where the company has moved 3 million passengers safely.
But the Las Vegas project has failed to live up to the projections made by Boring Company officials in 2019, when Las Vegas officials approved the project. Intended to stretch for more than 68 miles, the tunnel only runs 2.2 miles under the convention center and the company took one year to dig 1.7 miles. According to the Nevada Current, construction at that rate could take 40 years to complete the entire loop.
Nashville mayor’s office queries Boring Company about tunnel plan

Reports also show the company built tunnels without permits, dumped untreated water into storm drains and sewers and was fined $112,000 over workers’ complaints about severe burns and muck spills. Boring is contesting the violations. 
O’Connell’s office submitted about 70 questions to the Boring Company, and Lee said he believes it is answering them. The questions deal with everything from emergency responses in the proposed tunnel to maintenance, ownership and safety standards.
Lee called Boring “a highly sophisticated company” that will be required to meet safety standards to ensure the tunnel is structurally sound for transportation.
“It’s incredibly important that we do it right,” Lee said. “But it’s also an incredible opportunity for our state to have a modern, state-of-the-art transit system that will move millions of people in our city and particularly in our state, entirely at no cost to the taxpayers.”

(Kevin Hardy | Stateline)BOSTON — During this year’s budget cycle, Oklahoma state Sen. John Haste said lawmakers had two major things on their minds.
“Number one was tax cuts. Number two, what the hell is going on in Washington?” he told a national gathering of state lawmakers last week in Boston.
While Oklahoma lawmakers secured another round of income tax cuts, they are still wrapping their heads around the fiscal impacts of President Donald Trump’s massive spending and tax law, Haste said. The measure slashes funding for health care and food assistance.
That legislation, and other Trump actions, proved a central theme of discussion during the National Conference of State Legislatures summit, which organizers said was the largest ever gathering of state lawmakers with more than 1,600 in attendance. Aside from cutting funding, the law imposes costly new administrative burdens on states.
States are still sorting through the long-term impacts of the legislation — and what, if any, actions they can take to soften the blow.
Haste, a Republican, said concern is highest in rural areas, where reduced Medicaid funding could threaten hospitals. He said that just one provision of the law will cut $209 million in funds that help Oklahoma cover the cost of Medicaid, and that the state will need to spend an estimated $30 million on the new cost of checking eligibility twice per year.
“All of those things added together come up to a really big number,” he said, but added: “We don’t know exactly what that is.”
Lawmakers from liberal and conservative states said they are still grappling with the implications of Trump’s signature legislation. With most states boasting solid fiscal positions, some expect to cover new up-front administrative costs by tapping into strong reserve funds. But many are considering reducing services.
Nevada state Sen. Fabian Doñate, a Democrat, said state leaders will have to cut Medicaid eligibility or services since Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo has said he will oppose any efforts to raise taxes.
“That becomes a challenge, right?” Doñate said during a panel discussion on Medicaid. “Do you cut the pregnant mom or the person that makes above 180% of the federal poverty level who’s under 50, or do you cut diapers for seniors?”
At the same time, states must gear up for new bureaucratic mandates from Washington.
“Regardless of how you feel about these provisions — whether these are opportunities or challenges, fantastic or awful — regardless, it’s going to be a heavy lift for states,” said Lauren Kallins, NCSL’s senior legislative director for state-federal affairs.
She said states and organizations, including NCSL, are still awaiting detailed federal guidance on all the changes, which are spread out over several years. But states will need to react quickly.

One provision in the law requires the 40 states plus Washington, D.C., that have expanded Medicaid to check paperwork at least twice a year to ensure those enrollees are meeting new work requirements. The legislation provided states $200 million, but experts question whether it will be enough to help states implement the changes by the end of 2026.
To meet that deadline, states will need to increase outreach to Medicaid recipients and make new investments in technology, Kallins said. Similarly, states must cover new administrative costs for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, commonly called food stamps.
Traditionally, the federal government has fully funded SNAP benefits and split administrative costs of the program with states. The new law requires states to fund 75% of administrative costs and requires some states, depending on the accuracy of their eligibility determination, to fund a portion of benefits.
“So that’s another very significant increase for states,” Kallins said.
States in a ‘very, very strong position’
Though revenue growth is slowing, lawmakers and experts pointed out that many states currently enjoy strong budget fundamentals.
That’s true in Utah, which touts deep reserve funding and a rapidly growing economy.
Jonathan Ball, Utah’s legislative fiscal analyst, told conference attendees that the state could rely on some of its reserve for one-time administrative and technical costs associated with the federal legislation.
He said lawmakers and budget writers always have to find creative ways to solve their state’s budget puzzles.
“It’s a little bit maybe scarier, but it’s not a new sort of problem,” he said. “I think you all have the tools, we feel like we have the tools to fix it.”
Still, he said the potential for further federal funding cuts has raised many questions.
“The uncertainty about what happens in the future is huge,” Ball said.
At a separate session focusing on state budgets, financial analyst Geoffrey Buswick said most states have enviable credit ratings, meaning investors can be confident in a state’s ability to pay back debts, which affords it lower interest rates.
Buswick, the managing director and sector leader for public finance at S&P Global Ratings, said states likely have the budgetary cushion to adjust to federal policy changes.
“The states are in a very, very strong position — about the strongest we’ve ever seen,” he said.
Maryland Democratic state Sen. Karen Lewis Young didn’t buy that assessment.
She said her state touts strong reserve funds, but that those can only be used for one-time expenses and not to replace eliminated funding on an ongoing basis. Maryland is facing a huge decline in federal jobs, along with federal cuts in transportation, health and education funding.
“What am I missing in your optimism?” she asked the financial analyst.
Afterward, she told Stateline that Maryland may tout a stronger position compared with other states. But she added that even with low unemployment and a high average income, the federal legislation forces difficult decisions for lawmakers, who are constitutionally mandated to balance the state budget.
“You’ve got to cut from someplace else,” she said. “If you’re losing a pretty large share of your federal match, who do you cut?”
A ‘substantial headache’
Across the country, Democratic lawmakers hope to underscore the cuts in Trump’s new law to weigh down Republicans in state races this year and next.
Hawaii Democratic state Sen. Ronald Kouchi said lawmakers need to ensure constituents understand where the spending cuts originated.
“Who’s going to be blamed when people are left out, when people are hungry and they lose out on educational opportunities?” he asked during a panel. “If we as state legislators do not convey that it is a result of the decisionmakers in Washington, D.C., they will be at our doorstep as the place of last resort.”
Kouchi, the president of the state Senate, said Hawaii leaders had socked away more than $1 billion in reserves. But he said the state cannot fill in all the financial gaps, especially during a time when officials are trying to set aside more in disaster funding and grapple with a slowdown in tourism.
“There is no current financial ability for the state to meet the needs of everyone who is currently being impacted,” he said in an interview.










We have no idea yet how we’re going to respond.


– West Virginia Republican House Speaker Roger Hanshaw


New Mexico state Rep. Meredith Dixon, a Democrat, said her state should be somewhat insulated after directing surplus oil and gas revenues into a new Medicaid Trust Fund. But she said it’s still unclear how much pressure the federal legislation will put on the state.
“We are not protected by any stretch. So we are going to have to look at how we cover those costs. … We’re still digging into everything.”
West Virginia House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, a Republican, said no one in the federal government or at the state level seemed to have a full understanding of the implications of the legislation.
“I look at this bill as Obamacare 2.0: We have to pass this bill so we can find out what’s in it,” he told Stateline.
Hanshaw said the law has some provisions that will benefit West Virginia and others that will cause a “substantial headache.”
“We have no idea yet how we’re going to respond,” he said. “I don’t want to speak for any other state … but I would speculate that’s true for nearly every other state.”

Hery McMaster leads a briefing at the South Carolina Emergency Operations Center in West Columbia on Friday, Sept. 27, 2024, after the damage caused by Tropical Storm Helene. (Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Gov. Henry McMaster authorized deploying 200 National Guard members from South Carolina to Washington to support the Trump administration’s policing of the nation’s capital.
They leave Monday.
According to McMaster’s office, his order Saturday was requested by the Pentagon.
The troops are activated under Title 32, or “federal-state status” authority, which means the federal government pays for their deployment but McMaster remains in control.
The governor said he will bring the troops back immediately if a hurricane or other natural disaster threatens the state.
“South Carolina is proud to stand with President Trump as he works to restore law and order to our nation’s capital and ensure safety for all who live, work, and visit there,” McMaster said in a statement.
The National Guard in South Carolina includes more than 9,300 Army National Guard and 1,300 Air National Guard members.
President Donald Trump asserted control of the Washington police force Aug. 11 and mobilized 800 National Guard troops after declaring a “crime emergency.”
It marked the first federal takeover since 1973, when the Home Rule Act allowed the city’s residents to elect their own mayor and city council. The law allows the president to take control when “special conditions of an emergency nature exist.” But it limits a takeover to 30 days, unless Congress passes a resolution extending the authority.
District officials sued Friday, arguing the Trump administration “far exceeded” its authority with an executive order making the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration the emergency police commissioner. In response, the Trump administration agreed to leave Washington’s police chief in charge of the city’s 3,400 officers.
But the lawsuit did not challenge Trump’s ability to deploy 800 National Guard members. Since the district is not a state, the president has sole authority over National Guard units in the capital city.
State Democratic Party Chair Christale Spain called it reckless for McMaster to send 200 troops to Washington in the middle of hurricane season.
“The gall of Henry to think so little of our friends, neighbors and loved ones as to send our heroes away during the very time they are most needed here at home is a disgusting act of betrayal,” she said in a statement Sunday.
“South Carolinians know all too well how devastating a storm can be,” she continued. “Instead of putting South Carolina first, Governor McMaster has chosen political loyalty to Donald Trump over the safety and security of the people he was elected to serve.”
State Rep. John King also questioned the deployment and its costs.
“We are told federal reimbursement will cover the expenses, but history has shown there are always hidden costs that fall back on taxpayers,” the Rock Hill Democrat wrote Sunday in a letter to McMaster also sent out in a news release.
He called the deployment “political theater.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/mcmaster-briefing-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-18 08:56:48.562036

Fueled by hot summer weather and persistent drought conditions across the western half of the state, wildfires as of Aug. 18 had burned more than 200,000 acres in Colorado in 2025.
It’s Colorado’s worst fire year since 2020, when multiple historic blazes burned a record-setting 625,357 acres, according to National Interagency Fire Center data.
Drought conditions classified as “severe” or “extreme” extend across the majority of the Western Slope, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. A critical fire weather advisory for western Colorado and several neighboring states has been issued by the Rocky Mountain Area Coordination Center, a Denver-based branch of the NIFC, and will remain in place through at least mid-August.

“After a dry winter with minimal snowpack fuel moistures are well below normal, and much of the region is under severe to extreme drought,” the agency warns. “Extreme fire behavior marked by rapid spread, torching, and resistance to control is being driven by critically dry … fuels, and drought-stressed brush and trees. As heat intensifies and fuel moistures decline further, fire potential will remain elevated across the area.”
Here is a look at three 2025 Colorado fires:

The Lee Fire, west of the town of Meeker in Rio Blanco County, has burned an estimated 137,485 acres with 61% containment as of Aug. 18. It was caused by lightning on Aug. 2.
The nearby Elk Fire, southeast of Meeker, was also caused by lightning on Aug. 2. It has burned an estimated 14,518 acres as of Aug. 18, and is 100% contained.
The Turner Gulch Fire, east of Gateway near the Colorado-Utah border in Mesa County, is 79% contained and has burned an estimated 31,697 acres since it was started by lightning on July 12.

Due to climate change, much of Colorado has grown hotter and drier in recent decades, increasing wildfire risk. The three largest wildfires in Colorado history all occurred in 2020, and the state’s 20 biggest fires on record have all occurred in the past 20 years. Rising levels of greenhouse gases, mostly the result of fossil-fuel combustion, have caused much of the Western Slope to warm by an average of more than 4 degrees Fahrenheit above pre-industrial levels, and the region’s current “megadrought” is its worst dry spell in at least 1,200 years.
Most wildfires are caused by human activity. To minimize the risk of sparking a fire, authorities urge visitors to national forests and other public lands to follow local fire restrictions, ensure that vehicles are properly maintained and trailer chains are secured, and avoid driving or parking on dry grass.
In 2017, the State Forest Service reported that more than 2.9 million Coloradans lived in the “wildland-urban interface” — areas at risk of being impacted by wildfires. Fire safety experts urge residents of such zones to familiarize themselves with the “Ready, Set, Go” system of precautions.

Human emissions driving Colorado River ‘megadrought,’ CU Boulder research finds


By: Chase Woodruff - Monday August 18, 2025 4:00 am





As historic drought conditions on the Western Slope fuel another dangerous wildfire season, a new paper from researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder warns that human-caused climate change is playing a major role in making those conditions worse.
Previously published climatological research has found that the Colorado River Basin’s current “megadrought” is the worst dry spell the region has experienced in at least 1,200 years. But a new study, published last week in the journal Nature,  concludes that those persistently dry conditions are being driven by human activity “more intensely — and more directly — than previously understood,” its authors say.
A 2022 study attributed about 40% of the megadrought to higher temperatures alone, as hotter weather leads to greater evaporation of moisture from water surfaces and soils. Modeling global warming’s precise impacts on rainfall patterns has proved more elusive, but Pedro DiNezio, an associate professor at CU Boulder’s Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, said the new paper “add(s) more human influence to that previous number.”
“What’s important here is that we’re showing that rainfall has also been influenced by humans, in addition to just evaporation,” said DiNezio. “Both contribute to drought.”

Polis declares emergency over ‘near record level’ Colorado fire danger


By: Chase Woodruff - Friday August 15, 2025 9:23 am





Colorado Gov. Jared Polis on Thursday issued a broad emergency declaration covering multiple wildfires currently burning on the Western Slope and the risk of new fires as dangerous weather conditions persist in the coming weeks.
More than 2,000 local, state and federal personnel are currently battling nine large fires in Colorado, including the Lee Fire in Rio Blanco County, which as of Friday ranked as the fifth-largest fire in state history at an estimated size of 133,602 acres. Polis said in a press release that Thursday’s executive order declaring an emergency would “bolster our ability to jump on fires early” as elevated fire risk continues.
“Continuing throughout July and into August, and as part of the same prolonged weather pattern, parts of Colorado have experienced continued high temperatures, high winds, severe to extreme drought conditions, and near record level fire indices,” the order says. “Elevated fire weather and fire risk is forecast for the coming weeks.”

Containment of the Lee Fire west of Meeker has dropped slightly to 6%, compared to its 7% containment Monday. A Tuesday morning map of the fire, which is the fifth-largest in state history, showed 116,859 acres burned. That’s more than 3,000 new acres burned since Monday.
The Lee Fire started in Rio Blanco County and has spread toward Rifle in Garfield County, pushed by strong winds and dry conditions.
During a community meeting at Colorado Mountain College on Monday night, incident meteorologist Rose Schoenfeld said smoke conditions are expected to improve in Rifle throughout Tuesday as winds change. But fire crews still face challenges ahead, especially moving into Wednesday, Schoenfeld added.
“Wednesday is really the day to watch with regards to fire weather,” Schoenfeld said. “Wednesday is going to be warmer, and it’s going to be more of an unstable atmosphere.”
“In the past 30 days, we have gotten 5% of the normal precipitation, putting the area in extreme drought,” she added.

Western Slope wildfires already add up to Colorado’s worst fire year since 2020


By: Chase Woodruff - Wednesday August 6, 2025 2:23 pm





High winds and extreme drought conditions in northwest Colorado have fueled the rapid growth of two wildfires this week near Meeker in Rio Blanco County, where firefighting crews say they’re prioritizing structure protection with “limited resources” on hand.
The Lee Fire, west of Meeker, nearly doubled in size Tuesday and has now burned 22,497 acres, predominantly on Bureau of Land Management land south of Colorado Highway 13. About 20 miles to the east, the Elk Fire is estimated at 8,304 acres in size. Both fires are believed to have been started by lightning strikes on Aug. 2.
With the latest growth, the estimated area burned in Colorado by 11 major wildfires in 2025 now stands at 64,196 acres, according to federal data. That doesn’t include smaller fires suppressed by state and local first responders, but it already makes for the state’s worst fire year since 2020.

“I don’t think it’s a secret that I have some questions I would like answered about the role and guardrails,” Armstrong said during a Friday meeting of selection committee members.
Hogue said he also wants to know how candidates would handle so-called frivolous complaints. Some lawmakers during the legislative session said that people were weaponizing the Ethics Commission by filing baseless complaints against their political opponents.
“I’m not willing to support anybody who is not willing to dispose of non-serious complaints in short order,” Hogue said.
Senate Minority Leader Kathy Hogan, D-Fargo, suggested that the committee ask candidates if there are any broad structural changes they would like to see the commission make.

She also suggested that the selection committee ensure candidates can articulate the basic purpose and responsibilities of the commission, which she said many people misunderstand.
The selection committee said it would prepare a list of questions to send to applicants by the end of this week. After that, they would select a smaller group of candidates for the first round of interviews.
One winning applicant will finish out the term of former chair Dave Anderson, who died unexpectedly in May. That term ends in 2026.
Another will replace Commissioner Ward Koeser, whose term wraps up Aug. 31.
Commissioner Murray Sagsveen’s term also ends on Aug. 31, though he is seeking to be reappointed. Sagvseen joined the commission to fill the seat left by former Ethics Commission Chair Paul Richard, who retired last year. The commission sent a letter to the Governor’s Office supporting his reappointment.
The Ethics Commission was created through a constitutional amendment approved by voters in 2018. It’s tasked with enforcing ethical behavior in the areas of elections, lobbying, corruption and transparency.
Commissioners’ duties include adopting ethics rules, investigating alleged violations and issuing advisory opinions to help public officials navigate ethical issues. They are paid a stipend for every day they meet, plus reimbursement for travel.

Yes, the state’s economy slowed last year along with the nation. But Michigan hit some important positive milestones that threaten to be undone by President Donald Trump’s economic wrecking ball.
The number of people in the state’s labor force—nearly 5.1 million—was the highest in 23 years. And the labor force participation rate—the percentage of working-age adults employed or looking for work—returned to pre-COVID levels.
Michigan also recorded the largest number of payroll jobs in 20 years, averaging 4.5 million positions last year.
Most important, incomes rose as inflation softened and the state produced more high-wage jobs. Last year was the first year since 2020 that the average Michigan worker saw a gain in real earnings. Just 14% of jobs in the state paid $15 an hour or less, down from more than 22% in 2022.
Those numbers come from the Michigan Center for Data and Analytics, a state agency that doesn’t hesitate to publish unflattering economic data about Michigan’s economic performance.
Its annual report highlights a number of areas, including the unemployment and labor force participation rates, where Michigan lags competitor states. And the report, released in April, noted the state’s economy, while still growing, was continuing to slow in the early months of this year.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
But Trump’s chaotic implementation of tariffs and other moves by the administration could throw the state’s economy into reverse.
Detroit’s automakers have been some of the hardest-hit U.S. corporations as Trump has slapped big tariffs on almost every country in the world in an attempt to end trade deficits with the U.S. He’s tariffed countries such as Brazil and Canada where the U.S. has trade surpluses.
Ford, General Motors and Stellantis have collectively paid $2.1 billion in tariffs so far this year and expect to pay billions more by the end of 2025. They’ve largely eaten the tariffs, but analysts say they will soon have to pass a hefty chunk of those costs to consumers.
The tariffs’ hit on automakers and other employers has alarmed Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who scored a recent private meeting with Trump to discuss how the levies were hurting the Detroit Three and the state’s economy. The outcome of that meeting wasn’t disclosed, but it seems unlikely Trump will back away from what he sees as the centerpiece of his economic blueprint.
Ironically, tariffs might give some foreign automakers an advantage over the Detroit Three.
Ford Motor Co. CEO Jim Farley has complained that the 15% tariff Trump slapped on imported Japanese cars is less than the 25% tariff Detroit automakers pay on some of the vehicles and parts they import from Canada and Mexico. Trump had earlier assessed a 25% tariff on Japanese-built vehicles but lowered it as part of a broader trade agreement.
Farley told Bloomberg TV that the new tariff, combined with Japan’s lower labor and currency costs could make a Japan-built Toyota 4Runner $10,000 cheaper than a Michigan-built Ford Bronco.
Trump’s deal with Japan outraged the United Auto Workers union, which said it “hands a win to transnational automakers that rely on low-road labor practices, substandard wages, excessive (temporary workers), and union-busting.”
UAW President Shawn Fain was an early supporter of Trump’s tariff strategy, but the duties could prove costly to his members’ pocketbooks. Analysts say tariff-induced losses at the Detroit Three could cut thousands of dollars from autoworkers’ profit-sharing checks this year.
It almost seems as if Trump is rooting against the home team with his trade war.
And it’s not just automakers and large corporations that are reeling from the tariffs. Small businesses in the state are being hit as well by the levies and an overall uncertainty caused by the president’s economic policies.
A June survey of 644 small-and-medium-sized businesses, conducted by the Lansing-based Michigan Business Network, found those business owners in a gloomy mood because of tariffs, inflation and other issues.
Expectations of increases in profits, sales and investments were at their lowest points in the 16-year history of the semiannual survey, MBN founder and CEO Chris Holman said.
“We have never seen less enthusiasm by business owners for expecting increases in their revenue or profits this year because of tariffs and inflation,” Holman told Detroit Free Press business columnist and “Michigan Matters” television show host Carol Cain.
Trump, you may recall, promised to lower prices “on day one” of his administration. But inflation has remained stubbornly high.
Fewer than half of business owners surveyed said they were optimistic about how Trump’s election would favor their businesses. That’s down from 60% who were enthused about his election six months ago.
Trump has warned his sweeping economic overhaul will create a painful transition period on the way to a revitalized domestic auto industry and a “golden age of America.”
Michigan businesses and workers are feeling the pain. But they’re not so sure it’s going to subside any time soon.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/gettyimages-2208184612_0-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-18 06:56:43.885740

(Photo by Alex Kormann/Minnesota Star Tribune pool photo)In June, the assassinations of Melissa Hortman, the speaker emerita of the Minnesota House of Representatives, and her husband Mark Hortman, and the attempted murder of Minnesota State Sen. John Hoffman, his wife, Yvette, and their daughter Hope, shocked the nation.



“This isn’t just a murder case,” Acting U.S. Attorney for Minnesota, Joe Thompson told the Associated Press in July after a court hearing for 58-year-old Vance Boelter who was charged with the killing, “This is a political assassination.”





Beyond the headlines, Boelter may have a singular place in the history of bombings, arsons and assassinations that have marked the era of legal abortion in the United States: He is (allegedly) the first to kill a public official.
When Boelter was indicted on federal charges (to which he has pleaded not guilty), The New York Times reported, “Nothing revealed by the prosecutors suggests that the shooter was motivated by religious fervor.” The Times offered no other motive, but Boelter’s past, and his own words, point to a likely religious motive — like those of every other anti-abortion assassin.
The rest of us needn’t turn a blind eye to the obvious. In fact, the preservation of democracy in our time requires that we don’t.
Available evidence suggests that Boelter was thwarted early in a campaign he had been planning for as much as two years — to assassinate pro-choice Democratic elected officials, abortion providers and abortion rights advocates. No other professions or viewpoints have surfaced from among the 45-70 names reported in various media to have been found in his car and in other of his writings.
In addition to Hortman and Hoffman, the list includes other Minnesota state and federal legislators as well as U.S. Representatives from Illinois, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, Texas and Wisconsin. It also included Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan and Attorney General Keith Ellison, along with former Minnesota State Rep. Ruth Richardson, now president of Planned Parenthood of the North Central States.
  In this handout provided by Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office, Vance Luther Boelter poses for a booking photo on June 16, 2025 in Green Isle, Minnesota.
Boelter was identified by police when he had to abandon his car at the murder scene. He was on the lam for several days before he was arrested near his home in Green Isle, a town of 556 in rural Sibley County.
Academy for the End Times
The key part of Boelter’s religious history is his attendance at Christ for the Nations Institute (CFNI) in Dallas, Texas, from 1988-1990. He graduated with a Diploma in Practical Theology in Leadership and Pastoral. The school, founded in 1970, is best known for training missionaries, and for its founder Gordon Lindsay who was part of the Pentecostal Latter Rain movement, which was inspired by William Branham in 1948 in Canada. Lindsay founded the ministry Voice of Healing that year to promote Branham’s work. As Kari Lardner reported in Religion Dispatches, they were also part of the British Israelism movement:


        According to this movement, White people were the true Israel of the Bible, a belief that was pivotal to the mid-century Latter Rain revival Lindsay helped organize … In fact, Branham had been ordained into ministry by the National Imperial Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, and Lindsay had strong connections with white-supremacist networks throughout North America.    
 
Lindsay later distanced himself from Branham because of his violent antisemitic views, “though it’s unclear,” Lardner writes, “whether Lindsay ever actually recanted his views on British Israelism.” The Christian Identity movement in the U.S. informs some of the most violent white supremacist groups.
Lindsay’s post-Branham ministry became an early training school for the formation of apostolic networks — a feature of what came to be called the New Apostolic Reformation.
End Times war in the here and now
As I reported last year in Barn Raiser, the term New Apostolic Reformation (NAR) was coined in the 1990s by the late C. Peter Wagner, a professor at Fuller Theological Seminary. He and his colleagues had observed that Pentecostal and charismatic churches that operate outside of denominational structures, were the fastest growing sector of Christianity in the United States and worldwide. In this movement, Wagner saw a trend, an emerging new paradigm, that he and his close associates eventually sought to shape, organize and lead.
The NAR movement comprises loosely organized, often international networks of independent or nondenominational churches and ministries. NAR leaders believe that Christian institutions have mostly gotten it wrong for the last 2,000 years. They have sought to replace historically democratic church governance in Protestant churches with what they call “apostolic governance.” They are trying to do the same in government. To achieve this, they seek the restoration of modern-day apostles and prophets and the church of the first century, as they imagine it.
The NAR vision draws on beliefs and practices from earlier religious movements, such as Latter Rain, as well as Christian Reconstructionism, which emerged from Calvinism and helped shape the theocratic trend of the Christian Right in the 1980s and 1990s, and has become prominent in the persons of Idaho pastor Doug Wilson and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.
The NAR is spearheading an increasingly politicized movement that seeks religious and political “dominion” in the U.S. and the world. In the view of Latter Rain/NAR, many existing churches, church offices and doctrines are obstacles to advancing of the kingdom of God on Earth. In a guest sermon when he was a missionary in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Boelter’s prophecy that God will send apostles and prophets to correct the churches is consistent with this idea.
C. Peter Wagner called this obstacle the “spirit of religion.” Some apostolic leaders express this idea forcefully. Apostle Greg Hood of Franklin, Tennessee, for example, sells a T-shirt emblazoned with the quote: “We are here to put a knife to the throat of religion.”
These movements generally see themselves as part of an emerging global army engaged in an End Times war. The theater of this war is first a matter of “spiritual warfare” — organized collective prayer against demonic forces in heaven and on Earth. But important apostolic leaders warn that the theater of the war may expand — and become physical at any time.
This final force features the rise of what is variously called the “Manifest Sons of God” and “Joel’s Army” — an elite mobilization of Christians who will acquire supernatural powers and ultimately defeat Satanic forces. Accounts vary as to exactly how and when these things will unfold. But many believe it is already underway.
Heroes know which villains to kill
There’s a relationship between “spiritual warfare” and physical warfare. NAR leaders increasingly refer to Democrats, liberals, feminists and LGBTQ+ people — basically anyone with a different political, religious or gender identity — as demonic, and blame them for society’s problems. There are potential consequences for this kind of thinking.
“Social science since World War 2 and the Nazi genocide has shown that under specific conditions, virulent demonization and scapegoating can and does create milieus in which the potential for violence is increased,” Chip Berlet, a former longtime researcher with Political Research Associates, wrote in 2014. “What social science cannot do, is predict which individual upon hearing the rhetoric of clear or coded incitement will turn to violence.”
Berlet’s essay was titled “Heroes Know Which Villains to Kill: How Coded Rhetoric Incites Scripted Violence.” Indeed, villain identification has been going on for a long time, and NAR leaders have been increasingly featuring scripts for contemporary violence and religious war.
Prosecutors are so far saying Boelter acted alone. However, scholars report that those said to be “lone wolves” rarely, if ever, act entirely alone. Thus, it was intriguing when Boelter texted his family while he was on the lam: “Dad went to war last night … I don’t wanna say more because I don’t wanna implicate anybody.” Given that NAR leaders understand themselves to be in a war with secular government and other established institutions, it would not be surprising if it turns out that Boelter is not a lone vigilante warrior.
Boelter’s war
Boelter apparently kept his violent intentions to himself over the months, and perhaps as long as two years of planning his assassination campaign.
His friends have described him as religiously and politically conservative, but reserved about it.
He was less reserved while serving as a missionary in the Democratic Republic of the Congo between 2021 and 2023, where he is known to have given three sermons at La Borne Matadi, a Pentecostal church in the Atlantic seaport city of Matadi, in which he expressed views consistent with NAR thought.
In one sermon Boelter preached:


        They don’t know abortion is wrong, many churches. They don’t have the gifts flowing. God gives the body gifts. To keep balance. Because when the body starts moving in the wrong direction, when they’re one, and accepting the gifts, God will raise an apostle or prophet to correct their course.    
 
When Boelter speaks here of the body, he is evidently referencing the Body of Christ, meaning the church. In the general Latter Rain/NAR view, the Body of Christ is being transformed into an End Times army, led by apostles and prophets. Boelter added:


        God is going to raise up apostles and prophets in America, to correct his church. … Many churches in America didn’t listen to Jesus. … They’re divided. This little group here, this little group here, this little group here. … And the enemy, the devil, comes through and rips everything apart. The churches are so messed up, they don’t know abortion is wrong, many churches.    
 
In another sermon, he tells the audience that “people don’t know what sex they are” because the devil “has gotten so far into their mind and their soul.”
The idea of God sending apostles and prophets to “correct his church” is significant because of the Latter Rain/NAR idea that traditional Christian denominations, doctrines, and officers are seen as obstacles to advancing the Kingdom of God as they see it.
Diversity, equity and inclusion
CFNI (Christ for the Nations Institute) has remained a key institution in the NAR movement. Dutch Sheets, a leading apostle, graduated from CFNI and later became its executive director. According to Matthew D. Taylor of the Institute for Islamic, Christian, and Jewish Studies, “No Christian leader did more to mobilize Christians to be in DC on January 6th than Dutch Sheets,” who Taylor says helped develop “strategic-level spiritual warfare programs to mobilize charismatic evangelicals to do spiritual warfare on Trump’s behalf.” Apostle Cindy Jacobs — who helped develop the NAR’s distinct style of intercessory prayer and was present at the Capitol on January 6 guiding the nation in prayer — teaches at the Institute where she received an award in 2025. That said, this doesn’t necessarily mean that everyone involved in CFNI believes exactly the same things. What’s more, like NAR itself, CFNI’s student body has always been multiracial, multiethnic and multinational, its roots in Latter Rain/British Israelism notwithstanding.
And in fairness, the institutions with which Boelter has been affiliated have denounced and distanced themselves from his alleged crimes. These include Christ for the Nations Institute, La Borne Matadi (the Congolese Pentecostal church where he gave several sermons) and Jordan Family Church in Jordan, Minnesota, a town of 5,000, 40-miles southwest of Minneapolis where he is a member. Since Boelter’s arrest, his church has removed its sermons from the web.
It is also important to note that while Boelter’s acts may not represent those organizations, nor of the broad conservative, anti-abortion wing of Christianity, they are definitely not representative of Christianity at large. In fact, mainstream polling consistently shows that many American Christians, including most Catholics, are pro-choice. What’s more, leading denominations of mainline Protestantism have been officially pro-choice since the 1970s. These include The Episcopal Church, United Church of Christ and Presbyterian Church (USA).
Nevertheless, the religious origins of Boelter’s alleged criminal, and arguably revolutionary, mission is clear, even as some tiptoe around it. This squeamishness is typical when Christianity of any kind informs the motives of violent criminal suspects. We can assume, however, that law enforcement, politicians and the media would have been far less demure if Boelter was a Muslim.
The past is prologue
There is precedent for an anti-abortion hit list that includes government officials. Two decades ago, a web site called the Nuremberg Files listed abortion providers alongside pro-choice celebrities, government officials from both parties and federal judges, including members of the U.S. Supreme Court.
It was named for the city where the German war crimes trials were held after World War II. Site proprietor, the late Neal Horsley explained, “A coalition of concerned citizens throughout the USA is cooperating in collecting dossiers on abortionists in anticipation that one day we may be able to hold them on trial for crimes against humanity.”
Originally, the Nuremberg Files listed only abortion providers, but the list grew to comprise several hundred others who were called “abortionists” because of their political support for reproductive rights or their efforts to enforce the law to protect women needing an abortion.
“Judges and politicians who pass or uphold laws authorizing child-killing or oppressing pro-life activists: These classes of individuals,” among others, Horsley declared, “are all committing various crimes to which they should answer. We regard them all as ‘abortionists.’ ”
The site was regarded as a hit list after he began crossing out the names of murdered doctors and clinic staff after their demise; and graying the names of those who were wounded.
Pointing to the crossed-out name Dr. Barnett Slepian on his computer screen in one scene in the 2001 HBO documentary “Soldiers in the Army of God,” Horsley recalled his reaction to the murder: “When I drew a line through his name, I said ‘See, I told ya. There’s another one. How many more is it gonna take?’ ”
“The evidence is at hand,” Horsley declares. “There are people out there who [will] go out and blow their brains out.”
As I reported for Salon at the time, Horsley was involved in the Army of God, the largely underground network in whose name antiabortion violence had been carried out since the early 1980s.
In an essay titled “Understanding the Army of God,” Horsley described the enemy as a culture and a country that have fallen away from God’s laws. He therefore saw the Army of God as holy warriors engaged in “terrorist actions” because “the government of the USA has become a godless and apostate body.” Therefore, he declared, “the people who rise up in arms against such idolatry deserve the name ‘The Army of God.’ ”
The Army of God splintered in the wake of a wave of arrests, prosecutions and a massive monetary judgement by a federal court against some of its leaders. Its website is currently under construction but promises to be back. One feature of the site is a list of people incarcerated for their anti-abortion crimes, called Prisoners of Christ. It would not be surprising to see Boelter added to the list when the site is relaunched.
In any case, the idea that the government has fallen away from God’s laws and needs to be overthrown, lives on. Boelter’s inclusion of elected officials on his hit list suggests that he shares Horsley’s view of the complicity of government and government officials in abortion and tolerance of homosexuality.
Like all other known anti-abortion assassins, Boelter’s Christianity informed his alleged crimes. Here are three of his predecessors.

James Kopp assassinated abortion provider Dr. Barnett Slepian at his home in Amherst New York in 1998. Slepian had just returned from his synagogue where he had said kaddish in remembrance of his father. Kopp was a member of the itinerant Catholic-led antiabortion group, Lambs of Christ. He is also a suspect in a series of shootings across Canada.
Paul Hill assassinated abortion provider Dr. John Britton in Pensacola, Florida in 1994. Hill was an ordained minister in the evangelical Presbyterian Church in America (later defrocked) and was a graduate of Reformed Theological Seminary in Jackson, Mississippi.
Scott Roeder assassinated abortion provider Dr. George Tiller while he served as an usher during Sunday service at his Lutheran church in Wichita, Kansas in 2009. Roeder had no known previous antiabortion involvements. However, at his sentencing he read aloud from a book by Paul Hill titled, “Why Shoot an Abortionist?”

What is different about Boelter is that while abortion providers were also on the hit list, like Neal Horsley, he targeted elected officials as well. This suggests that when he texted his family that “dad’s gone to war,” his war was not just with abortion care, but the system of government that allows and protects it. Special Agent in Charge Alvin M. Winston, Sr., of FBI Minneapolis, correctly characterized Boelter’s alleged crimes “an attack on the rule of law.”
Others who have committed violence against abortion providers have held to revolutionary theocratic views of various sorts, but Boelter was allegedly the first to strike government officials. He may not be the last.

Mayday Health, a New York-based health education nonprofit, will run the ads at 104 rural gas stations through Sept. 7. The campaign started Aug. 11. 
The advertisements say “Pregnant? Don’t want to be? Learn more at Mayday Health.”
Executive director Liv Raisner said it’s crucial to advertise at gas stations, which serve as community hubs in rural areas.
“Many rural counties in West Virginia and Kentucky have few or no OB-GYN providers. Some have lost their only hospitals, their only clinics,” Raisner said. “So routine education and preventative reproductive health information is much harder to access through traditional medical channels. And so that’s why we decided to advertise at gas stations.”
The organization started after the Supreme Court overturned Roe V. Wade and the constitutional right to abortion in 2022.
“We heard this sobering statistic that only 10% of Americans even knew what abortion pills were,” Raisner said. “And with clinics closed, reproductive options became very limited for women across the United States. We knew that a massive education campaign needed to be executed to inform people that they still have options.”
According to the Guttmacher Institute, in 2023, medication abortion accounted for 63% of all abortions in the United States, up from 53% in 2020. 
In 2022, West Virginia lawmakers passed a law banning abortion with narrow exceptions. Earlier this summer, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the ban in a challenge brought by abortion pill manufacturer GenBioPro. 
Despite abortion being illegal in West Virginia in most cases, Raisner said the organization does not fear legal repercussions from the campaign. 
“We don’t have concerns about advertising because we don’t sell, distribute or package abortion pills,” they said. “We’re merely spreading First Amendment-protected free speech. So if anyone wants to come after us, what they’re coming after is the First Amendment.”
Earlier this year, Mayday Health launched a digital billboard and poster campaign in Tennessee and an aerial campaign above the Indy 500.
While abortion is mostly illegal in West Virginia, states with abortion bans may have trouble prosecuting out-of-state providers and entities mailing pills to people within their borders.
Since the Supreme Court struck down Roe V. Wade, 22 states and Washington D.C. have enacted shield laws that protect patients, providers and people assisting in abortion from the reach of states where it’s illegal, according to KFF. Some shield laws protect providers who send abortion pills to people in states with abortion bans. 
Earlier this year, the West Virginia Senate passed a bill aimed at out-of-state providers that would have made it a felony to prescribe or distribute medications used for abortion to people in West Virginia unless the abortion is legal. The bill was not taken up by the House of Delegates. 
West Virginia Attorney General J.B. McCuskey recently signed on to a letter urging Congress to ban shield laws, calling them “blatant attempts to interfere with states’ ability to enforce criminal laws within their borders.”
“People in [states with abortion bans] should be and are empowered to make their own decisions,” Raisner said. 
The website directs people to sites where they can order abortion medication.
People who visit Mayday Health are also linked to a helpline where they can get free, private advice on state specific abortion laws, they said. The group encourages website visitors to reach out to a hotline where a group of doctors provide free advice. 
Raisner said it’s also important for people to know that abortion pills are safe and effective. 
“There’s so much misinformation peddled by the anti-choice movement about the dangers of abortion pills, and it’s just not true,” Raisner said. “Abortion pills are so safe that they are even sold over the counter in some foreign countries. 
“Clinics are closing across the country, but people everywhere still have the power to make the choices that are right for their reproductive health,” they said.

Santiago/Getty Images)BILOXI, Miss. — The Trump administration is developing a powerful data tool it claims will let states identify noncitizens registered to vote. But Democratic critics and data experts warn it could allow the federal government to vacuum up vast quantities of information on Americans for unclear purposes.
Some Democratic election officials and opponents of the effort fear President Donald Trump wants to build a federal database of voters to target political opponents or cherry-pick rare examples of noncitizen voters to fuel a sense of crisis. Republican election officials allied with the president counter that he’s helping states to maintain accurate voter rolls.
The Trump administration has rolled out changes to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, tool at the same time the U.S. Department of Justice is asking states for copies of their voter rolls. The timing, combined with questions about what happens to voter data uploaded to the program, has alarmed critics.
Trump wants Congress to pass a national proof of citizenship voter registration requirement and in March tried to unilaterally impose one for federal elections through executive order. But with the legislation stalled and the order halted by the courts, the citizenship data tool may offer a backdoor way to accomplish the same goal.
SAVE was originally intended to help state and local officials verify the immigration status of individual noncitizens seeking government benefits. But U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, this spring refashioned it into a platform that can scan states’ voter rolls if election officials upload the data.
The changes to SAVE, rolled out over just a few months and with little public debate, are “tinkering with sort of the bones of democracy,” said John Davisson, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington, D.C.-based research and advocacy group that argues privacy is a fundamental right.
“You’re talking about the voting process and who will be eligible to vote,” Davisson said. “And to take a system that is not designed for use in that process and repurpose it, really on the fly, without a formal comment process, without formal rulemaking, without congressional intervention — that’s pretty anomalous and pretty alarming.”
Previously, SAVE could only search one name at a time. Now it can conduct bulk searches, allowing state officials to potentially feed into it information on millions of registered voters. SAVE checks that information against a series of federal databases and reports back whether it can verify someone’s immigration status.
Since May, it also can draw upon Social Security data, transforming the program into a tool that can confirm citizenship because Social Security records for many, but not all, Americans include the information. NPR reported earlier on changes to SAVE.
“It is incredible what has been done, really since March,” Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray, a Republican who supports proof of citizenship requirements and the SAVE tool, told a gathering of state secretaries of state in Biloxi, Mississippi, last week.
Individuals registering to vote in federal elections must already sign a statement affirming they are citizens under penalty of perjury, and those who cast a ballot face criminal penalties and deportation. One study of the 2016 election placed the prevalence of noncitizen voting at 0.0001% of votes cast.
But as Trump has spread falsehoods about elections, Republicans have made purging noncitizens from voter rolls a central focus.

Democratic concerns were on display last week at the National Association of Secretaries of State conference, held at the Beau Rivage casino-resort in Biloxi. In interviews on the sidelines of the conference, Democratic secretaries of state voiced deep reservations — or outright opposition — about plugging their voter data into SAVE.
Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said Aug. 6 that the federal government appeared to be trying to take over election administration. She formally rejected the Justice Department’s voter roll request two days later.
Bellows said the Department of Homeland Security told her in a recent phone call that it planned to retain SAVE data for 10 years for “audit purposes only.”
“Just like the [Justice Department] is asking us to hand over an electronic file of all the voters in our state, it seems like the Department of Homeland Security is through this backdoor system also asking us to share voter information about every voter in our state,” Bellows said.
At least one state appears to have granted the federal government sweeping authority over any voter data it provides to SAVE.
Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales announced in July he had reached an agreement with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to access the newly expanded system for voter list maintenance. Indiana’s agreement allows the federal agency to use information the state provides for any purpose permitted by law, including criminal prosecutions.
Morales, a Republican, said in a news release that SAVE represented “another step in safeguarding the rights” of eligible voters. His office didn’t respond to Stateline’s questions.
The Trump administration has ramped up efforts to encourage state election officials to use the expanded program. The White House hosted a bipartisan “fly in” event for state secretaries of state on July 29. Multiple secretaries of state told Stateline that USCIS Director Joseph Edlow, who was confirmed on July 15, spoke at the event.
“The president is very much keyed in on voter list maintenance,” Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, a Republican, said in an interview — echoing other GOP secretaries of state who released statements praising the Trump administration after the meeting.
Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, a Democrat who attended the meeting, said he questioned how the federal government would handle voter information provided to SAVE. He added that the Justice Department’s request for his state’s voter rolls raised his level of concern about how data would be used.
“When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances,” Simon told Stateline.
The White House referred questions about SAVE and the event to the Department of Homeland Security and USCIS.
In response to questions from Stateline, USCIS didn’t directly answer whether the agency would share voter roll data with other parts of the federal government but confirmed it disposes of records after 10 years.
“The SAVE application is a critical tool for state and local governments to access information to safeguard the integrity of elections across the country. It’s no wonder many states have quickly adopted it, and we continue to promote the tool to other states and counties not using SAVE,” USCIS spokesperson Matthew Tragesser said in a statement.
“We look forward to continued optimization efforts and implementing more updates to SAVE.”
GOP pressure
Some Republican election officials and Trump allies have long wanted the federal government to take an expanded role in searching state voter rolls for noncitizens.
Last summer the Trump-aligned litigation group America First Legal, co-founded by Trump adviser Stephen Miller, encouraged states to submit to the Department of Homeland Security the names of individuals for citizenship or immigration status verification.
Some states did just that. Texas, for example, asked USCIS to verify the citizenship of some voters in September, and Indiana asked the agency to verify 585,774 voters in October. The same month, 16 Republican state attorneys general signed a letter criticizing Homeland Security, then under the Biden administration, for failing to work with states on verification.
After Trump took office, GOP state officials kept up the pressure. Twenty-one Republican secretaries of state urged Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in February to prioritize SAVE improvements.
On April 16, Indiana sued the department in federal court for not responding to its verification request last fall. USCIS announced an overhaul of SAVE less than a week later.
As the agency continues to remake SAVE, the tool will soon allow searches using the last four digits of a Social Security number, multiple state secretaries of state told Stateline. The agency confirmed the feature is under development and will be available soon but didn’t provide an exact date.
The change would mark another significant expansion of the program because most states collect the last four digits when individuals without a driver’s license register to vote.
Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican, said SAVE represents a better way to verify citizenship than a state law requiring voters to produce documents. “I think there’s a real opportunity for us to do a lot of this through just sharing of information and I think that’s what we’re seeing happen,” McGrane said in an interview.
Unreliable data
But some voting rights advocates and experts on government data caution against an overreliance on Social Security data.
The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, a progressive policy nonprofit, has noted that Social Security only began tracking the citizenship status of all applicants in 1978 — meaning the database doesn’t include comprehensive citizenship information for older Americans. Additionally, Social Security may not always have up-to-date information on the status of naturalized U.S. citizens.
The nonpartisan Institute for Responsive Government also warned in May that since SAVE hasn’t used Social Security numbers to verify citizenship in the past, its accuracy and effectiveness are unknown. The success of the expanded SAVE program may also partially depend on whether it has adequate staff and resources, it said.
A 2017 Government Accountability Office report found that between fiscal years 2012 and 2016, about 16% of the nearly 90 million SAVE searches required additional verification, which the institute says often translates into federal workers manually checking files. Now that SAVE allows bulk searches, the need for manual checking could rise dramatically.
Nick Doctor, director of implementation at the Institute for Responsive Government, said in an interview that a tool confirming the eligibility of registered voters in a way that doesn’t burden individuals can be a good thing. But he emphasized that it depends in large measure on SAVE’s implementation.
“The changes that have been made to SAVE happened very quickly and, to my knowledge, we haven’t seen releases on the level of accuracy of that information,” Doctor said.
During interviews, Republican secretaries of state stressed that voters aren’t kicked off the rolls because SAVE can’t verify their citizenship. Instead, an inability to verify would likely trigger a follow-up process with the voter.
“Just because we get something back from the SAVE database, it’s not a cut and dry, especially on those they’re not sure about,” Hoskins, the Missouri secretary of state, said.
Election security or overkill?
Still, Arizona illustrates why some Democrats worry about any large-scale effort to ask voters — especially longtime, older residents — to prove their citizenship. After the state discovered errors in how it tracked voter citizenship dating back years, election officials are contacting some 200,000 voters seeking proof of citizenship documentation.
Some have been casting ballots for decades without incident and many feel targeted, Arizona Democratic Secretary of State Adrian Fontes said during a presentation at the state secretaries of state conference. “They feel insulted when they get that letter,” Fontes said.
Charles Stewart III, a professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies elections, said Arizona may actually point to the potential usefulness of SAVE. If Arizona runs its voter roll through the program, a list of 200,000 voters needing citizenship verification would perhaps drop into the hundreds, he suggested.
“There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside,” Stewart said.
Connecticut Democratic Secretary of State Stephanie Thomas told Stateline that every secretary wants tools to keep voter lists as clean as possible. But the details are important.
When she hears of something new, Thomas said she asks whether it’s the best option available and whether “the i’s are dotted, the t’s crossed.” She said she’s asked USCIS a series of questions about SAVE and is waiting on some responses.
“When it comes to voter lists,” Thomas said, “I don’t want Connecticut voters to be a guinea pig.”

The Town of Mason’s Board of Mayor […],"Attendees at Tuesday's meeting of the Mason, Tennessee Board of Mayor and Alderman look on from seats in the non- air conditioned  Mason Fire Department Garage. (John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)The American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee is challenging the outcome of a vote in Mason that would enter the city into a detention facility contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
The organization sent a letter to town officials Friday demanding that Mason leadership halt the contract’s execution.
The Town of Mason’s Board of Mayor and Aldermen approved a contract with private prison corporation CoreCivic to reopen the West Tennessee Detention Facility as an immigration detention center on Tuesday, voting 4-1 with two abstentions.
The town’s separate but related contract with ICE received three ayes, two nays, and two abstentions. 
Questions over the vote’s outcome surfaced immediately after the chaotic meeting concluded. Some officials reported that the vote was successful in approving the ICE contract, claiming the abstentions did not count toward the vote total and therefore the vote passed 3-2, a simple majority of the votes counted (but not the number of members present).
West Tenn. town approves CoreCivic to run immigration detention facility after chaotic meeting

But the ACLU says this is an error, according to the letter sent to the town’s mayor, recorder and an attorney who spoke on behalf of the municipality during Tuesday’s meeting. The organization stated that, according to the town’s charter, the vote should have been counted based on members present. Thus, it would need four votes out of seven total votes to pass.
“The Town of Mason Charter says any form of board action should be passed by a majority of members present if there is a quorum,” ACLU of Tennessee Policy Director Bryan Davidson said Friday. The charter also states that the board can determine its own rules, and has chosen to follow Robert’s Rules of Order.
Based on the charter, state law and Robert’s Rules, the ACLU said the contract was not approved.
“We do not believe that this contract passed, and therefore any action taken by the mayor and board of the Town of Mason to further the execution of this contract is illegal and it’s invalid,” Davidson said.
Mayor Eddie Noeman, City Recorder Lureatha Harris, and attorney Nathan Bicks could not be immediately reached for comment.
The ACLU also states that because the start date of the contract with CoreCivic is dependent on the start date of the ICE contract, the CoreCivic agreement is also void.
ACLU Tennessee Legal Director Stella Yarbrough requested a written response from town leadership within seven days of the letter’s receipt. The organization also included a request for all communication between the mayor and board members and representatives of both CoreCivic and ICE, beginning in November 2024 through present day.
“Zooming out from the procedural deficiencies, there’s a lot of questions here around the total lack of transparency in this process,” Davidson added.
The ICE contract, a 200-page document, was presented to board members as a physical copy immediately before the Tuesday vote, he said, and was not available for public review online until two days later.
The majority of people who spoke at Tuesday’s meeting opposed using the currently empty prison facility as an immigration detention center.
Eloise Thompson, whose family has roots in Mason and surrounding areas going back to the 1870s, was one of the residents to stand in opposition.
“We’re just absolutely not interested in a for-profit prison operation … at the expense of human suffering,” she said on a media call Friday. “Not only does it come down to the human suffering part, it really can eat at one’s soul to feel a part of something like that.”
The community in Mason is interested in economic growth, she said, but “moving forward in the right way and in the way that lifts those around us and lifts our community.”

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)As historic drought conditions on the Western Slope fuel another dangerous wildfire season, a new paper from researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder warns that human-caused climate change is playing a major role in making those conditions worse.
Previously published climatological research has found that the Colorado River Basin’s current “megadrought” is the worst dry spell the region has experienced in at least 1,200 years. But a new study, published last week in the journal Nature,  concludes that those persistently dry conditions are being driven by human activity “more intensely — and more directly — than previously understood,” its authors say.
Jeremy Klavans and Pedro DiNezio of CU Boulder’s Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences worked with other scientists from around the country to model how global climate patterns affect rainfall across the U.S. southwest.

Their findings concern a climate pattern known as the Pacific decadal oscillation. Related to the better-known El Niño-La Niña cycle to the south, the PDO is a natural fluctuation that brings warm water to the northeastern Pacific Ocean near the U.S. West Coast during its “positive” phase, leading to more storms and higher-than-average rainfall. During its “negative” phase, however, cooler water and air temperatures result in less precipitation in Western states.
Despite typically reversing itself every one or two decades, the PDO has been “stuck” in the negative, dry phase since the 1990s. By analyzing more than 500 climate model simulations developed by climatologists around the world, the study’s authors were able to paint the clearest picture yet of the influence of human activity on the PDO, and the resulting Southwestern megadrought.
“All of them had this common signal when we averaged them together,” DiNezio said in an interview. “By having so many simulations, we could be absolutely sure that this was not an artifact of a single model, or of a subset of simulations.”
Severe drought conditions have persisted in the Colorado River Basin since 2000, putting increased stress on the water supplies relied on by about 40 million people in Colorado and six other Western states. Water levels in two key reservoirs, Lake Mead and Lake Powell, have fallen to record lows in recent years.










What's important here is that we're showing that rainfall has also been influenced by humans, in addition to just evaporation ... Both contribute to drought.


– Pedro DiNezio, researcher with CU Boulder's Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences


Rising levels of greenhouse gases, mostly the result of fossil-fuel combustion, have caused much of western Colorado and neighboring states in the Colorado River’s Upper Basin to warm by an average of more than 4 degrees Fahrenheit above pre-industrial levels, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration data.
Prior research has attributed about 40% of the post-2000 megadrought to higher temperatures alone, as hotter weather leads to greater evaporation of moisture from water surfaces and soils. Modeling global warming’s precise impacts on rainfall patterns has proved more elusive, but DiNezio said the new research “add(s) more human influence to that previous number.”
“What’s important here is that we’re showing that rainfall has also been influenced by humans, in addition to just evaporation,” he said. “Both contribute to drought.”
Colorado and other states that are parties to the 103-year-old Colorado River Compact have negotiated for years over how to distribute the cuts to water use made necessary by the basin’s ongoing drought. The federal Bureau of Reclamation on Friday announced another year of reduced water allocations for the Lower Basin states of Arizona and Nevada.
Not long ago, the possibility that the Pacific decadal oscillation would eventually reverse itself offered hope that the long-term drought outlook for the U.S. Southwest wasn’t as bad as it seemed. Instead, evidence now suggests the last two decades are the region’s “new normal.”
“I was a Ph.D. student in 2012, and there was a consensus that eventually (the PDO) was going to flip,” DiNezio. “We had a big El Niño in 2015, and there was this idea that El Niño will flip the PDO back to the opposite, rainfall-producing phase. And we had that big El Niño event, and the PDO remained stuck. We just had an El Niño event in 2023 … and (it) also didn’t flip the PDO.”
“That’s the most important implication of  our findings,” he added. “That this drought is here to stay, unless we we do something about rising temperatures and global warming.”

(Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)In the quiet corners of Idaho — Bonner and Boundary counties — where neighbors wave from passing cars and acknowledging neighbors still matters, something unsettling has taken root. The handshake, once a symbol of trust, is now shadowed by ideological scorecards. A new playbook is unfolding, and the rules are being written in rooms most Idahoans will never enter.
The stories of Republicans Rep. Mark Sauter and Sen. Jim Woodward are not isolated tales of political contest. They are warnings. Warnings of what happens when conscience is punished, and control becomes the highest value.
 Manufactured dissent and the illusion of betrayal

Take the Bonner County Republican Central Committee’s vote of no confidence in Sauter. Was it about performance? Principle? Or was it a choreographed act of party purification— a signal to those who think for themselves that deviation will be punished?
Sauter supported education funding, common-sense health care provisions, and resisted attempts to censor libraries. Woodward stood firm on abortion exceptions, budget transparency and a consistent approach to civic policy. Yet both were vilified. Not by the general public, but by operatives who frame moderation as betrayal.
“This is not about public service — it’s about ideological obedience.”
 The machinery behind the message

These attacks don’t form in daylight. They emerge from back rooms and obscure donor rolls. The Idaho Freedom Foundation and its affiliate Idaho Freedom Action function as ideological enforcers — not just issuing policy positions, but publishing scorecards, endorsing primary challengers and drowning elections in hyperbole.
Behind them stand shadow networks like Donors Trust and the State Policy Network — national groups that shield billionaire backers and fund far-right campaigns across the country. Their goal isn’t better Idaho policy. It’s control. If a candidate like Sauter or Woodward won’t follow the script, the machine finds someone who will — and funds them to the hilt.
I call that “dark money governance,” and that’s exactly what it is — unelected influence in a state that prides itself on sovereignty.
 Ideology over Idaho

The talking points? “Freedom.” “Choice.” “Constitutional conservatism.” But the actions tell another story — defunding public education, dismantling social services and redirecting taxpayer dollars to private interests.
Scott Herndon’s campaign against Woodward was a case study in distortion: twisting nuanced votes into political grenades, vilifying civility as weakness. Now the same tactics are being aimed at Sauter: cherry-picked votes framed as betrayals, balanced decisions distorted into dogma.
In past editorials on political extremism I called this what it truly is: “ideological colonization.” The scripts aren’t written in Idaho — they’re imported.
 The cost of conscience

And still, these men stand. Woodward didn’t hide from his critics — he met them, clarified his views and continued serving. Sauter ran without the local GOP’s endorsement — and won. Neither man surrendered principle for praise.
They remind us of what governance used to mean: showing up, listening, deciding with care. It isn’t always flashy, but it’s real. It’s Idaho.
As it has been said before, “Leadership isn’t loud — it’s loyal to the people, not the platform.”
 A call to clarity

Idaho now faces a choice. Not between left and right, but between reality and rhetoric. Will we elevate those who serve quietly and thoughtfully? Or will we hand the reins to operatives who answer only to distant donors and unforgiving dogma?
The attacks on Mark Sauter and Jim Woodward are more than politics — they are philosophical ruptures. We must decide whether our communities deserve representatives who think and feel — or only those who comply.
Let us not confuse volume with virtue. The loudest voices may not speak for the people — they may speak for the strings being pulled behind them.
And in that clarity, we just might reclaim the Idaho we know.

(Photo: Cassandra Stephenson)West Tennessee Healthcare is piloting a new technology that uses artificial intelligence to help case managers prevent patients from being kept in the hospital longer than necessary.
The nonprofit health care system will test Dragonfly Navigate, a product designed by Franklin-based AI technology company Xsolis to streamline administrative decisions between a patient’s hospital admission and discharge.
West Tennessee Healthcare serves around half a million West Tennesseans, including residents in rural areas, and began construction of a new Bolivar Hospital in July. WTH has used other Xsolis products since 2022. 
The new workflow technology uses artificial intelligence (AI) and real-time data from the hospital to model whether a patient can be discharged and where they should go after leaving the hospital (a skilled nursing facility, home, or to long-term care, for example).
“When a patient is in the hospital longer than what the model is predicting, then it alerts the (case manager) to go back into the case to look to see what’s stopping the patient from being discharged,” Xsolis CEO and founder Joan Butters said.
Barriers can include uncompleted testing, X-rays, treatments, doctor signatures and more. The workflow technology aims to help case managers quickly identify these needs without manually combing through clinical data and documentation.
“Our models are not meant to replace the clinical determination or the clinical expertise of the people that are using our solutions,” Butters said. “We are simply ensuring that they can get to that answer more efficiently.”

Debbie Ashworth, executive director of care management for West Tennessee Healthcare, said in a statement that the workflow will complement clinical expertise and “supports more proactive discharge planning, which will give my teams more time to focus on addressing patient needs.”
Starting discharge planning early helps cut down on extra time spent in the hospital due to logistics. If a patient is being discharged to a skilled nursing facility, for example, pre-planning can ensure there is a bed ready for that patient when they are cleared to leave the hospital, Butters said.
This can save the hospital, health insurance companies, and the patient money, she said.
“Every day a patient is in the hospital more than they need — an extra day — that costs the hospital, on average, about $3,000 a day,” Butters said. “If a hospital has 10,000 discharges and 20% of their patients remain in the hospital one day more than they need to, that’s millions of dollars … that they’ve lost … and that bed’s not available for new patients to come in as well.”
The workflow also helps cut out “a lot of the friction and the back-and-forth” between healthcare providers and insurance companies, she added. 
Patients may also see benefits.
“The longer that a patient stays in the hospital inappropriately, there’s higher risk of complications, increased risk of hospital-acquired infections, and higher risk of readmissions,” Butters said.
Xsolis’ AI models are retrained every quarter to adjust them to new conditions and patient populations. The company also goes through a series of annual audits covering data, system and physical security.

Missouri lawmakers are poised to return to Jefferson City next month to redraw the state’s eight congressional districts in order to gerrymander the Kansas City-based seat of Democratic U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver. They’re also considering changes to the initiative petition process to make it harder for Missourians to change the state constitution. 
Both have been longtime priorities of the Freedom Caucus, a group of hard-right GOP state lawmakers whose quarrels with party leaders led to years of Missouri Senate gridlock.
Yet after years of holding outsize sway in Missouri politics, the Senate Freedom Caucus is down to only two members.

State Sen. Rick Brattin, a Harrisonville Republican and former caucus chairman, quit in June following a break with the group over a $1.5 billion incentive package to finance stadiums for the Chiefs and Royals. 
State Sen. Brad Hudson of Cape Fair, who also voted in favor of the stadium bill, soon joined him. He told The Independent last week that his differences with the caucus focused on tactics, not policy. 
“I’ve got nothing but respect for my friends in the Freedom Caucus,” Hudson said.
The departures mean only two state senators from St. Charles County — Nick Schroer and Adam Schnelting — are still aligned with the Freedom Caucus. 
Schroer, who took over as caucus chairman after Brattin stepped down, insists the group is “stronger than ever” despite the loss of half its Senate membership. 
There are 11 members of the caucus in the House, Schroer said, and numerous candidates likely to join the group who are running in GOP primaries for open Senate seats next year. Not to mention, he said, Missouri’s secretary of state and two congressmen are Freedom Caucus alums. 
“I’m not concerned whatsoever that at this moment we only have two very strong senators,” he said. “And I think those numbers are going to grow. But just like in years past, there are going to be senators who may not be wearing the Freedom Caucus insignia, but they are going to be with us on 99.9% of issues.”
But the caucus’ dwindling numbers in the Senate, where its influence was always most acutely felt, has some wondering if its days in the center of the Missouri political spotlight are drawing to a close. 
Freedom Caucuses push for conservative state laws, but getting attention is their big success

It began in 2018, when a group of GOP senators formed what they called the conservative caucus. 
The group’s formation set off an escalating war with Republican leadership that culminated four years later when acrimony became so bad that the Senate adjourned a day early for the first time since a fixed adjournment date was set in the state constitution in 1952.
Soon after, the conservative caucus announced it was disbanding. 
A year later, six Republican senators — most of whom were part of the conservative caucus — announced the formation of the Missouri Freedom Caucus.  
And the Republican civil war resumed almost immediately. 
The 2023 legislative session saw Freedom Caucus members using near-daily procedural maneuvers to gum up the Senate. Republican leadership responded by stripping caucus members of committee assignments and musing about their expulsion. 
The 2024 session saw no improvement, resulting in fewer bills passed than any year in living memory, including the COVID-shortened session in 2020. 
Throughout the turmoil, the group kept losing members. 
State Sen. Cindy O’Laughlin, a Shelbina Republican, quit in 2021, telling The Independent at the time that she grew tired of the group’s disruptive tactics. She went on to become majority leader and president pro tem of the Senate, routinely squabbling with her former caucus colleagues. 
GOP state Sen. Jill Carter of Granby left the group last year, saying she could no longer in good conscience be a part of “actions behind the scenes that defame grassroots and violate the needs of my constituents.”
Tensions in the Senate cooled this year, with term limits pushing key figures on both sides of the fight out of the chamber. The detente led to a much more productive session, marked more by partisan squabbling than GOP infighting. 
Deal to pay for Chiefs, Royals stadiums fractures Missouri Freedom Caucus

That changed after Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe called lawmakers back into special session in June to pass incentives aimed at keeping the Chiefs and Royals from moving to Kansas. 
The Freedom Caucus vowed to oppose the funding scheme, which it decried as a “handout to billionaire sports team owners.” But Brattin and Hudson voted in support of the plan after a provision was added making changes to local property tax bills.
Both were accused of betraying the caucus’ principles, with the group’s longtime political adviser publicly calling for the Freedom Caucus to “disband and join the uniparty that runs Jefferson City.”
Brattin quit soon after, saying he opposed the stadium funding but voted in favor after the property tax provisions were added that he believed would benefit his constituents. 
Hudson quit a month later. 
“I agree with the caucus probably on 95% of the issues,” Hudson said, “and I intend to continue to be allies with them and work with them on issues that we agree on. There have been some times where tactically, there may have been some disagreements where I may have wanted to go a different direction.”
Schroer said the fact that the legislature is poised to debate a congressional map that seeks to eliminate the Democratic-leaning seat in Kansas City shows the Freedom Caucus is anything but dead. 
“Back in 2022, the Freedom Caucus pushed for a 7-1 map and couldn’t get enough Republicans to help us,” he said. “Now we’re going to do it.”
The overarching goal, he said, is that the Freedom Caucus will pull the party to the right so the caucus will no longer need to exist at all. 
“When we’ve got enough of these strong-willed conservatives that are able to stand up to the establishment and stand up to special interest groups, hopefully at that point we’ll have a majority of the majority,” he said, “ and there will be no need for the Freedom Caucus.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/040925_schroer1-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-08-18 06:56:43.885740

(Emily Previti/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)Across Pennsylvania, counties and providers of essential human services are bracing for what many fear will be a protracted state budget standoff in Harrisburg that’s already nearly seven weeks past the deadline. 
For many, it’s bringing up fears of another impasse like in 2015, when lawmakers went nine months without finalizing a spending plan. 
While most Pennsylvanians won’t have noticed any change in their day-to-day lives so far, for some of the most vulnerable people in the state, that may soon change. That’s because, until a budget is signed by Gov. Josh Shapiro, state payments for county-run services — like child welfare enforcement, senior citizen care, county health department programming, and more — are effectively on hold.
So, county governments are beginning to dip into their reserves. Now, officials and the nonprofits they contract with are rushing to develop contingency plans for when those run dry.
According to reporting by Spotlight PA, more than $2.5 billion in state payments for education and human services will be delayed in the coming weeks if lawmakers don’t come to an agreement.
“We’re hearing somewhere around the middle of next month as being the time some counties may run out of those reserves,” said Kyle Kopko, executive director of the County Commissioners Association of Pennsylvania. “Some may be before that. Some may be after. There’s going to be a lot of these human services that they’re mandated to provide, and if that’s the case, county commissioners are going to have to start looking at where they can move that money around.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
For many counties, that will mean a temporary stop or reduction in some social services. For others, it could mean taking out loans against expected tax payments, which come with interest that won’t be covered by the state when a budget is eventually passed and signed into law.
“In October, if we get that far and there’s still not a state budget, there’s going to be some real financial pressures for counties,” Kopko said.
But some won’t be able to wait that long. While most have not had to disrupt services yet, the longer the budget stalemate drags out, the more likely that becomes. And for many county officials and service providers, the current impasse brings back memories of the longest in recent memory in 2015. It lasted nine months, and led to many cuts in services and loans that, in some cases, providers are still paying back.
For instance, the Pennsylvania Council of Children, Youth and Family Services represents agencies and nonprofits that contract with counties to provide child and family services. They help recruit foster families, get those families’ homes ready to take kids, staff group homes, and more. Collectively, they employ more than 12,000 people. 
While some receive money from federal sources like Medicaid, President and CEO Terry Clark says about 90% are paid or reimbursed for their work by counties. As it stands, those counties may soon be unable to pay them.
“Some of those providers, they’re going to continue to work, regardless of whether the county or the state is paying them,” Clark said. “They have to. They have to be there for those kids and families.”
While most child service providers have not had to dip into reserves yet, it’s been a scramble to figure out what they’re going to do if the budget impasse drags out any longer. That may mean cutting their workforce, temporarily lowering pay, halting some services, or foregoing pay altogether until the stalemate in Harrisburg is resolved. 
It could also lead to a situation that counties also face – taking out loans, with interest that won’t be covered by the state. Clark says some of the contractors he represents are still repaying loans taken out during the 2015 impasse. Back then, he says, more than 100 service providers had to borrow over $172 million.
“Some people, to get that loan, had to put up their personal property,” Clark said. “That’s pretty sad when you might have to have a nonprofit CEO take out a loan on their home and know that they’re never going to get reimbursed [for the interest].”
During that nine-month impasse, Clark was working on the government side, as a county administrator in York County.  He remembers what it was like having to triage social services, figure out how they could shift around funds, and take out loans on the county side.
“The biggest lesson I learned is a lot of these nonprofits, they just don’t have a lot of money sitting there waiting,” he said. “They don’t have a slush fund or rainy day fund like the government has.”
Janine Maust is the executive director of Aging Services Inc., a private nonprofit that partners with Indiana County to provide services for seniors. They provide free meals for seniors, help them with bathing, provide in-home services for some who can’t travel, and offer an emergency button service in case of falls or other health issues.
Since the June 30 deadline for Pennsylvania to implement a budget, her organization has implemented a spending freeze. Except for covering operating costs, like keeping the lights on, and paying employees and providers, they’re unable to spend additional funds. 
That has led to cutting back on social events they hold for seniors, or at least finding ways to hold events at little to no cost. It has also meant a growing waiting list for services. While the wait list began last April, it’s been growing and being exacerbated by the impasse.
“If we’re flat-funded, those waiting lists are going to continue,” Maust said. “We need money above what we’re allocated to take people off a waiting list.” 
Already, Maust said her organization is dipping into reserves, and looking at the possibility of taking out a credit line, the interest on which they’ll be responsible for without state help. She expects it will be around two to three months until that becomes a necessity.
“Once the budget is passed and signed by the governor, it takes probably 45 to 60 days to get the money to come in,” Maust said. That could mean, even if a budget passed, they may still have to take a loan.
“We’ll have to pay interest on that, and we’ll have to use dollars to do that that could be spent on older adults,” she added.
According to Brian Bornman, executive director of the Pennsylvania Children and Youth Administrators Associations, some service providers that work with vulnerable kids and the families that care for them, are already seeing cuts to their pay,
“Generally what I’m hearing is some are already starting to provide reduced payments to providers,” Bornman said. “It may start that month one, they’re paying 80% of the invoice, and then 60%, and on down.”

Bornman says that’s in part that’s because, while lawmakers and their staff will continue to be paid as a standoff continues, counties will not receive state funds that are typically directed to providers of child welfare services and other mandatory, county-run programs.
“One can go down a cynical road there, if they were so inclined,” Bornman said.
However, he stressed, while some programs may be cut, when it comes to crucial services like child protective programs, work will continue, regardless of what happens in Harrisburg.
“If you have concerns that any child is being abused, continue to call as you normally would, because those services are going to be continued,” Bornman said. “The child welfare workforce is incredibly dedicated, and the counties are extremely committed to making sure the kids are protected.”
Following safety net services, schools will likely be the next to feel the squeeze. Though, for now, many are able to operate as usual.
The Pottstown School District is an example.
“The reality is school districts get a decent amount of funding from real estate tax revenues, which are all coming in right now, said Pottstown Superintendent Stephen Rodriguez, superintendent of the Pottstown School District. “Nevertheless, the short term effects are negligible. The long-term effects are detrimental. So we would like for there to be a budget.”
Matt Vannoy, the vice president of the Pennsylvania School Boards Association and a school board director for Sharon City School District, said in a public meeting last week that, while many school districts have enough funds to last for several months, some will have to take action as soon as next month.

Those  districts, he said, may have to take out loans, with interest costs that will be passed to taxpayers, or delay purchases of things like textbooks, electronics, classroom supplies and other materials.
“Ultimately that trickles down,” he said of costs borne by school districts to offset a delay of state funds. “You’re hurting kids and you’re impacting your instructional programs.”
Vannoy said his own school district  is “not in a terrible spot as of today,” and has enough funding to last for four or five months.
Spokespeople for Gov. Shapiro and House Majority Leader Matt Bradford (D-Montgomery) did not respond to requests for comment. 
A spokesperson for Senate President Pro Tempore Kim Ward (R-Westmoreland) sent a statement.
“The Senate passed a responsible short-term budget that immediately released funding for schools, nursing homes and human services,” she said. “Gov. Shapiro and House Democrats blocked that deal. Any cuts in services to schools, nursing homes, hospitals, and essential services lies with Gov. Shapiro and House Democrats to answer as to why they are holding the funds hostage.”
While the Democratic-led House rejected a stop-gap budget passed by the Republican-controlled Senate earlier this month, the House also passed a budget bill in July, which stalled in the Senate.
Leaders of both parties have blamed the other for the impasse, while emphasizing negotiations continue.
Mass transit agencies across the commonwealth are also feeling the squeeze, with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA), the state’s largest transit authority, set to begin a 20% service cut later this month. They say deeper cuts will follow if the state does not increase their funding. 
Other transit agencies in urban, rural and suburban areas have said they would have to cut services as well if a budget with increased funding isn’t agreed to soon..",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Shamokin3-1024x742.jpeg,,,2025-08-18 08:56:48.562036

(Kentucky Lantern photo by David Stephenson)SHELBYVILLE – A local church is urging its members to permanently remove books from the Shelby County Public Library by checking them out and never returning them. The books portray gay characters and historical figures or explore LGBTQ+ themes.
Pamela Wilson Federspiel, who has been director of the library in downtown Shelbyville for 34 years, says the action is tantamount to “stealing.”
But three leaders of the Reformation Church of Shelbyville defend what they call an “act of civil disobedience.”
  Austin Keeler
“Yes — we have urged Christians, both locally and across the country, to search their libraries for books that promote sodomy, gender confusion and rebellion against God — and if found, to check them out and never return them as an act of civil disobedience,” pastors Jerry Dorris and Tanner Cartwright and Austin Keeler, an evangelist with the church mission, Reformation Frontline Missions, recently told the Lantern in an email.
The library has “lost” 16 books valued at $410.85 since a member of the church checked them out last year with due dates in late June 2024, said Federspiel. Some of the books were written for children, some for adults. (The list of books is at the bottom of this story.)
Federspiel did not identify the library patron and said the books were never returned after several notices.
The titles include “The Art of Drag,” “My Two Moms” and “My Two Dads.”
Chris Hartman of Louisville, executive director of the Fairness Campaign, said he has never considered “theft to be a form of civil action.”
He also said he has never heard of a church encouraging its members “to steal from a public institution. It is shameful, unfortunate and disrespectful.”
Such activity often backfires by making people, especially young people, curious about the books and giving them more attention, he said.
  Author Sarah Prager
Sarah Prager of Boston wrote one of the 16 books the Shelby County Public Library has “lost.” It is called “Kind Like Marsha: Lessons from LGBTQ+ Leaders”  and  is for juveniles. Amazon.com says it celebrates 14 LGBTQ+ people throughout history, like politician Harvey Milk, scientist and painter Leonardo da Vinci, Mexican artist Frida Kahlo and Marsha P. Johnson, who took care of her trans community on the streets of New York City.
“My book is not about sexual acts. It is about real, caring people — and what is wrong about that? A library must always have a diverse inventory.  We can never let that change,” Prager said.
Complaints about books increase
The church posted its recommendation to check out certain library books and not return them in a 2 minute, 57 second video on its Facebook page on June 1, 2024.  Church leaders said recently their message has not changed.
“Friends, the Shelby County Public Library is promoting the vile LGBTQ agenda to groom and trans children in Kentucky,” a script accompanying the video says.
“Would you help us expose what’s happening here?” it asks before providing contact information for two library officials and listing books the church found objectionable. 
Complaints about books to public libraries are not new but are growing in Kentucky and the United States. There were 302 challenges to Kentucky public libraries in 2024, up from only 26 in 2023, according to the state Department of Libraries and Archives annual Statistical Report of Kentucky Public Libraries released in April.
But rare, if ever, is the practice condoned by the Shelbyville church for making books disappear from the shelves. 
“Strategically checking out books with no plans to return them as a method of permanently removing certain books from local public libraries is not a common practice, at least not one that has been reported to KDLA,” said Jill Midkiff, a spokesperson for the  Kentucky Education and Labor Cabinet and the Kentucky Department for Libraries and Archives (KDLA).
  Suzanne Trimel
PEN America, based in New York, tracks book bans and fights censorship across the country. Spokesperson Suzanne Trimel said she has never heard of the  book-removal tactic recommended by the Shelbyville church, though some conservative churches have urged members to seek public office to be in a position to censor LGBTQ+ books. She’s also heard of hiding controversial books where they aren’t likely to be found on library shelves
PEN America has seen censorship activities in public schools and public libraries intensify, she said, as public libraries have responded to pressure by canceling author visits and drag story hours. 
Trimel said public libraries also have been under pressure from the “Hide the Pride” campaign, largely led  by a conservative Catholic advocacy organization called CatholicVote.  In 2022, the leaders of CatholicVote estimated 50 to 100 libraries were targeted for “Hide the Pride.” 
The campaign instructs parents to go to the children’s section of a public library and check out all “Pride Month” books on the display shelves. The parents return the books on time but place them on other shelves out of reach of children.
The Reformation Church of Shelbyville does not return controversial books removed from the Shelby County library.
The church’s stance
Pastor Dorris said the church became aware of the controversial books when a member took their children to the library and the “children were exposed to some of them. Upon investigation they discovered the remaining books.”
Like librarian Federspiel, Dorris declined to identify the patron. He said the family did not want any public attention. Records of books checked out by patrons of public libraries are not subject to Kentucky’s Open Records Act, said Amye Bensenhaver, co-founder and co-director of the Kentucky Open Government Coalition.

Dorris said he is uncertain where the checked-out books are now. “They have not been destroyed to my knowledge.”
He said his independent church, which “shepherds 357 souls,” is taking a “public stand against sexual perversion being pushed upon children through taxpayer-funded institutions.” It will continue to take that stand without apology, he said.
“This is not literacy — it’s grooming,” Dorris said.
Asked about the removal of public property, Dorris said, “We reject the idea that civil rebellion is only legitimate when it’s done with rainbow flags or Marxist slogans. Civil disobedience is a biblical category when obedience to God and love for neighbor demand it.”
 Dorris said that when the church discovered the controversial materials in the local library, it contacted Shelby County’s state senator and representative. It also contacted the library’s staff and its board members “to express our deep concern and call for action.”
“No library staff or board member ever followed up with us, no request has been made for the return of these books, and — tellingly — the books themselves have not been replaced. Not that we would return them — but the silence itself speaks volumes,” said Dorris.
Matt Burgin, president of the library’s board of trustees, said Federspiel told the board about the situation but no one else has ever contacted him about the books.
The library has handled it like other cases of overdue books, he said.

Dorris said he did talk to then-state Sen. Adrienne Southworth, R-Lawrenceburg, but he would not divulge their conversation. She could not be reached for comment. State Rep. Jennifer Decker, R-Waddy, did not return phone calls to her Frankfort office seeking comment.
Dorris stressed that the book action is not a formal position of the Reformation Church and “not every member of our church is aware of and agrees with these actions, and that’s acceptable. We don’t discipline or pressure members over strategy. These actions — like the permanent removal of library books — were taken by individual Christians under personal conviction. We support their right to act or refrain in good conscience.”
The library’s stance
The 16 books director Federspiel says are “lost” due to the efforts of the Reformation Church range in cost from $19.99 to $35.
The library offers a variety of books for a diverse community, she said. “All are library property.”
Library materials that are not returned are not available for other patrons, said Federspiel, who declined to have her photo taken for this article. “The library is committed to providing materials that meet patron needs. Materials that are not returned are not available for other patrons. Replacing lost material is costly.”
Amanda Perry-Davis, the library’s collection manager, said the library acquires books generally based on their popularity. That can be determined by various book reviews, journals and magazines. Library professional journals recommended the “lost books” as appropriate titles for each age level.
Patrons also suggest specific books to acquire, said Perry-Davis.
Federspiel, who is retiring at the end of the year, said several staffers also provide their input on what books to buy but the final decision is hers.
Federspiel said that most of the “lost books” had not been in high demand by library patrons.
  Shelby County Public Library, Aug. 5, 2025. (Kentucky Lantern photo by David Stephenson)
The library left a voicemail message with the patron about the overdue books and issued three other notices before turning the matter over to a collection agency, Unique Management, after 60 days, she said. The replacement cost is added to the patron’s card but so far the books remain missing.
Church has other targets besides library
The church has engaged in more public protests, including against a now closed Shelbyville bar and a fall fundraiser in Cynthiana in which people dress up as witches.
The church protested The Barrel Room, formerly a bar in downtown Shelbyville, for holding drag shows and the city’s conference center for allowing “drag queens to dance in front of children.”The church branded Cynthiana “a hotbed of witchcraft” in response to the Harrison County seat’s Witches’ Day Out event. 
“These displays grieve the heart of God and signal our community’s descent into spiritual decay,” said Pastor Dorris. “We do not hate the men who perform in drag, nor the librarians, nor the critics who accuse us of being hateful. We love them enough to tell the truth — that Jesus Christ is Lord, that sin leads to hell, and that the gospel alone can set people free.”
 The Barrel Room closed in October. Vicki Jones Lee, a local gay rights advocate, said she saw several drag shows there. “We would hear the protesters outside, making a lot of noise. The shows would just go on,” she said.
A spokesperson for the conference center said the center became the site for a Pride event in the summer of 2023 “to help it find a public venue.

James Smith, executive director of the Cynthiana-Harrison County Chamber of Commerce, said “Witches Day Out” is part of the community’s annual Halloween festivities. Participants dress like witches and try to raise money for a needy cause such as helping a family whose child had brain cancer
“It’s not a cult, it’s not a religion. Cynthiana’s Witches Day Out is a fun, community event with 130-plus vendors, food, readings, and a Victorian seance-themed Crystal Ball on the first Saturday in September in downtown Cynthiana to kick off the fall season,” said committee member Sam Lunger.
“But it is disappointing to hear anyone say it involves witchcraft. Everyone is entitled to free speech but this is misleading and out of bounds. We do provide a free space for the church protesters.”
Drag shows and witches are taboo to the church but it has given most attention to books.
Consequences
Dorris, the pastor, expects “some sort of reaction against the church” for its book removal efforts but does not know exactly what that will be.
“We know there will be consequences for saying what others are afraid to say. We will not be silent. We will not comply. We will not flinch. Our duty is to God, and our aim is the good of our neighbors — even those who revile us,” he said.
Madison Markham, a staff member on PEN America’s Freedom to Read team, said, “The alarming rise of book bans and censorship in the country is and will continue to have devastating consequences in our communities in the years to come.
“Regardless of whether you are a student, a parent, a librarian, an author, or a community member, this is an issue that affects all of us. Access to books with LGBTQ+ representation helps LGBTQ+ people and their families feel seen, and builds empathy. Everyone deserves the right to read and to be exposed to diverse ideas and experiences.”
Mark Adler, director of the Paris-Bourbon County Public Library and last year’s winner of the Kentucky Public Library Association’s Intellectual Freedom Award, acknowledges that community members have the right to voice their concerns about materials in a public library but suggested it be channeled through a reconsideration request.
Each individual library has its own reconsideration process, as each community is unique in its makeup just as the local library collections are, he said. “These reconsideration requests provide an avenue for community members to file objections while also providing a structured, consistent process for libraries to follow when requests are filed. We encourage community members who have questions to bring those directly to their local libraries so we can work with the affected citizens to address their concerns.”
Shelby County’s Federspiel concurred, adding a public library should always celebrate books for all kinds of people.
In 1903, when Andrew Carnegie built the library in Shelbyville and donated $10,00 to it  “he had inscribed on the floor as you enter …  ‘A University for the People,’ showing his dedication to unite communities,” she said.
“To this day, we proudly honor these words by acquiring acquisitions that celebrate both inclusiveness and diversity of our community.”

Mike Kehoe discusses the 2025 legislative session with reporters in his Capitol office on May 16 (Jason Hancock/Missouri Independent).Once upon a time, Missouri Republicans were proud to declare their independence from Washington, D.C., and anyone associated with it.
During Barack Obama’s administration, they authorized specialty “Don’t Tread on Me” license plates, decorated with the Gadsden Flag. A lot of red states have those now, but Missouri was a trendsetter.
Lawmakers were also fond of floating bills with “freedom” in the name. There was, for instance, a “light bulb freedom act,” a protest against federal energy regulations.
More recently, Republicans rammed through the Second Amendment Preservation Act, which tries to make it illegal to enforce federal gun laws in Missouri. It is unwise legislation that immediately ran into legal challenges, but it did reflect Republicans’ vaunted defiance.
I didn’t like any of those bills, but I kind of miss the defiance — now that so many Missouri Republicans have become quivering, gelatinous flunkies for Donald Trump.  
We are about to find out just how subservient our state’s leaders have become. Some time soon, Gov. Mike Kehoe is expected to announce if he will call a special session to redistrict the state’s U.S. Congressional districts. 
Most people are expecting he will. Of course he will. President Trump told him to. 
Missouri governor won’t confirm redistricting, but Republicans say it’s likely

In a bid to eke out every advantage for Republicans in the 2026 midterm elections, Trump is leaning on states with Republican governors and legislatures to redraw their Congressional districts now, instead of waiting for the next Census count, as is traditional in most states.
Kehoe felt cowed enough by Trump and his followers to do an about face on the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election. So he seems an unlikely prospect to withstand pressure from the leader now.
The aim of a special session would be to gerrymander Missouri’s Congressional districts so that Democrats have a reasonable chance of winning only one of eight. Right now two seats are obtainable for Democrats.
The likeliest scenario would be to distort the lines of the 5th Congressional District, currently held by Democrat U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, to encompass more Republican-leaning territory. Jackson County would likely be split into two or possibly three districts, and the now-compact 5th District would stretch farther into mid-Missouri. 
This is a terrible idea. Republicans know that. They passed on extensive gerrymandering three years ago when they looked at redistricting Congressional districts after the 2020 Census. Saner lawmakers argued that such a radical redrawing of the lines would invite expensive court challenges and possibly dilute Republican strength in the districts they consider safe.
All that is still the case. But some things are different since the legislature preserved the 6-2 Congressional map in 2022. 
Since then, Missourians voted to make abortion legal and Republicans in Jefferson City have taken steps to reinstate the ban that the people overturned. Missourians, by a hefty margin, voted for paid sick leave for workers. The legislature’s Republican majority overturned that. For good measure, they also weakened a voter-approved minimum wage increase.
People’s attitudes toward a legislature that doesn’t respect their votes are toxic now. As a Jackson County resident, I can tell you that a gerrymandering scheme to hand one of Missouri’s Democratic strongholds over to Republican congressional representatives will poison relationships with Jefferson City for years to come.
Kehoe has said he feels a responsibility to “keep the (U.S.) House in Republican control.” 
What about his responsibility to his state and his constituents? Is his calling to Missouri or is it to Trump?
This foolish redistricting scheme, it should be said, is purely a defensive crouch for Kehoe and Missouri Republicans — a way to avoid incurring the wrath of Trump and the MAGA multitudes.
There will be no actual reward for blind obedience to the president.
Just ask Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey. He has turned his office into an auxiliary law firm for Trump. But when Bailey threw his hat in the ring for the job as FBI director, the president casually dismissed him after an interview. 
“He just didn’t have the presence in the room,” Trump reportedly said.
Few people have tried harder to ingratiate themselves with Trump and the MAGA movement than Josh Hawley, Missouri’s senior U.S. senator. In 2021, he became the first senator to announce he would object to the certification of Joe Biden’s electoral victory, and he cheered the crowds that had gathered to storm the U.S. Capitol.
More recently, Hawley twisted himself into a pretzel trying to be a populist while at the same time staying on Trump’s good side.
First he said he wouldn’t vote for a bill that slashed Medicaid spending. Then he cast the decisive vote for Trump’s “big, beautiful bill,” which did indeed slash Medicaid spending. Then he introduced a new, dead-on-arrival bill to restore the slashed Medicaid spending.
All that, only to have Trump call him a “second-tier senator” a few weeks later, as Hawley attempted to take a stand on a different issue. 
This is the calculus for Kehoe. Call a special session and get the redistricting done and maybe Trump won’t blast him on Truth Social or exact some petty revenge down the road. But dysfunction in the legislature will worsen and so will the bad blood between the state of Missouri and Kansas City, its most dynamic region.
Courage is an elusive commodity these days. I think we can guess which way Kehoe will turn.  
Missouri earned its slogan as the Show-Me state in part because politicians through the years refused to take orders from outsiders.
We may have to change the motto on our license plates. Odds are Kehoe is about to turn Missouri into the Tell-Me state.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_1968-e1747406679213-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-08-18 05:57:12.008052

The six-month investigation, reported by Tom Loftus and John Voskuhl, found “the entire state-funded resurfacing program is plagued by a lack of competition.” 
Secretary Gray will recognize the names of the companies that benefited decades ago from the asphalt bidding schemes. According to the latest research published  by my organization – Kentucky FREE – many of those same highway contractors are still reaping the rewards from  the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet’s (KYTC) single-bid contracts. 
Our research shows that during the first six months of 2025, the Transportation Cabinet awarded $150,407,982 in single-bid asphalt contracts. Those awards translated to $12,765,410 in inflated project costs when compared to estimates based on competitive scenarios. Fifteen highway contractors secured single-bid contracts from January to June, however, six companies reaped 87% of their dollar value.
To be fair, some things have changed in the last 31 years.
Mountain Enterprises and Hinkle Contracting, once family-owned, are now subsidiaries of CRH-Oldcastle, the largest building materials company in North America. Also, Hinkle is part of a joint-venture with Nally & Gibson, another player in the single-bid asphalt game. 
Leonard Lawson, dubbed the “King of the Roads” by Loftus and Voskuhl, died in 2022. Steve Lawson, his son, now sits atop a road paving conglomerate that includes ATS Construction, L-M Enterprises, The Allen Company, Lexington Quarry and Walker Construction. 
In the 1980s, Leonard Lawson was an unindicted co-conspirator in a federal bid rigging trial. As reported by the Courier Journal, Lawson testified “he and another paving contractor agreed to cooperate on their bidding — splitting state jobs ‘right down the middle.’”
The days of contractors getting together in a room to divvy up territories are a thing of the past. However, a peer-reviewed study published in 2020 and co-authored by a University of Kentucky economist, raised questions of “tacit collusion” by the state’s asphalt industry. 
Tacit collusion refers to an implicit agreement among firms in an oligopolistic market to coordinate their pricing and output strategies. It can lead to higher prices and reduced competition, as firms avoid competition that could harm their profits. It’s revealed by patterns in bidding behavior over a long period of time.
The 2020 study argued that “stark evidence that county lines might provide a focal point for collusive bidding can be seen in the Lexington-Bluegrass market area.”  
Last year, the General Assembly’s Legislative Oversight & Investigations committee examined KYTC’s single-bid asphalt awards from 2018 to 2023. It found that “bidding is generally more competitive in counties surrounding Jefferson County and in northern Kentucky; counties (in the Fayette County area) have a high percentage of single-bid contracts even though multiple (asphalt) plants are in the region.”  
I’ve been examining asphalt bidding for five years. A small number of companies clearly maintain local monopolies. 
In central Kentucky (with rare exceptions), L-M Asphalt controls Fayette County, Lexington Quarry controls Jessamine and The Allen Company controls both Clark and Madison. Bourbon County is Hinkle’s and Scott County is Nally & Gibson’s. The Lawson-owned companies don’t bid into the CRH-Oldcastle counties and the CRH-Oldcastle companies don’t bid into the Lawson companies’ counties. 
L-M Asphalt has won countless single-bid projects in Laurel County, though none as eye-popping as the $147 million contract for an Interstate 75 project announced last week. It defies logic that the Transportation Cabinet couldn’t get another company to bid on such a big project. 
History isn’t repeating itself. The same story has continued unabated for decades. Unfortunately, the results are the same today as they were in 1994: The lack of competition wastes millions of the taxpayers’ dollars every year. 
In 2021, I testified about this issue in front of the interim Transportation Committee. Several legislators unloaded on me, trying to undermine my presentation with the industry’s talking points. 
Those legislators should’ve taken two lessons away from that committee meeting: Lobbyists’ talking points aren’t the same as facts and an industry that tries to silence its critics probably has something to hide.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gettyimages-83455071-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-08-18 05:57:12.008052

Julie Fedorchak, R-N.D., meets with Don and Sharon Zubke of Dickinson during a series of constituent meetings in Bismarck on Aug. 15, 2025. (Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)U.S. House Rep. Julie Fedorchak, R-N.D., said she plans to continue holding one-on-one meetings with North Dakotans going forward, but poured cold water on the possibility of a public town hall.
Fedorchak held 10 meetings in Bismarck on Friday with those who signed up for time slots in advance. She also held similar meetings in Fargo last month with seven constituents.
She said was encouraged by the meetings and believes people just wanted “to be heard.”
“People came in with issues and only a handful of folks really had grievances about the current administration, or what’s going on,” Fedorchak said in an interview after the meetings.
She said the constituent meetings are only one element of her outreach efforts to North Dakotans. The virtual public forums, meeting with advocacy groups and organizations around the state and responding to messages will also continue, she said, which provide multiple layers of interaction.
“The town hall would not be as productive,” Fedorchak said. “I’m not interested in creating an environment that just further underscores the partisan nature of our political arena today and that’s what those town halls generally do. They are a forum for political theater that has turned into yelling and screaming, and not a productive conversation about the consequential issues.”
One North Dakotan with a meeting slot in Bismarck was Mike Larson of Carrington. He said “cruelty” prompted him to sign up for a one-on-one meeting with Fedorchak.

“We’re going backwards,” Larson said, prior to his meeting. “Everything. Just cruelty in general. It’s not her fault. It’s the party. The people. And I’m just kind of fed up with the cruelty. That’s the thing that bothers me the most.”
Larson said he has friends that he now describes as “people I used to know” because of their political disagreements.
After the meeting, Larson said Fedorchak listened and wrote down his concerns. He added he felt better upon exiting his meeting.
“I just hope she adheres to some of the things that I talked to her about and understands that there’s a lot of people like me that are very concerned about our future,” he said. “I hope she understands that a person needs to be an individual and make your own decisions.”
Fedorchak said she has crafted her political beliefs after more than 30 years in business and public service and she is a conservative, which shouldn’t surprise anyone.
“I am a Republican and I’m committed to the principles of the Republican Party and the conservative movement because I think they are right,” Fedorchak said. “Folks who don’t share those values are going to see it differently and wish I voted differently.”
Debbra Hill of Bismarck said she considers herself a Republican, but has major concerns about the high cost of child care and its accessibility. She also said she has issues with the way the United States is treating Ukrainian immigrants who fled their country, only to have problems with their visas being extended.
Poll: Trump, Armstrong support firm; Fedorchak, Cramer slip

“I have friends from Ukraine. They say they are not deporting them, but if they can’t work and the government is not helping them … that’s a horrible way to treat our Ukrainian friends,” Hill said. 
She also expressed concerns about the country’s $37 trillion debt and that the Republican reconciliation package will add to that debt, not pay it down.
“We thought we were going to decrease our debt. We thought we were going to have a better quality of life. This is all reversed and I’m very disappointed,” Hill said.
After her meeting, Hill said Fedorchak justified the Republican tax and spending package, which is what she expected.
“She justified everything they have done,” Hill said. “We’re not going to have growth with high tariffs and we’re not going to have growth when we don’t have workers to do the labor.”
Hill said her opinion of Fedorchak did not change as a result of the meeting.
Fedorchak said the meetings proved that people can still have respectful discussions about important issues.
“I think everyone appreciated being able to be heard and hearing where I stand on issues, even if it’s different from them,” Fedorchak said. 
Some North Dakotans met with Fedorchak to address personal issues regarding their missing tax refund or problems with the visa process for a family member.
In a statement from North Dakota Sen. Kevin Cramer’s office, Cramer said he holds a regular series of radio town halls that are listed on his website, which provides opportunities for North Dakotans from across the state to participate.
“Whether a person is speaking into a microphone or telephone, they are speaking directly to me, with the only differences being they don’t have to get in their car or wait for a town hall to align with their schedule,” Cramer said in a statement. “I also make it a priority to be available to local reporters, and in fact most of them have my cell phone number. If I am going to represent North Dakotans the best way I can, I need to hear from them, but it’s too important to rely only upon 20th Century tools and tactics when we all know how quickly things move today.”
In a statement, North Dakota Sen. John Hoeven’s office said, “Hoeven holds public meetings on issues important to our state and nation. These public events are in communities across the state, and North Dakotans are welcome to attend.”
The office said Hoeven has participated in meetings and discussions over the last several weeks involving: energy, border security, housing, grazing and flood protection. Hoeven is also available to meet with constituents regularly in Washington, D.C., and North Dakota.

(Jon Cherry/Getty Images)As participation in Arkansas’ school voucher program has grown, so too has tuition at the private schools receiving state funds. 
Since its creation under the LEARNS Act in 2023, the Educational Freedom Account program has provided state money for allowable education expenses such as private school tuition. The program has been phased in over three years with increasing eligibility and is open to all students for the first time this fall.
Of the 164 schools that applied for the 2025-2026 academic year, 160 have been approved to participate, according to Arkansas Department of Education spokesperson Kimberly Mundell. Students used the EFA program at 97 schools in the program’s first year in 2023-24 and 126 schools the second. Additional schools were approved to participate both years, but did not have students who accessed EFA funds, Mundell said. 
According to an Arkansas Advocate analysis of private school tuition obtained through a public records request, the average tuition for the 2025-2026 year is around $8,800, which is more than the roughly $7,000 the state will provide each student this year.
The average tuition increase among the 93 schools that participated in all three years of the program was about $1,400, the Advocate’s analysis showed. 
North Little Rock’s Immaculate Conception Catholic School had the largest three-year increase at $5,725.
Under EFA program rules, ADE may prohibit schools from participating in the program if the department determines tuition or fee increases “are unreasonable or arbitrary.” Asked if a school’s proposed increase has ever been rejected, Mundell said “each private school’s tuition is reviewed individually to ensure compliance with state law.”
“The department reviews each school’s proposed tuition before granting approval for the upcoming year,” Mundell said in an email. “If any concerns arise, the department contacts the school to learn more.”

High and low tuition
Fayetteville Christian School, which has participated in the EFA program since its inception, doubled its K-12 tuition from $3,000 to $6,000 this year. Students paid between $700 and $850 in additional fees last year that are included in this year’s tuition cost. According to the school’s application, its superintendent sent the 2025-2026 tuition structure to ADE for review on Dec. 9 with an explanation for the increase. An official reviewed and “pre-approved” the increase the same day, according to the application. 
Calvary Christian Academy, which joined the program last school year, included in its application three reasons for increasing tuition by $2,900 to $6,200 this year. Officials said they didn’t previously charge “the full amount available,” so they wouldn’t financially hurt families ineligible for the EFA program. They also didn’t charge for some operational and technology fees, which they didn’t realize could be included in the EFA program. Additionally, the tuition hike will provide teachers and staff “a much-deserved raise,” according to the application. 
The largest year-over-year increase belongs to PLUM’s St. Howard’s Academy in Forrest City, which increased its tuition by roughly $5,100 to $12,000. The average tuition increase from last year among participating schools was about $860. PLUM Foundation is a nonprofit dedicated to community development in impoverished areas of the state, according to its website.
First-time participant Ewing Adventist Junior Academy in Bonnerdale has the lowest tuition at $2,000 for K-8 students. 
Bentonville’s Thaden School has the most expensive tuition at $29,300 for high school students. Head of School Michael Maloy told the Advocate last summer that Thaden offers “a robust financial aid program” that includes indexed tuition, meaning families pay according to their income.
Three new EFA participants, Excel High School, Northgate Academy and Veritas Scholars Academy, are not included in the Advocate’s analysis because instead of traditional tuition, the online schools’ charges vary based on how many and what type of courses students register to take. 

Doing more
Although Christ Academy received approval to participate in the inaugural year of the EFA program, principal Nyesha Greer decided to wait until this fall when all of her students would be eligible. 
The Newport school, which opened in 2018 and can serve around a dozen students in grades 6 through 8, is affiliated with a church and has previously relied on private donors and grants for funding. 
This will be the first year the school charges tuition, $6,500 per student. That’s just under the $6,994 being provided to each EFA student this year. The per-pupil EFA amount in the program’s first year was $6,672 and $6,856 the following academic year. Each year’s amount was based on the prior year’s per-student foundation funding for public schools.  
Greer said delaying participation in the EFA program “was the best decision.” The state funding will reduce stress on parents and allow the school to provide more programs and expand extracurricular activities, she said.  
“It just means we’ll be able to do a little bit more. It opens doors for us,” she said. 
Those sentiments were shared by Esmerki De Los Santos, principal of Fe Viva Christian School. The school is a ministry of Iglesia Bautista Fe Viva, an independent Baptist, Spanish-speaking church in Rogers. De Los Santos said the school provides instruction in English, but with a bilingual emphasis. 
Fe Viva joined the EFA program last year and is educating nearly 50 students in kindergarten through 12th grade this fall. The school’s funding was much smaller previously, and although money was “tight for a lot of parents,” De Los Santos said they educated students regardless. The EFA funding will enable the school to do more this year, such as providing students meals and additional resources, the principal said. 
“It’s life-changing. It’s life-changing for them, for the school,” De Los Santos said.

Tuition at Fe Viva is $6,000 for kindergarten through 7th grade and $6,500 for 8th through 12th grade. In deciding tuition, De Los Santos said they consider the cost of education and tuition prices in Northwest Arkansas.
“We are probably by far one of the cheapest here in the area just because we are working mostly with bilingual families,” he said. “We reach a lot of Hispanic families that would like to give their kids a little bit of Christian and better education, and so we reach out to families that wouldn’t be able to afford any other type of private school otherwise.”
While he’s grateful for state funding, De Los Santos said that, in the back of his mind, there’s always a concern about how the EFA program could shift in the future, such as new rules infringing on the school’s “religious liberty” or if funding runs out. De Los Santos said 80% to 90% of Fe Viva’s budget relies on EFA funding, and he’s not sure parents could afford tuition if the program goes away. 
Likewise, Greer said she’s mindful of how the program might shift once a new governor comes into office. 
“That has been a thought, but I’m not concerned,” she said. “The way I see it is we’ve been able to function before, and so this is not a determining factor whether we’ll be successful or not. This is just something that comes along and it’s a great help to us right now.”
Covering all applicants
The state has approved $277 million for the program’s third year; however, there are plans to fund every approved application, Mundell said. The deadline for schools and students to apply was Aug. 1 and Aug. 15, respectively. Mundell said it is yet to be determined if more students will be allowed to apply later in the year. 
As of Thursday afternoon, ADE had received 50,630 total applications — 29,836 private school students, 20,782 homeschool students, 12 incomplete. Of those, 44,599 had been approved, including 27,779 private school students and 16,820 homeschool students. 
By this same time in 2023 and 2024, ADE had approved participation for roughly 5,000 and 12,000 students, respectively. 
Of the currently approved students, 456 are former recipients of the Succeed Scholarship. The program, which was absorbed into the EFA program, provided private school tuition for students with disabilities, foster children and military families. 
Students who participated in the Succeed Scholarship during the 2022-2023 school year have continued to receive the scholarship amount awarded to them. Their funding has increased from $7,413 to $7,618 to $7,771 since the 2023-2024 school year.
The EFA program is only open to Arkansas schools, with the exception of the Madonna Learning Center in Tennessee, which has been allowed to participate in order to continue serving a former Succeed Scholarship recipient. The school will not be allowed to continue in the EFA program once the student graduates, Mundell said. 
ADE did not have data on when the last of the former Succeed Scholarship students are expected to graduate, but Mundell said graduation data will be presented in the annual EFA report. The program’s rules require that a legislative report be submitted no later than Sept. 30 each year. 



How we did it: 
Data was collected from Educational Freedom Account program applications provided by the Arkansas Department of Education through a state Freedom of Information Act request. Annual tuition rates for schools that provided weekly or monthly rates were calculated based on a 10-month school year.
Schools generally provided tuition rates for the 2025-2026 and 2024-2025 academic years. Some schools only provided one document for tuition rates. Although that may be because the tuition rate is the same for the current and previous year, only the tuition rate for the specific year listed on the document was included in the analysis.
Some schools included all fees in their listed tuition price, but the majority listed separate fees to be paid in addition to the tuition rate. The tuition rates in this analysis do not reflect discounts for things like being a church member or enrolling more than one child.

(Photo courtesy of Getty Images)With friction growing between the public and school leaders over policy decisions, Fairfax County Public Schools is in the process of hiring security for its superintendent due to the need for additional protection over safety concerns.
The move has left legislative leaders curious if similar proposals could occur at other school divisions around the region and beyond, as school leaders continue to be challenged by the public and face investigations for their decisions.
“I think that our superintendents do not want to have to spend their very scarce resources on something like this,” said Del. Laura Jane Cohen, D-Fairfax, a former Fairfax County school board member. “And I honestly believe, if you see this in Fairfax County, it is highly likely that these threats are happening all over the country.” 
The Mercury confirmed that school divisions in Falls Church City, and the counties of Loudoun, Prince William, Rapphannock and Frederick have not appropriated funds specifically for their superintendent’s security. 
Fairfax County Public Schools, the largest school division in the commonwealth, is likely the first to take such action. In a statement, FCPS told reporters that the “highly publicized tragic events around the country over the last several months illustrate the need to intensify and enhance security protocols at all organizations.”
Fairfax’s policy decisions have made targets of Superintendent Michelle Reid, the school board, and even staff, dating back as far as the pandemic. Chief among its critics have been parents, lawmakers and Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration.
Some of the board’s decisions include overhauling school admissions at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology to promote greater diversity and resisting statewide transgender policies that would have forced schools to out transgender students or restrict pronoun use.
Fairfax, along with four other school divisions — Alexandria City, Arlington, Loudoun and Prince William — was also the subject of a federal investigation that determined their gender policies violated Title IX. The U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights proposed that the divisions rescind their policies and adopt biology-based definitions of the words “male” and “female” in all practices and policies relating to Title IX.
The division is also facing a criminal investigation after school staff were alleged to have helped minors get abortions without parental consent. Reid has denied the allegations.
The division did not immediately respond to questioning.
 The decision

Cohen said threats against school board members have stretched back to her time on the board between 2020 and 2023. During those years, she said someone would be assigned to follow her to her car or from other buildings.
Cohen said she feels confident in the office’s decision, given their assistance with her own security while she was on the board. She faced threats and successfully had a petition against her removal dismissed.
“If there are credible threats on her life, not only do you want to make sure that she’s protected, but you want to make sure that every time she goes into a school or is meeting with anybody that she is not a liability,” Cohen said.
In July, FCPS posted the job opening for an “executive protection agent” to work on a 260-day contract. The job would pay between $84,000-$144,000 per year. 
The job posting reads that the agent is responsible for “ensuring the personal safety, security, and operational continuity of the division superintendent across school campuses, public events, official travel, and private residences. This role requires discretion, professionalism, proactive risk management, and continuous coordination with internal stakeholders and external partners, including law enforcement.”  
During the same month, the school board met to discuss “public safety matters” and to “dispense with the attendance of the superintendent” during a portion of the closed session on July 17.
Following the job posting’s publication, WJLA reported that the security detail could consist of up to four positions. 
The Virginia School Board Association (VSBA) and School Board Member Alliance (SBMA) did not directly answer if they have concerns that Fairfax’s decision will set a precedent for hiring superintendents.
Instead, Gina Patterson, VSBA executive director, said in a statement that the decision made by the Fairfax County School Board is an example of their local control. 
“If the board and superintendent determined that this course of action was appropriate, it reflects their judgment on what they believe to be in the best interest of both their superintendent and their school division,” Patterson said.
In contrast, Shelly Norden, SBMA executive director, said the alliance believes the school board should instead prioritize more security officers at Fairfax’s elementary schools before the superintendent, costing the division at least $424,000 annually. She pointed out that the security detail could be an added expense considering there is already security at public events like board meetings and at the central administrative office.
“Adding a dedicated private security detail to these benefits would represent a further significant expense to taxpayers,” Norden said in a statement. “The school board holds the authority to approve or deny such requests.

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)Virginia-based abortion funds are citing an increased uptick in calls to their intake lines, as more people rely on their assistance to help cover the cost and sometimes travel expenses to get abortions. 
Since federal protections were overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court three summers ago, various states have enacted restrictions or near-total bans on the procedure. With Virginia the least-restrictive southern state, several funds here told the Virginia Mercury in interviews they’re seeing a spike in assistance requests. 
But it’s not just from out-of-state patients, they said, as higher costs of living mean Virginians seeking abortions have also needed a boost from organizations like the Blue Ridge Abortion Fund (BRAF), Richmond Reproductive Freedom Project (RRFP) or Hampton Roads Reproductive Justice League (HRRJL). 
Over the past year, BRAF said it supported over 2,300 callers and saw a 54% increase in funding provided for callers. Before 2023, about 15% of people BRAF supported came from out of state, but that number now accounts for 25% of people the fund has served as of this year. 
“We’re seeing a ripple effect,” executive director April Greene shared in a recent call.
Other Virginian abortion funding groups echo that they’re seeing requests for assistance from North Carolinians, Georgians and Floridians in particular. 
Florida and Georgia ban the procedure after 6 weeks (a time when some people are just learning they are pregnant), while North Carolina blocks the procedure after 12 weeks. The longer it takes to afford, schedule and travel for an abortion and the further into pregnancy a person becomes, the higher the need to come to a state like Virginia, which caps most abortions around 26 weeks, rises.
Abortion providers challenge FDA’s remaining mifepristone restrictions in federal court

A spokesperson from RRFP noted that out-of-state patients can strain the resources for Virginia patients too. But this is also why Greene, from BRAF, said several funds in various states remain in communication with each other. 
Greene explained that abortion funds are more than a fund for patients to tap into; they are also a source of moral support and information. 
This is particularly the case, she said, for patients who need to travel further for care, or ones who reach out with questions and are counseled or comforted by intake staff while they navigate delays in locking down appointments. Sometimes funds help patients book hotel rooms or flights as needed, or even talk someone through their pre-flight jitters if it’s their first time on a plane. 
“We’re sort of walking alongside people so much longer than people would think,” Greene said. “It’s not just ‘here’s 500 dollars for your abortion.’ It’s so much more than that.” 
Sara Blachman, a volunteer with the Hampton Roads Reproductive Justice League, said that the largest increase in out-of-state callers her organization has seen are people coming from Georgia or Florida. 
“Being located in Hampton Roads we have always had callers from North Carolina, and callers from our neighboring state seem to be increasing too,” she said in an email. 
Blachman added that the fund usually gets between 50 and 70 calls a week, despite only having the funding to make three to five pledges a week. RRFP relayed that their funding line was typically open from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. prior to the overturn of Roe, but now, they are routinely flooded with calls and have had to close their line earlier in the day. 
“While some of this is due to more people and clinics knowing about us, more importantly it’s a reflection of the higher need we are seeing,” the spokesperson said. 
New River Abortion Access Fund, which is rooted in Southwest Virginia but like its counterparts connects patients around the state, has suspended its hotline for the time being. 
Its director, Val Washington, connected with The Mercury but was unable to follow through on an interview to glean more details by the time of this publication.
Meanwhile, the costs associated with getting an abortion in the first place has also been rising amid national inflation. As out-of-state patients seek to tap into Virginia funds, the RRFP spokesperson also noted cost burdens on Virginians. 
“People in Virginia need more support than before because the cost of living (which affects the cost of food, hotels, rideshare rides, gas, etc. around appointment dates) has increased without their wages increasing,” the spokesperson said. “Even a meal after an abortion is much more expensive now than it was five years ago, and that has nothing to do with overturning Roe.”
Newer to the abortion assistance landscape is State Line Abortion Access Partners (SLAAP), which has its “Last Mile Fund.” Anchored in Bristol along the Virginia and Tennessee border, the hyper-local fund “bridges the gap” for people who have secured money for abortion care but still need some help. The organization coordinates with other abortion funds to help transport patients to a reproductive health clinic in Bristol by reimbursing volunteer drivers for gas. 
With a rise in demand, sometimes the fundraising keeps pace, and sometimes it doesn’t.
Greene from BRAF shared that the fund noted a surge in donations around the time that Roe was overturned and supporting abortion access was top of mind for people feeling philanthropic. Those numbers eventually dropped, but Greene said that funds like BRAF began to strategize how to meet the needs of the people it serves and sustain itself. 
“We were incredibly lucky over the past few years to get some infrastructure,” Greene said. 
This came in the form of support through the National Network of Abortion Funds and tapping into other organizations. 
And while abortion funds aren’t directly affected by federal funding freezes, Greene still said funding organizations are watching with caution. 
For instance, three Virginia-based Planned Parenthood clinics have been waiting for federal funding tethered to family planning and cancer screening services for low-income people amid a federal funding freeze announced this spring. Though the funding is not connected to abortions specifically, the fact that Planned Parenthood clinics do provide the procedure has drawn ire from abortion opponents. Legal battles are also underway regarding other federal funding that clinics have historically received. 
Still, Greene said that BRAF missed out on some non-federal grant funding this year — necessitating a small budget reduction for the time being. 
“I think everyone’s a little tentative, a little bit unsure about what’s happening in the philanthropic landscape,” she said.

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)Chesterfield native Deborah Ragsdale spent the summer stressed out by  trying to find a new place to live. Her previous residence failed health and safety inspections, which are mandatory for landlords who rent to housing voucher recipients like Ragsdale, who is also disabled. 
Then, Housing Opportunities Made Equal, or HOME of Virginia, stepped in. The organization helped Ragsdale navigate her journey to a new home in Henrico County, a service they and similar housing organizations perform for thousands of Virginians each year.
‘A smack in the face:’ Vouchers holders fear federal housing cuts

“If I didn’t have her, if I didn’t have her voice, I don’t know where I would be today,” Ragsdale said of Teneika Jones, a housing specialist with HOME.
Vouchers help Ragsdale live independently and keep close to her grandchildren; she’s envisioning them playing at a park near her new home. The stress of finding a place to liveis finally melting away for her, but for nonprofit workers and others who aid in building housing safety nets, troubling new challenges are on the horizon as the federal funding landscape experiences seismic shifts. 
White House budget proposals earlier this summer sugget deep cuts for housing programs that Virginia has long relied on to help struggling renters, first-time homebuyers and those who are unhoused and in need of shelter. The federal funds at risk also support organizations that fight housing discrimination and generally assist people with locking down a place to live.
President Donald Trump’s budget requests would eliminate or reduce funding streams from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), including Community Development Block Grants, the Fair Housing Initiative Program and the vouchers that people like Ragsdale depend on. 
Nearly 200,000 homes in Virginia receive some form of support from HUD, according to an analysis from the Virginia Housing Alliance. About 50,000 of those residents use vouchers.
While recent movement in Congress shows the changes may not come to fruition in the next year, some funding changes are already unfolding for localities. For instance, Richmond’s public housing authority has stopped issuing new housing vouchers amid federal funding reductions. Those particular reductions stem from Richmond’s inability to utilize all of the vouchers it was funded for, essentially due to landlords not accepting them. 
“We are putting vouchers on the street,” Richmond Redevelopment and Housing Authority CEO Steven Nesmith told The Richmonder earlier this summer.  “But “landlords are saying — I’m just being real with you — ‘I’m not accepting those people.’” 
That’s where organizations like HOME come in to help. Spokesman Lance Warren said the “obstacles are all too familiar.” 
Though state law makes it illegal to refuse an applicant based on the source of funds used to pay rent, like vouchers, he said it’s not uncommon for his organization or the local housing authority to encounter landlords that refuse to comply. 
For now, voucher access and other federal housing funding aren’t “further hurt by Congress,” but they also aren’t “further helped,” Warren said. 
Existing voucher users are still facing their own hurdles, despite the assistance on paper.
Kimyade Richardson-Keys said he and his wife were rejected multiple times in the process of searching for apartments and homes this spring and summer before landing a place in Southside Richmond. He works at Chippenham Hospital and his wife is a caretaker. While they hope to eventually move to Chester, for now they are grateful for their place in Richmond. 
“We finally found the place we’re at now with a landlord who was extremely nice and pleasant and helpful getting us in there,” he said. 
It wasn’t easy though, Richardson-Keys said. He believes their status as housing voucher recipients made some places turn them away or string them along until they would walk away. 
“A couple of them were discriminating against us,” he said. “I think that was the basis of it because we have a good credit score, good rental history, so everything down the board was checked off.”
At above 650, his credit score is considered fair. Eligibility for housing voucher assistance is typically determined by income levels, not credit scores. Richardson-Keys’ credit score, which indicates he prioritizes paying bills on time and avoiding incurring too much debt, is part of why landlords review would-be tenants’ credit when approving or rejecting applications.
He attributed his family’s ultimate success to the “magic that Mrs. Jones was working.”
Jones, who used to work for RRHA, said she’s seen a variety of renters over the years that rely on organizations like HOME of Virginia and the housing authority to afford a place to live. Her experience helps her understand the concerns some landlords might possess around housing voucher clients, but she noted that the stigma is mostly inaccurate. 
“Do you have families that definitely don’t pay their portion or have damages to the house?  Absolutely, but it is a very small drop in the pond,” Jones said. “Most people work, they pay their bills — they just need a little help.”
More often than not, she said,  housing voucher recipients are misunderstood and judged. It’s a personal lived experience for her as well, having been a recipient at one point in her life. 
“I remember how people used to treat me,” she said, reflecting on the tough time she had as a single mother after her children’s father died. She brings that perspective to the table when helping her clients complete housing applications or relocate.
Jones said she feels like there are incidents where Virginia landlords have been able to discriminate against would-be renters without technically violating any laws. 
“We have great landlords that we work with, and property managers, but some of them have found ways to exclude people legally,”she said.
For instance, landlords can choose to not renew leases, or sometimes there are abatement issues like Ragsdale experienced when her property failed safety inspections and she had to move. Warren warns that it’s these cracks in the system that organizations like HOME watch out for and help people overcome.

If you buy your own health insurance in Arkansas, expect to start paying more in a few months — a lot more — thanks to Republicans in Congress and President Donald Trump.
Rates for individual plans are set to rise by an average of 36% next year, according to proposed 2026 rate filings by BlueCross and Centene, the two companies that sell policies on the Arkansas Health Insurance Marketplace.
Most Americans who buy a marketplace plan get financial help from the federal government through tax subsidies created by the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, the 2010 health reform legislation often called “Obamacare.” But those ACA subsidies are set to shrink next year, and congressional Republicans refuse to extend them.




Some 166,000 Arkansans get their insurance on the marketplace as of now. Most of them will face a major rate hike — or simply be priced out of coverage — if the changes take effect.




Last week, Gov. Sarah Sanders said the companies’ proposed rate hikes are “unacceptable” and called on the commissioner of the Arkansas Insurance Department to reject them.







It’s tough talk, but talk is cheap. Health care is not. As governor, Sanders aims to cut health spending at the state level and supports Republican cuts at the federal level. If she truly cared about preventing rate increases for Arkansans, she’d call on Congress to keep the current ACA subsidies in place, or she’d find money elsewhere. Instead, she’s trying to distract us with fake populism by attacking a corporate villain everyone loves to hate — insurance companies.



The state Insurance Department isn’t answering questions about any of it, including basic questions about the agency’s timeline to make a decision about rates. But here’s what we know.




 Rates in real life


Rate increases are a fact of life in the perennially broken American health system. As the cost of doctors and hospitals and prescription drugs rises, so does the cost of insurance. Insurers file their rate adjustments for the upcoming year with the Insurance Department annually, which hires independent actuaries to determine whether the proposed changes are reasonable.
The rate hikes for individual plans in the past five years have been between 2% and 6%, as outlined here by the Arkansas Center for Health Improvement. That adds up, but it’s in the same ballpark as recent annual hikes for employer-sponsored insurance. A single-year increase of 36% is a different story.



And that’s an average increase. Costs vary from carrier to carrier, and the premiums on some Centene plans are projected to increase by more than 50%. Remember also that costs vary from person to person, depending on factors like age and family size.



So what’s happening here? It’s helpful to first back up for a quick refresher on how the Affordable Care Act works.
The ACA made insurance available to more Americans in two main ways. First, it expanded Medicaid, the country’s patchy safety net insurance program, to cover low-income households. “Medicaid expansion” is available to those making under 138% of the federal poverty line, a measure of income that depends on family size. In 2025, 138% of the poverty line was about $21,600 annually for a single person; for a three-person household it was about $36,800.
In Arkansas, the Medicaid expansion program is called ARHOME, and it gives essentially free coverage to some 230,000 people who are below the 138% threshold. The federal government pays for most of the cost of that coverage (90%) and the state pays the rest. (Medicaid expansion still hasn’t happened in some red states, like Texas.)
ARHOME could be affected by the proposed insurance rate increases too, thanks to some complicated quirks of how the expansion program is set up in Arkansas. But for now, the focus is on the second piece of the ACA — federal subsidies for individual plans sold by private companies on the health insurance marketplace.
For most people with incomes above 138% of the poverty line who can’t get insurance through a job or a spouse, buying an individual plan is the only option. To make the premiums on those plans more affordable, the ACA created a sliding scale of “premium tax credits” that depend on income. If you’re a single person in Arkansas making $25,000 annually, you make slightly too much to qualify for Medicaid expansion, but you can get a tax credit — a subsidy — that covers most of the cost of buying a private plan on the marketplace.
From the beginning, though, there was a problem with the ACA marketplace: The subsidies were too stingy. Some people signed up, but many others still found individual plans to be prohibitively expensive even with the subsidy. So while Medicaid expansion was very successful in getting more Americans covered, the marketplace was less so — until the COVID pandemic created an opportunity.
President Joe Biden’s American Rescue Plan made the ACA subsidies larger for everyone and also removed a cap on the upper end of the income sliding scale. Under the original ACA, people making four times the federal poverty level (400%) simply didn’t get any help at all and had to pay the full cost of insurance out of pocket. The Biden policy — which was later extended under the Inflation Reduction Act — gave modest subsidies to those above 400% as well.
The result was dramatic. In 2020, there were just 64,000 Arkansans insured through an individual marketplace plan. This year, with “enhanced” ACA subsidies now making insurance affordable, there are 166,000, according to the health policy nonprofit KFF.
The enhanced ACA subsidies are set to expire at the end of 2025, though, and Republicans have shown no interest in extending them. Insurance companies expect tons of people, especially those young and healthy enough to feel like they can risk it, to drop their coverage in 2026 as a result. And crucially, the people left behind in the risk pool will be sicker and more expensive to insure on the whole, thus driving up per-person costs.
To see this dynamic at play, it’s helpful to look at a specific example. The inimitable DIY health policy analyst Charles Gaba has run the numbers on Arkansas’ proposed rate hikes with and without the enhanced ACA subsidies. Right now, a 30-year-old single mom in Arkansas who makes a $40,000 salary can buy a solid, mid-tier insurance plan for herself for about $61 a month — a pretty good deal. (Her child will almost certainly be covered by ARKids, the Medicaid-funded program for children.) Without the enhanced subsidy, though, she will pay a $214 monthly premium.
That’s an increase of $153, or 250%. Will the average 30-year-old single mom with a $40K income pay $1,832 more annually to keep her health insurance? Or will she opt to pay for groceries, bills, child care, a vehicle and a roof over her family’s heads? There’s no question — unless she’s already sick. The only scenario where she’d prioritize buying health coverage is if she absolutely has to have it, due to a chronic illness, high-cost prescriptions or other health needs. And if she uses her insurance frequently, that will cost the insurance company more money — even as it has less money coming in the door due to other people dropping coverage.
Multiply this dynamic by tens of thousands of individuals, and the proposed Arkansas rate hikes make more sense.
Gaba runs through various other examples in his charts, including a four-person family with mom and dad both age 40. If they make $70,000 annually, they now pay about $138 monthly in premiums. When the enhanced ACA subsidies go away, that will more than triple, to $436 monthly.
Or imagine an older couple who are both 64 (just one year shy of Medicare eligibility) and make $90,000, placing them above that 400% poverty line mark. Right now, with the enhanced ACA subsidies in place, they pay a hefty $638 monthly in premium. That will become a back-breaking $2,915 monthly payment in 2026.
The enhanced ACA subsidies aren’t the only thing behind the rate hikes. General inflation plays a role, as do various other policy changes at the state level. But the insurers themselves say the main driver is that the subsidies are shrinking.
A filing from Centene with the Arkansas Insurance Department puts it this way: “Most notably, as [enhanced ACA subsidies] expire and enrollees face increased out-of-pocket premiums, we assume healthier individuals who tend to be more price sensitive will exit the market, worsening the average morbidity of the individual risk pool.”
(All the filings from the carriers can be found here on the Insurance Department’s website. Though there are six companies listed, note that they’re all some form of either Arkansas Blue Cross & Blue Shield or Centene. Centene is the parent company of Celtic Insurance Company (Ambetter), QCA Health Plan, Inc., and QualChoice Life and Health Insurance Company, Inc. Health Advantage, USAble HMO, Inc. (Octave) and USAble Mutual Insurance Co. are all affiliated with Blue Cross.)
A cynical ploy
The end of the enhanced ACA subsidies isn’t a direct result of Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill, though it’s fair to conflate the two. The point of the bill was to prevent Trump’s first-term tax cuts from expiring. Republicans could have stopped the enhanced subsidies from expiring as well. But that would have meant less money for tax cuts.
Instead of preserving the subsidies, the Trump bill reduced federal health care spending by hundreds of billions of dollars in the years to come, mostly via Medicaid cuts that won’t kick in until after next year’s midterm elections. Republicans hope voters have short memories and aren’t planning ahead. But the surge in health insurance premiums is coming now, and not just in Arkansas. A KFF analysis found a median proposed premium increase of 18% nationwide.
Maybe that’s why Sanders is trying to get out ahead of this issue. Shouting and pointing fingers at the insurance companies might distract from the truth that her party set these price increases in motion by chopping health spending to pay for tax cuts.
Sanders wholeheartedly supported the Big, Beautiful Bill as written and cheered when it passed. She was even engaged in the legislative process, penning a Washington Post op-ed that urged Congress to strip out a policy on state-level AI regulation that she and other red-state governors objected to. She didn’t utter a word about the need to extend the enhanced ACA subsidies and still hasn’t, as far as we know.
But here she is, roleplaying as an economic populist about a rate hike created by her own party’s regressive policies. Note that there’s no trace of a solution in Sanders’ statement on the issue, and no mention of what might be causing it, other than BlueCross and Centene putting “corporate profits over Arkansas’s people.”
Strange words to hear from a governor who signed three rounds of corporate income tax cuts during her first 18 months in office, reducing state revenue collection from businesses by 28% last year, or $212 million. That’s money that could be used to help people afford health care. Instead, Sanders is looking for ways to cut health spending to make budgetary room for more tax cuts and school vouchers.
She’s looking to implement a Medicaid work requirement expected to kick thousands of poor and working Arkansans off their insurance in advance of the nationwide changes in the federal Trump bill. She’s made Arkansas one of two states in the country that yank Medicaid coverage away from new mothers just two months after birth (the 48 other states extend coverage to 12 months postpartum). And the bill that just passed Congress is going to cut Medicaid further over the next few years.
Americans are understandably furious at the insurance industry. Polls have shown a substantial minority of people are sympathetic to Luigi Mangione, the man who allegedly killed UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson on the street in Manhattan in December. But the rot of the health care system goes far beyond greedy insurance companies. It’s just as much about doctors incentivized to perform unnecessary tests, hospitals that bill at wildly inflated rates for routine procedures, nursing homes seeking new ways to squeeze profit from residents and overworked CNAs, drugmakers and medical supply companies that game the system, and on and on.
Now, Republican policies are driving health insurance prices upward even further. With her acutely tuned PR antennae, Sanders knows the public anger is there. With her bluster and misdirection, she’s working hard to make sure none of that anger is pointed her way.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_4531-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-18 05:57:12.008052

As a child, I had a great deal of anxiety. If you’ve ever seen me speak in public, that might surprise you. But anxiety among children is extremely common and affects almost all children, to varying degrees.
During pre-pandemic times, researchers noted that as many as 7% of children had a diagnosable anxiety disorder that disrupted their everyday functioning. In addition, 20% had a tendency to feel anxious that didn’t rise to the level of a clinical disorder. And all children feel anxious at some time or another.
Most researchers have found that anxiety in children increased during and after the pandemic. Lockdowns that isolated children from their peers and interruptions to their routines may have accounted for the findings in these studies.
As a researcher who’s studied children’s mental health for decades, I know that predictability helps prevent anxiety in children. Predictability means things going along as they’ve always gone: sleep at night, up in the morning, cornflakes for breakfast, off to school, activities in the afternoon, dinner with the family. In Louise Fitzhugh’s children’s novel “Harriet the Spy,” Harriet’s mother can’t believe that her daughter always takes a tomato sandwich to school. Always. Harriet has no interest in variety. She’s perfectly happy with the same sandwich, year after year.
Anxiety will crop up for many children again this fall, and it can be intertwined with other feelings, such as excitement and shyness. Here are steps parents can take to help reduce their kids’ back-to-school anxiety and encourage a better start to the fall term.
1. Look for general symptoms of anxiety

	
Ask your kids how they’re feeling about going back to school, and keep an eye out for headaches, stomachaches, sleeping troubles, persistent “what if” questions, crankiness, excessive concern about very distant events, problems focusing on schoolwork and concerns that aren’t alleviated by logical explanations. An example might be your children worrying that they won’t have friends in school, even though they do have friends from their class last year; or concerns that while they’re at school, something extremely unlikely will happen, such as the house being hit by lightning.
What’s tricky, of course, is that any of these behaviors can be an indication of many different problems, so probe further. Talking to your kids about their thoughts may help you unravel whether they’re feeling anxious.
 2. Encourage activities that reduce anxiety

Playing outside, playing with friends or even just “hanging out” can be powerful ways to reduce negative feelings. Outdoors, people often feel more relaxed. Playing in an unstructured way – that is, without someone else telling them what or how to play – allows kids to work through their feelings and reduce anxiety.
 3. Limit kids’ screen time

Researchers have found that, post-pandemic, more children are using different types of digital devices, along with more social media apps. The significant body of evidence finding a link between excessive digital device use and anxiety suggests that these increases in device use may contribute to increased anxiety rates in children.
 4. Focus on family activities

The emotional connection that children have with their families is their psychological anchor during difficult times. At a time of increased stress and uncertainty, spending time with family can be an antidote. Take a walk or a hike together, eat dinner together, or play board games.
 5. Embrace distraction

Distraction isn’t a cure for anxiety, but it can diminish its intensity and help sufferers think more clearly about the source of their worries. When children are feeling very anxious, it’s fine to talk to them about how watching TV or reading a funny book can help them feel calmer.
 6. Get professional help when needed

If your child’s anxiety is interfering with sleep, eating, socializing or school attendance, and it persists beyond a few days, it’s a good idea to call your pediatrician or family doctor and report what’s going on. Medical professionals who work with children have seen anxiety skyrocket among kids, and they know how to get your child the necessary help.
As with any back-to-school season, you may find yourself shopping for binders and backpacks. However, children and their anxiety may also need your attention. Practicing simple prevention and intervening when necessary can get your kids off to a great school year.

This is the question Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows kept asking during discussions of President Donald Trump’s efforts to change the voting process at the conference of the National Association of Secretaries of State, the oldest nonpartisan professional organization for public officials, in Biloxi, Mississippi earlier this month. 
The day after it ended, Aug. 8, Bellows officially responded to the U.S. Department of Justice’s request for sweeping voter data, questioning the federal agency’s intentions and asking that the request be withdrawn. She has yet to receive a response. 
“What we’re seeing right now is a dramatic expansion in federal power, coming from the Trump administration, over the states and the people that upends the very concept of our democratic republic,” Bellows said in a sit-down with Maine Morning Star after the conference. “Anyone who cares about states’ rights and individual freedom should be concerned about federal agencies engaged in an unprecedented power grab.”
Bellows, a Democrat who is running for governor in 2026, said she was reassured to hear from secretaries on both sides of the aisle who are concerned about federal intrusion into elections, which are administered by the states, not the federal government, under the U.S. Constitution.  
But she returned from the conference with more questions than answers regarding the Trump administration’s intentions and the repercussions of some secretaries embracing the federal requests.
Proof of citizenship
Trump wants Congress to pass a national proof of citizenship voter registration requirement and in March tried to unilaterally impose one for federal elections through executive order, but the legislation stalled and the order was halted by the courts. 
Some states have individually passed laws to require documented proof of citizenship to vote, including New Hampshire and Wyoming, whose secretaries of state presented at the conference. A federal judge dismissed a lawsuit against Wyoming’s law in July. Two lawsuits filed against New Hampshire’s law are still pending in federal district court. 
“All of us agree that only citizens should vote in federal elections. That’s in the Constitution. That’s not the debate,” Bellows said. 
Rather, Bellows’ concern is how added requirements would work in practice and, she expects, could create barriers for legitimate voters, particularly in a state like Maine with sizable rural, low-income and senior populations. 
Already, people registering to vote must sign a statement affirming they are citizens under penalty of perjury. Noncitizens who register to vote or cast a ballot face criminal penalties and deportation. 
One study of the 2016 election estimated the prevalence of noncitizen voting at 0.0001% of votes cast. However, conservatives in Maine and elsewhere have shared unsubstantiated claims of noncitizen voting.
“Then the concern becomes, from a very practical place, what is the impact on actual citizens and their constitutional right to vote?” Bellows said. 
In New Hampshire, some legitimate voters have been turned away due to the new requirements. Bellows, who oversees Maine’s Bureau of Motors Vehicles, says insight into potential impact in Maine can be gleaned from the rollout of Real ID requirements, which she says have tripped up long-time Mainers while being easier for new citizens who have their documents readily available.  
For example, she said, some people who grew up in Aroostook or Washington counties were born in Canada because the nearest hospital was across the border, so birth certificates aren’t a document they can use for citizenship proof. 
“We have heard from dozens of customers who have complained that it has sometimes taken them many months or almost a year to get certified birth certificates from other states if they were born out of state,” Bellows said, “or marriage information from other states. Particularly people who’ve experienced both marriage and divorce, those documents may not be documents that they have kept.”   
Seniors are the least likely to have that documented proof, partly because of higher likelihood of misplacement or damage over time, Bellows said, plus the added barrier of having to pay to get new copies. 
“Ironically, some of these policies are most likely to disproportionately impact senior citizens living in rural areas, which predominantly voted for Trump in the last election,” she said. 
With federal legislation and the executive order stalled, the Trump administration is attempting a backdoor way to accomplish its goal of requiring documented proof of citizenship for voting, Maine Morning Star’s partner outlet reports.  
The Trump administration is urging states to use an existing federal immigration database, called the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) program, that it has refashioned into a platform to verify voters’ citizenship. 
Originally intended to help state and local officials verify the immigration status of people seeking government benefits, searching one name at a time, SAVE can now do bulk searches, allowing for the scanning of full voter rolls. These changes also come as the U.S. Department of Justice is asking Maine and other states for copies of their voter rolls. 
Bellows told Stateline she had a recent phone call with officials at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security who said the agency planned to retain SAVE data for 10 years for “audit purposes only.”
“Just like the [Justice Department] is asking us to hand over an electronic file of all the voters in our state, it seems like the Department of Homeland Security is through this backdoor system also asking us to share voter information about every voter in our state,” Bellows told Stateline. 
Voting equipment
Another possible change to elections discussed at the conference was also part of Trump’s executive order but hasn’t drawn as much attention: directing the independent Election Assistance Commission to amend a set of security benchmarks for voting machines.
Donald Palmer, commissioner of the Election Assistance Commission who was nominated to the role by Trump in 2019, gave a presentation on how the commission is trying to implement the order by amending the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines to require paper ballots and remove bar codes and QR codes, which could lead to the decertification of certain voting systems.  
“The concern about that is that seems to be a path to decertifying the election or challenging legitimate election results held by the states,” Bellows said. 
Bellows sees the move as a way the Trump administration is setting the stage for more federal intervention in future elections. 
As a member of the elections committee of National Association of Secretaries of State, Bellows said she and other secretaries continue to meet every other week, sometimes more frequently as issues emerge, to press state and federal officials on the reasoning behind voting and election changes. 
When asked about other proactive measures she is taking, Bellows said she hopes to keep the state on its current path.
“Our greatest defense against what the federal government seems to be trying to do to undermine voter confidence and take over aspects of our elections is to continue to run really great elections,” she said.

(VCU Capital News Service)The Virginia Department of Energy has officially gotten word that funding for the Solar for All program — which aimed to help lower- and moderate-income households build solar panels on their roofs — has been rescinded by the federal government.
Virginia had been awarded $156 million that would have aided an estimated 15,000 households install rooftop solar or buy into community solar projects. The state had not started rolling out the program or taken applications yet.
The program that started under the Biden administration would have provided $7 billion to states to implement it. The funding was clawed back under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, as part of government efficiency and the rollback of renewable energy programs enforced by President Donald Trump’s administration. 
“The bottom line again is this: EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a video posted to X. “With clear language and intent from Congress in the One Big Beautiful Bill, EPA is taking action to end this program for good. We are committed to the rule of law and being a good steward of taxpayer dollars.”
Virginia had chosen to use the first year of funding to establish an avenue for implementing the program, meeting with stakeholders and formulating rules but had yet to select an administrator. Applications for the grants were going to open to the public in January. Now advocates for solar are frustrated over the loss.
“You know, having grown up in a low-income community, it’s just that same vicious cycle, right? Where folks say ‘we got this money, we’re gonna help you, we want to do this.’ And then at the 11th hour, it’s, you know, we ain’t got that no more,” said Branden Praileau, the Virginia Program Director at Solar United Neighbors.  ”It’s another sad commentary of the most marginalized and the most energy burdened, continuing to be left behind.”
Praileau explained that disadvantaged families would have benefitted from solar panels on their roofs by offsetting their energy bills with the production of energy from the panels. However much energy the panels produced would be subtracted from their energy bills each month.
“The ability to reduce that energy burden by offsetting what they produce versus what they consume, literally puts money back in people’s pockets,” Praileau said. ”I can speak from a life experience there. Since we’ve been solar at my church, we’ve been able to take the 25-30% that we’ve been saving yearly in energy, and roll it into outreach ministry.”
Richard Borean, a spokesperson for the Virginia Department of Energy, said that approximately $730,000 had been spent so far during the planning period and will still be covered by the funding previously awarded. The federal government will take back the rest of the unspent award. The department is in the process of creating a webpage called “Virginia Energy Connect,”  a one-stop-shop that will allow homeowners to find energy programs they qualify for cohesively. The site is expected to launch in the coming months.
Borean also highlighted efforts by the state to invest in an “all of the above” energy profile through renewable energy, nuclear, grid reliability, etc.
The reconciliation bill that was signed into law on July 4 also does away with the 30% tax credit for the installation of solar panels on homes starting at the end of this year. Praileau said this will create even more barriers for homeowners who are interested in solar for their homes but don’t have the means to pursue it without grants and tax credits.
Praileau said the rooftop solar projects would have helped cash-strapped households get repairs to their roofs for installation. He also pointed out that many of the homes that would have qualified for this funding have not been updated in decades and don’t have ways to become more energy efficient to lower their power bills.
Clean energy advocates have said they plan to appeal the decision to end the program since the money had already been allocated to the 60 recipients.

(Getty Images)Longtime Utility Consumer Counselor William Fine is leaving his post effective Aug. 31 — setting up an opportunity for Gov. Mike Braun to have a direct impact on utility issues in the state.
Fine has led the Office of Utility Consumer Counselor (OUCC) since 2017. The agency represents all Indiana consumers to “ensure quality, reliable utility services at the most reasonable prices possible through dedicated advocacy, consumer education and creative problem solving,” its website said.
Fine was appointed the 24th Utility Consumer Counselor for the state by then-Gov. Eric Holcomb and was reappointed in December 2020.
He led a staff of more than 50 professionals including attorneys, analysts, engineers, and additional employees who represent Indiana’s residential, commercial, and industrial ratepayer interests in state and federal utility regulatory proceedings.
Fine is retiring after 45 years of practicing law. Before joining the OUCC, he served in the Indiana House of Representatives and was a member of the Lake County Election and Voter Registration Board, the Indiana Public Defender Commission and the Board of Managers for the Lake County Bar Association.
His bio on the OUCC site said he is a former vice president and treasurer of the National Association of State Utility Consumer Advocates and currently serves on its executive committee.  Fine was a member of Indiana’s 21st Century Energy Policy Development Task Force and was on the Critical Consumer Issues Forum Advisory Committee.
A Lake County native, Fine holds degrees from the Maurer School of Law, Purdue University and Indiana University.
Gov. Mike Braun will appoint his successor.
The Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) will also be getting a new leader soon.
Current IURC Chairman Jim Huston announced his retirement in May. He plans to step down in January 2026 after more than a decade with the agency.

States and clinicians are working on getting correct information on vaccines to vulnerable groups amid shifting federal guidance. (Photo illustration by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Heading into the respiratory illness season, states and clinicians are working to encourage pregnant patients to get COVID-19 vaccinations, even though the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services no longer recommends that they should.
Along with being older and having an underlying health condition, pregnancy itself is a risk factor. Pregnant women are more vulnerable to developing severe illness from COVID-19. They’re also at high risk for complications, including preterm labor and stillbirth. The vast majority of medical experts say getting the shot is safe and effective — much safer than having the illness.
But HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced in May that the agency would no longer recommend that pregnant women get the vaccine. Before testifying before Congress in June, Kennedy circulated a document on Capitol Hill claiming higher rates of fetal loss after vaccination. But the authors of those studies told Politico that their work had been misinterpreted.
Experts say the federal shift puts the onus on state health agencies to ramp up vaccine guidance and outreach. Clinicians and public health organizations are trying to dispel misinformation and make sure information reaches low-income people and people of color, who had higher maternal death rates during the pandemic. During the first two years of the pandemic, the virus contributed to a quarter of maternal deaths, according to federal data.
“We are severely disappointed,” said Dr. Neil Silverman, a professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California, Los Angeles David Geffen School of Medicine. He has studied vaccines and pregnancy for the past 15 years and specializes in high-risk pregnancies.
Silverman called the federal shift a “public health tragedy on a grand scale.”
Health groups urge insurers to cover COVID-19 shots for pregnant women

Vaccinations against COVID-19 help prevent severe illness in pregnant people as well as their newborns, who are too young to get vaccinated, Silverman said. In what’s called passive immunity, vaccinated mothers pass on antibodies to their babies through the placenta and through breast milk.
“State public health agencies are probably going to have to implement vaccine guidance that differs from the federal recommendations. And that’s going to be an interesting can of worms,” said OB-GYN Dr. Mark Turrentine, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas.
Turrentine serves on a board of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists that focuses on immunization and infectious diseases. He said his recent pregnant patients who had COVID-19 hadn’t gotten the vaccine.
“The change in guidance on the federal level just really makes a lot of confusion, and it makes it very challenging to try to explain to individuals why all of a sudden the difference,” Turrentine said.
A slew of public health organizations have been making a concerted effort to dispel vaccine myths. They include the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit organization of maternal-fetal experts. At a news briefing the society held this month, clinicians stressed the safety and long-standing science behind COVID-19 vaccines, as well as the shots for RSV and the flu. Cases of RSV and the flu tend to peak in the winter months, while in recent years COVID-19 cases have spiked in the summer and the winter.
Dr. Brenna Hughes, an OB-GYN who chairs the organization’s infectious diseases and emerging threats committee, pointed to survey data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing that less than a third of eligible pregnant patients received COVID-19 shots, and only 38% received RSV shots for the 2023 to 2024 season. Less than half — 47% — received flu shots, and 59% received TDAP (whooping cough) vaccines.
CDC data shows that for last year’s and this year’s season, only between 12% and 14% of pregnant patients got the COVID-19 vaccine.
“The complications from the infection are so much greater than the complications and the very few and typically minor adverse events that might occur from the vaccine,” said microbiologist Sabra Klein, a professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
In June, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and 30 other professional health organizations signed a letter urging insurers to continue covering the COVID-19 shot for pregnant women, and have continued to urge coverage since then.
CVS Caremark, one of the nation’s three major pharmacy benefit managers, told Stateline it will continue covering the vaccine for pregnant women. The Arizona, California and North Carolina state Medicaid agencies also told Stateline they are still currently covering COVID-19 vaccines for pregnant women.
Black maternal health advocates, researchers press on amid federal funding cuts

Dr. Kimberly Fortner, president-elect of the Infectious Diseases Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology, said during the maternal-fetal medicine briefing that she hopes medical groups’ joint messaging will bolster insurers.
“Hopefully by us linking arms, that can then help develop consistency so that insurers will continue to pay for the vaccine,” she said.
Exacerbating disparities
Dr. Ayanna Bennett, director of the District of Columbia Department of Health, said the federal government’s new stance has upended “a system that’s been stable for a very long time.”
Bennett said her agency used federal pandemic aid to shore up vaccine outreach efforts to communities of color. Now that flow of money is ending.
The changes in federal guidance and funding will “almost certainly exacerbate” maternal health disparities, said Marie Thoma, a perinatal epidemiologist and an associate professor in the University of Maryland Department of Family Science who researches pregnancy and COVID-19.
Black and Indigenous women died at higher rates. The virus exacerbated existing racial disparities in maternal health — and created new ones: Latina mothers, who generally see low rates of maternal mortality, saw deaths surge to 28 per 100,000 in 2021. Their rate was about 12 per 100,000 in 2018, according to federal data.
“We are going in with some exposure already that we didn’t have during the start of the pandemic. So, there will be some protection, but now that will erode,” said Thoma. “If we’re not getting vaccines, or if people are hesitant to take them, we could see some increase.”
Silverman said the administration’s efforts to strip mentions of race from government policies makes it difficult for institutions to reach populations at greatest risk. He called the dismissal of decades of data “saddening and infuriating.”
“The politicization of the vaccine process, or access to it, is what concerns me the most,” said Dr. Yvette Martas, a Connecticut OB-GYN who chairs the board of directors of the Hispanic Health Council.
Many women “are trying to navigate an economic system that’s not always in their favor in terms of also providing access to the kind of educational material that they need,” she said.
Not just COVID-19
In June, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee, replacing them with some members who are vaccine skeptics.
The change is creating chaos. Some states have vaccine laws, such as mandates for kids and coverage statutes, that are specifically tied to the committee’s decisions.











The politicization of the vaccine process, or access to it, is what concerns me the most.


– Dr. Yvette Martas, a Connecticut OB-GYN who chairs the board of directors of the Hispanic Health Council



The Vaccine Integrity Project at the University of Minnesota called on frontline health workers, health officials and professional societies to “counter the spread of inaccurate and confusing vaccine information.”
At a news briefing this month held by the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, representatives from Alabama, Connecticut and Washington, D.C., said they will continue to recommend vaccines.
Alabama’s state health officer, Dr. Scott Harris, said clinicians will be instrumental in getting correct vaccination information to patients.
“We don’t think that we necessarily have the same authoritative voice that we might have had a decade ago in trying to guide people in what to do, but we do believe that people trust their health care providers in most cases and are certainly willing to listen to them,” he said at the briefing.
Bennett said she is hopeful that strong, consistent messaging from respected medical organizations will help combat confusion.
“Having established groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics or the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology make very firm recommendations that keep us essentially not changed from where we have been, I think, should reassure families,” she said.

Amber Roldan/Georgia RecorderCanceled pride graduation celebrations. Eliminated resource centers for LGBTQ students. Tighter rules for using a preferred name on class rosters and student IDs. These are some of the casualties on Georgia college campuses as a national push to erase DEI initiatives and programs takes hold.
University System of Georgia schools across the state have adopted a variety of changes in response to a flurry of federal orders from the Trump administration. Republican state lawmakers have also pursued a ban on DEI programs and policies in Georgia’s public schools and universities. 
Georgia Southern was one of the first universities in the state to roll back DEI initiatives according to Chanel Haley, deputy director with Georgia Equality, which advocates on behalf of LGBTQ Georgians. Concerned students reached out to Haley after the school cancelled graduation ceremonies that previously celebrated the achievements of LGBTQ+ students.
“I think that people need to realize it’s harm for everybody, not just LGBTQ students,” Haley said about DEI rollbacks.
In Atlanta, Georgia Tech dissolved their LGBTQIA+ Resource Center, Women’s Resource Center and Black Culture, Innovation and Technology team and moved them under the university’s Arts, Belonging and Community Department.
“Every university had a DEI office, and now we don’t, that’s a 180 degree turn,” said Matthew Boedy, who is president of the Georgia chapter of the American Association of University Professors. 
‘A place they can go’ 
With a student population over 45,000, Kennesaw State University is one of the larger public universities in the metro Atlanta area. Located towards the north end of Cobb County, KSU’s wider community has earned a progressive reputation in recent years. New policies at KSU have inspired a wave of opposition on and off campus as the community continues to express disappointment. 
Some of the changes have affected programs and policies that once benefited LGBTQ+ students. 
Ames West, a KSU senior, grew up in an evangelical household where being a part of the LGBTQ+ community was considered a “grave sin.” At KSU, West became a familiar face at the LGBTQ+ resource center and befriended numerous peers who shared similar stories. 
Last spring, KSU internally announced that the center would no longer cater specifically to LGBTQ+ students and would be rebranded as a part of a new Department of Student Engagement and Support. 
“This shift includes reorganizing various student programs into targeted support hubs focused on key areas like career readiness, academic success, mentorship, and well-being. KSU remains committed to student success, transparency throughout the transition, and full compliance with federal, state, and University System of Georgia guidelines,” KSU’s assistant vice president of communications, Tammy DeMel, said.
As someone who visited the resource center up to three times a week, West worried about friends and students who would no longer have a place to be themselves. Fueled by fear, West helped mobilize the Kennesaw Pride Alliance, a support network for LGBTQ+ KSU students, to look for solutions.
“I just couldn’t sit back and do nothing,” West said.
“We don’t care how much it costs, we don’t care how much it takes, we’re going to make sure our community on campus has a place they can go that has the support they need so that they do not feel left alone or like no one’s there to help them,” West added.
After spending the better part of their summer searching for a LGBTQ+ friendly space on campus, the alliance opened the doors to their new Kennesaw Pride Center in late July.
The new location is on the top floor of Kennesaw’s First United Lutheran Church, and the alliance hopes the student-run community hub and pride center becomes an inclusive spot for KSU’s LGBTQ+ community. 
Decorated with colorful flags, posters and an assortment of thrifted furniture, the center is ready to welcome students back to campus this fall. While the center will serve as a refuge to visitors in between classes, the alliance also plans to use the space to host social events including their annual pride gala.
Preferred name changes
Evelyn Priddy, a transgender sophomore studying computer engineering, expects to be directly affected by a new preferred name policy at KSU.
The change stems from a University System of Georgia policy. According to the USG Business Procedures Manual, the policy aims “to respect individuals’ preferred names while providing consistent identity management standards and reducing the risk of fraud by impersonation.”
USG notified institution presidents of the change last November and policy enforcement began July 1. Critics worry that the change has the potential of outing transgender students who no longer use their government-recognized names. 
Some transgender people refer to the names they were assigned at birth as “dead names.” For many, being referred to by a dead name can be hurtful or bring back painful memories. 
In previous years, KSU students hoping to go by a different name could submit a request to use a preferred name. Once approved, this name replaced the legal name associated with student registration. While official transcripts and degrees would still use the legal name, the policy allowed preferred names to display on student IDs and class rosters. 
Policy enforcement will now require a student’s preferred name to be placed in parentheses next to their legal name on all identifying documents.
“My legal name is going to be on every roster because I can’t file the forms to change it fast,” Priddy said. “I mean at this point I’m just gonna have to explain it. I hope I’ll be okay, but also, you could see how that could be a bit of a safety risk.”
For transgender students like Priddy who were given a name at birth that they no longer identify with, pursuing a legal name change is one of the only options. 
A legal name change process in Georgia is often a time-consuming ordeal. From paperwork to notary requirements and legal publishing policies, a name change can take weeks and become a costly feat. In Cobb County, notices must be published in the county’s local newspaper to notify community members that a petition to change a legal name has been filed. These notices must be published once every four weeks to meet the legal requirement.
In an effort to assist students directly affected by the new policy, The Southern Legal Center for Youth partnered with student organizations to host a virtual name change clinic to help students seeking a legal name change start the process.
Liz Harding Chao, the center’s founder and president created the organization after noticing a lack of local legal representation for youth in the South. As a LGBTQ+-led organization, the group noticed an increased need for legal assistance with name changes and offered support to KSU students. 
“For a lot of trans and gender-expansive folks, their dead name has a lot of baggage associated with it. It’s from a time that they often rather not remember or think about it,” Harding Chao said. 
Clinic clients represent themselves but law students and attorneys from the center help clients fill out the appropriate paperwork. The center also helps interested applicants fill out a poverty affidavit to combat any financial barriers.
Last week, KSU’s virtual clinic served seven students and accumulated a wait list with an additional 10. While the clinic helped students start the process of officially registering their preferred name, the legal change will not be completed before the first day of classes.

Chris Sununu, about 50 police departments are engaged in the accreditation process, according to John Scippa, the PSTC’s director. (Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)For decades, the Derry Police Department operated without accreditation. Officers followed policies  — some codified, others unwritten — intended to align with national standards. But no external organization audited and validated what was done.
Derry was not alone; despite the existence of a national accreditation organization since 1979, most New Hampshire law enforcement agencies have not sought or received accreditation.
But in January, that changed, when Derry obtained accreditation through a new program run by the state’s Police Standards and Training Council. It was the first New Hampshire law enforcement agency to do so.
Now, the department has a certification indicating it has implemented policies on areas ranging from reporting police misconduct, to arrest procedures, to social media use. And it must continually update those policies to address any changes from the state agency.
“They’re a living, breathing document. The standards change all the time,” said Derry Police Chief George Feole in an interview. “So that’s something that we need to be cognizant of.”
Derry’s embrace of the new program comes as part of a shift in policing in the state. Three years after the state accreditation process was created by executive order by Gov. Chris Sununu, about 50 police departments are engaged in the accreditation process, according to John Scippa, the PSTC’s director.
That 50 represents just a quarter of the more than 220 departments Scippa says exist in New Hampshire. But it is a jump up from the 15 departments that had begun accreditation in June 2024.
Today, four police departments have fully obtained the credential, Scippa says: Derry, Bow, Stratham, and Gilford. 
The PSTC is using word of mouth among police chiefs to try to drum up all interest. Enticing all agencies is still a challenge, Scippa said.
“Accreditation is important,” Scippa said in an interview. “We think it speaks to professionalizing (policing) across our state. But you know, we’re also very cognizant of the fact that there’s some agencies that are still, you know, down significantly with regard to just basic staffing.”
Born out of a recommendation by the Commission on Law Enforcement Accountability, Community, and Transparency (LEACT), the state accreditation committee came as part of a broader interest in police accountability. LEACT itself was created by Sununu in the wake of the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020. 
The wave of protests calling for police reform inspired many New Hampshire departments to implement new policies, officials say — for instance, prohibitions of the type of chokehold that caused Floyd’s death. And the movement spurred departments’ interest in accreditation as a way to validate those changes.
“CALEA looked at policies on neck restraints, vascular neck restraints, chokeholds, all those kinds of things,” said Capt. John Lavoie of the Durham Police Department, speaking on the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies. 
“They rolled out an update and said, basically, all organizations need to have these changes. You need to prohibit this. We were already doing that here at Durham PD, so we’re proud of that, that we had already had prohibitions on that.”
But some saw the national accreditation process run by CALEA as expensive and onerous. CALEA certifications require four years of audits and compliance, which in turn can necessitate an increase in police bureaucracy and travel to conferences and trainings. For smaller departments, that can be prohibitive.
To address that burden, the LEACT recommended the creation of a state accreditation process that could be a cheaper, shorter, and less demanding alternative. Sununu’s executive order made New Hampshire one of 36 states to create police accreditation commissions, and pushed the Police Standards and Training Council to develop its own accreditation requirements for departments, separate from the CALEA ones.
“When we designed the accreditation program here, we made sure that the ability to become state-level accredited would not be prohibitive for smaller agencies that may not have, like physical infrastructure,” Scippa said.
Today, the PSTC has a 99-page document outlining a number of required policies for department certification. Some touch on how departments must report police officers who have been investigated for misconduct to the exculpatory evidence schedule known as the “Laurie List.” Others dictate how strip and body cavity searches, no-knock warrants, and arrests should be used and handled. 
In order to receive accreditation, departments must develop those policies and put them in writing. Then, they must pass an audit run by state volunteers in which the policies are examined and department staff are interviewed.
For Derry, that process meant some policies that were not in writing needed to be codified, and others that were already written down needed to be amended, Feole said.
“We’ve always conducted ourselves in the professional fashion and done things according to what we call the national standard, the best practices,” Feole said. “What we did is codified everything and sought accreditation review from the state, and the state said, ‘Yes, in fact, you do meet all these standards.’”
Feole, who became police chief in 2022, said he is unaware of why Derry did not seek CALEA certification in the years earlier. But he said since obtaining the state certification, the department is planning to begin the process to be CALEA-accredited by next year, and that he has set aside funds to do so in the department’s budget.
Some New Hampshire police departments are choosing the national accreditation over the state option. Durham, which has been CALEA-certified since 1996, and has been awarded a “Certificate of Meritorious Accreditation” by CALEA for holding its accreditation for at least 15 years, is one of them. 
Lavoie said the department has determined that applying for the state accreditation would be an unnecessary cost. Following the CALEA standards has allowed Durham to stay up to date on policing, and has helped the department’s standing in the community, Lavoie said.
For instance Durham police officers are trained to not engage in high-speed pursuits except in extreme circumstances, Lavoie said, a direct result of CALEA certification. 
In early August, Todd Selig, Durham town administrator, accompanied some members of the Durham Police Department to a CALEA convention in Little Rock, Arkansas, where the department formally received its four-year re-accreditation.
“What makes me most proud, though, is not just the paperwork, the reports, or our compliance with CALEA’s high standards, although all those things matter,” Selig said in a speech at that convention. “It’s the authentic way our officers and staff connect to the people we serve, such that the department is deeply woven into the daily fabric of Durham.” 
There are legal benefits to certification, too, Lavoie and Feole say. Having updated policies can help officers avoid misconduct, can lower insurance costs, and can help departments if they are sued, he said.
“If we were to ever be sued for anything, these policies would be reviewed,” Feole said. Showing that we meet national and best practices in state best practices is going to be beneficial to us.”
Both accreditation processes require that police departments conduct anti-bias training for officers.  New Hampshire lawmakers have recently passed legislation in House Bill 2, the budget trailer bill, banning “diversity, equity, and inclusion” programs in state and local governments. The new law states that “no state funds shall be expended for DEI-related activities, including but not limited to implicit bias training” and other programs.
But Scippa argued the anti-bias trainings required in the state accreditation process would not be affected by that law and would be allowed to continue.
“We have to make sure that the police are not acting in a biased manner, whatever bias that might be,” he said. 
The New Hampshire Speaker’s Office did not reply to a request for comment Friday about the intended effect of the anti-DEI law. 
Scippa and other law enforcement officials say they hope interest in accreditation will spread to the other 150 departments over time. But they acknowledged the process is voluntary, and that some agencies may not have the resources.
“Every department, in my opinion, should seek accreditation and improve accountability to the public,” said Feole. “That’s something that’s kind of on the forefront of everybody’s mind nowadays. It improves community relations. It builds trust in the community. It makes for a better relationship between the agency and the public.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/standardssign-1024x723.jpg,,,2025-08-18 05:57:12.008052

(Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)Test wells at the Franklin County prison site yielded far less water than a typical home needs, much less a 3,000-bed prison, records show — and at least one state legislator took notice.
Well construction reports obtained from the Arkansas Department of Agriculture’s Well Water Commission show the two wells drilled at the site on Aug. 1 yielded two gallons of water per minute and ten gallons of water per hour, respectively.
According to the New York State Department of Health, well yield “is a sustainable rate of water flow, usually expressed in gallons per minute (gpm), that a well can draw continuously over an extended period.”
The typical home needs six to 12 gallons of water per minute.
According to Arkansas Department of Health records, each of the four water wells supplying water to the DOC’s Tucker Unit uses 51.9 gpm on average, or 207.63 gpm across all four. The Tucker Unit is a 2,000-bed facility.
The well reports contradict what representatives from Vanir, the firm contracted to manage the prison construction, told the Board of Corrections about the test well flow rates at the beginning of the month. In their report to the board, Vanir said the test wells were yielding 15-16 gallons a minute and 5 gallons a minute, also noting that those numbers were preliminary.
The board authorized spending $50,000 to drill the wells in June, part of preliminary site work to determine whether the land can support the prison, which was not done prior to the state’s purchase of the Franklin County property.
Arkansas corrections board orders wells to be drilled at Franklin County prison site

Critics of the prison plan have questioned whether local infrastructure is capable of supporting the site’s water and wastewater needs since Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced the land purchase last Halloween.
The site is roughly 26 miles from Fort Smith and 19 miles from Ozark. Fort Smith said earlier this summer that it could not support the prison’s water or wastewater needs. Ozark passed a resolution in February saying the town of 3,601 people couldn’t either, noting the prison would put substantial strain on its budget and infrastructure if the project moved forward.
Corrections board Chairman Benny Magness seemed to acknowledge the dwindling options for utilities for the project when the drilling was approved in June, saying that if the test wells proved unsatisfactory, the board would likely need to begin exploring other site options for the prison.
Magness did not respond to a request for comment for this story.
Department of Corrections spokesperson Rand Champion did not answer specific questions about the discrepancy or why it arose other than to say that all numbers are preliminary.
“At this time, all the reports and numbers we have are preliminary,” Champion said in an email. “Once those reports are finalized, it will give the Board and the Department a better idea of what we’re dealing with and next steps.”
Once the reports are finalized, Champion said, the results will be analyzed to determine “next steps.” However, much will depend on the architectural and engineering contract, he added. That contract still hasn’t been approved by the Arkansas Legislative Council.
During an ALC meeting Friday, Sen. Gary Stubblefield, R-Branch, referenced the discrepancy in the yield amounts when questioning DOC Chief Financial Officer Chad Brown as the council considered approval of a routine on-call engineering contract.
“We’re getting so much misinformation, that I would like to know why, why you guys can’t get your facts straight,” said Stubblefield, who has been a vocal opponent of the Franklin County site.
DOC Chief of Staff Wade Hodge told Stubblefield he got his information about the test wells from Vanir and didn’t know about the other flow numbers.
Arkansas officials ‘kept in the dark’ over state’s land purchase for new prison

Adam Watson, another prison opponent who recently sent legislators a request for an investigation into the prison site selection process, said that regardless of what the correct yield number is, it won’t be enough to supply the prison.
“There’s no, no reality where those wells are capable of fulfilling the needs,” Watson said in an interview last week. “So the last ditch effort will be going to Ozark to see if they can pull water from there, which Ozark City Council has passed a resolution stating that the city is against this project and the way that it’s been handled.”
Watson said that if the state had done its “due diligence” before committing to the Franklin County property, everyone would have been better off.
“If they would have done their due diligence to start with … we wouldn’t be sitting here a year later with the most basic question about building a new prison still unanswered: Where the hell is the water going to come from?”

President Donald Trump’s administration has ordered some retiring coal plants to stay online, even as they have struggled to remain economically viable. (Photo by Liam Niemeyer/Kentucky Lantern) Mandates from President Donald Trump’s administration to retain aging coal plants could cause a massive spike in energy costs, according to an independent analysis commissioned by several environmental groups.
Orders from the U.S. Department of Energy to save coal plants from retirement could cost ratepayers more than $3 billion per year, according to a report from Grid Strategies, a power sector consulting firm. It was carried out on behalf of Earthjustice, Environmental Defense Fund, Natural Resources Defense Council and Sierra Club.
Under Trump, the agency has issued emergency orders to maintain operations at coal plants that were scheduled for retirement. While federal officials say the coal plants need to stay online to avoid blackouts, power plant owners and state regulators planned their closures because they were no longer economically viable or needed for reliability.
“DOE mandates override those well-informed decisions, inflating electric bills for homeowners and businesses and undermining the competitiveness of U.S. factories and data centers,” the Grid Strategies analysis found.
Across the country, coal plants have phased out as they’ve struggled to compete with cheaper renewables and natural gas. A 2023 analysis by Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan think tank, found that 99% of existing U.S. coal plants “are more expensive to run than replacement by local wind, solar, and energy storage resources.”
But Trump, who has pushed to unleash more fossil fuel development and to stymie wind and solar, has ordered a retiring coal plant in Michigan to stay online, along with an oil and gas plant in Pennsylvania.
“Based on the trend to date and indications that DOE has approached the owners of many retiring fossil power plants about potentially mandating their retention, DOE may attempt to mandate the retention of nearly all large fossil power plants slated for retirement between now and the end of 2028,” reads the Grid Strategies report.
The cost of keeping those plants online would be immense. By 2028, if Trump were to mandate the retention of all fossil fuel plants slated for retirement, the annual cost to ratepayers would be more than $3.1 billion, the analysis found.
The report also considers a number of aging plants that are not yet scheduled for retirement. It finds Trump’s actions could create a “perverse incentive,” causing plant owners to claim they’re planning to shut down, inducing the feds to step in and keep them open, with the cost borne by ratepayers.
Accounting for that possibility, the report found that ratepayer costs could reach $5.9 billion per year to keep the entire aging fossil fuel fleet online. California, Texas and Colorado would see the highest increases in electricity bills.

In many cases, the increased costs they’ll face will be so big that more than 100,000 will lose their coverage, they warn.
However, Ohio U.S. Sens. Jon Husted and Bernie Moreno, both Republicans, won’t say whether they’ll act to renew the program.
The subsidy is known as the “enhanced premium tax credit.” It was created during the coronavirus pandemic to make insurance purchased on the marketplace created by the Affordable Care Act more affordable. 
It’s available to people making between 100% and 400% of federal poverty guidelines. For a family of three, that’s between $26,650 and $106,600 a year. Nearly 20 million Americans and 530,000 Ohioans receive it.
More than 90% of those who get insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace receive the subsidies, and they’re set to expire at the end of the year. 
The average recipient saves about $700 a year because of them, the Center for American Progress reported. But some save much more, meaning they have a lot more to lose.
“A typical 60-year-old couple making $82,000 … would see monthly marketplace premiums more than triple, from $581 to $2,111 — an annual increase of roughly $18,400,” the group reported late last year.
The subsidies are credited with helping to push the percentage of uninsured Americans to an all-time low. That might be why, after initially being skeptical of the Affordable Care Act, 66% of Americans had favorable views of the law by June 2025.
After attempting to repeal the Affordable Care Act in his first term, President Donald Trump has undertaken several other measures that some experts say will push the number of uninsured Americans up — a lot.
One is by cutting nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid spending over 10 years as part of his One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The law gives roughly the same amount in tax cuts to the richest 1% of Americans, and it adds $3.4 trillion to the deficit.
The Medicaid cuts are expected to add greatly to the ranks of the uninsured. KFF, an independent nonprofit, in June estimated that 11 million Americans would lose insurance because of them. In Ohio, 310,000 would lose insurance, increasing the rate of uninsured Ohioans by 3%, the organization estimated.
Emergency physicians have warned that creating huge numbers of newly uninsured people will strain hospital services for all patients — especially in rural areas where hospitals are already struggling.
ERs have to treat people regardless of their ability to pay. To cover those costs, hospitals will have to cut staff, leading to longer wait times, fewer services and negative health outcomes, the doctors say.
Expiration of the marketplace subsidies would make the numbers even more dire, experts warn. KFF estimates that between the loss of subsidies and the Trump Medicaid cuts, 16 million Americans will lose insurance, including 440,000 Ohioans.
If Congress allows the subsidies to expire at the end of 2025, those who receive them will feel the pain before those facing Medicaid cuts do. Medicaid work requirements — the biggest single way cuts to that program will be financed — don’t kick in until after next year’s midterm elections.
Americans for Healthy Communities, a nonprofit advocacy group, urged Congress to renew the insurance subsidies.
“By failing to renew the ACA’s premium tax credits, Republicans in Congress are jeopardizing the health of more than 500,000 Ohioans who rely on these credits to receive the care they need,” it said in a written statement. “We urge Congress, especially Ohio’s delegation, to quickly come to the table and work together on passing an extension of these tax credits before it’s too late. Congress still has a chance to renew the tax credits when they return in September — however, if they once again refuse to, millions will lose their coverage and millions more will face unaffordable, high premiums. The time to act is now.”
The offices of Husted and Moreno didn’t respond when asked whether they believed the insurance subsidies should be allowed to expire.

“I’m sure that part of the reason for us to continue to trail the country is because of the numerous service deserts, these are geographic areas where people do not have ready access to the necessities of life,” OACAA Executive Director Philip E. Cole said during a recent press conference.
This is the 32nd year the association, which represents 48 agencies across the state, has issued a State of Poverty report. 
A Delaware County resident is likely to live about 12 years longer than a Vinton County resident, according to the report. 
“These counties are separated by about 100 miles and 12 years,” Cole said. “12 years is a lot of life. This number reminds us that in too many cases, the life you live is determined at birth.” 
Poverty has many causes, he said.
“People like to say that poverty is about personal choices,” Cole said. “In most cases, that’s just wrong. It has nothing to do with the choices of those who live in poverty, as no one can choose their parents or their place of birth. It has to do with unequal access to the important resources people need to thrive in their life.” 
Service deserts 
There are 421 Census tracts across 72 of Ohio’s 88 counties that qualify as food deserts, according to the United States Department of Agriculture Access Research Atlas. 
Slightly more than 90% of those are in tracts where the poverty rate is above the state average and 41% are in tracts where the poverty rate is more than double the state average. 
Food deserts are geographic areas where residents have limited access to fresh produce, typically due to the lack of grocery stores or supermarkets. 
“Ohio’s service deserts disproportionately impact high-poverty communities in both urban and rural areas,” Cole said. “When families and whole communities have a difficult time accessing basic needs like food and medicine, that is normally a demonstration of lack of access to employment and other economic opportunities as well.” 
Cole slammed federal policy from the 1980s that no longer enforced anti-trust laws like the Robinson-Patman Act. 
“It kept small grocers, for example, and other small retailers in business by outlawing price discrimination, which could favor large retail businesses, especially chain stores, at the expense of the small retailers,” Cole said. “When this act ceased to be enforced, price discrimination was allowed to benefit the large corporate grocers and other retailers at the expense of small businesses.”
This wiped out small grocers and impacted low income areas the most, Cole said. 
“Food deserts are creations out of public policy,” Cole said. 
It’s not just food deserts, it’s also pharmacies. 
Ohio saw a 16% drop in retail pharmacies across the state from 2015 to 2024, according to the report. 
“Unregulated pharmacy benefit managers are simply allowed to put small pharmacies out of business with their payment structures,” Cole said. “People have less access to prescriptions and less access to those who understand the interaction of drugs.” 
There are also legal assistance deserts — 82 Ohio counties have less than one attorney per 700 residents, according to the report. 
Ohio has 13 maternity care deserts where there is limited or no access to maternity health care services, the report added.
Data from the report 
Athens County had the highest overall poverty rate with 25.3% and Scioto County had the highest family poverty rate with 17.6%. 
In highest overall poverty rate, Meigs County followed Athens with 20.8% and Mahoning and Pike counties were tied with 19.5%. 
Black Ohioans have the highest poverty rate at 26.9%, followed by Hispanic/Latinos at 21.7%.
Recommendations 
The OACAA had three possible solutions involving lawmakers at the state and federal level. 

Suggesting the Trump Administration enforce anti-trust laws like the Robinson-Patman Act to help bring small retailers back in business. 
Asking Ohio lawmakers to get rid of taxes on small business startups and offer them refundable tax credits for jobs they create with businesses they open in desert areas. 
Increasing the funding for Ohio food banks. 

“We need to make food available,” Cole said.

New Hampshire’s health care system is facing unprecedented challenges that could have major economic and personal consequences in the coming years. Changes in federal and state policy, combined with broader market pressures, are projected to result in significant coverage losses, higher costs, and reduced access to care — particularly in rural areas.
Nationally, that more than 15 million Americans could lose their health coverage in the coming year, including thousands of Granite Staters. Without insurance, individuals and families are more vulnerable to overwhelming medical bills when illness or injury strikes. Rising costs may also push more households into medical debt, strain family budgets, and limit access to lifesaving care. With nearly 184,000 Granite Staters — about 13.4% of the state’s population — relying on Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), cuts to Medicaid and ACA programs could cause thousands to lose access to essential care, destabilizing rural hospitals and escalating costs for everyone.
Coverage losses and rising costs
Proposed funding reductions to Medicaid — estimated at $1 trillion nationally over the next decade — could lead to increased out-of-pocket expenses for enrollees, including copays of up to $35 for doctor visits. This change would be particularly difficult for low-income families, people with disabilities, and rural residents who already face limited health care options.
Older adults may also face higher costs for prescription drugs and premiums. Without continued support for Medicare drug price negotiations, taxpayers could shoulder billions in additional costs, while low-income seniors may pay thousands more each year for necessary medications and services.
For individuals and families purchasing insurance on the open market, industry estimates suggest that premiums could rise by an average of 18 percent in the coming year. Without offsets such as tax credits, some households could see their coverage costs increase by more than 70%.
Economic ripple effects
When people lose coverage or face higher costs, they often delay or skip care. A survey of more than 1,300 New Hampshire adults, conducted in 2024, found that over two-thirds (69%) said they delayed or went without health care due to cost. This can lead to more severe health issues and greater long-term expenses.
Half of New Hampshire’s acute care hospitals — or 13 of 26 — serve rural communities and survive largely on Medicaid support. Those hospitals and clinics — especially in rural parts of New Hampshire — may be forced to close or reduce services, driving patients to more distant facilities. As demand concentrates in fewer locations, wait times and costs can increase for everyone.
Emergency rooms, often the provider of last resort, could become overcrowded with uninsured patients, adding financial pressure on hospitals and contributing to rising premiums for insured patients. Employers may also face higher health benefit costs, which could limit wage growth or lead to reduced hiring.
Impact on credit and financial stability
Medical debt remains a leading cause of personal financial hardship in the United States. Recent changes at the federal level have reduced protections for consumers, meaning unpaid medical bills may continue to appear on credit reports. A lower credit score can make it more expensive — or impossible — to secure a loan, rent a home, or start a small business. For families already living paycheck to paycheck, a single medical emergency can create a cycle of debt that is difficult to escape.
A New Hampshire challenge
New Hampshire’s aging population, rural geography, and reliance on a mix of small and regional health care providers make the state particularly vulnerable to these pressures. Many communities have only one hospital or primary care clinic within reasonable distance, and staffing shortages in areas such as maternity care and behavioral health already strain the system. Since 2000, nine hospitals have ceased labor and delivery services, doubling travel time for women in many New Hampshire rural areas.
If coverage declines and costs rise sharply, the impact will not be confined to the health care sector. Small businesses could face steeper health insurance bills, employees may delay necessary care, and towns could see reduced economic activity as household budgets tighten. The state’s ability to attract and retain a healthy workforce could also be affected, with long-term implications for growth.
Looking ahead
The future of health care in New Hampshire will depend on how policymakers, health care providers, insurers, and communities respond to these challenges. Transparency in health care pricing, support for rural providers, and collaborative problem-solving among stakeholders will be critical to ensuring that residents continue to have access to affordable, quality care.
The choices made in the next year will shape the health — and economic well-being — of Granite Staters for decades to come. Without real solutions and collaboration, these pressures will dismantle access — especially in rural communities. Protecting coverage, preserving rural hospitals, and ensuring equity in access are crucial steps toward securing health and economic stability for all Granite Staters.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/healthcostsnhg-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-18 04:57:41.429772

Here’s what you can do to get your money back.
For the first two weeks of August, Ohio’s 5.75% tax rate — and any local sales taxes — were paused.
“That doesn’t mean that all online or even in-person shopping experiences here in Ohio are incorporating it,” financial expert and Case Western Reserve University professor Michael Goldberg said. “Consumers really need to look.”
Viewers and readers reported that some stores weren’t honoring the state sales tax break, and they were still being charged tax. Ohio Senate Finance Chair Jerry Cirino (R-Kirtland) explained that the holiday is mandatory.
“It’s their obligation to follow the law, of course, and I guess businesses who decide not to pass it along will run afoul of regulators in the state of Ohio,” Cirino said.
Most products were eligible as long as they were under $500. This includes dining in at restaurants and internet purchases from chain companies.
There were some exceptions, which included items already separately taxed, like alcohol, marijuana or vehicles.
If you bought an eligible item between Aug. 1 and 14, but you had tax on your receipt, here is what you can do:
The Ohio Department of Taxation said that consumers should take their receipt, or show a digital copy, to the retailer for a refund.
If that isn’t possible, ODT’s Adam Schwiebert said there is another option.
“You can submit an application for a refund for that erroneously collected sales tax,” Schwiebert said. “You can submit that application electronically or via mail, so you have options to get your money back.”
CLICK HERE to go to the refund form.
If you can’t access the webpage from this link, here are the instructions:
CLICK HERE to get to the department’s website. Then click the “Forms” section in the upper right-hand corner. From there, type “STAR” into the “Form Title or Number” box. There should be a search result that says, “Application for Sales/Use Tax Refund.” Click “View PDF Fill-In.”
Consumers have four years to file for a return, but Schwiebert urges Ohioans to apply as soon as they see the error.
“The department is very passionate about getting people their money back quickly because that really is the purpose of the holidays and for Ohioans to save those taxpayer dollars, keep them within their pockets,” Schwiebert said. “The department works very quickly to try to get their money back as fast as we possibly can.”
The expected time frame to receive your money back from the state varies.

(Photo by Morgan Trau, WEWS)Ohio’s property tax working group met last week, where superintendents fought against county officials who were pushing to take money away from school districts in order to provide property tax relief.
With property taxes continuing to climb, Ohioans like Brian Massie have been begging lawmakers for some relief.
“The legislators are doing nothing to address the injustice of taxing people out of their homes,” Massie said.
And the clock is ticking for solutions.
The state’s new property tax reform group met again to discuss initial thoughts, evaluating each of the Republican legislators’ proposals to decrease taxes — all of which could impact schools.
“We don’t think that people realize what’s on the line,” said Stephanie Starcher, the superintendent of Fort Frye Local Schools.


The members discussed a myriad of options, which include:

Idea 1: Take away some of the schools’ savings, capping the carryover revenue at a certain percentage and refunding to taxpayers anything above that.
Idea 2: Put restrictions on the ability to put emergency levies on the ballot or request an increase to a current levy. This would eliminate levy replacements on property taxes for all political subdivisions. For schools, it would have prohibited them from imposing a fixed-sum emergency levy, a substitute emergency levy and a combined school district income tax and fixed-sum property tax levy.
Idea 3: Require that emergency and substitute tax levies, incremental growth levies, conversion levies, and the property tax portion of combined income tax and property tax levies be included in the 20-mill floor calculation for school funding purposes.
Idea 4: Allow a three-person county budget commission to unilaterally take money away from a school’s already passed levy if they find it “reasonably necessary.”
Idea 5: Similar to House Bill 186, this would limit property tax increases via an inflation cap. It authorizes a tax credit for owners of property in a school district on the 20 mill floor.

In the two-year state operating budget, Gov. Mike DeWine vetoed the levy restrictions. In July, the House narrowly passed an override to it. This one is detrimental, both Starcher and Dublin City Schools Superintendent Dr. John Marschhausen said.
“Either Ohio kids are going to lose a ton of money, or taxpayers are going to be paying more for the same support,” Starcher said, noting that eliminating types of levies will cause schools to go to the ballot more frequently.
But group chair Bill Seitz, a former Republican lawmaker from Cincinnati, said limiting these levies would prevent unclear ballot questions that raise taxes.
“Substitute for what? The voters really have no way of knowing.” Seitz said. “What the hell are we substituting for?”
Warren County Auditor Matt Nolan said schools need to be held accountable, since some are just “sitting on taxpayer money.”
Lake County Auditor Chris Galloway said that this option would hurt local governments.
“If there was someone that thought that doing this was going to change the property tax situation for Ohioans, they’re out of their mind,” Galloway said. “This is not going to change the dollars and cents of average Ohioan voters on property taxes.”
Starcher and Marschhausen tried to explain several times how schools could be hurt by several of the provisions. But Galloway and Nolan were fans of budget commissions to take money away from schools.
“Having that hammer behind us to say, ‘Please lower your levies. If you don’t, we will do it for you’ — that has worked extremely well,” Nolan said.
Hamilton County Commissioner Denise Driehaus said that this was “undemocratic.”
“If three elected officials in Hamilton County decided to overturn the will of the people, I’m going to have an issue with that,” Driehaus said.
Pike County Commissioner Jeff Chattin echoed Driehaus’ thoughts, reminding the working group that voters and their choices must be taken seriously.
Massie said that he wants voters to have a choice and knows the taxpayers have to pay for municipalities, but not at his expense.
“To vote for property tax levies, you’re funding your own demise,” Massie said.
The group will continue working and discussing policy until their deadline of the end of September.

(Getty Images)Over the past month, both of Kansas’ U.S. senators and one of its representatives have been eager for Kansas Reflector to relay their thoughts to you, our readers.
What they haven’t been willing to do is answer real, in-depth questions.
In the aftermath of the Senate and House passing President Donald Trump’s “One Big, Beautiful Bill” into law, Republicans across the country want to persuade voters that they have delivered. Unfortunately for them, the bill polls terribly and constituents have been eager to confront their elected officials.
You can’t have that, not when control of both chambers will be up for a vote next year. Instead, these politicians have been trying to funnel propaganda directly to you, our audience, without pesky journalists asking a bunch of questions.
Sorry guys, but that’s not the way we do things around here.
This first came up with Sen. Jerry Moran. I’ve written a couple of columns about him this year, and others have also addressed him in this space. Back in 2022, he sat down with Kansas Reflector senior reporter Tim Carpenter for our podcast. Moran can hold himself perfectly well in an interview with a professional journalist. He’s been doing this for a long time.
So when his office reached out last month expressing unhappiness about a column, I thought it was a fantastic opportunity to request an interview with the senator. He did it before, right?
His staff didn’t see it that way.
Communications director Angela Lingg both emailed and tried to talk to me on the phone. I told her that we would be perfectly willing to correct any factual errors if the office wanted to point them out. That goes for any piece published by Kansas Reflector. The op-ed, which dealt with the effects of Medicaid cuts on state mental health services was indeed corrected with extra information. I was happy to do so.
However, if I don’t have a previous relationship with a public relations staffer, I’m not going to have an informal phone conversation with them about an article they don’t like. Let me tell you sometime about being harassed by a Hillary Clinton staffer one morning as the Concord Monitor worked on a story about her foreign policy.
It’s a waste of time and doesn’t do anyone any good.
As I told Lingg, I would be delighted to talk further about Moran’s vote and his role in the process — during an on-the-record conversation with Moran. If he didn’t want to talk to me, he could talk to anyone else on the Kansas Reflector staff.
She then asked if we would post an op-ed from Moran. I explained that as a matter of policy (which you can read here and which has been in place since I started four years ago), we don’t run pieces from elected officials or candidates for office. Again, I offered an on-the-record interview.
I haven’t heard back.
For two other Kansas lawmakers in Washington, D.C., our interactions were brief but similarly telling.
U.S. Rep. Tracey Mann’s staff sent along an unsolicited op-ed praising border security provisions in the law. I gave Mann’s communications director, Taylor Bradley Stanley, the same response that I gave Lingg. We can’t run the piece but would love to speak directly with the congressman. Again, no response.
Sen. Roger Marshall actually showed his face to local reporters as part of an photo op. He took a 10-minute air ambulance helicopter ride and answered a handful of questions. He didn’t sit down for the kind of in-depth, penetrating interview that one might expect from a serious legislator after passing a mammoth piece of legislation.
Let’s talk turkey.
We want to hear from your elected representatives. We want to know what they think and why they make the choices they do.
I would be especially interested in knowing why Moran — who has voiced his support for rural hospitals repeatedly — and Marshall — who has made his background as a physician core to his political identity — chose to vote for a spending package that will leave Kansans poorer and less healthy.
I would like to know why Mann — who represents Lawrence, thanks to some opportunistic redistricting — voted for a bill that so clearly contradicts the electoral preferences of this 95,000-person strong city. In case you didn’t know, Douglas County as a whole went 67%-30% for Kamala Harris over Trump last year.
Now, if you’re not accustomed to the concept of an adversarial press, you might think these questions impolite. You might think they’re uncouth or hostile.
Nothing could be further from the truth. Such questions are meant to put elected officials on the record. We want to hear what they have to say, directly from their own mouths in a context that they don’t control. We welcome these kinds of exchanges. We want our readers to hear what their representatives say.
Other elected officials have been willing to do so. U.S. Rep. Derek Schmidt sat down with Carpenter back in December. Miracle of miracles, he survived the experience no worse for wear. Likewise, U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids frequently makes public appearances in Kansas and answers questions from journalists.
So what makes Moran, Marshall and Mann different?
I think all men are perfectly brave, accomplished and intelligent. I think all three could hold their own perfectly well during an interview or press conference. They are professional politicians. It’s what they do.
No, I think this reticence comes from the fact that these men can read polls. The reconciliation bill-turned-law remains unpopular and Trump himself has turned off massive numbers of Americans. What might be good for any one of these men to do politically — break with the White House or its priorities publicly — also puts them at risk of provoking the president and creating headaches they don’t need.
The simplest fix? Work the refs. Try to control the narrative. Don’t subject yourself to questions that would force you to take an unpopular stand. Don’t acknowledge the real trade-off behind the reconciliation bill and the grievous harms it will inflict on Kansans.
Honest dialogue would force these politicians to admit they have both compromised and been compromised.
Feel free to reach out and prove me wrong.

Santiago/Getty Images)BILOXI, Miss. — The Trump administration is developing a powerful data tool it claims will let states identify noncitizens registered to vote. But Democratic critics and data experts warn it could allow the federal government to vacuum up vast quantities of information on Americans for unclear purposes.
Some Democratic election officials and opponents of the effort fear President Donald Trump wants to build a federal database of voters to target political opponents or cherry-pick rare examples of noncitizen voters to fuel a sense of crisis. Republican election officials allied with the president counter that he’s helping states to maintain accurate voter rolls.
The Trump administration has rolled out changes to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, tool at the same time the U.S. Department of Justice is asking states for copies of their voter rolls. The timing, combined with questions about what happens to voter data uploaded to the program, has alarmed critics.
Trump wants Congress to pass a national proof of citizenship voter registration requirement and in March tried to unilaterally impose one for federal elections through executive order. But with the legislation stalled and the order halted by the courts, the citizenship data tool may offer a backdoor way to accomplish the same goal.
SAVE was originally intended to help state and local officials verify the immigration status of individual noncitizens seeking government benefits. But U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, this spring refashioned it into a platform that can scan states’ voter rolls if election officials upload the data.
The changes to SAVE, rolled out over just a few months and with little public debate, are “tinkering with sort of the bones of democracy,” said John Davisson, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington, D.C.-based research and advocacy group that argues privacy is a fundamental right.
“You’re talking about the voting process and who will be eligible to vote,” Davisson said. “And to take a system that is not designed for use in that process and repurpose it, really on the fly, without a formal comment process, without formal rulemaking, without congressional intervention — that’s pretty anomalous and pretty alarming.”
Previously, SAVE could only search one name at a time. Now it can conduct bulk searches, allowing state officials to potentially feed into it information on millions of registered voters. SAVE checks that information against a series of federal databases and reports back whether it can verify someone’s immigration status.
Since May, it also can draw upon Social Security data, transforming the program into a tool that can confirm citizenship because Social Security records for many, but not all, Americans include the information. NPR reported earlier on changes to SAVE.
“It is incredible what has been done, really since March,” Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray, a Republican who supports proof of citizenship requirements and the SAVE tool, told a gathering of state secretaries of state in Biloxi, Mississippi, last week.
Individuals registering to vote in federal elections must already sign a statement affirming they are citizens under penalty of perjury, and those who cast a ballot face criminal penalties and deportation. One study of the 2016 election placed the prevalence of noncitizen voting at 0.0001% of votes cast.
But as Trump has spread falsehoods about elections, Republicans have made purging noncitizens from voter rolls a central focus.
Democratic concerns were on display last week at the National Association of Secretaries of State conference, held at the Beau Rivage casino-resort in Biloxi. In interviews on the sidelines of the conference, Democratic secretaries of state voiced deep reservations — or outright opposition — about plugging their voter data into SAVE.
Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said Aug. 6 that the federal government appeared to be trying to take over election administration. She formally rejected the Justice Department’s voter roll request two days later.
Bellows said the Department of Homeland Security told her in a recent phone call that it planned to retain SAVE data for 10 years for “audit purposes only.”
“Just like the [Justice Department] is asking us to hand over an electronic file of all the voters in our state, it seems like the Department of Homeland Security is through this backdoor system also asking us to share voter information about every voter in our state,” Bellows said.
At least one state appears to have granted the federal government sweeping authority over any voter data it provides to SAVE.
Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales announced in July he had reached an agreement with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to access the newly expanded system for voter list maintenance. Indiana’s agreement allows the federal agency to use information the state provides for any purpose permitted by law, including criminal prosecutions.
Morales, a Republican, said in a news release that SAVE represented “another step in safeguarding the rights” of eligible voters. His office didn’t respond to Stateline’s questions.
The Trump administration has ramped up efforts to encourage state election officials to use the expanded program. The White House hosted a bipartisan “fly in” event for state secretaries of state on July 29. Multiple secretaries of state told Stateline that USCIS Director Joseph Edlow, who was confirmed on July 15, spoke at the event.
“The president is very much keyed in on voter list maintenance,” Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, a Republican, said in an interview — echoing other GOP secretaries of state who released statements praising the Trump administration after the meeting.













When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances.


– Minnesota Democratic Secretary of State Steve Simon





Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, a Democrat who attended the meeting, said he questioned how the federal government would handle voter information provided to SAVE. He added that the Justice Department’s request for his state’s voter rolls raised his level of concern about how data would be used.
“When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances,” Simon told Stateline.
The White House referred questions about SAVE and the event to the Department of Homeland Security and USCIS.
In response to questions from Stateline, USCIS didn’t directly answer whether the agency would share voter roll data with other parts of the federal government but confirmed it disposes of records after 10 years.
“The SAVE application is a critical tool for state and local governments to access information to safeguard the integrity of elections across the country. It’s no wonder many states have quickly adopted it, and we continue to promote the tool to other states and counties not using SAVE,” USCIS spokesperson Matthew Tragesser said in a statement.
“We look forward to continued optimization efforts and implementing more updates to SAVE.”
 GOP pressure

Some Republican election officials and Trump allies have long wanted the federal government to take an expanded role in searching state voter rolls for noncitizens.
Last summer the Trump-aligned litigation group America First Legal, co-founded by Trump adviser Stephen Miller, encouraged states to submit to the Department of Homeland Security the names of individuals for citizenship or immigration status verification.
Some states did just that. Texas, for example, asked USCIS to verify the citizenship of some voters in September, and Indiana asked the agency to verify 585,774 voters in October. The same month, 16 Republican state attorneys general signed a letter criticizing Homeland Security, then under the Biden administration, for failing to work with states on verification.
After Trump took office, GOP state officials kept up the pressure. Twenty-one Republican secretaries of state urged Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in February to prioritize SAVE improvements.
On April 16, Indiana sued the department in federal court for not responding to its verification request last fall. USCIS announced an overhaul of SAVE less than a week later.
As the agency continues to remake SAVE, the tool will soon allow searches using the last four digits of a Social Security number, multiple state secretaries of state told Stateline. The agency confirmed the feature is under development and will be available soon but didn’t provide an exact date.
The change would mark another significant expansion of the program because most states collect the last four digits when individuals without a driver’s license register to vote.
Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican, said SAVE represents a better way to verify citizenship than a state law requiring voters to produce documents. “I think there’s a real opportunity for us to do a lot of this through just sharing of information and I think that’s what we’re seeing happen,” McGrane said in an interview.
 Unreliable data?

But some voting rights advocates and experts on government data caution against an overreliance on Social Security data.
The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, a progressive policy nonprofit, has noted that Social Security only began tracking the citizenship status of all applicants in 1978 — meaning the database doesn’t include comprehensive citizenship information for older Americans. Additionally, Social Security may not always have up-to-date information on the status of naturalized U.S. citizens.
The nonpartisan Institute for Responsive Government also warned in May that since SAVE hasn’t used Social Security numbers to verify citizenship in the past, its accuracy and effectiveness are unknown. The success of the expanded SAVE program may also partially depend on whether it has adequate staff and resources, it said.
A 2017 Government Accountability Office report found that between fiscal years 2012 and 2016, about 16% of the nearly 90 million SAVE searches required additional verification, which the institute says often translates into federal workers manually checking files. Now that SAVE allows bulk searches, the need for manual checking could rise dramatically.
Nick Doctor, director of implementation at the Institute for Responsive Government, said in an interview that a tool confirming the eligibility of registered voters in a way that doesn’t burden individuals can be a good thing. But he emphasized that it depends in large measure on SAVE’s implementation.
“The changes that have been made to SAVE happened very quickly and, to my knowledge, we haven’t seen releases on the level of accuracy of that information,” Doctor said.
During interviews, Republican secretaries of state stressed that voters aren’t kicked off the rolls because SAVE can’t verify their citizenship. Instead, an inability to verify would likely trigger a follow-up process with the voter.
“Just because we get something back from the SAVE database, it’s not a cut and dry, especially on those they’re not sure about,” Hoskins, the Missouri secretary of state, said.
Still, Arizona illustrates why some Democrats worry about any large-scale effort to ask voters — especially longtime, older residents — to prove their citizenship. After the state discovered errors in how it tracked voter citizenship dating back years, election officials are contacting some 200,000 voters seeking proof of citizenship documentation.
Some have been casting ballots for decades without incident and many feel targeted, Arizona Democratic Secretary of State Adrian Fontes said during a presentation at the state secretaries of state conference. “They feel insulted when they get that letter,” Fontes said.













There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside.


– Charles Stewart III, professor of political science at MIT who studies elections





Charles Stewart III, a professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies elections, said Arizona may actually point to the potential usefulness of SAVE. If Arizona runs its voter roll through the program, a list of 200,000 voters needing citizenship verification would perhaps drop into the hundreds, he suggested.
“There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside,” Stewart said.
Connecticut Democratic Secretary of State Stephanie Thomas told Stateline that every secretary wants tools to keep voter lists as clean as possible. But the details are important.
When she hears of something new, Thomas said she asks whether it’s the best option available and whether “the i’s are dotted, the t’s crossed.” She said she’s asked USCIS a series of questions about SAVE and is waiting on some responses.
“When it comes to voter lists,” Thomas said, “I don’t want Connecticut voters to be a guinea pig.”

Some of the Texans fled to Illinois, where in December, 1840, a 31-year-old Kentucky-born Whig state representative jumped out a window to thwart a quorum House Democrats needed to pass a bill undermining the Bank of Illinois, a Whig pet.
The solon’s name was Abraham Lincoln.
His unorthodox exit went for naught because he had been marked present. The majority Democrats corralled enough members for a quorum, and the anti-bank bill passed 46-15.

Springfield is the capital of Illinois. But in late 1840, the legislature was meeting in the old First Methodist Church while work crews were putting the finishing touches on the Capitol a block away. (The building was replaced by the current Capitol in 1876.)
The church was too small and ill equipped to adequately accommodate the lawmakers, which “added to the confusion Lincoln encountered as leader of the minority Whig party,” explains a plaque on a downtown building now on the church site.
The blue-framed “Looking for Lincoln” tablet is titled “Leaping Lincoln.” 
On Dec. 5, 1840, the Democratic majority was set to approve the bank-busting bill. The Whigs decided to make themselves scarce, thus preventing a quorum. “Only Lincoln and a few lieutenants remained to observe,” according to the plaque.
When Lincoln and other Whig bigwigs discovered the Democrats had a quorum after all, they ran for the door, which was barred. In desperation, Lincoln leapt, followed by Joseph Gillespie and Asahel Gridley.
The State Register, a devoutly Democratic newspaper in Springfield, gleefully reported the incident: “A laughable circumstance took place while the yeas and nays were being called on the passage of the resolution. Mr Lincoln of Sangamon (Lincoln lived in Springfield, the Sangamon County seat), who was present during the whole scene, and who appeared to enjoy the embarrassment of the House, suddenly looked very grave after the Speaker announced that a quorum was present. The conspiracy having failed, Mr Lincoln came under great excitement, and having attempted and failed to get out of the door, very unceremoniously raised the window and jumped out, followed by one or two other members.”
It was a first floor window, said to be only 4 or 5 feet from the ground.
According to the paper, “This gymnastic performance of Mr Lincoln and his flying brethren, did not occur until after they had voted! and consequently the House did not interfere with their extraordinary feat.”
The State Register confessed, “We have not learned whether these flying members got hurt in their adventure, and we think it probable that one of them came off without damage, as it was noticed that his legs reached nearly from the window to the ground!”
The paper further lampooned the 6-foot-4 Lincoln, declaring it had heard “that a resolution will probably be introduced into the House this week to inquire into the expediency of raising the State House one story higher, in order to have the House set in the third story! so as to prevent members from jumping out of the window! If such a resolution passes, Mr Lincoln will in the future have to climb down the spout!”
The plaque also says that “an embarrassed Lincoln ever after resented references to what he called that ‘jumping scape.’ ” But he had the last laugh 20 years later when Free State voters sent him to the White House. (He polled just 1,366 votes in slave state Kentucky.)
Historians rank “The Great Emancipator” as one of our greatest presidents because he led the Union to victory in the Civil War and put slavery on the road to extinction. (Illinois towns were named for Gillespie and Gridley.)

(Photo by Liam Niemeyer/Kentucky Lantern)Mandates from President Donald Trump’s administration to retain aging coal plants could cause a massive spike in energy costs, according to an independent analysis commissioned by several environmental groups.
Orders from the U.S. Department of Energy to save coal plants from retirement could cost ratepayers more than $3 billion per year, according to a report from Grid Strategies, a power sector consulting firm. It was carried out on behalf of Earthjustice, Environmental Defense Fund, Natural Resources Defense Council and Sierra Club.

While federal officials say the coal plants need to stay online to avoid blackouts, power plant owners and state regulators planned their closures because they were no longer economically viable or needed for reliability.
“DOE mandates override those well-informed decisions, inflating electric bills for homeowners and businesses and undermining the competitiveness of U.S. factories and data centers,” the Grid Strategies analysis found.
Across the country, coal plants have phased out as they’ve struggled to compete with cheaper renewables and natural gas. A 2023 analysis by Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan think tank, found that 99% of existing U.S. coal plants “are more expensive to run than replacement by local wind, solar, and energy storage resources.”
But Trump, who has pushed to unleash more fossil fuel development and to stymie wind and solar, has ordered a retiring coal plant in Michigan to stay online, along with an oil and gas plant in Pennsylvania.
“Based on the trend to date and indications that DOE has approached the owners of many retiring fossil power plants about potentially mandating their retention, DOE may attempt to mandate the retention of nearly all large fossil power plants slated for retirement between now and the end of 2028,” reads the Grid Strategies report.
The cost of keeping those plants online would be immense. By 2028, if Trump were to mandate the retention of all fossil fuel plants slated for retirement, the annual cost to ratepayers would be more than $3.1 billion, the analysis found.
The report also considers a number of aging plants that are not yet scheduled for retirement. It finds Trump’s actions could create a “perverse incentive,” causing plant owners to claim they’re planning to shut down, inducing the feds to step in and keep them open, with the cost borne by ratepayers.
Accounting for that possibility, the report found that ratepayer costs could reach $5.9 billion per year to keep the entire aging fossil fuel fleet online. California, Texas and Colorado would see the highest increases in electricity bills.

Aug. 12, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)Three thoughts … 
Auschwitz. Treblinka. Bergen-Belson. Russian gulags. Manzanar. Heart Mountain. Lincoln.
Wait, what? Lincoln?
Go ahead. Insist I’m overreacting. Being a drama queen. Hyperventilating on the hype. Getting my NIMBY on. Maybe I am. But the idea that a federal migrant detention camp would be built where I live — already reported as a possibility — comes with a stigma. 
Nor would a camp in Omaha, Grand Island, North Platte or any place in Nebraska mitigate the mood. If Floridians want to embrace “Alligator Alcatraz,” the camp in the state’s swamps with the childishly cruel name, let them. But as the U.S. Department of Homeland Security searches for other detention camp sites, let’s hope Nebraska political leaders understand the long-term message such a place sends and the reputation that will follow.
Immigration is in dire need of serious reform. So some may welcome a camp here for migrants as part of the solution to the immigration problem. Indeed the president said on the campaign trail that a mass deportation will take place to rid the country of violent criminals, human traffickers and fentanyl pushers. 
To date, however, the data shows that a clear majority in detention camps or already deported fits none of that trifecta. Of interest, too, is that according to 8 U.S.C. § 1325, being in the country without documentation, with a few exceptions, remains a civil and not criminal offense.
Placing a migrant detention camp in the backyard may not last forever, but its memory would. Lincoln and Nebraska can do without.
School finance
With the dog days behind us and their namesake rightly in its heavenly place, most Nebraska’s schools are up and running. (We pause here to give thanks for air conditioning.)
Also at their desks starting last week were members of the governor’s newly-minted School Financing Review Commission, charged with building a better school financing mousetrap. 
Even a cursory look at school financing in Nebraska requires a trip down the rabbit hole when considering formulas and fairness. While the commission holds out hope it can solve some seriously hairy dilemmas involving property taxes and paying for a quality education, its initial conversations — as they should be — seemingly kept an aggregate eye on the prize: Nebraska’s public school students.
The old saw about showing me a budget and I’ll show what you value applies here. Nebraska schools have historically performed well in comparison to its border neighbors and the nation as a whole. In the constant push to lower property taxes, however, previous attempts not simply here but in other states have too often centered on painting school districts as spendthrifts or wholly inefficient stewards of money. The result has been a patchwork of policies that have satisfied neither those who pay property taxes nor those on the front lines of educating children.
Ergo, the School Financing Review Commission … and the balancing act which lies before it. 
History lesson
Speaking of schools, Nebraska’s history teachers should take note of a worrisome development at the Smithsonian Institution, the nation’s flagship museum of all things American.
The White House has sent a letter to the Institution’s director, giving him a heads up that the administration will be “reviewing” the museum’s exhibitions and research so they march to the same drummer as “the president’s directive to celebrate American exceptionalism, remove divisive or partisan narratives, and restore confidence in our shared cultural institutions.” The review would apply to eight Smithsonian museums.
Oh, boy. Democracies are, by their very nature, divisive. When the people make the rules, differences of opinion are not only evident and expected, they create a process of deliberation and debate that has made us the best last hope for freedom on the planet. Probably best not to mess with that.
Moreover, like book banners, if rewriters of history reveal only the good parts of the past, it’s not really history. Slavery, Japanese internment camps (two of which are listed above), the Tulsa Race Massacre, the mistreatment of Mexican Braceros and Jan. 6, 2021 — when for the first time in our nation’s history, a violent mob tried to undo a free and fair election — all happened, whether we like it or not. Not our finest hours. We must acknowledge them, study them and learn from them. Otherwise, the axiom is true: we’ll repeat them. 
Maybe we already are.
When we own all of our history, when we count all our wins and losses, when we let all of our true narrative be our teacher and not something to edit or erase, then we are unquestionably an exceptional nation.
