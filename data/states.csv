(Courtesy of Applied Digital) Applied Digital, the company operating data centers near Ellendale and Jamestown, on Monday announced plans to build a $3 billion data center at Harwood, north of Fargo. 
Applied Digital plans to break ground in September on what it calls Polaris Forge 2, a  280-megawatt artificial intelligence computing center. 
The plan calls for two facilities with room for expansion. Applied Digital has contracted more than 900 acres for its campus and secured power through Cass County Electric Cooperative, a member-owned nonprofit. The data center is expected to employ more than 200 full-time workers, in addition to long-term contractors.
Applied Digital said in a news release that it is expanding in North Dakota because the state has abundant energy, available land and a pro-business climate.
“The demand for AI capacity continues to accelerate, and North Dakota continues to be one of the most strategic locations in the country to meet that need,” Wes Cummins, CEO of Applied Digital, said in the news release. 
Harwood is a town of about 800 people north of Fargo along Interstate 29. 
“Applied Digital’s investment reflects confidence in our people and our potential, and we’re proud to be part of this moment,” Harwood Mayor Blake Hankey said in the news release.
AI driving data center demand at accelerating pace 

Applied Digital has invested in housing and other infrastructure in Ellendale, a town of about 1,100 near the South Dakota state line, where it operates Polaris Forge 1.
“North Dakota wins when companies like Applied Digital choose to be more than an employer.” Gov. Kelly Armstrong said in the news release. “In Ellendale, they invested in people through workforce housing and created strong local partnerships that strengthen the community.” 
Applied Digital data centers house banks of computers owned by tech companies that provide artificial intelligence and other services. 
The tech companies lease space from Applied Digital, which builds climate-controlled facilities to keep the computers cool, clean and operating efficiently.
Data centers use tremendous amounts of power, which will be supplied by Cass County Electric Cooperative, a member of Grand Forks-based Minnkota Power Cooperative. 
“Our focus is on making sure it is integrated in a way that strengthens our communities, supports reliable and responsible power, and builds on the strong foundation we have established through more than 85 years of service to this region,” Mac McLennan, Minnkota Power Cooperative president and CEO said in the news release.

Nick Phillips, executive vice president of Applied Digital who works from the Ellendale campus, spoke last week in Fargo at an artificial intelligence summit organized by the Fargo Moorhead West Fargo Chamber. 
He said data centers are beneficial to communities, providing good jobs for people in the skilled trades, such as electricians, and adding to the tax base.

Applied Digital, with a campus just outside of Ellendale, requested to be annexed into the town to increase tax revenue for Ellendale.
At the same Summit, U.S. Rep. Julie Fedorchak said North Dakota’s ability to provide power and a home for data centers is important for national security. 
“Where I see incredible opportunity for North Dakota is using that resource, the incredible energy resources we have to help provide the power to develop this incredible industry here in America, not over in India and China,” she said.

Bowyer admitted to operating an illegal gambling business, money laundering, and filing a false tax return. He failed to report more than $4 million in income in one tax year, according to the government’s motion to the judge, filed Friday, to impose a sentence outside federal guidelines.
Bowyer’s business “placed and accepted bets on sporting events for its clients, and employed agents and sub-agents, including casino hosts, who referred and recruited clients, demanded and collected on bettors’ losses and distributed winnings, and were paid a portion of the losses bettors incurred and paid,” says the government’s motion.
The proposed sentence, scheduled to be imposed next week, is far less than the 41 to 51 months calculated in the government’s presentence report, and rewards Bowyer for his lack of criminal history and “substantial assistance to the government,” including in its prosecution of Ohtani’s interpreter, Ippei Mizuhara, and fellow bookie Damien LeForbes.
Mizuhara is serving a 57-month sentence for stealing $17 million from Ohtani. LeForbes is awaiting sentencing for operating an unlawful gambling business and money laundering.  
Bowyer’s information “contributed to the government’s ability to interpret recovered text messages and execute a search warrant on Leforbes in December 2023,” the motion says, adding he provided additional information in January 2024. 
LeForbes declined to comment on the record on the revelation that Bowyer cooperated against him. 
“I met with Matt Bowyer over a year ago and he said he told his lawyer he wasn’t giving up his players or his friends, just the dirty casino executives,” high stakes gambler Robert (R.J.) Cipriani, who worked as a confidential source for the government, said Monday. 
LeForbes, Bowyer, and another gambler lost an estimated $24 million, much of it laundered gambling proceeds, at Resorts World Las Vegas. 
The Current was first to report two years ago that federal authorities out of California were investigating allegations that gamblers with questionable sources of income were gambling at Resorts World and MGM Grand. 
MGM paid a $7.45 million fine as part of a non-prosecution agreement with the feds, and paid $8.5 million to Nevada regulators. Resorts World paid a $10.5 million fine to the Nevada Gaming Commission. An anticipated nonprosecution agreement between federal prosecutors and Resorts World has yet to materialize. 
“It’s unconscionable that two bookies are likely going to jail yet the Resorts World executives who got caught up in it move down the street to another casino,” Cipriani said. 
Bowyer, the government says, has accepted responsibility for his conduct and is making restitution on unpaid taxes as part of his plea agreement. His sentencing is scheduled for next week.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/resorts-world_exterior_hero-expanded-1-e1723756620194-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-08-18 12:58:15.399001

Patrick Morrisey’s executive order allowing religious exemptions to the state’s strict school vaccination requirements. 
The organizations refiled the complaint Friday in Kanawha County Circuit Court. They originally filed the lawsuit May 23 on behalf of Marisa Jackson, of Kanawha County, and Dr. Joshua Hess, of Cabell County. Jackson and Hess are both parents of immunocompromised students. Hess is also a pediatric hematologist and oncologist practicing at Marshall Health’s Cabell Huntington Hospital. 
It names as defendants the state Department of Health, Bureau for Public Health along with Justin Davis, interim commissioner for public health and Arvin Singh, the state’s cabinet secretary for the health department. 
In July, Kanawha Circuit Judge Kenneth Ballard dismissed the lawsuit for procedural reasons, agreeing with an attorney for the state who argued that the organization failed to give the 30-days notice required by state law when suing a governmental agency. 
In the refiled complaint, the organizations note that the judge originally dismissed the lawsuit because of its failure to “adequately articulate a claim for injunctive relief” rather than a deficiency with its constitutional claims.  
“This action is now ripe for re-filing with pleadings that cure the procedural deficiencies identified by the court,” they write. “The underlying constitutional violations that prompted the original litigation remain unaddressed and continue to cause ongoing harm. Additionally, Plaintiffs/Petitioners have gained substantial insight into the unconstitutional manner in which 
Defendants/Respondents are interpreting and applying the relevant statutory provisions,  strengthening both the factual foundation and legal theories supporting this renewed challenge.” 
In a news release Monday, the organizations said they’re seeking emergency relief to protect students as the new school year begins. 
“Time is running out to protect West Virginia’s schoolchildren from a dangerous and unconstitutional policy,” ACLU-WV Legal Director Aubrey Sparks said in the news release. “While our previous case was dismissed on procedural grounds, the core of this issue is clear: What the state is doing violates the law and the West Virginia Constitution. We’re asking the court to act immediately before more children are put at risk.”
“This isn’t just about policy — it’s about protecting real children who will be sitting in classrooms next week,” Mountain State Justice Director Sarah Brown said in the news release. “Gov. Morrisey is gambling with children’s lives to score political points. We’ve seen what happens in other states when vaccine requirements are weakened, and we won’t let that happen here in West Virginia.”
The ACLU’s lawsuit is at least the second lawsuit filed in regards to the question of Morrisey’s executive order and the state’s school vaccination requirements. Morrisey’s executive order is still in place after the Legislature this year voted down a bill that would have inscribed religious exemptions into state code. 
A Raleigh County judge last month ruled in favor of the parents of three students who were issued a religious exemption to the vaccination requirements and sued the state Board of Education for instructing school boards not to accept the exemptions. 
Morrisey has argued the state’s school vaccination law should be read alongside the state’s 2023 Equal Protection for Religion Act to mean that families should get religious exemptions to the immunizations.
As West Virginia students head back to the classroom for the year, rules about vaccination requirements may vary by school.
The state Board of Education has not changed its guidance that public schools should accept only medical exemptions to vaccines. 
The governor’s executive order does not apply to private schools, leaving them to decide whether to follow state law or the executive order. 
The West Virginia Professional Charter Schools Board earlier this month voted to tell the state’s seven charter schools to follow the executive order and accept religious vaccination exemptions. That action led the state Board of Education last week to send a letter to the charter school board instructing it to follow the state’s school vaccination law, not the executive order. 
Morrisey and the state Department of Health did not immediately return an email seeking comment. 
In a post on the social media platform X last week, Morrisey promised that families seeking religious exemptions would win either in court or through legislative action. 
‘Hold strong. I recognize that the Board [of Education] is creating hardships for families but we will keep pushing,” he wrote.

(Getty Images)Glencoe Public Schools filed a suit in Payne County District Court Thursday against the Oklahoma Secondary School Activities Association over its decision to disallow some students from playing basketball due to an alleged rule violation.


According to the lawsuit, the OSSAA says the students violated Rule 24, also known as the “Linked Rule,” a controversial provision intended to keep students from transferring from following a coach to a new school district.
Three of the four named students in the lawsuit attended a team camp in May at Glencoe with Coach Garrett Schubert. The students later applied through the transfer portal when it opened in June.
But, according to the lawsuit, OSSAA said the students should have unenrolled from their previous districts first.
Glencoe’s attorney, Hannah Whitten with the firm Whitten Burrage, said there is no OSSAA provision requiring that.
“There’s been no requirement to unenroll your kid before the school year starts and before the transfer portals open,” Whitten said. “So they did everything to the letter of the law.”
The plaintiffs appealed OSSAA’s decision at a Wednesday hearing, but the Board of Directors voted unanimously to uphold its ruling.
The suit requests an order from the court determining the OSSAA’s ruling to be unreasonable, as well as a temporary restraining order and permanent injunction against OSSAA’s enforcement of the rule on the students.
The plaintiffs in the suit are the student athletes’ families, Glencoe Public Schools and Coach Garrett Schubert.
Plaintiffs have submitted sworn testimony that no recruiting occured. Whitten also said OSSAA released guidance on May 20 that said summer participation before June 1 would not affect student eligibility.
Rule 24 has been the target of Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond. Drummond ordered the organization to end its enforcement in September. In response, OSSAA temporarily suspended its enforcement of the rule.
Lawmakers voiced support for the students in a Thursday news release.
“Oklahomans believe in fairness and opportunity. OSSAA’s decision here undermines both, and it’s why the Legislature must look closely at reforming how these decisions are made,” Sen. Avery Frix (R-Muskogee) said.
In a statement to StateImpact, Gov. Kevin Stitt urged the OSSAA to reconsider its position and let the students compete.
“When I fought for open transfer, it was to ensure that every student in Oklahoma had equal opportunity to succeed. For many students, athletics are an essential part of a well-rounded education,” Stitt said. “It is disappointing that OSSAA would continue to perpetuate a system that bars students from the opportunity to compete — especially when many students rely on the opportunity athletics provides to pursue higher education.”
A spokesperson for OSSAA declined to comment, citing the litigation.

Fagan Harris, Moore’s chief of staff, will leave his post Jan. 5 to become the next president and CEO of the Abell Foundation, according to a statement issued by the philanthropic nonprofit.
“Fagan shares the Abell Foundation’s steadfast commitment to the people of Baltimore, and he will honor our organization’s legacy while leading the next chapter of our work,” Christy Wyskiel, chair of the Abell Foundation Board of Trustees, said in a statement Monday.

“Abell has spent decades investing in Baltimore – its people, its neighborhoods and its future, and Fagan shares our unwavering belief in the potential of Baltimore,” her statement said.
A spokesperson for Moore did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.
Talk of Harris’ departure — specifically to the Abell Foundation — has circulated for weeks.
Harris, 38, grew up in Bowie and in Anne Arundel County, and attended local public schools.
After graduating from Stanford University, Harris, like Moore, became a Rhodes Scholar. That connection led to Moore later becoming a mentor.
He and Moore launched Baltimore Corps in 2013, a nonprofit employment and grant-making agency.
The organization connects overlooked job seekers with positions in public service, nonprofits and the private sector. During the pandemic, the nonprofit focued on recruitment in the city’s public health workforce.
Moore tapped Harris as his chief of staff in 2022, soon after the election.
Harris will succeed Robert C. “Bob” Embry Jr. in leading the Abell Foundation. Embry joined the nonprofit in 1987.

(David Stephenson/Kentucky Lantern)SHELBYVILLE, Kentucky – A Kentucky church is urging its members to permanently remove books from the Shelby County Public Library by checking them out and never returning them. The books portray gay characters and historical figures or explore LGBTQ+ themes.
Pamela Wilson Federspiel, who has been director of the library in downtown Shelbyville for 34 years, says the action is tantamount to “stealing.”
But three leaders of the Reformation Church of Shelbyville defend what they call an “act of civil disobedience.”

  Austin Keeler
“Yes — we have urged Christians, both locally and across the country, to search their libraries for books that promote sodomy, gender confusion and rebellion against God — and if found, to check them out and never return them as an act of civil disobedience,” pastors Jerry Dorris and Tanner Cartwright and Austin Keeler, an evangelist with the church mission, Reformation Frontline Missions, recently told the Lantern in an email.
The library has “lost” 16 books valued at $410.85 since a member of the church checked them out last year with due dates in late June 2024, said Federspiel. Some of the books were written for children, some for adults. (The list of books is at the bottom of this story.)
Federspiel did not identify the library patron and said the books were never returned after several notices.
The titles include “The Art of Drag,” “My Two Moms” and “My Two Dads.”
Chris Hartman of Louisville, executive director of the Fairness Campaign, said he has never considered “theft to be a form of civil action.”
He also said he has never heard of a church encouraging its members “to steal from a public institution. It is shameful, unfortunate and disrespectful.”
Such activity often backfires by making people, especially young people, curious about the books and giving them more attention, he said.
  Author Sarah Prager
Sarah Prager of Boston wrote one of the 16 books the Shelby County Public Library has “lost.” It is called “Kind Like Marsha: Lessons from LGBTQ+ Leaders”  and  is for juveniles. Amazon.com says it celebrates 14 LGBTQ+ people throughout history, like politician Harvey Milk, scientist and painter Leonardo da Vinci, Mexican artist Frida Kahlo and Marsha P. Johnson, who took care of her trans community on the streets of New York City.
“My book is not about sexual acts. It is about real, caring people — and what is wrong about that? A library must always have a diverse inventory.  We can never let that change,” Prager said.
Complaints about books increase
The church posted its recommendation to check out certain library books and not return them in a 2 minute, 57 second video on its Facebook page on June 1, 2024.  Church leaders said recently their message has not changed.
“Friends, the Shelby County Public Library is promoting the vile LGBTQ agenda to groom and trans children in Kentucky,” a script accompanying the video says.
“Would you help us expose what’s happening here?” it asks before providing contact information for two library officials and listing books the church found objectionable.
Complaints about books to public libraries are not new but are growing in Kentucky and the United States. There were 302 challenges to Kentucky public libraries in 2024, up from only 26 in 2023, according to the state Department of Libraries and Archives annual Statistical Report of Kentucky Public Libraries released in April.
But rare, if ever, is the practice condoned by the Shelbyville church for making books disappear from the shelves.
“Strategically checking out books with no plans to return them as a method of permanently removing certain books from local public libraries is not a common practice, at least not one that has been reported to KDLA,” said Jill Midkiff, a spokesperson for the  Kentucky Education and Labor Cabinet and the Kentucky Department for Libraries and Archives (KDLA).
  Suzanne Trimel
PEN America, based in New York, tracks book bans and fights censorship across the country. Spokesperson Suzanne Trimel said she has never heard of the  book-removal tactic recommended by the Shelbyville church, though some conservative churches have urged members to seek public office to be in a position to censor LGBTQ+ books. She’s also heard of hiding controversial books where they aren’t likely to be found on library shelves
PEN America has seen censorship activities in public schools and public libraries intensify, she said, as public libraries have responded to pressure by canceling author visits and drag story hours.
Trimel said public libraries also have been under pressure from the “Hide the Pride” campaign, largely led  by a conservative Catholic advocacy organization called CatholicVote.  In 2022, the leaders of CatholicVote estimated 50 to 100 libraries were targeted for “Hide the Pride.”
The campaign instructs parents to go to the children’s section of a public library and check out all “Pride Month” books on the display shelves. The parents return the books on time but place them on other shelves out of reach of children.
The Reformation Church of Shelbyville does not return controversial books removed from the Shelby County library.
The church’s stance
Pastor Dorris said the church became aware of the controversial books when a member took their children to the library and the “children were exposed to some of them. Upon investigation they discovered the remaining books.”
Like librarian Federspiel, Dorris declined to identify the patron. He said the family did not want any public attention. Records of books checked out by patrons of public libraries are not subject to Kentucky’s Open Records Act, said Amye Bensenhaver, co-founder and co-director of the Kentucky Open Government Coalition.
  The Shelby County Public Library in Shelbyville, Aug. 5, 2025. (David Stephenson/Kentucky Lantern)
Dorris said he is uncertain where the checked-out books are now. “They have not been destroyed to my knowledge.”
He said his independent church, which “shepherds 357 souls,” is taking a “public stand against sexual perversion being pushed upon children through taxpayer-funded institutions.” It will continue to take that stand without apology, he said.
“This is not literacy — it’s grooming,” Dorris said.
Asked about the removal of public property, Dorris said, “We reject the idea that civil rebellion is only legitimate when it’s done with rainbow flags or Marxist slogans. Civil disobedience is a biblical category when obedience to God and love for neighbor demand it.”
Dorris said that when the church discovered the controversial materials in the local library, it contacted Shelby County’s state senator and representative. It also contacted the library’s staff and its board members “to express our deep concern and call for action.”
“No library staff or board member ever followed up with us, no request has been made for the return of these books, and — tellingly — the books themselves have not been replaced. Not that we would return them — but the silence itself speaks volumes,” said Dorris.
Matt Burgin, president of the library’s board of trustees, said Federspiel told the board about the situation but no one else has ever contacted him about the books.
The library has handled it like other cases of overdue books, he said.

Dorris said he did talk to then-state Sen. Adrienne Southworth, R-Lawrenceburg, but he would not divulge their conversation. She could not be reached for comment. State Rep. Jennifer Decker, R-Waddy, did not return phone calls to her Frankfort office seeking comment.
Dorris stressed that the book action is not a formal position of the Reformation Church and “not every member of our church is aware of and agrees with these actions, and that’s acceptable. We don’t discipline or pressure members over strategy. These actions — like the permanent removal of library books — were taken by individual Christians under personal conviction. We support their right to act or refrain in good conscience.”
The library’s stance
The 16 books director Federspiel says are “lost” due to the efforts of the Reformation Church range in cost from $19.99 to $35.
The library offers a variety of books for a diverse community, she said. “All are library property.”
Library materials that are not returned are not available for other patrons, said Federspiel, who declined to have her photo taken for this article. “The library is committed to providing materials that meet patron needs. Materials that are not returned are not available for other patrons. Replacing lost material is costly.”
Amanda Perry-Davis, the library’s collection manager, said the library acquires books generally based on their popularity. That can be determined by various book reviews, journals and magazines. Library professional journals recommended the “lost books” as appropriate titles for each age level.
Patrons also suggest specific books to acquire, said Perry-Davis.
Federspiel, who is retiring at the end of the year, said several staffers also provide their input on what books to buy but the final decision is hers.
  Shelby County Public Library, Aug. 5, 2025. (David Stephenson/Kentucky Lantern)
Federspiel said that most of the “lost books” had not been in high demand by library patrons. 
The library left a voicemail message with the patron about the overdue books and issued three other notices before turning the matter over to a collection agency, Unique Management, after 60 days, she said. The replacement cost is added to the patron’s card but so far the books remain missing.
Church has other targets besides library
The church has engaged in more public protests, including against a now closed Shelbyville bar and a fall fundraiser in Cynthiana in which people dress up as witches.
The church protested The Barrel Room, formerly a bar in downtown Shelbyville, for holding drag shows and the city’s conference center for allowing “drag queens to dance in front of children.”The church branded Cynthiana “a hotbed of witchcraft” in response to the Harrison County seat’s Witches’ Day Out event.
“These displays grieve the heart of God and signal our community’s descent into spiritual decay,” said Pastor Dorris. “We do not hate the men who perform in drag, nor the librarians, nor the critics who accuse us of being hateful. We love them enough to tell the truth — that Jesus Christ is Lord, that sin leads to hell, and that the gospel alone can set people free.”
The Barrel Room closed in October. Vicki Jones Lee, a local gay rights advocate, said she saw several drag shows there. “We would hear the protesters outside, making a lot of noise. The shows would just go on,” she said.
A spokesperson for the conference center said the center became the site for a Pride event in the summer of 2023 “to help it find a public venue.

James Smith, executive director of the Cynthiana-Harrison County Chamber of Commerce, said “Witches Day Out” is part of the community’s annual Halloween festivities. Participants dress like witches and try to raise money for a needy cause such as helping a family whose child had brain cancer
“It’s not a cult, it’s not a religion. Cynthiana’s Witches Day Out is a fun, community event with 130-plus vendors, food, readings, and a Victorian seance-themed Crystal Ball on the first Saturday in September in downtown Cynthiana to kick off the fall season,” said committee member Sam Lunger.
“But it is disappointing to hear anyone say it involves witchcraft. Everyone is entitled to free speech but this is misleading and out of bounds. We do provide a free space for the church protesters.”
Drag shows and witches are taboo to the church but it has given most attention to books.
Consequences
Dorris, the pastor, expects “some sort of reaction against the church” for its book removal efforts but does not know exactly what that will be.
“We know there will be consequences for saying what others are afraid to say. We will not be silent. We will not comply. We will not flinch. Our duty is to God, and our aim is the good of our neighbors — even those who revile us,” he said.
Madison Markham, a staff member on PEN America’s Freedom to Read team, said, “The alarming rise of book bans and censorship in the country is and will continue to have devastating consequences in our communities in the years to come.
“Regardless of whether you are a student, a parent, a librarian, an author, or a community member, this is an issue that affects all of us. Access to books with LGBTQ+ representation helps LGBTQ+ people and their families feel seen, and builds empathy. Everyone deserves the right to read and to be exposed to diverse ideas and experiences.”
Mark Adler, director of the Paris-Bourbon County Public Library and last year’s winner of the Kentucky Public Library Association’s Intellectual Freedom Award, acknowledges that community members have the right to voice their concerns about materials in a public library but suggested it be channeled through a reconsideration request.
Each individual library has its own reconsideration process, as each community is unique in its makeup just as the local library collections are, he said. “These reconsideration requests provide an avenue for community members to file objections while also providing a structured, consistent process for libraries to follow when requests are filed. We encourage community members who have questions to bring those directly to their local libraries so we can work with the affected citizens to address their concerns.”
Shelby County’s Federspiel concurred, adding a public library should always celebrate books for all kinds of people.
In 1903, when Andrew Carnegie built the library in Shelbyville and donated $10,00 to it  “he had inscribed on the floor as you enter …  ‘A University for the People,’ showing his dedication to unite communities,” she said.
“To this day, we proudly honor these words by acquiring acquisitions that celebrate both inclusiveness and diversity of our community.”

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)Contractor Hector Madrid Reyes was driving to Home Depot in March when he was rear-ended. As he and the other driver exchanged information, a Georgia State Patrol officer pulled up and asked for their licenses. Madrid, who arrived in the U.S. from Honduras as a teenager and was awaiting a court hearing for his asylum claim, didn’t have one.
“There’s no public transportation where we’re at, no Uber or Lyft,” said his wife, Jacqueline Maravilla, about his choice to drive. “Everything’s 45 minutes from everything. It’s a calculated risk we have to take to support our family.”

This story is part of “Trump Two: Six Months In,” a series from The Marshall Project that takes stock of the administration’s efforts to reshape immigration enforcement and criminal justice.

That risk has grown even greater for thousands of immigrant families under the Trump administration, as officials expand efforts to deport people with little or no criminal history.
The monthly number of people deported whose most serious conviction was a traffic violation — such as driving without a license — has more than tripled in the last six months, hitting almost 600 in May, according to new estimates by The Marshall Project. In total, over 1,800 people with traffic violations have been deported this year.
People with no criminal convictions at all make up two-thirds of the more than 120,000 people deported between January and May. For another 8%, the only offense on their record was illegal entry to the U.S. Only about 12% were convicted of a crime that was either violent or potentially violent. The numbers contradict officials’ continued claims that immigration enforcement is focusing on the “worst of the worst” criminal offenders.
The numbers are estimates from a Marshall Project analysis of Immigration and Customs Enforcement data, provided to the Deportation Data Project in response to a FOIA request. The group noted the dataset may be incomplete and could undercount the true numbers of deportations.
ICE officials did not respond to a request for comment.

For many facing removal, the crimes on their records are years old. So far this year more than 600 people have been deported whose most serious convictions were marijuana-related offenses, and in three out of four cases, the offense occurred at least five years ago.

“It’s not at all about convictions anymore,” said Tim Warden-Hertz, a directing attorney of the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, a Washington-based legal organization. “There is no discretion. It’s just trying to get as many people as they can, any way that they can.”
Historical data from the Deportation Data Project shows that previous administrations also deported people with no convictions or only minor offenses, but the numbers have increased under Trump. From President Biden’s inauguration through the end of fiscal year 2023, the last day with available data, over half of the people deported had no criminal conviction. During that period, an average of 80 people a month were deported with only traffic offenses, compared with an average of over 350 per month so far under Trump’s second term.
Some of Trump’s advisors have said publicly that the administration’s goal is for 3,000 ICE arrests each day. But in recent court filings, immigration officials have denied having a quota.

Some attorneys worry this pressure to deport more people is leading to an increase in racial profiling, and that more drivers of color are being pulled over for minor traffic violations as a way to check their legal status. Twenty states have recently passed laws that increase local police’s involvement in immigration enforcement. And a growing number of police departments are signing agreements with the Department of Homeland Security to enforce federal immigration laws during encounters like routine traffic stops.
“We hear people pulled over for minor reasons, like a broken blinker, crossing the yellow line, or the tint is too dark on windows,” said Paul R. Chavez, director of litigation and advocacy for Americans for Immigrant Justice, a Miami-based nonprofit. “People are arrested for those very minor things, brought to jail, fingerprinted, and then handed over to ICE.”
Chavez noted that many people are being charged solely with driving without a license, a crime police generally discover only after making a traffic stop. “If you’re pulled over and that’s the only accusation, in my mind that’s pretty clear evidence of racial profiling,” he said.
The number of people deported with only nonviolent offenses — like trespassing, failure to appear in court, marijuana offenses, shoplifting and traffic violations — has almost doubled since January.
After Madrid’s accident, he says he passed a breathalyzer test. But he admitted he had smoked weed the night before, 18 hours prior. The Georgia State Patrol officer arrested him on charges of driving without a license and driving under the influence.
Madrid’s only existing conviction was for driving without a license in 2019, he said. Back then, “He got arrested, I bailed him out, he had a court date, he paid the fine,” Maravilla said. “And that was the end of it.”
Things went differently this time. After Maravilla paid Madrid’s bond, ICE officers picked him up and ultimately took him to Stewart Detention Center, south of Columbus, Georgia. A judge denied his release from detention, citing the DUI charge for marijuana use the night before the accident. But the hearing in his criminal case wouldn’t happen until the following summer. Madrid had to decide between spending at least a year stuck inside a remote, overcrowded detention center — or leaving his wife and family behind.
In early July, Madrid opted to self-deport to Honduras. Maravilla, a U.S. citizen who has never been on a plane and doesn’t have a passport, is working to save enough money to visit him and bring him some of his belongings. The two were married just three weeks before his arrest.
“It’s a deep pain,” Madrid told The Marshall Project in Spanish. “I am not there with my wife, cannot see my mother and give her a hug, or help them with what I earn from my work. Listening to my wife cry on the phone has been something I do not wish for anyone.”

Missouri lawmakers are poised to return to Jefferson City next month to redraw the state’s eight congressional districts in order to gerrymander the Kansas City-based seat of Democratic U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver. They’re also considering changes to the initiative petition process to make it harder for Missourians to change the state constitution.
Both have been longtime priorities of the Freedom Caucus, a group of hard-right GOP state lawmakers whose quarrels with party leaders led to years of Missouri Senate gridlock.
Yet after years of holding outsize sway in Missouri politics, the Senate Freedom Caucus is down to only two members.
State Sen. Rick Brattin, a Harrisonville Republican and former caucus chairman, quit in June following a break with the group over a $1.5 billion incentive package to finance stadiums for the Chiefs and Royals.
State Sen. Brad Hudson of Cape Fair, who also voted in favor of the stadium bill, soon joined him. He told The Independent last week that his differences with the caucus focused on tactics, not policy.
Right-wing ‘Freedom Caucus’ launches at Oklahoma Capitol

“I’ve got nothing but respect for my friends in the Freedom Caucus,” Hudson said.
The departures mean only two state senators from St. Charles County — Nick Schroer and Adam Schnelting — are still aligned with the Freedom Caucus.
Schroer, who took over as caucus chairman after Brattin stepped down, insists the group is “stronger than ever” despite the loss of half its Senate membership.
There are 11 members of the caucus in the House, Schroer said, and numerous candidates likely to join the group who are running in GOP primaries for open Senate seats next year. Not to mention, he said, Missouri’s secretary of state and two congressmen are Freedom Caucus alums.
“I’m not concerned whatsoever that at this moment we only have two very strong senators,” he said. “And I think those numbers are going to grow. But just like in years past, there are going to be senators who may not be wearing the Freedom Caucus insignia, but they are going to be with us on 99.9% of issues.”
But the caucus’ dwindling numbers in the Senate, where its influence was always most acutely felt, has some wondering if its days in the center of the Missouri political spotlight are drawing to a close.
It began in 2018, when a group of GOP senators formed what they called the conservative caucus.
The group’s formation set off an escalating war with Republican leadership that culminated four years later when acrimony became so bad that the Senate adjourned a day early for the first time since a fixed adjournment date was set in the state constitution in 1952.
Soon after, the conservative caucus announced it was disbanding.
A year later, six Republican senators — most of whom were part of the conservative caucus — announced the formation of the Missouri Freedom Caucus.
And the Republican civil war resumed almost immediately.
The 2023 legislative session saw Freedom Caucus members using near-daily procedural maneuvers to gum up the Senate. Republican leadership responded by stripping caucus members of committee assignments and musing about their expulsion.
The 2024 session saw no improvement, resulting in fewer bills passed than any year in living memory, including the COVID-shortened session in 2020.
Throughout the turmoil, the group kept losing members.
State Sen. Cindy O’Laughlin, a Shelbina Republican, quit in 2021, telling The Independent at the time that she grew tired of the group’s disruptive tactics. She went on to become majority leader and president pro tem of the Senate, routinely squabbling with her former caucus colleagues.
GOP state Sen. Jill Carter of Granby left the group last year, saying she could no longer in good conscience be a part of “actions behind the scenes that defame grassroots and violate the needs of my constituents.”
Tensions in the Senate cooled this year, with term limits pushing key figures on both sides of the fight out of the chamber. The detente led to a much more productive session, marked more by partisan squabbling than GOP infighting.
That changed after Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe called lawmakers back into special session in June to pass incentives aimed at keeping the Chiefs and Royals from moving to Kansas.
The Freedom Caucus vowed to oppose the funding scheme, which it decried as a “handout to billionaire sports team owners.” But Brattin and Hudson voted in support of the plan after a provision was added making changes to local property tax bills.
Both were accused of betraying the caucus’ principles, with the group’s longtime political adviser publicly calling for the Freedom Caucus to “disband and join the uniparty that runs Jefferson City.”
Brattin quit soon after, saying he opposed the stadium funding but voted in favor after the property tax provisions were added that he believed would benefit his constituents.
Hudson quit a month later.
“I agree with the caucus probably on 95% of the issues,” Hudson said, “and I intend to continue to be allies with them and work with them on issues that we agree on. There have been some times where tactically, there may have been some disagreements where I may have wanted to go a different direction.”
Schroer said the fact that the legislature is poised to debate a congressional map that seeks to eliminate the Democratic-leaning seat in Kansas City shows the Freedom Caucus is anything but dead.
“Back in 2022, the Freedom Caucus pushed for a 7-1 map and couldn’t get enough Republicans to help us,” he said. “Now we’re going to do it.”
The overarching goal, he said, is that the Freedom Caucus will pull the party to the right so the caucus will no longer need to exist at all.
“When we’ve got enough of these strong-willed conservatives that are able to stand up to the establishment and stand up to special interest groups, hopefully at that point we’ll have a majority of the majority,” he said, “ and there will be no need for the Freedom Caucus.”

U.S. Army National Guard and Navy Veteran Tripp Adams announced in late July he would be suspending his campaign in order to prioritize his mental health. On Monday, Adams offered his support to former special victims prosecutor Christina Hines. 
“I want to endorse Christina as a friend, and as the leader that Macomb and Oakland counties need,” said Tripp Adams, “As a veteran and as a small business leader, when I sat down with Christina, I felt heard and seen. Christina has the plan, the leadership, and experience as a warrior fighting for us as a prosecutor to win this race and take care of the people in our community – not just Democrats, but people from all walks of life. That’s why I’m excited to endorse her campaign today.”

Hines noted her gratitude for Adams’ endorsement, with the two becoming friends in their time on the campaign trail. 
“I have deep respect for Tripp’s service to our country, his commitment to our democracy, and his determination to fight for everyone in our community. I’m glad to have him as an advisor and friend,” Hines said. 
While Michigan’s 10th Congressional District is held by U.S. Rep. John James (R-Shelby Township), James’ decision to seek the governor’s seat in 2026 has left the battleground seat open to competition. 
According to the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, the seat leans Republican, however Michigan 10 has been listed as a key target for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
Two Republicans have stepped up to succeed James in holding the district for Republicans: Michigan Open Carry Inc. President Casey Armitage and former Macomb County Assistant Prosecutor Robert Lulgjuraj.
With Adams exiting the race, four candidates are expected to face off in the Democratic primary. Alongside Hines, former state Rep. Tim Greimel, attorney Eric Chung and U.S. Army veteran Alex Hawkins are vying for the nomination.

HOLLAND — Ottawa County residents continued to call for the closure of the coal-fired J.H. Campbell coal plant on Friday, decrying a Trump Administration order in May that prevented the facility from closing as planned earlier this year.
“The Campbell coal plant is Consumers Energy’s last coal power plant (in Michigan), and it’s one of the biggest contributors to pollution in our entire state,” said Indigo Umlor, of the Michigan League of Conservation Voters, which organized the protest along with the Sierra Club and other local activist groups.
The 18-year-old Byron Center resident said the majority of county residents don’t want the plant to continue operations because it’s driving up energy bills for residents and remains a major contributor to air pollution in the area.

Campbell coal plant in Port Sheldon Township to close. [ONN photo/Dirk Wierenga]“We don’t want that by our lakes. We don’t want that by any of us,” Umlor said. “The closure of the plant was planned for years and years, and it was projected to save Michiganders $600 million by 2040, but instead, Bill Huizenga has chosen to align with MAGA politicians and align with keeping this plant open for longer. This plant is costing about $1 million per day to stay open, and in the last five weeks, has cost taxpayer dollars about $30 million.”
 How we got here

The protest, which marched from downtown Holland’s Window on the Waterfront to U.S. Rep. Bill Huizenga’s Holland office, was the second protest this week over the controversial continued operation of the Campbell plant, which has become the epicenter of a legal battle between the U.S. Department of Energy and Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel.
On Tuesday, a group of lawmakers, health professionals and other officials held a press conference in the shadow of the Campbell plant, calling on federal officials to withdraw a May 23 federal order exercising wartime powers to force Consumers to keep the plant available for operation for 90 days.
The plant, operating since 1962, was originally scheduled to close partially in 2030 and wholly in 2040. But the utility announced in 2021 it was moving the plan up by 15 years for an operations end date of May 31, 2025.
Consumers has said closing the plant was expected to save Michigan ratepayers $600 million by 2040.
The utility was seeking to end coal use altogether by 2025 as part of its goal to achieve carbon neutrality.
  The J.H. Campbell plant in Port Sheldon Township, operating since 1962, was scheduled to close partially in 2030 and wholly in 2040. Consumers Energy, however, announced in 2021 it was moving the plan up by 15 years for May 31, 2025. [ONN photo/Sarah Leach]On May 23, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright directed the Midcontinent Independent System Operator in coordination with Consumers to ensure that the 1,560 megawatt plant “[remain] available for operation, minimizing any potential capacity shortfall that could lead to unnecessary power outages.”
The Energy Department said the emergency order is authorized by Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act and is in accordance with President Trump’s Executive Order: Declaring a National Energy Emergency to ensure that power generation availability in the region does not “dip below 2024 capacity levels.”
The order came just eight days before the plant was scheduled to shut down.
Wright said the move was intended “to minimize the risk of blackouts and address critical grid security issues in the Midwestern region of the United States ahead of the high electricity demand expected this summer.”
“This administration will not sit back and allow dangerous energy subtraction policies threaten the resiliency of our grid and raise electricity prices on American families. With President Trump’s leadership, the Energy Department is hard at work securing the American people access to affordable, reliable, and secure energy that powers their lives, regardless of whether the wind is blowing or the sun is shining.”
In June, Nessel — along with a collective group of public interest organizations, Minnesota and Illinois, Maryland Office of People’s Counsel, and the Organization of Midcontinent Independent System Operator States — challenged the DOE’s order to keep the Campbell plant in Port Sheldon Township to remain open for 90 days, arguing that the move will force customers to absorb exorbitant costs.
Nessel filed a request for rehearing with the DOE, challenging what she described as an “arbitrary and illegal order seeking to stop the planned retirement of Consumers Energy’s J.H. Campbell coal-fired power plant in West Olive, Michigan, under the pretense of a fabricated energy emergency.”
She said the order “will burden Michigan utility customers with unnecessary costs and needless additional pollution from the 60-year-old Ottawa County coal plant that was scheduled to close May 31.”
When the DOE didn’t respond to Nessel’s request within 21 days, she filed a petition for review July 24 with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Washington, D.C., Circuit, challenging the U.S. Department of Energy’s order, claiming the “arbitrary and illegal” move forced the continued operation of the plant “under the pretense of a fabricated energy emergency.”
“This unprecedented order by the Department of Energy declares an emergency without evidence, completely ignores state and federal regulators that approved the plant’s retirement, and will potentially put enormous costs onto utility customers who receive no real benefit,” Nessel said. “I will continue to fight to protect Michigan customers from unreasonable costs imposed by the federal government.”
Last month, Nessel also filed a pleading before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in response to Consumers’ request to recover the costs from running the Campbell plant beyond its initial retirement date. That proceeding is still ongoing.
Katie Carey, director of media relations for Consumers, said Tuesday that the utility is continuing to comply with the DOE order and has requested “the timely recovery of costs associated with plant operations.”
“We expect FERC will take timely action on our request. Our FERC filing from Friday, June 6, requests approval of a mechanism to recover and allocate those costs through MISO.
 Frustration mounts with residents

“This is a clear example of how the Trump Administration doesn’t care about what the constituents want. This is why we’re out here protesting,” Umlor said. “We need to show Bill Huizenga and the rest of the MAGA party that we don’t support their actions. As a matter of fact, we support our Earth.”
Friday’s protest drew nearly 100 participants, who displayed signs with slogans like “Huizenga: Listen to the people,” “Leave coal in the ground” and “My asthma and my wallet can’t afford coal.”
Dr. Steven Ashmead, a family physician and a member of the Michigan Clinicians for Climate Action, said coal-fired plants pose serious negative health effects to residents, which is part of well-settled science.
“Public health of Michigan is more important than the political favors the Trump administration owes in coal, in the fossil fuels for over 60 years,” Ashmead said.
He said the burning of fossil fuels has caused pollution that has led to widespread health issues for many Michigan residents.
“We cannot stress that enough pollutants like carbon dioxide, particulate matter, nitrous oxide, sulfur dioxide and toxic metals such as arsenic, lead, mercury and radioactive radon exposure is highest to those of us living closest to the plant right now,” he said. “However, those westerly winds blow those emissions straight to Grand Rapids and beyond. The coal ash contains at least 17 toxic heavy metals, including lead, mercury, cadmium, all of which damage human health and at least six neurotoxins and five known or suspected carcinogens.”
Ruby Muehlenz, a local youth activist who grew up in Holland, said keeping the Campbell open is a short-sighted move that perpetuates bad energy policy.
“Energy bills are just too damn high, guys,” Muehlenz said. “I’m in college, I’m at an apartment, I’m paying my own bills. It’s cost us already almost $30 million … energy prices will rise across the Midwest. Young people … we’re trying to create our own future.”
 Local politics involved

In February, the Ottawa County Board of Commissioners approved a resolution in a 10-1 vote urging a delay in the plant’s closure pending a second look by state regulators; however, they stopped short April 22 of approving a resolution that would have brought litigation to prevent the closure altogether.
At the time, the 10 Republicans on the board cited concerns over reports from energy watchdog agencies that warned of possible brownouts and blackouts in summer 2025 if more generating facilities were taken offline.

[ONN photo/Cathy Seaver]Board Vice Chair Josh Brugger, who voted in favor of the board’s May resolution, said earlier this week that commissioners merely intended to protect county residents from potential grid instability.
“My intention was that we were deferring to the state of Michigan’s authority and for them to weigh in and provide a second opinion on whether it should or should not be closed. Like, full stop right there,” he said Tuesday.
Board Chair John Teeples echoed his colleague’s comment.
“The resolution was to ask the [MPSC] to relook at this issue, in light of the concern that the grid was in jeopardy, at risk. That’s all it was, and that’s where it ended, even though other people wanted to go beyond that,” Teeples said Tuesday.
“Some wanted to start a lawsuit, which I thought was absolutely ridiculous and a waste of taxpayer dollars without any foresight about what it could mean,” he said. “So, all we were doing was raising the flag and that was it. That’s the extent. From my perspective, the county should go no more, no less. There’s nothing wrong with asking our elected officials or regulators to make sure you’ve got your T’s crossed, your I’s, dotted. That’s all this was, and that’s where it should stay.”
 What’s the cost?

In a June 3 statement, a Consumers spokesperson said the company is currently complying with the order.
“We are currently in compliance with the order, have arranged for new shipments of coal, some of which arrived last week, and will continuously operate the Campbell Plant,” Trisha Bloembergen, West Michigan media relations specialist, said in a June 3 email. “We are still determining the overall cost, but want to ensure those costs are shared across MISO and not all on Consumers Energy customers.”
Generating power at the Campbell plant is likely to be costly for ratepayers, experts from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis wrote June 5.
Campbell Units 1 and 2, which are 63 and 58 years old, respectively, were already increasingly uncompetitive in the MISO market, meaning it cost more to generate electricity than what it could be sold for, said energy data analysts Seth Feaster and Dennis Wamsted.
According to data filed by Consumers at FERC, the operation and maintenance costs for the two units totaled $45.80 per megawatt-hour (MWh) in 2023 (the most recent data available). That puts both units in the red almost all the time in MISO: S&P data shows that the monthly around-the-clock price at the Michigan hub has been above $40/MWh just twice in the past two years, and never during the summer.
“In other words, the plant would lose money on virtually every MWh generated if past prices hold this summer, costs that could add up to many more millions of dollars if the units at Campbell are run for any substantial amount of time,” Feaster and Wamsted said.
Beyond operational costs, there are fuel and staffing costs as well.
“Coal itself has gotten more expensive,” said Frank Rambo, executive director at Horizon Climate Initiative, a nonprofit organization that works to use cost-saving energy market reforms to address the causes and impacts of climate change.
“That fleet has gotten more expensive to run. It’s coal, which used to be synonymous with cheap power. It’s now among the most expensive power … and then the excess costs that are incurred because they’re running more expensive resources.
Ultimately, it will be residents who foot the bill, Rambo said.
“They run those coal plants, and then they turn around, go to their commissions and recover those excess costs from their customers,” he said.
Rambo said the price could be even higher than normal because Consumers would need to buy coal on the open market rather than enter into a new contract with a mine.
“We don’t need to sign a new long-term coal supply contract because we’re shutting the plant down,” he said. “Now they may have to buy coal on the spot market.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-17-080620-1024x688.png,,,2025-08-18 10:24:13.711171

Roger Marshall and President Donald Trump.","Christy Davis, one of three candidates seeking the Kansas Democratic Party's nomination for U.S. Senate, is eager to challenge in 2026 incumbent U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall, a Republican loyal to President Donald Trump. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Democrat Christy Davis’ campaign for U.S. Senate is steeped in the politics of incumbent Republican Sen. Roger Marshall and President Donald Trump.
But the resident of Cottonwood Falls is also driven by frustration that many folks holding power in Washington, D.C., have been quick to disenfranchise Kansans with no interest in placing a Marshall sign in the yard or branding themselves by wearing a MAGA cap.
“All Kansans are served by their elected officials, or should be,” Davis said on the Kansas Reflector podcast. “When you’re elected to the U.S. Senate, you’re representing everyone in the state regardless of who they voted for.”
“Kansans deserve the best representation, and we’re not getting it in Washington,” she said. “Register to vote, show up at the polls and help however you can.”


Davis said Marshall, who won a competitive race in 2020 and has committed to seek reelection in 2026, chose to be among the Senate GOP’s most partisan members rather than bring civility to the job.
“There’s not enough resources in the world … for us to be spending all of our energy fighting each other,” she said. “Kansans need to know that they’re being heard, not just the ones who are invited to private meetings.”
Davis, who hasn’t held elective office, launched one of three bids for the Kansas Democratic Party’s nomination for Senate. In terms of the August 2026 primary, her rivals would include Michael Soetaert of Wellington and Anne Parelkar of Overland Park.

‘Fight for what’s right’
Davis grew up in Harvey County and earned degrees at Kansas State University and Wichita State University. She worked as a preservation planner for the city of Newton and was a preservation officer with the Kansas Historical Society. She moved to Chase County in 2013 to become executive director of Symphony in the Flint Hills.
“The Flint Hills is one of the most endangered landscapes on the planet and so we were really focused on conservation of that landscape,” Davis said.
From 2023 until January, she was state director of rural development for the U.S. Department of Agriculture in the administration of President Joe Biden. The job was to deliver hard-to-fund projects important to communities, she said.
“During the Biden administration, we invested about $1.3 billion in projects in Kansas and worked on housing, local business, energy efficiency in agribusiness and also a lot of hospitals, clinics, child care, those sorts of projects,” she said.
Davis is married with a son. She said her grandfathers served in World War II, one as a surgeon and the other with soldiers who helped liberate concentration camps. She said their service wasn’t easy, but they did it because they “understood the importance of right and wrong, and they believed that it was an American value.”
Davis said her sister was a physician who died while advocating for the Affordable Care Act, the landmark law signed by President Barack Obama that reshaped health care in the United States.
“I tell people I’ve survived 36 hours of labor, and I’ve survived a double mastectomy, and after that, it doesn’t seem so hard to fight, to fight for what’s right,” Davis said.

‘It’s an embarrassment’
Davis ran for the U.S. House in 2020 but lost the Democratic primary. That 1st District campaign was won by U.S. Rep. Tracey Mann, a Republican who still serves a district stretching from Dodge City to Lawrence.
The last time Kansas elected a Democratic candidate to the U.S. Senate was in 1932. Both of the state’s Senate seats have been held by Republicans since 1939.
“Sometimes there are other factors at play besides who the best candidate is,” Davis said. “The key is garnering that support, raising enough money early to get, you know, on the ground and begin the hard work.”
She said one of her strengths as a candidate was that she had worked in every county in Kansas and understood issues relevant to a diverse constituency. She said Congress wasn’t fighting battles that needed to be fought for Kansans, including affordable housing and the rising cost of living.
Congress should stand up for fundamental rights, including due process, amid the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, Davis said.
She said she was an unwavering supporter of public education and was convinced the effort to close the U.S. Department of Education would make education a significant campaign issue in 2026. She opposed appropriation of tax dollars to private schools.
“I believe that we should be doing everything we can to shore up public education,” she said.
Davis denounced the proposed amendment to the Kansas Constitution that would have laid the foundation for more stringent restrictions on abortion. In 2022, Kansas voters rejected the amendment to nullify a Kansas Supreme Court opinion that said the state constitution guaranteed women bodily autonomy and the right to end a pregnancy.
Votes in Congress to remove millions of people from Medicaid could jeopardize dozens of rural hospitals in Kansas, she said.
Davis said work by Republicans to demolish the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, was a tragedy.
“It’s an embarrassment that we have cut funding to USAID, that we have had opportunities to help people who are experiencing food insecurity, and that we have cut those programs off at the knees,” she said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/P8120676-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-08-18 09:57:21.612515

Pregnant women are more vulnerable to developing severe illness from COVID-19.","In this photo illustration, Ruth Jones, Immunization Nurse, holds a Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (brand name: Comirnaty) at Borinquen Health Care Center on May 29, 2025 in Miami, Florida.  (Photo illustration by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Heading into the respiratory illness season, states and clinicians are working to encourage pregnant patients to get COVID-19 vaccinations, even though the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services no longer recommends that they should.
Along with being older and having an underlying health condition, pregnancy itself is a risk factor. Pregnant women are more vulnerable to developing severe illness from COVID-19. They’re also at high risk for complications, including preterm labor and stillbirth. The vast majority of medical experts say getting the shot is safe and effective — much safer than having the illness.
But HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced in May that the agency would no longer recommend that pregnant women get the vaccine. Before testifying before Congress in June, Kennedy circulated a document on Capitol Hill claiming higher rates of fetal loss after vaccination. But the authors of those studies told Politico that their work had been misinterpreted.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Experts say the federal shift puts the onus on state health agencies to ramp up vaccine guidance and outreach. Clinicians and public health organizations are trying to dispel misinformation and make sure information reaches low-income people and people of color, who had higher maternal death rates during the pandemic. During the first two years of the pandemic, the virus contributed to a quarter of maternal deaths, according to federal data.
“We are severely disappointed,” said Dr. Neil Silverman, a professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California, Los Angeles David Geffen School of Medicine. He has studied vaccines and pregnancy for the past 15 years and specializes in high-risk pregnancies.
Silverman called the federal shift a “public health tragedy on a grand scale.”
Health groups urge insurers to cover COVID-19 shots for pregnant women

Vaccinations against COVID-19 help prevent severe illness in pregnant people as well as their newborns, who are too young to get vaccinated, Silverman said. In what’s called passive immunity, vaccinated mothers pass on antibodies to their babies through the placenta and through breast milk.
“State public health agencies are probably going to have to implement vaccine guidance that differs from the federal recommendations. And that’s going to be an interesting can of worms,” said OB-GYN Dr. Mark Turrentine, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas.
Turrentine serves on a board of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists that focuses on immunization and infectious diseases. He said his recent pregnant patients who had COVID-19 hadn’t gotten the vaccine.
“The change in guidance on the federal level just really makes a lot of confusion, and it makes it very challenging to try to explain to individuals why all of a sudden the difference,” Turrentine said.
A slew of public health organizations have been making a concerted effort to dispel vaccine myths. They include the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit organization of maternal-fetal experts. At a news briefing the society held this month, clinicians stressed the safety and long-standing science behind COVID-19 vaccines, as well as the shots for RSV and the flu. Cases of RSV and the flu tend to peak in the winter months, while in recent years COVID-19 cases have spiked in the summer and the winter.

Dr. Brenna Hughes, an OB-GYN who chairs the organization’s infectious diseases and emerging threats committee, pointed to survey data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing that less than a third of eligible pregnant patients received COVID-19 shots, and only 38% received RSV shots for the 2023 to 2024 season. Less than half — 47% — received flu shots, and 59% received TDAP (whooping cough) vaccines.
CDC data shows that for last year’s and this year’s season, only between 12% and 14% of pregnant patients got the COVID-19 vaccine.
“The complications from the infection are so much greater than the complications and the very few and typically minor adverse events that might occur from the vaccine,” said microbiologist Sabra Klein, a professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
In June, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and 30 other professional health organizations signed a letter urging insurers to continue covering the COVID-19 shot for pregnant women, and have continued to urge coverage since then.
CVS Caremark, one of the nation’s three major pharmacy benefit managers, told Stateline it will continue covering the vaccine for pregnant women. The Arizona, California and North Carolina state Medicaid agencies also told Stateline they are still currently covering COVID-19 vaccines for pregnant women.
Dr. Kimberly Fortner, president-elect of the Infectious Diseases Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology, said during the maternal-fetal medicine briefing that she hopes medical groups’ joint messaging will bolster insurers.
“Hopefully by us linking arms, that can then help develop consistency so that insurers will continue to pay for the vaccine,” she said.

Exacerbating disparities
Dr. Ayanna Bennett, director of the District of Columbia Department of Health, said the federal government’s new stance has upended “a system that’s been stable for a very long time.”
Bennett said her agency used federal pandemic aid to shore up vaccine outreach efforts to communities of color. Now that flow of money is ending.
The changes in federal guidance and funding will “almost certainly exacerbate” maternal health disparities, said Marie Thoma, a perinatal epidemiologist and an associate professor in the University of Maryland Department of Family Science who researches pregnancy and COVID-19.
Black and Indigenous women died at higher rates. The virus exacerbated existing racial disparities in maternal health — and created new ones: Latina mothers, who generally see low rates of maternal mortality, saw deaths surge to 28 per 100,000 in 2021. Their rate was about 12 per 100,000 in 2018, according to federal data.
“We are going in with some exposure already that we didn’t have during the start of the pandemic. So, there will be some protection, but now that will erode,” said Thoma. “If we’re not getting vaccines, or if people are hesitant to take them, we could see some increase.”
Silverman said the administration’s efforts to strip mentions of race from government policies makes it difficult for institutions to reach populations at greatest risk. He called the dismissal of decades of data “saddening and infuriating.”
“The politicization of the vaccine process, or access to it, is what concerns me the most,” said Dr. Yvette Martas, a Connecticut OB-GYN who chairs the board of directors of the Hispanic Health Council.
Many women “are trying to navigate an economic system that’s not always in their favor in terms of also providing access to the kind of educational material that they need,” she said.
Not just COVID-19
In June, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee, replacing them with some members who are vaccine skeptics.
The change is creating chaos. Some states have vaccine laws, such as mandates for kids and coverage statutes, that are specifically tied to the committee’s decisions.










The politicization of the vaccine process, or access to it, is what concerns me the most.


– Dr. Yvette Martas, a Connecticut OB-GYN who chairs the board of directors of the Hispanic Health Council


The Vaccine Integrity Project at the University of Minnesota called on frontline health workers, health officials and professional societies to “counter the spread of inaccurate and confusing vaccine information.”
At a news briefing this month held by the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, representatives from Alabama, Connecticut and Washington, D.C., said they will continue to recommend vaccines.
Alabama’s state health officer, Dr. Scott Harris, said clinicians will be instrumental in getting correct vaccination information to patients.
“We don’t think that we necessarily have the same authoritative voice that we might have had a decade ago in trying to guide people in what to do, but we do believe that people trust their health care providers in most cases and are certainly willing to listen to them,” he said at the briefing.
Bennett said she is hopeful that strong, consistent messaging from respected medical organizations will help combat confusion.
“Having established groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics or the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology make very firm recommendations that keep us essentially not changed from where we have been, I think, should reassure families,” she said.

Gov. Gavin Newsom’s effort to redraw California’s congressional maps is the marquee item on the state Legislature’s agenda, now that lawmakers are back today from summer recess and eyeing a frenetic schedule to decide the fate of more than 200 other bills in the next few weeks.
As CalMatters’ Alexei Koseff explains, Democratic officials released new maps on Friday that would give the party a greater chance of picking up five more seats currently held by Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives during the 2026 midterm elections. The maps would also help shore up seats barely held by Democrats in five other districts.
Before the end of this week, state lawmakers plan to hold a vote that would place the new maps on the ballot in a statewide special election. If passed, California voters would then decide on Nov. 4 whether to approve or reject the maps.
Newsom’s plan — which is in direct response to Texas’ own redistricting efforts — is being slammed by Republicans as an illegal power grab by Democrats. The National Republican Congressional Committee said in a statement that it was prepared to fight Newsom in court.
An estimate by Assembly Republicans calculated that the special election would cost taxpayers more than $235 million. The last special election, in which voters rejected recalling Newsom in 2021, cost about $200 million. 
The state has pledged to cover the cost for counties for this election, and some early numbers have come in: Fresno and Riverside counties, for example, estimate it would cost them up to $4 million and $16 million, respectively.

Speaking of the maps: Alexei and CalMatters’ Jeremia Kimelman built a lookup tool that enables you to check if you could be affected by the redistricting plan. Though the new maps aim to give Democrats five more seats in the House, more districts could be altered. Check it out here.

Some news affecting California’s cost of living:

Gas prices: Despite ambitions to wean the state from fossil fuels and a campaign last year cracking down on oil companies over alleged gas price gouging, Newsom and Democratic leaders now find themselves negotiating a plan with oil companies to boost in-state oil production. The move comes after two California fuel refineries said they were shutting down sooner than expected, which could lead to gas prices rising to more than $8 a gallon by the end of 2026, according to a hotly contested estimate by one professor at University of Southern California. Democratic leaders are facing increased pressure to make the state more affordable. Read more from CalMatters’ Alexei, Alejandro Lazo and Maya C. Miller.


Health insurance: If you’re one of the nearly 2 million Californians covered by health insurance through Covered California, you will see your premiums increase by an average of 10.3% next year. This is the first time the marketplace’s rate will increase by double digits since 2018. While Covered California’s director cited a number of factors, including rising health care costs, about 2% of the rate increase is due to expiring federal aid that President Donald Trump did not extend in his federal budget bill. These enhanced subsidies were used by more than 90% of Affordable Care Act enrollees nationwide, and California stands to lose about $2.1 billion because of Trump’s changes.

Colorado River water shortages

Federal officials last week said the country’s two largest reservoirs could see steep declines in water levels within the coming years — a prospect that would severely affect the water supply of seven states, including California, writes CalMatters’ Rachel Becker.
The Colorado River’s Lake Mead and Lake Powell are each only 31% full, and are projected to dip to levels that would further tensions among the states in the Colorado River basin that must agree on new river management standards after 2026, when current guidelines expire. 
Based on two-year projections by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, some states could see their total annual allotment of Colorado River water cut by 5% to 18%. Because California has senior rights to the water, it has been spared from mandatory conservation.
Still, the risk of overdrafting the reservoirs underscores California’s dependency on them: The state takes the biggest share of Colorado River water, which it uses to irrigate crops in the Imperial Valley and to supply water to Southern California. 
Officials have warned that states must reach a broad agreement by Nov. 11 or risk having the federal government step in.

(Commonwealth Media Services)*This story will be updated*
The 2026 race for governor has begun in Pennsylvania.
After months of speculation, state Treasurer Stacy Garrity formally announced her candidacy for the Republican nomination for governor on Monday. 
Garrity, a combat veteran and Bradford County native, was first elected to statewide office in 2020 by defeating incumbent state Treasurer Joe Torsella by just under one point. Her victory over the Montgomery County Democrat was seen as an upset. 
She secured a second term in 2024 by defeating Democrat Erin McClelland by six points. During the campaign, she broke the record in Pennsylvania for most votes won by a candidate for statewide office. That record was previously held by Gov. Josh Shapiro’s 2022 landslide victory over GOP state Sen. Doug Mastriano, a potential challenger to Garrity for the 2026 nomination.
Garrity is the first Republican to announce her intentions for the statewide office.
Her announcement did not come as a surprise to political observers. During a conservative gathering in April, she told the Capital-Star that she was considering a run for the office. 
“I think right now…millions of Pennsylvanians feel that we’re at a crossroads in Pennsylvania and we have to decide what kind of state we’re going to be,” she said.
Just last week, she released a video sharply criticizing Shapiro and added that “help is on the way.” 
The Pennsylvania Republican Party is set to meet in September to endorse a candidate in the race. During the previous gubernatorial campaign in 2022, the party did not endorse a candidate in the crowded field, while Donald Trump delivered a last-minute endorsement to Mastriano.
Garrity and Mastriano have both been vocal supporters of President Trump.
The last time a Republican candidate won the race for governor in Pennsylvania was then-Attorney General Tom Corbett’s victory in 2010. Since then, three Democratic candidates – Tom Wolf (twice) and Shapiro – have won by nearly double digits.
Shapiro has not formally announced his bid for a second term, but is widely expected to run for re-election. He has a 61% approval rating, according to a Morning Consult poll released last month.
During an appearance in Luzerne County on Friday, Shapiro was asked about potentially facing Garrity in 2026. 
“Look, the Republicans are going to deal with their intramural fight. I’m not going to get into their parlor games,” Shapiro responded. “You know what I’m going to do? I’m going to keep creating jobs here in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. I’m going to fund our kids’ schools. I’m going to make sure that we have more cops on the beat, and I’m going to focus on doing my job of bringing Republicans and Democrats together to get stuff done. That’s my focus. They can focus on their political games all they want.”
The Cook Political Report currently rates the 2026 race for governor in Pennsylvania as “likely Democratic.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/26906_treas_inauguration_nk_005-e1755521613604-1024x707.jpg,,,2025-08-18 08:56:48.562036

(Photo by Madison McVan/Minnesota Reformer.)President Donald Trump’s campaign to deport immigrants en masse has reached the southeast Asian community in East St. Paul and beyond.
More than 150 southeast Asians have been deported from Minnesota since May, according to MN8, a Southeast Asian political advocacy group. More are awaiting deportation at an Immigrations and Customs Enforcement facility in Louisiana.
Many of those deported were brought to the U.S. as children as their parents fled the destruction of the Vietnam War and what’s known as the Secret War in Laos. The CIA recruited Hmong people in Laos to fight against the North Vietnamese army; many of the surviving soldiers fled with their families to the U.S. after the war. 
Activists gathered at the East Side Freedom Library in St. Paul Sunday to call attention to the deportations and discuss how to respond.
“Those same children who came as refugees are being sent back to the countries their family originally fled from by the same government that was responsible for their displacement 50 years ago,” said Montha Chum, executive director of MN8.
The Trump administration has highlighted the criminal records of the southeast Asian deportees. Many of those deported had served their sentences and became productive members of society, said Mai Neng Moua, an immigration attorney and board chair of MN8.
Rep. Kaohly Vang Her, DFL-St. Paul, was three years old when her parents joined the initial wave of Hmong refugees fleeing Laos for the U.S.; her grandfather was a colonel in the Secret War. 
Her — also a candidate for mayor of St. Paul — and MN8 supported reforms to the state pardon and clemency process that were passed by the DFL-controlled Legislature in 2023. Those reforms are of particular importance to immigrants with felonies on their records, who may be subject to deportation. 
Her said after Trump was elected to a second term, she and Rep. Liz Lee, DFL-St. Paul, met with staff from the administration of Joe Biden to ask for expedited pardons — including for those who could be at risk of deportation due to prior convictions. But the administration didn’t have enough time to issue the pardons, according to Her.

After years of cracking down on California’s oil industry, Gov. Gavin Newsom and legislative Democrats are moving to get Kern County wells pumping again to avoid soaring gasoline prices.


The oil industry is having an I-told-you-so moment in California.
For decades, the state has raced to end its reliance on fossil fuels and prioritize clean energy. Its relationship with oil companies became particularly contentious in the past two years, as Gov. Gavin Newsom and Democratic legislators held two special sessions to crack down on alleged price gouging at the pump.
But now two of its last remaining fuel refineries are closing sooner than California expected, tossing a simmering emergency into officials’ laps. With a hotly debated forecast that $8-per-gallon gasoline might be on the horizon, there has been a remarkable shift at the state Capitol. Led by Newsom, who just last fall was lambasting oil companies for “screwing” consumers, California may soon let its black gold flow again.
“We are all the beneficiaries of oil and gas. No one’s naive about that,” Newsom said at a press conference last month. “So it’s always been about finding a just transition, a pragmatism in terms of that process.”
Newsom and Democratic legislative leaders are now negotiating a plan with the industry to boost stagnating production in California’s oil-drilling hub of Kern County — and avert a nightmare scenario for a governor with national ambitions and a party that has promised to focus on affordability. Lawmakers could pass a measure before the end of their annual session in mid-September, though the details remain unsettled and environmental groups are raising alarms.
The headspinning realignment potentially heralds a new era in California’s transition to a carbon-free future, as high costs, technological impediments and flagging political will force Democrats to recalibrate their ambitious climate goals. President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans are also taking aim at the state’s vast powers to regulate its greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, including revoking California’s mandate to phase out gas-powered vehicles and slashing renewable energy tax credits.
“We all need to kind of evolve. Maybe that’s just the lesson on climate. There’s not really a purity test on this. It’s not like civil rights,” said state Sen. Henry Stern, a Calabasas Democrat who five years ago was publicly advocating for keeping more California oil in the ground. 
As both a staffer and a legislator, Stern worked on major laws to require buffer zones around oil wells in sensitive areas and restrict the well stimulation technique known as fracking. But he said he does not want California to see the same backlash to climate action as western Europe, where environmentally focused Green parties have recently been crushed electorally by far-right populists.
“We can perform a muscular version of climate policy that doesn’t have to be so all-or-nothing,” Stern said.
Oil industry forces Newsom’s hand
Refinery closures are accelerating the pressure in Sacramento. Two days after Newsom signed a law increasing state oversight of maintenance, Phillips 66 announced in October that it would shut its Los Angeles facility by the end of 2025 because of concerns over the sustainability of the California market. Then in April, Valero declared it would close its Benicia refinery next year, citing a challenging regulatory environment.
That would leave only six major facilities to refine crude oil into transportation fuels in a state that remains the country’s second-largest gasoline consumer after Texas, as well as a major user of jet fuel, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. A business professor at the University of Southern California projected the loss of refining capacity, which will be offset with more expensive imports of finished fuel, combined with additional state actions, could send gasoline prices spiraling past $8 per gallon by the end of 2026.
Republicans pounced on that figure to criticize Newsom for fomenting an energy crisis in California, sparking fierce pushback from the governor’s office, which has dismissed the report as an “unscientific analysis” by a professor with close ties to the oil industry. Other experts have estimated a smaller effect on prices, which currently average about $4.49 per gallon in California, according to AAA, $1.33 higher than the national average but lower than they’ve been since January. 
The Western States Petroleum Association — the powerful Sacramento-based lobby for the oil and gas industry that has donated more than $330,000 to lawmakers in the past decade — blames taxes, fees and regulations for California’s high prices. Decades of state rules, including strict emissions targets, a ban on the additive MTBE, and requirements for a special gasoline blend, traditionally make refining more expensive. Drilling in California is also in what the industry calls “terminal decline” as the Newsom administration has largely stopped issuing new permits, forcing a greater reliance on foreign countries such as Brazil, Iraq, Guyana and Ecuador with looser labor and environmental standards.
“At some point, are you going to have enough supply to meet California’s demands?” said Catherine Reheis-Boyd, CEO of the petroleum association, who evoked the fuel shortages and long lines at gas stations that followed a 1973 embargo against the United States by other oil-producing nations. “People’s lives were completely disrupted.”
Industry leaders argue pumping more crude oil in California, particularly in Kern County, could help meet demand at a lower cost. But if the state doesn’t act quickly, they warn that production could drop so low it would shut down pipelines between local oil fields and refineries, further exacerbating a crisis of California’s own creation.
“For me, I don’t care if the motivation is political or policy. I’m very happy that we’re having a conversation about something that’s really impactful to the consumers of California,” Reheis-Boyd said. 
Climate commitment meets reality
After years of making the oil industry into a political boogeyman, Newsom has become surprisingly receptive to its message.
Gone is the bombastic governor who declared to a United Nations summit in 2023 that “this climate crisis is a fossil fuel crisis,” or strong-armed the Legislature that same year into adopting a law that could penalize oil companies for excessive profits.

In April, after Valero said it would close its Benicia refinery, Newsom directed Siva Gunda, vice chair of the California Energy Commission, to “redouble the state’s efforts to work closely with refiners on short- and long-term planning” and ensure a “reliable supply of transportation fuels.”
Gunda returned a series of recommendations in June that closely aligned with the industry’s wishlist, including stabilizing in-state crude production, rolling back regulations that limit imports and improving investor confidence.
While the commission is exploring delaying implementation of the profit penalty and refinery maintenance oversight laws, Newsom began circulating a draft bill that would provide blanket approval for environmental reviews of Kern County wells to sidestep litigation that has stalled drilling. That proposal is now at the center of negotiations over a legislative package that could simultaneously create new standards for restarting offshore drilling, require the industry to plug more idle wells and end the use of fracking. 
“We’re in the ‘how’ business. We move to a low-carbon, green-growth future, change the way we produce and consume energy,” Newsom said at the press conference last month. “At the same time, we have enough available fuel supplies, a stable fuel supply and address the anxieties around cost. Both and.”
Matt Rodriguez, a longtime Democratic consultant who has worked in California and on several presidential campaigns, said Newsom is caught between a commitment to climate action that is important to the left and a substantive problem that could hurt both the economy and individual voters.
“The reality is that gas prices are higher here than the rest of the nation. That’s just undeniable,” he said. “If there are storm clouds on the horizon, you can’t just sit there and ignore it.”
The larger the gap between the price at the pump in California and in other states, Rodriguez said, the greater the liability it poses in a future presidential campaign for Newsom, who will likely also face criticism for how his own policies contributed to the problem. But Rodriguez said there is a potential upside if the governor can negotiate a solution with the oil industry, allowing him to tout himself as a pragmatist rather than an ideologue.
“Any way that he can keep gas prices from ballooning, that’s his imperative,” Rodriguez said.
‘We didn’t have a champion’
Environmental groups, meanwhile, are up in arms. More than 120 signed a letter earlier this month opposing Newsom’s push, which they characterized as an industry giveaway that would “gravely harm the air we breathe and water we drink around the state, but have no impact on refinery closures or gas prices.”
Hollin Kretzmann, an attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity, called the governor’s proposal to streamline approval of new Kern County wells a “drill, baby, drill” plan that would “eviscerate” California’s bedrock environmental review law for one of its core purposes: reining in a polluting industry.
He noted that courts already struck down earlier versions of the idea when Kern County tried it, because the environmental review was deemed insufficient. Last month, the county passed a third version of the plan, which Newsom’s bill would enshrine into state law.
“It’s a very misguided and ill-conceived proposal,” Kretzmann said.

Martha Dina Argüello, executive director of the Physicians for Social Responsibility Los Angeles, remembers attending a press conference last September, outside the Inglewood Oil Field, where Newsom signed a trio of new laws aimed at cleaning up idle wells and restricting oil and gas operations. She said she was “stunned” by the governor’s rapid reversal and warned that it would allow the oil industry to gut public health protections under the guise of affordability, passing the costs on to low-income communities near oil fields and refineries that have higher asthma and cancer risks from exposure to toxic chemicals.
“You don’t often get champions who are consistent — and it’s very sad that we didn’t have a champion that was really going to do the difficult thing and tell us the changes that we need to make to actually address climate change and air pollution,” she said. “That’s what our communities still need.”
Landing a deal will be tricky
The governor’s office is working to find an approach that can get through the Legislature in a short time frame. Lawmakers return from their summer recess on Monday for the final month of session.
That could necessitate making tradeoffs between priorities for environmentally minded lawmakers on the left, such as protecting the buffer zones around oil wells, and moderates more sympathetic to the industry’s arguments. It’s possible the proposal will be merged with a separate effort to extend California’s cap-and-trade system for greenhouse gas emissions, because oil refiners are seeking a more gradual decline in the credits that allow them to emit carbon pollution without paying.
Stern described the mood among lawmakers as “begrudgingly practical,” but also grumpy about having to take on yet another fight over oil, “so nothing feels like a win.” Given the political sensitivities, he said it was possible the Legislature would pass only the provision to boost drilling in Kern County and carry over the rest of the discussion into next year.
Nevertheless, the boundaries of the debate around domestic oil production have completely shifted in Sacramento, with affordability taking on a more prominent role.

Assemblymember Cottie Petrie-Norris, an Irvine Democrat who chairs the Assembly’s utilities and energy committee, said the Legislature could no longer afford to treat California’s energy transition like a future aspiration, as previous generations of officials have. Instead, lawmakers must be pragmatic and retain the support of everyday Californians, she said, because without their buy-in, the state will cease to be a climate leader.
“There are some advocates who continue to think that you can somehow just wave a magic wand and end oil production in California without terrible consequences,” she said. “We need California to be an inspiration, and not a cautionary tale.”
An agreement to expand drilling would be a hard-fought victory for Sen. Shannon Grove, a Bakersfield Republican who has spent the majority of her 10-year legislative career repeatedly warning that cutting oil production in California would only increase reliance on imports from countries with lower environmental and labor standards.
“Do I wish that companies and businesses would not have left my district and taken their jobs with them and created a vast unemployment rate? Do I wish that the people who lost their jobs still had their jobs? Do I wish it would have happened sooner?” Grove said. “Yes. But I’m grateful that it’s happening.”
Grove said Kern County, which also is home to some of the state’s largest solar and wind projects, has the potential to be the “energy capital of the United States.” She argues the county has done its due diligence with environmental reviews to ensure that future drilling projects are more climate conscious than importing oil from other countries. 
“If you’re going to do it, you have to do it right,” she said, “and Kern County does it right.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/070622_Oil_Field_LV_CM_006.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-18 08:56:48.562036

California has an overwhelmingly Democratic delegation in Congress. Gov. Newsom’s plan could give his party five more seats and offset a Texas gerrymander.


The fight over redistricting is about to hit overdrive in California.
As the Legislature returns to Sacramento today for the final month of session, Democrats are racing to finish a plan that could tilt the state’s congressional map in their favor — and thrust California into another confrontation with President Donald Trump.
Republicans, who stand to lose more than half their seats in the state, decry the scheme as a self-serving power grab. But supporters, led by Gov. Gav Newsom, contend they are saving democracy by stopping Trump from rigging the outcome of the 2026 midterms.
Ultimately, California voters will likely decide in a special election this November.
Here’s what you need to know:
Wait, what is Newsom trying to do?
The governor is leading the charge for the Democratic response in a burgeoning partisan showdown that could effectively determine control of the U.S. House of Representatives before a single vote is cast next November.
This kicked off thousands of miles away from Sacramento — in Texas. Earlier this year, Trump began pressuring Republican leaders there to redraw its congressional lines to shore up the GOP’s narrow majority in the House. As his approval rating sinks, the president is worried Democrats could win back Congress in the 2026 election and disrupt the final two years of his term.
Even as dozens of Democratic members have fled the state in protest, the Texas Legislature is advancing a new map that could flip five Democratic House seats to Republican control. Other conservative states, including Ohio, Missouri, Indiana and Florida, are considering similar actions.
So, channeling the anger of Democratic voters, Newsom has launched California into a retaliatory redistricting that would offset the Texas map with five new Democratic-leaning seats.
“Donald Trump, you have poked the bear and we will punch back,” Newsom said during a rally last week formally kicking off the campaign. “Don’t mess with the great Golden State.”
How would it work?
It’s complicated!
Unlike Texas, where the Legislature determines congressional lines, California voters in 2010 gave that power to a bipartisan citizen commission. The commission draws a new map once each decade, after the U.S. Census, to ensure each congressional district has roughly an equal number of people. It last did so in 2021.
Newsom is proposing to temporarily override the commission and create districts more favorable to Democrats until after the 2030 Census. That requires going to the voters for their approval.
Democratic officials already drew a new map in secret, which they finally shared publicly on Friday. The Legislature, where three-quarters of members are Democrats, plans to vote before the end of this week to put that map on the ballot in a statewide special election on Nov. 4.
“Voters will see the maps and have the final say,” Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas, a Salinas Democrat, said in a statement.
Why the rush?
California’s primary election is in June, so work backwards from there. The deadline for candidates to declare is in early March. Those who want to collect signatures to qualify, instead of paying a filing fee, can start in December.
That means new congressional lines need to be in place by the end of the year, so candidates actually know which voters they need to reach.

Newsom is eyeing Nov. 4 for the special election to consolidate it with municipal elections across the state that day. State law requires elections officials to mail a ballot to every voter starting 29 days before the election, and to military and overseas voters 45 days before, which means ballots must be ready by late September.
The secretary of state’s office has said the Legislature must act by Friday to leave enough time for local elections officials to meet those deadlines for a Nov. 4 election. Even then, the next month will be extremely busy for them.
How much will this cost?
The state has promised to cover the expenses counties incur running this unexpected election, which won’t be cheap. The last state special election, an unsuccessful recall of Newsom in September 2021, cost about $200 million.
Newsom has said consolidating the election with already scheduled local elections on Nov. 4 could save money. But early estimates from counties — up to $4 million in Fresno and up to $16 million in Riverside — are higher than they were for the recall.
“No price tag for democracy,” Newsom told reporters last week following the kickoff rally.
Will this plan succeed?
Democrats feel good about their chances, but it’s a heavy lift.
A Politico poll found that nearly two-thirds of California voters prefer retaining the state’s independent redistricting commission over returning authority to the Legislature to draw congressional lines.
That is not exactly what Newsom’s plan would do, however. His messaging has emphasized that the commission would only be sidelined temporarily, because of what he calls a Trump-induced political emergency. It’s reflected in the name of the measure: the Election Rigging Response Act. Internal polling shared with lawmakers put support, when framed along those lines, at 52%.
While that’s enough to win in November, it may not be enough to withstand an intense campaign this fall that is expected to draw hundreds of millions of dollars in spending. Charles Munger, Jr., the longtime Republican donor who poured more than $12 million into the campaign to pass independent redistricting, has said he will open up his wallet again to defend it.
“Citizens, not politicians or partisan party insiders, should not only hold the power at the ballot box but also the power to draw the lines,” Amy Thoma Tan, a spokesperson for Munger’s campaign committee, said in a statement.
The National Republican Congressional Committee said in a statement that it was prepared to “fight Gavin Newsom’s illegal power grab in the courts and at the ballot box.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/081425-Newsom-Redistricting-Rally-TS-CM-03.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-18 08:56:48.562036

Take a peek inside one ideal classroom scenario,Carolyn Jones,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/k-12-education/2025/08/california-tk/,"This fall at least 200,000 California students are expected to enroll in transitional kindergarten, which serves as a bridge between preschool and kindergarten.","In summary
This fall at least 200,000 California students are expected to enroll in transitional kindergarten, which serves as a bridge between preschool and kindergarten.


Break out the crayons and finger paint: Every 4-year-old in California is now eligible for transitional kindergarten.
Fifteen years after a handful of school districts opened the first TK classrooms, California now has the largest — and fastest growing — early education program in the country. At least 200,000 youngsters will attend TK this fall, enjoying low teacher-student ratios, age-appropriate curriculum and plenty of music, art and circle time.
“This really is something to celebrate,” said Carolyne Crolotte, policy director for Early Edge California, an advocacy group. “Now, there’s no question about who’s eligible and who isn’t. Everyone is eligible.”
TK is meant to be a bridge between preschool and kindergarten, preparing 4-year-olds for the routine and expectations of elementary school while honing their social skills and self-confidence. In TK, children learn how to make friends, write their names and do basic math. Mostly, they’re supposed to fall in love with learning.
Holding frogs and counting marshmallows
That was the case at Silverwood Elementary in Concord last week as a dozen bright-eyed 4-year-olds hovered around their teacher, Elizabeth Swanson, as she gingerly held out a tree frog for their inspection.
Several got a chance to hold the docile, turquoise amphibian.
“What does the frog feel like? What do you wonder about the frog?” said Swanson, who was recently named Mt. Diablo Unified’s Teacher of the Year. “How does he use his hands? How do you use your hands?”
But the tree frog — one of several critters in her classroom — was not the most popular attraction that afternoon. That honor belonged to the “home living” station, a corner of the classroom dedicated to costumes, dollhouses, a mini kitchen and everything else an imaginative youngster would need to play house.

Last year, an enterprising group of students, inspired by the opening of a Dutch Bros. near the school, used the home living station to open their own coffee shop. They ordered lattes and made coffee and collected money. Swanson turned it into a math lesson by asking them to count marshmallows and decide how many should go into each cup of hot chocolate.
“One child would be the barista and one would be the customer, so they learned how to share and take turns,” Swanson said. “They were getting so much practice with social language and communication. And everything was integrated into play.”
Importance of fun
Judy Krause, executive director of early childhood programs at Pacific Oaks College in Pasadena, said that’s exactly what a TK classroom should be like. The focus should be on experimentation and hands-on activities, based on students’ interests. TK, she said, is not a version of kindergarten; 4-year-olds have unique developmental needs. The main one, she said, is having fun.
If children are enjoying themselves, they’ll learn naturally, she said. If they feel overly pressured or bored, they’ll lose interest and miss out on valuable skills they’ll need for kindergarten and beyond.
“It’s a really big deal that we have this opportunity for all 4-year-olds,” Krause said. “But we have to make sure we’re doing it right.”
15-year rollout of TK
California introduced TK in 2010, and a decade later began expanding it to all districts. This year is the culmination of that effort, with all 4-year-olds now eligible and 91% of districts offering the program. The only districts that are exempt are those that don’t receive money through the state’s funding formula because they receive more money through their local property taxes. 
Like kindergarten, TK is optional. But many districts, including Mt. Diablo Unified, have seen strong interest from families. A recent report from the Public Policy Institute of California predicted that about 70% of 4-year-olds will enroll in TK this fall, with waiting lists in some districts. Black, Latino and Native American students have been slightly underrepresented so far, although those not enrolled might be enrolled in other programs. The state doesn’t track that data.
Nearly everyone agrees TK is a good idea. Children who’ve attended TK tend to do better in reading and math, and those with disabilities can be identified early and receive services, research shows. 
TK, which is free, can be a financial boon for families. Because of California’s high cost of living, child care and preschool costs are among the highest in the country, with families paying up to $20,000 annually — more than the cost of in-state tuition at the University of California. 
Gov. Gavin Newsom has long championed TK, setting aside more than $2.7 billion in the years when the state had a budget surplus. The money is to help school districts pay teachers, keep class sizes small and provide other services to the new learners. Ongoing funds will come from the state’s Local Control Funding Formula.
“California is making a big commitment to making transitional kindergarten free and accessible to all 4-year-olds,” Newsom said in a 2023 video. “When we’re finished, California will have the largest free preschool program in the country, where every 4-year-old can start their schooling on the right track, setting them up for success further down the road.”  
Teacher shortage and other challenges
But the TK rollout has had some hiccups. The chief one is finding enough qualified teachers. Because of the small class sizes and the extra qualifications required to teach 4-year-olds, there’s a shortfall of at least 12,000 TK teachers, according to Early Edge California. Last year the state introduced a new TK-through-third-grade credential and more districts are partnering with local colleges to recruit and train future teachers, which has eased the shortage somewhat.
Another obstacle has been finding classroom space. Like kindergarten classrooms, TK classrooms must contain bathrooms, which means that districts had to find money to remodel existing classrooms, or build new ones altogether. Last year’s $10 billion school construction bond has funding available for TK projects.
TK has also had an impact on preschools. Families in California have several early education options: state-funded preschools for low-income families, federal Head Start preschool for very low-income families, and private preschools. Now that 4-year-olds have a free option, existing preschools have seen an enrollment decline that, in some cases, has led schools to raise prices or even close. A recent report from UC Berkeley showed that TK expansion has led to “pre-K deserts” in some parts of the state.

Bruce Fuller, an education professor at UC Berkeley who’s researched TK, said it’s too early to tell who’s benefitting from the program. 
“We’re seeing a shift away from preschool and toward TK, but we don’t know if TK is actually reaching new families,” Fuller said. “We might just be seeing families who would have enrolled anyway.”
Dual-language programs
A handful of districts offer dual-language TK classes, which have been popular with parents. Karina Galustians, a parent in the Tujunga neighborhood of Los Angeles, enrolled her daughter Julianna last fall in an Armenian-English TK class in Los Angeles Unified’s Pinewood Early Education Center.
Galustians’ husband speaks fluent Armenian, and the couple was eager for Julianna to be able to communicate with the extended family and learn more about the culture. 
“The more languages you know, the better off you are,” said Galustians, whose first language is Spanish. “To find a school where she can get those academic skills and practice her Armenian — me and my husband were beyond grateful. We hit the jackpot.” 
Julianna starts kindergarten this fall at another Los Angeles Unified school, where she’ll be part of the Armenian dual language program. “We feel like she’s very well prepared,” Galustians said.
‘Everyone feels included’
Meanwhile, at Silverwood Elementary in Concord, Swanson ended the day by having students put away the blocks and plastic bugs and Eric Carle books. Then she sat with them in a circle and praised each child’s efforts and told them how excited she was to see them again tomorrow.
“David, you were super responsible today,” Swanson told an awed 4-year-old as she handed him a personalized certificate. “Lindsay, you were a good friend. Zaire, you were so respectful.”
Then it was time for the children to go meet their parents, who were waiting at the side of the playground. Swanson chatted with nearly every parent, telling them how much she enjoys their children.
“I think TK should be the same as what we want for society generally,” Swanson said. “It should be a place where everyone feels included and valued. We want everyone to be curious and non-judgmental and happy to be here.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/081125-TK-Class-Concord-LE-CM-04.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-18 08:56:48.562036

On August 12, 2025, just days after his 83rd birthday, Richard E. Tarrant Sr. passed away at his home in Hillsboro Beach, Florida surrounded by his family. Born in Newark, New Jersey on August 6, 1942, Rich was proud to be a first-generation Irish-American. The oldest of four boys, he graduated from St. Benedict’s Preparatory School in Newark before enrolling at New York basketball powerhouse Saint Bonaventure University in 1960.
After his freshman year at St. Bonnie’s, Rich realized he’d need a scholarship to continue his education. Disappointed to learn St. Bonnie’s would not guarantee a scholarship, he applied for a transfer to several other colleges. St. Michael’s College in Winooski, Vermont came through with a full scholarship, and the rest is basketball history. Leading St. Mike’s Purple Knights to multiple titles, “Richie the Robot” was named to the All-American Team in 1965 and drafted by the Boston Celtics as a fourth-round draft choice immediately after graduation. He played with Celtics greats Casey Jones, Sam Jones, John Havlicek, and Bill Russell. After being released at the end of pre-season, Rich went directly from the Celtics’ offices to IBM’s Boston Regional Headquarters, and although he didn’t have an appointment for an interview, the Regional Director met with him and hired him on the spot, thus setting the stage for Rich’s next chapter.
Rich excelled at selling computers in rural Vermont in the mid-1960’s – no easy feat. He was repeatedly named Salesman of the Year before leaving IBM in 1969 to start what became IDX Systems Corporation. With thousands of employees and offices worldwide, under Rich’s guidance, IDX flourished in early healthcare information technology. The company began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in 1995, and in 2005 was acquired by GE Healthcare.
Rich then turned his attention to national healthcare. Hoping to impact the broken American healthcare system through a national pulpit, he ran unsuccessfully for Vermont’s U.S. Senate seat in 2006. Never one to let adversity get in his way, Rich went on to found Marathon Health based in Winooski, Vermont. The company’s on-site clinics for corporations and government entities proved that managing healthcare on a personal level was far more effective than the existing American healthcare bureaucracy. To encourage entrepreneurship, Rich also invested in and mentored many other fledgling companies.
Rich felt strongly that his good fortune came with responsibilities. Along with his wife Deb, he established the Richard E. and Deborah L. Tarrant Foundation in 2005. Hundreds of non-profits have received funding from the Tarrant Foundation. In addition, the Foundation made a lasting impact on Vermont’s education system through the Tarrant Institute for Innovative Education. As Rich’s brainchild, the Institute partnered with the University of Vermont to train teachers across the state using interactive technology in the classroom and allowing students to learn and excel in non-traditional ways. Through the Foundation, Rich was also the creative force behind the recently released documentary “Gone Guys”. The film highlights the disenfranchised state young men across America face due to the current social climate and the lack of clear paths to successful manhood. “Gone Guys” was received to critical acclaim, winning the award for Best Documentary Feature at the Vermont Film Festival on the very day of Rich’s passing.
Rich was a master jokester with a zest for life that was contagious. As a member of the Boca Raton Economic Roundtable (aka Scuttlebutt) since 2006, he especially relished his role as unofficial court jester while sharing insights on economic and world issues.
Although Rich was tremendously successful in business and philanthropic ventures, his family is what brought him true joy. He is survived by Deb Tarrant (nee Deborah Miles Messner), his wife and partner of 28 years, his former wife Amy Tarrant (nee Amy Fayette), and seven children – Jerry Tarrant (Lori), Rich Tarrant Jr. (Tracy), Brian Tarrant (Christina), Ellen Ludwig (Derek), Audrey Williams (Basil), Tori Messner (Natalia), and Kyle Messner (Amanda). His 12 grandchildren (with number 13 on the way) meant the world to him and gave him endless delight – Gretchen, Claudia, Anisa, Cole, Lily, Nina, Vera, Eva, London, Ariana, Jasmine, and Miles.
Rich leaves a legacy of profound impact on thousands of lives. With a ready smile and a giving heart, at 6’6” he was larger-than-life with charisma to match. He was truly a “giant among men”.

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)Renewable energy advocates Wednesday appealed a Montgomery County circuit judge’s ruling excluding them from consideration of customer rates set by Alabama Power.
Energy Alabama, a renewable energy organization, is seeking to join a docket to set the Energy Cost Recovery (ECR) rate, a price that Alabama Power can charge customers to offset the money they pay for fuel that the Public Service Commission allows.
“We believe decisions that affect customers should be made in the open,” said Daniel Tait, executive director of Energy Alabama. “Not in secret. Fuel costs have a major impact on monthly bills, and they are changed with virtually no transparency or public scrutiny. We are asking the Alabama Supreme Court to recognize that customers have the right to be heard when decisions about their energy costs are being made.”

The PSC adjusts the rate as often as every month to align with the price of oil, natural gas and uranium in the market. To update the rate, the PSC issues interim consent orders based on recommendations from Alabama Power but has not allowed public input on the measure since 2008 and considers the docket closed.
The ECR rate is updated on an ongoing basis depending on the market rate for the different sources of fuel. Typically, Alabama Power submits a request to allow it to charge customers a specific price for the fuel that it buys that the PSC can either approve or change.
The issue of whether the PSC allows for the rate adjustments amounts to a proceeding is a critical issue because the regulations allow other parties to intervene and be part of the docket if there is a proceeding.
Energy Alabama’s position is that the updates are, in fact, proceedings, and that the public has a right to be part of the docket and weigh in on the appropriate rate ECR that Alabama Power should charge.
Montgomery Circuit Court Judge Brooke Reid ruled in July that the PSC could prevent Energy Alabama from intervening in the docket because the case does not involve fraud or reach a decision in which the evidence did not align with the decision, the only two instances that Alabama law allows the court to intervene.
Energy Alabama now wants the Alabama Supreme Court to decide whether updates to the rate ECR amount to a “proceeding” that would allow Energy Alabama to be part of the docket and weigh in on the decision.
A message was sent to Alabama Power and the Public Service Commission on Thursday seeking comment.
Energy Alabama filed a petition in May 2024 requesting to be part of the docket for deciding the fuel cost. In response, Alabama Power said in filing to the PSC that the rate adjustments are not proceedings that allow Energy Alabama to intervene and be party to the docket.
In the end, the PSC sided with Alabama Power and ruled in August 2024 that Energy Alabama could not intervene and be part of the docket. Energy Alabama requested the PSC reconsider its decision, but the PSC affirmed its decision in September that same year.

The Trump administration in July announced changes to long-standing federal guidelines that allowed social safety net programs including community health centers, homeless shelters, and child care programs to offer services without verifying immigration status. 
“Currently, no individual is being denied services at the Health District or Southern Nevada Community Health Center under this reinterpretation,” Jennifer Sizemore, a spokeswoman with the Southern Nevada Health District, said in an email. “We are closely monitoring developments, providing input, and preparing for potential operational changes should the policy take effect. Our priority remains protecting the health of all residents and maintaining access to essential public health services.”
SNHD couldn’t answer additional questions about the potential impact of the federal policies changes on undocumented people accessing health services, since the issue is being litigated. 
Days after the Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford joined 19 other states and the District of Columbia, have signed onto a lawsuit challenging the rule, arguing it’s already sowing chaos in communities.
Dr. Cassius Lockett, the District Health Officer for the Southern Nevada Health District, told district board of health members at a July 24 meeting that “a little over 50% of our clients in the Southern Nevada Community Health Center are undocumented” and could lose access to primary care services, behavioral health services and family planning under the rule change as written. 
Lockett didn’t specify an exact figure of the number of undocumented patients who could lose access to health services at the district. 
The district is conducting an analysis to understand the fiscal impact from the federal changes, he said. 
The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 had a long-standing practice of allowing various community based programs that rely on federal funds to serve people regardless of immigration status.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced July 10 it would reverse that policy and require agencies to check immigration status. 
“For too long, the government has diverted hardworking Americans’ tax dollars to incentivize illegal immigration,” said Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr in a statement.
In their suit challenging the policy reversal, attorneys general argued multiple programs “cannot realistically conduct verification at the door, such as 24/7 crisis hotlines, emergency services for individuals suffering an overdose, and homeless shelters.” 
“Even if some programs could implement such verification with time and resources, vulnerable people lack government identification when accessing these services for myriad reasons—some may be undocumented immigrants, but many others are U.S. Citizens or permanent residents,” the suit contends. “For the first time, millions of people are facing a new demand before they can access the Nation’s most essential programs: ‘show me your papers.’
Dr. Frank Nemec, the vice chair for the health board, said during the board’s July 24 meeting that the decision wasn’t just cruel but could have a “devastating economic impact on an already fragile medical infrastructure” in Nevada. 
Another “unintended consequence” could mean emergency rooms and trauma systems seeing an uptick in people who normally seek health services through community clinics, Lockett said.  
Federally Qualified Health Centers, which receive federal funding to provide primary care to underserved populations, are still unclear on the full impact of the rule change, said Randy Smith, the CEO of Southern Nevada Community Health Center.
“The individuals that we’re talking about are some of the most vulnerable members of our community,” he said. “There’s also a public health implication. They may have communicable diseases that are going to go untreated. Certainly on the individual level, it’s about quality of life … It’s a whole system of care really impacted in a very significant way in terms of access to care and the costs associated with that care.”
While roughly half of the patients coming into the Southern Nevada Community Health Center are uninsured, Smith said he wasn’t sure how many lacked health insurance because they didn’t have legal status. 
“The health center program has never had a requirement to collect eligibility documentation,” he said. “What I do know is a significant portion of them are and that’s because we’ve made efforts to help folks get on insurance and they’ve been unable to do so.”
There are also public health implications around the spread of communicable diseases.
The guidelines, if fully implemented, would mean immunizations, communicable disease testing and screening could be carried out without checking immigration status, Lockett said. 
Some in the board worried that many people, even those who are legal permanent residents or have Green Cards, aren’t seeking care, including vaccinations. 
Lockett said the district is working on doing more outreach to “make it clear they still have access to immunization services at the health district and they still have access to communicable disease services.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Image-8-15-25-at-12.01 PM-1024x572.jpeg,,,2025-08-18 08:56:48.562036

Santiago/Getty Images)BILOXI, Miss. — The Trump administration is developing a powerful data tool it claims will let states identify noncitizens registered to vote. But Democratic critics and data experts warn it could allow the federal government to vacuum up vast quantities of information on Americans for unclear purposes.
Some Democratic election officials and opponents of the effort fear President Donald Trump wants to build a federal database of voters to target political opponents or cherry-pick rare examples of noncitizen voters to fuel a sense of crisis. Republican election officials allied with the president counter that he’s helping states to maintain accurate voter rolls.
The Trump administration has rolled out changes to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, tool at the same time the U.S. Department of Justice is asking states for copies of their voter rolls. The timing, combined with questions about what happens to voter data uploaded to the program, has alarmed critics.
Trump wants Congress to pass a national proof of citizenship voter registration requirement and in March tried to unilaterally impose one for federal elections through executive order. But with the legislation stalled and the order halted by the courts, the citizenship data tool may offer a backdoor way to accomplish the same goal.
SAVE was originally intended to help state and local officials verify the immigration status of individual noncitizens seeking government benefits. But U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, this spring refashioned it into a platform that can scan states’ voter rolls if election officials upload the data.

The changes to SAVE, rolled out over just a few months and with little public debate, are “tinkering with sort of the bones of democracy,” said John Davisson, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington, D.C.-based research and advocacy group that argues privacy is a fundamental right.
“You’re talking about the voting process and who will be eligible to vote,” Davisson said. “And to take a system that is not designed for use in that process and repurpose it, really on the fly, without a formal comment process, without formal rulemaking, without congressional intervention — that’s pretty anomalous and pretty alarming.”
Previously, SAVE could only search one name at a time. Now it can conduct bulk searches, allowing state officials to potentially feed into it information on millions of registered voters. SAVE checks that information against a series of federal databases and reports back whether it can verify someone’s immigration status.
Since May, it also can draw upon Social Security data, transforming the program into a tool that can confirm citizenship because Social Security records for many, but not all, Americans include the information. NPR reported earlier on changes to SAVE.
“It is incredible what has been done, really since March,” Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray, a Republican who supports proof of citizenship requirements and the SAVE tool, told a gathering of state secretaries of state in Biloxi, Mississippi, last week.
Individuals registering to vote in federal elections must already sign a statement affirming they are citizens under penalty of perjury, and those who cast a ballot face criminal penalties and deportation. One study of the 2016 election placed the prevalence of noncitizen voting at 0.0001% of votes cast.
But as Trump has spread falsehoods about elections, Republicans have made purging noncitizens from voter rolls a central focus.

	Democratic concerns were on display last week at the National Association of Secretaries of State conference, held at the Beau Rivage casino-resort in Biloxi. In interviews on the sidelines of the conference, Democratic secretaries of state voiced deep reservations — or outright opposition — about plugging their voter data into SAVE.
Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said Aug. 6 that the federal government appeared to be trying to take over election administration. She formally rejected the Justice Department’s voter roll request two days later.
Bellows said the Department of Homeland Security told her in a recent phone call that it planned to retain SAVE data for 10 years for “audit purposes only.”
“Just like the [Justice Department] is asking us to hand over an electronic file of all the voters in our state, it seems like the Department of Homeland Security is through this backdoor system also asking us to share voter information about every voter in our state,” Bellows said.
At least one state appears to have granted the federal government sweeping authority over any voter data it provides to SAVE.
Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales announced in July he had reached an agreement with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to access the newly expanded system for voter list maintenance. Indiana’s agreement allows the federal agency to use information the state provides for any purpose permitted by law, including criminal prosecutions.
Morales, a Republican, said in a news release that SAVE represented “another step in safeguarding the rights” of eligible voters. His office didn’t respond to Stateline’s questions.
The Trump administration has ramped up efforts to encourage state election officials to use the expanded program. The White House hosted a bipartisan “fly in” event for state secretaries of state on July 29. Multiple secretaries of state told Stateline that USCIS Director Joseph Edlow, who was confirmed on July 15, spoke at the event.
“The president is very much keyed in on voter list maintenance,” Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, a Republican, said in an interview — echoing other GOP secretaries of state who released statements praising the Trump administration after the meeting.



When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances.


– Minnesota Democratic Secretary of State Steve Simon


Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, a Democrat who attended the meeting, said he questioned how the federal government would handle voter information provided to SAVE. He added that the Justice Department’s request for his state’s voter rolls raised his level of concern about how data would be used.
“When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances,” Simon told Stateline.
The White House referred questions about SAVE and the event to the Department of Homeland Security and USCIS.
In response to questions from Stateline, USCIS didn’t directly answer whether the agency would share voter roll data with other parts of the federal government but confirmed it disposes of records after 10 years.
“The SAVE application is a critical tool for state and local governments to access information to safeguard the integrity of elections across the country. It’s no wonder many states have quickly adopted it, and we continue to promote the tool to other states and counties not using SAVE,” USCIS spokesperson Matthew Tragesser said in a statement.
“We look forward to continued optimization efforts and implementing more updates to SAVE.”
GOP pressure
Some Republican election officials and Trump allies have long wanted the federal government to take an expanded role in searching state voter rolls for noncitizens.
Last summer the Trump-aligned litigation group America First Legal, co-founded by Trump adviser Stephen Miller, encouraged states to submit to the Department of Homeland Security the names of individuals for citizenship or immigration status verification.
Some states did just that. Texas, for example, asked USCIS to verify the citizenship of some voters in September, and Indiana asked the agency to verify 585,774 voters in October. The same month, 16 Republican state attorneys general signed a letter criticizing Homeland Security, then under the Biden administration, for failing to work with states on verification.

After Trump took office, GOP state officials kept up the pressure. Twenty-one Republican secretaries of state urged Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in February to prioritize SAVE improvements.
On April 16, Indiana sued the department in federal court for not responding to its verification request last fall. USCIS announced an overhaul of SAVE less than a week later.
As the agency continues to remake SAVE, the tool will soon allow searches using the last four digits of a Social Security number, multiple state secretaries of state told Stateline. The agency confirmed the feature is under development and will be available soon but didn’t provide an exact date.
The change would mark another significant expansion of the program because most states collect the last four digits when individuals without a driver’s license register to vote.
Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican, said SAVE represents a better way to verify citizenship than a state law requiring voters to produce documents. “I think there’s a real opportunity for us to do a lot of this through just sharing of information and I think that’s what we’re seeing happen,” McGrane said in an interview.
Unreliable data?
But some voting rights advocates and experts on government data caution against an overreliance on Social Security data.
The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, a progressive policy nonprofit, has noted that Social Security only began tracking the citizenship status of all applicants in 1978 — meaning the database doesn’t include comprehensive citizenship information for older Americans. Additionally, Social Security may not always have up-to-date information on the status of naturalized U.S. citizens.
The nonpartisan Institute for Responsive Government also warned in May that since SAVE hasn’t used Social Security numbers to verify citizenship in the past, its accuracy and effectiveness are unknown. The success of the expanded SAVE program may also partially depend on whether it has adequate staff and resources, it said.

A 2017 Government Accountability Office report found that between fiscal years 2012 and 2016, about 16% of the nearly 90 million SAVE searches required additional verification, which the institute says often translates into federal workers manually checking files. Now that SAVE allows bulk searches, the need for manual checking could rise dramatically.
Nick Doctor, director of implementation at the Institute for Responsive Government, said in an interview that a tool confirming the eligibility of registered voters in a way that doesn’t burden individuals can be a good thing. But he emphasized that it depends in large measure on SAVE’s implementation.
“The changes that have been made to SAVE happened very quickly and, to my knowledge, we haven’t seen releases on the level of accuracy of that information,” Doctor said.
During interviews, Republican secretaries of state stressed that voters aren’t kicked off the rolls because SAVE can’t verify their citizenship. Instead, an inability to verify would likely trigger a follow-up process with the voter.
“Just because we get something back from the SAVE database, it’s not a cut and dry, especially on those they’re not sure about,” Hoskins, the Missouri secretary of state, said.
Still, Arizona illustrates why some Democrats worry about any large-scale effort to ask voters — especially longtime, older residents — to prove their citizenship. After the state discovered errors in how it tracked voter citizenship dating back years, election officials are contacting some 200,000 voters seeking proof of citizenship documentation.
Some have been casting ballots for decades without incident and many feel targeted, Arizona Democratic Secretary of State Adrian Fontes said during a presentation at the state secretaries of state conference. “They feel insulted when they get that letter,” Fontes said.



There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside.


– Charles Stewart III, professor of political science at MIT who studies elections


Charles Stewart III, a professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies elections, said Arizona may actually point to the potential usefulness of SAVE. If Arizona runs its voter roll through the program, a list of 200,000 voters needing citizenship verification would perhaps drop into the hundreds, he suggested.
“There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside,” Stewart said.
Connecticut Democratic Secretary of State Stephanie Thomas told Stateline that every secretary wants tools to keep voter lists as clean as possible. But the details are important.
When she hears of something new, Thomas said she asks whether it’s the best option available and whether “the i’s are dotted, the t’s crossed.” She said she’s asked USCIS a series of questions about SAVE and is waiting on some responses.
“When it comes to voter lists,” Thomas said, “I don’t want Connecticut voters to be a guinea pig.”

(Laura Chramer for Alabama Reflector)What on Earth is the University of Alabama doing?
To be more precise: Why is university leadership letting federal and state officials shove Black and LGBTQ+ students out of public life? With no objection?
The UA system, as you might know, is fighting professors and students suing to overturn SB 129, Alabama’s anti-minority law — I’m sorry, “anti-DEI” law. The plaintiffs allege the statute intimidates instructors and prevents students from marginalized groups from organizing as they have a right to do.

Exhibit A: UA last year closed down a dedicated space for the Black Student Union and and another for LGBTQ+ students, known as the Safe Zone. Now UA’s attorneys say that the university can’t reopen them because of guidance the Trump administration.
“The guidance states that it would be an unlawful practice for ‘[a] university’s DEI initiative [to designate] a ‘safe space’ or lounge exclusively for students of a specific racial or ethnic group,” attorneys for the UA system wrote in a filing earlier this month.  “[E]ven if access is technically open to all, the identity-based focus creates a perception of segregation and may foster a hostile environment’ in violation of federal antidiscrimination laws.”
This is ludicrous, as attorneys for the professors and students suing UA pointed out last week. The Trump administration guidance is not binding on the school. And access to the groups was not “technically” open to all; it was open to all.
“There is not a shred of evidence in the record that either the BSU space or the Safe Zone created a perception of segregation or fostered a hostile environment,” the plaintiffs’ attorneys wrote.
I’d add that it’s a lot easier to join the Black Student Union than any of the UA Greek chapters HBO keeps shoving in our faces. The BSU doesn’t charge up to $5,532 for membership.
Ah, but following the argument of UA’s attorneys to its logical conclusion, if the most brittle white heterosexual at UA thinks the existence of Black and LGBTQ groups means segregation, segregation exists. And taking 40 seconds to explain basic concepts of association to Mr. Comeapart is too much work. Better to tell Black and LGBTQ+ students to hide themselves.
If this sounds like discrimination to you, it does to me, too.
The attorneys’ argument also will repeat UA’s shameful history. The school was built by enslaved people, some of whom were rented out by faculty members who pocketed the earnings of those who did the work.
Like every other public school in the state, UA excluded Black students through the early 1960s. When Autherine Lucy, a Black student, enrolled in a graduate library science course in 1956, a white mob stoned her car and tried to kill her. The university suspended and later expelled Lucy. When Vivian Malone and James Hood enrolled at the school in 1963, UA students made their lives hell. Hood transferred out.
One would hope this history would inspire UA’s leaders to break from it and make a campus that reflects its state and country. And by some measures, it has. There were nearly 5,000 Black students enrolled at the school in the fall of 2024, about 12% of the student body. That’s not 27%, like the Black population of the state, but a far better percentage than Auburn University (under 5%). (Schools do not track the number of students identifying as LGBTQ+.)
Yet UA leaders now seem to view that progress as a liability.
It’s hard to understand their choices over the last year if they didn’t. UA could have used its unique constitutional status to fight SB 129. It could have formed an alliance of schools to defend the mission of higher education in our state. Instead, it knuckled under and punished Black and LGBTQ+ students.
Administrators could have said something — anything — about Alireza Doroudi, a graduate student from Iran kidnapped by Immigration and Customs Enforcement earlier this year. Not only did they stay silent about Doroudi’s plight, UA leaders welcomed President Donald Trump to campus as Doroudi’s vision, hearing and mental health deteriorated in a Louisiana prison. All thanks to Trump’s actions.
Now UA’s leaders hide behind the White House to justify their craven behavior.
The school faces a choice. UA is a vital institution of research and education in our state, one that’s still relatively affordable and open to all Alabamians. UA can continue down that path, serving as engine of personal growth, social mobility and economic development.
Or it can become what the Trump administration and the Alabama Legislature want it to be: A finishing school for white Mountain Brook teenagers, subsidized by tuition payments from Dix Hills, New York and Winnetka, Illinois. A playground for rich young Alabamians, protecting them from new ideas and reinforcing their sense of privilege.
In short, it would be the old University of Alabama. A school whose mission is not educating the young, but doing what the powerful tell them.
And UA administrators keep showing their preference for the latter.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Donald-Trump-UA-commencement-May-1-2025-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-08-18 08:56:48.562036

“One of the big issues is, especially in small school districts, they may have somebody who’s really good, who has been the high school cafeteria manager for forever, but she doesn’t have a college degree and therefore doesn’t qualify for a promotion,” Mackey said.
Under the proposed changes, Child Nutrition Program directors in school districts with 2,500 students or more will still be required to have a valid Alabama Professional Child Nutrition Program Director Certificate issued by the state department and a bachelor’s degree.
The Child Nutrition Program isn’t limited to serving meals during the academic year. In addition to providing breakfast and lunch, ALSDE also oversees weekend, nighttime and summer feeding programs.
“It’s not just school lunch. School lunch is a big piece of it, but it’s a huge operation that provides for many families whose children are getting most of their meals through our department,” Mackey said.
According to the Alabama Department of Public Health, Alabama is the fifth poorest state in the nation and 23% of children in the state face food insecurity with COVID-19 contributing to an increase in numbers.

Wes Moore says he didn't inherit a $5 billion budget surplus in 2022, but a structural deficit propped up with COVID money. But longtime GOP adviser Jim Burton says there's still no getting around the bottom-line numbers.","Gov. Wes Moore hands a pen used to sign the state's $67 billion fiscal 2026 budget to House Appropriations Chair Ben Barnes in May. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Recently, Gov. Wes Moore appeared on Special Report with Bret Baier on Fox News. When questioned about Maryland’s growing budget deficit, Moore dismissed the premise outright, stating, “That’s been debunked over and over.”
But has it really?
In January 2023, just days into his administration, Moore himself said, “We anticipate ending the current fiscal year 2023 with more than a $2 billion General Fund balance and an additional $2.9 billion in the Rainy Day Fund — $5 billion in combined General Fund cash reserves.”
It’s on tape. So, what’s been “debunked”?
Here’s the math every Marylander understands: Moore inherited a $5 billion surplus from Gov. Larry Hogan. Now, just two and a half years later, the state is staring down a projected $3 billion deficit by fiscal year 2027. That’s an $8 billion fiscal swing in the wrong direction — an alarming number, especially for working families trying to stretch every dollar in the face of rising costs and tax hikes.
Ironically, the news of Maryland’s looming deficit in 2023 broke around the same time Moore held a high-profile ceremony to unveil the official portraits of former Gov. Martin O’Malley and first lady Catherine O’Malley. Former Gov. Parris Glendening even attended. The moment was steeped in symbolism. These three governors — Glendening, O’Malley and now Moore — share more than just Democratic politics. They share a pattern of running up budget deficits and resorting to tax hikes.
As Yogi Berra once said: “It’s déjà vu all over again.”

O’Malley famously raised taxes or fees over 40 times, totaling $9.5 billion in new revenue. That record helped pave the way for Larry Hogan’s election in 2014.
Moore now seems to be following a familiar playbook.
The FY 2026 budget introduces $1.6 billion in new taxes and fees, including:

A new tech tax
Increased car registration and tire fees
Higher fishing license costs
A new capital gains surcharge

It’s no wonder Moore wants to distance himself from his once-celebrated surplus. Acknowledging it would expose just how far off track his fiscal management has taken the state.
Maryland voters have seen this movie before. In 1994 (almost), 2002, and 2014, Democratic governors overreached, and voters responded by giving Republicans their shot at leadership.
Even Moore’s own approval numbers — while not disastrous — are softening. The most recent UMBC poll showed 55% approval, 36% disapproval. That’s good, not great, especially considering the media praise and national attention he’s receiving.
After the GOP’s disheartening showing in 2022, the current fiscal crisis offers a path forward. But success isn’t automatic — Republicans must do the hard work:

Stay disciplined on message
Organize locally and statewide
Recruit strong candidates
Expand voter registration
Knock on doors and engage voters directly

Republicans need to make it clear: Moore and Democratic leaders are spending tax dollars without proper accountability or program effectiveness. Instead of making tough choices or cutting failing initiatives, their default solution is to raise taxes on hardworking Marylanders.
The gas tax is up. Fees are up. Inflation is real. And the state budget is headed into the red.
Moore can try to rewrite the history of the $5 billion surplus. But voters remember. And come 2026, they may once again decide it’s time to change the script in Annapolis.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DSC_0169-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-08-18 07:58:03.330138

(Photo: Scott Olson/Getty Images)As wildfire crews battled the Dragon Bravo Fire on the Grand Canyon’s North Rim in July 2025, the air turned toxic.
A chlorine gas leak had erupted from the park’s water treatment facility as the building burned, forcing firefighters to pull back. The water treatment facility is part of a system that draws water from a fragile spring. It’s the only water source and system for the park facilities on both rims, including visitor lodging and park service housing.
The fire also damaged some of the area’s water pipes and equipment, leaving fire crews to rely on a fleet of large water trucks to haul in water and raising concerns about contamination risks to the water system itself.
By mid-August, Dragon Bravo was a “megafire,” having burned over 140,000 acres, and was one of the largest fires in Arizona history. It had destroyed more than 70 structures, including the iconic Grand Canyon Lodge, and sent smoke across the region.
Wildfires like this are increasingly affecting water supplies across the U.S. and creating a compounding crisis that experts in water, utilities and emergency management are only beginning to wrestle with.
 A pattern across the West

Before 2017, when the Tubbs Fire burned through neighborhoods on the edge of Santa Rosa, California, most research on the nexus of wildfire and water had focused on issues such as drought and how climate change effects ecosystems.
The Tubbs Fire destroyed thousands of buildings and also melted plastic water pipes. After the fire, a resident’s complaint about the taste and odor of tap water led to the discovery that the fire’s damage had introduced contaminants including benzene, a carcinogen, into parts of the public water system.
It quickly became obvious that the damage discovered at the Tubbs Fire was not unique.
Similar damage and pollutants were discovered in another California water system after the 2018 Camp Fire destroyed much of Paradise, a town of over 25,000 people.
Nevada wildfires will result in more water quality challenges, study shows

The list of incidents goes on.
In southern Oregon, the 2020 Almeda Fire damaged water pipes in buildings, leaving water to flow freely. That contributed to low system pressure just when people fighting the fire needed the water.
In Colorado, the 2021 Marshall Fire burned through urban water lines, damaging six public drinking-water systems along with more than 1,000 structures in the Boulder suburbs. All six systems lost power, which in some cases led to a loss of water pressure, hampering firefighting.
As firefighters worked on the Marshall Fire, water system operators raced to keep water flowing and contaminants from being transported into the water systems. But tests still detected chemical contamination, including benzene, in parts of the systems a few weeks later.
Then, in January 2025, the Los Angeles fires supercharged concerns about water and wildfire. As firefighters raced to put out multiple fires, hydrants ran dry in some parts of the region, while others at higher elevations depressurized. Ultimately, over 16,000 structures were damaged, leading to insured losses estimated to be as high as US$45 billion.
Water infrastructure is not merely collateral damage during wildfires – it is now a central concern.
It also raises the question: What can residents, first responders and decision-makers reasonably expect from water systems that weren’t designed with today’s disasters in mind?
 Addressing the growing fire and water challenge

While no two water systems or fires are the same, nearly every water system component, ranging from storage tanks to pipelines to treatment plants, is susceptible to damage.
The Grand Canyon’s Roaring Springs system exemplifies the complexity and fragility of older systems. It supplies water to both rims of the park through a decades-old network of gravity-fed pipes and tunnels and includes the water treatment facility where firefighters were forced to retreat because of the chlorine leak.
Many water systems have vulnerable points within or near flammable wildlands, such as exposed pump houses that are crucial for pulling water from lower elevations to where it is needed.
In addition, hazardous materials such as chlorine or ammonia may be stored on-site and require special considerations in high fire risk areas. Staff capacity is often limited; some small utilities depend on a single operator, and budgets may be too constrained to modernize aging infrastructure or implement fire mitigation measures.
As climate change intensifies wildfire seasons, these vulnerabilities can become disaster risks that require making water infrastructure a more integral part of fighting and preparing for wildfires.
 Ways to help everyone prepare

As a researcher with Arizona State University’s Julie Ann Wrigley Global Futures Laboratory, I have been working with colleagues and fire and water systems experts on strategies to help communities and fire and water managers prepare.
Here are a few important lessons:

Prioritizing fire-resistant construction, better shielding of chemicals and, in some cases, decentralizing water systems can help protect critical facilities, particularly in high-risk zones. Having backup power supplies, mobile treatment systems and alternate water sources are essential to provide more security in the face of a wildfire.
Emergency command protocols and interagency coordination are most effective when they include water utilities as essential partners in all phases of emergency response, from planning to response to recovery. Fire crews and water operators can also benefit from joint training in emergency response, especially when system failure could hinder firefighting itself.
Longer term, protecting upstream watersheds from severe fire by thinning forests and using controlled burns, along with erosion control measures, can help maintain water quality and reduce water pollution in the aftermath of fires.
Smaller and more isolated systems, particularly in tribal or low-income communities, often need assistance to plan or implement new measures. These systems may require technical assistance, and regional support hubs could support communities with additional resources, including personnel and equipment, so they can respond quickly when crises strike.

 Looking ahead

The Dragon Bravo Fire isn’t just a wildfire story, it’s also a water story, and it signals a larger, emerging challenge across the West. As fire seasons expand in size and complexity, the overlap between fire and water will only grow.
The Grand Canyon fire offers a stark illustration of how wildfire can escalate into a multifaceted infrastructure crisis: Fire can damage water infrastructure, which in turn limits firefighting capabilities and stresses water supplies.
The question is not whether this will happen again. It’s how prepared communities will be when it does.

“This memorial will honor those affected and will stand as a lasting tribute to the loss and resilience of the Spartan community,” the agenda materials said.
Even as the university navigates financial “uncertainty” and a 9% budget reduction announced by MSU President Kevin Guskiewicz  in June of this year, plans for a memorial on campus have been under discussion since fall 2023, prompted by the Spartan community’s demand for a space to commemorate the tragedy.
The total construction costs are estimated at $3.2 million with $300,000 provided by the Spartan Strong Fund and the remainder from capital reserves. Additionally, according to the agenda materials, the maintenance of the memorial will require an annual cost of $22,500 for the upkeep of the fountain and surrounding landscape, which is described as the “highest level of service.”

In an email statement to the Advance, a MSU spokesperson, Mark Bullion, said “the memorial will be funded by $300,000 set aside from the Spartan Strong Fund, and the rest will come from the university’s capital reserves, not general fund dollars.”
The memorial’s approval followed MSU’s decision earlier this month to pause its plan to lay off psychiatric providers and transition those services to MSU Health Care as part of previously announced university-wide budget reductions.
Following the announcement of the proposed changes, an unsigned online petition circulated, calling for the reinstatement of Dr. Swapna Hingwe, the first woman of color to lead the university’s counseling and psychiatric services.
While the petition, with approximately 1,500 signatures, applauded the decision to suspend the dismissal and other changes, it also expressed apprehension about future actions. 
“We remain concerned about the damage already done and the lack of transparency surrounding the future leadership and direction of Mental Health and Trauma Support Services,” the petition stated.

Seeking to delve into healing and memory, the approved project, named the “Permanent February 13th Memorial,” as stated in the agenda documents, was designed by artists Carlos Portillo and Jessica Guinto, who described it months ago as a “communal space that fosters healing, honors, and respects the process of grieving and remembrance.” 
Bullion also highlighted the importance of the memorial for the MSU community in offering a place for reflection, healing and remembrance. “A space where our community can honor the lives lost and those who were injured and affected,” he said.
The memorial will be located between the Student Services and Natural Sciences buildings on the east side of campus. It will replace an existing fountain in the former horticulture garden, and benches and seasonal plants will be added, as illustrated in the project models.
About 5,000 people participated in the process to choose the design for the future memorial, highlighted MSU Vice Provost for University Arts and Collections, Judith Stoddart, who congratulated the community for their support and involvement. 
“From the earliest stages of this project, including input from those most directly impacted, through the final design selection, the MSU and surrounding communities played a vital role in shaping the memorial,” Stoddart said.
Guskiewicz emphasized the impact on the Spartan community of the violence experienced on the cold night of the shooting.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-18 11:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,What to know about the CT Alert emergency notification system,Janhavi Munde,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/18/ct-alert-emergency-notification-system/,"CT Alert allows towns to reach residents who have signed up with information related to evacuations, safety measures or general alerts.","In a recent interview with MSNBC focused on the state’s preparation for hurricane season, Gov. Ned Lamont referenced the deadly flooding that took place in Naugatuck Valley last August. He said Connecticut is preparing for severe weather and public safety emergencies by taking a number of steps, like setting aside money in case of major storm damage.
“I just don’t know if I can count on FEMA right now,” Lamont said, referring to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is one of the federal agencies President Donald J. Trump has been working to dismantle. 
He also urged residents to sign up for the state’s “early warning system.”
In Connecticut, several emergency notification systems operate under state and regional authorities to notify residents with important information in times of public safety and health emergencies. One relatively modern statewide system is CT Alert.
Powered by software company Everbridge, CT Alert allows participating towns’ 911 call centers to reach residents who have signed up with information related to evacuations, safety measures or general alerts via cellphone, email or text message.
In times of critical emergencies, the system, operated by the state Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection, or DESSP, may try multiple methods to reach a resident if it requests but does not receive confirmation that the person got the notification.
How many people does CT Alert reach?
Less than 10% of CT residents have signed up for CT Alert, but Connecticut’s DESSP has over 4.8 million statewide contacts in the system, which allows it to amplify reach should an emergency demand it.
In an average year, anywhere between 3,000 to 5,000 individuals sign up to be alerted through the system.  This year to date, approximately 9,000 people have signed up.
Each alert is customizable, where 911 dispatchers can choose how localized the notification is and how many people to reach.
Last year, CT Alert was used 97 times. This year, it has been used 25 times. The system sees signup spikes after events like floods, fires, and other emergencies.
How do I sign up? 
Residents can sign up on CT Alert’s website by providing their name, email address, phone number and work or home address. Residents and businesses that have listed telephone numbers are already registered for the system.
Although the system is available to all towns, its usage depends on your given town or region’s 911 centers. Some towns might use more enhanced or specific notification systems, like Reverse 911.
When a town chooses to use CT Alert it means its emergency dispatch center will utilize the system to send out emergency alerts to residents. However, a registered individual will still get statewide and regional CT alerts even if their town does not actively use the system.
Although DESPP has access to Whitepages data for landlines numbers and purchased cellphone data through Everbridge, signing up to be alerted is the most effective way to be updated by the system, officials said.
Registered data can be disclosed to third parties for the purpose of emergency notification, or as required by the law, according to CT Alert’s FAQ page.  
How is CT Alert different from other emergency notification systems? 
The driving idea behind CT Alert was to warn residents preemptively before danger is imminent. Some statewide notifications are sent out to warn of incoming, and not always expected, danger.
Reverse 911 is another commonly used emergency notification system in Connecticut, which allows local authorities to reach specific neighborhoods, zones or towns by contacting registered landlines and cellphones for localized threats.
Nationwide notification systems, tailored regionally by local law enforcement, like FEMA’s Integrated Public Alert & Warning System or AMBER alerts notify the broader public about more specific emergencies, like only natural disasters or only missing children, respectively, often using broadcasting on radio and TV in addition to cellphones.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/49805592_1315199508620985_7928512067957424128_n.jpg,,,2025-08-18 07:58:03.330138

Through providing youth with evidence-based, relationship-centered mentoring programs we can help youth feel like they matter and instill a sense of belonging. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Jen Colman: Mentors help Vermont youth feel like they matter.","This commentary is by Jen Colman, of Burlington. She is a mental health provider for children and adolescents, and collaborates with youth-based organizations and schools to provide direct mental health services. Colman is also the executive director of Green Mountain Mobile Therapy, a nonprofit organization that provides accessible mental health and social emotional resources for children and adolescents.


As a mental health professional who works with Vermont’s youth, I see how our students are struggling everyday. 
Nationally, young people have reported a dramatic increase in conflict and divisiveness in our communities. A constant barrage of media, combined with social disconnectedness, creates a systemic feeling of hopelessness. 
Earlier this year, Vermont This Week on Vermont Public hosted a panel discussion on the state of youth mental health in Vermont. The conversation focused on the Vermont Department of Health’s 2023 Youth Behavior Risk Survey, released in November 2024, and the results showed that Vermont youth’s mental health is still in crisis with little improvement since the Covid-19 pandemic. 
One of the questions asked in the panel was “What do kids need?” and the collective response was that kids need to be believed and listened to. They need to feel like they belong and that they matter. It’s time for Vermont to get creative in how we approach our youth mental health crisis. 
Through providing youth with evidence-based, relationship-centered mentoring programs, we can help youth feel like they matter and instill a sense of belonging. 
Mentoring programs play a crucial role in supporting youth mental health by providing individualized, one-on-one attention and fostering meaningful relationships between youth and trusted adults. In Vermont, 96% of mentees in mentoring programs funded by the nonprofit organization MENTOR Vermont reported that their mentor made them feel like they matter, and 92% said having a mentor made a positive difference in their lives. 
MENTOR Vermont leads, expands and strengthens the mentoring movement, building capacity to make high-quality relationships accessible to all young people, so every young person in Vermont has the supportive relationships they need to grow and thrive.
Mentors offer emotional support, guidance and encouragement, which are particularly beneficial for youth struggling with mental health issues. They help young people engage in their schoolwork, think critically about their future and navigate personal challenges. This support is essential in preventing risky behaviors among young people. 
Moreover, mentoring meets youth where they live, learn, work and play, providing them with a consistent person outside of their family that they can turn to for support. 
Despite this data, 1 in 3 youth will grow up without a mentor and without the support of a trusted adult. According to the National Mentoring Partnership, young people who have mentors are more likely to improve in areas such as emotional regulation, social skills and overall life satisfaction. A study by the Journal of Primary Prevention found that mentoring can lower the likelihood of depressive symptoms and suicide attempts by providing emotional support, positive role models and a sense of belonging. 
Overall, mentoring programs are a proven tool in promoting mental well-being and ensuring that young people have the supportive relationships they need to thrive. 
Although the Vermont youth mental health crisis may seem overwhelming, it can be addressed by being proactive and putting in place proven early intervention programs such as mentoring. 
Thanks to the work of MENTOR Vermont, such programs already exist in many communities throughout the state, but they need sustainable investment to adequately meet the needs of youth across Vermont. This investment will ensure that every child who needs a mentor has access to one, and the path toward stabilizing and moving out of this crisis will become clear.

(Getty Images)Students identified with Autism Spectrum Disorder or ASD are a rapidly growing exceptionality category of students who display a very individualized and complex set of needs. Many families choose to supplement the educational services offered by their school with private ABA therapy. 
Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) therapy is a commonly used technique for autism symptoms. When implemented with fidelity per research based best practices in combination with a school experience, ABA therapy can be a powerful tool for early intervention to support students navigating ASD. 
In 2024, the US Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General released a blistering report of Indiana’s growing ABA clinic landscape. The report tells a cautionary tale of a field with no billing caps, no quality control, no oversight, no parent voice, and audacious fiscal improprieties. According to the report, Indiana made at least $56 million in improper fee-for-service Medicaid payments for ABA therapies from 2017-2020. 
The report cited Indiana’s ABA clinics ballooning their Medicaid billing from $14.4 million to $101.8 million in just three years, the second highest in the country. The report documented examples such as an individual student receiving more than $677,000 in individual services in a three year period. Another example documented an individual student receiving more than $28,000 in services per month over multiple years. All while not preforming background checks on service providers or showing any impact on student growth. 
Autism spectrum disorder as a disability category has experienced an unprecedented level of advocacy, funding, research, and attention in the mainstream over the last 20 years. Indiana’s own Rep. Dan Burton made advocating and funding autism his own personal issue. While in office, he funneled millions to our state to better understand ASD and serve this population. As a grandfather of a child with autism, he fought tirelessly for the right of families to have high quality support.
Indiana panel to consider ABA therapy cost controls

Based on his efforts, our state has an unusually high level of expertise in this area including the Autism Center at Riley Children’s Hospital and the Indiana Institute on Disability and Community at Indiana University. Given our state’s history with ASD funding and expertise, the 2024 report is all more concerning. We are a state that should have known better than to allow this to happen to our families. 
There are multiple layers of special education accountability that schools must navigate to serve students with ASD, including the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and Indiana’s Article 7. Currently, stand-alone ABA clinics do not have to adhere to any of the laws put in place to protect students with disabilities within educational settings. 
Schools are held accountable by the individual families via federally required annual meetings, where a child’s individualized education plan and progress toward annual goals are documented and discussed. They are held accountable for the academic progress of students with exceptionalities in their publicly accessible state reporting and accountability processes via the Indiana Department of Education, which includes reporting the academic achievement data of students identified as having exceptionalities. Charter schools have an additional layer of accountability as part of their authorizing processes to ensure services are provided, students are growing, and the law is being met. 
Private schools across the state offer special education support to their families in a way that matches their mission and traditions. Additionally, alternative schools, disability focused schools, recovery high schools, and adult high schools are all held accountable for the services they provide to students with exceptionalities.
Hoosier families that have children with exceptionalities deserve high quality and trustworthy options for their children. Hoosier taxpayers deserve for their tax dollars to help as many people as possible via the Medicaid system. Unfortunately, in Indiana we have not implemented an accountability process for ABA clinics, leaving the door open for predatory practices. While Medicaid, private insurances, and schools all have strict regulations and accountability processes in place to ensure quality; ABA clinics were allowed to operate with none. 
During his first few weeks in office, Gov. Braun released his executive order on ABA Therapies. His orders were clear, ABA clinics using Medicaid as a bottomless ATM must stop. The ABA Therapy commission was established to tackle this issue. 
The big question now is whether the commission will start protecting Hoosier families by holding ABA clinics just as accountable to policies and regulations as every other organization serving students with ASD.

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota State University is working to get back about $66 million in federal funding it lost when the Trump administration canceled a grant program it said was a “climate slush fund.”
The U.S. Department of Agriculture awarded South Dakota’s largest university $86 million in 2023 to research the impact of bison and cattle ranchers’ land management practices on soil health, and to open markets for farmers and ranchers using those practices. It was the largest research grant in South Dakota higher education history.
The grant came from the Partners for Climate-Smart Commodities program. Since 2022 during the Biden administration, the USDA had awarded 141 projects across the country a total of $3 billion. In April, the Trump administration terminated the grants and renamed the program Advancing Markets for Producers, saying “select projects may continue if it is demonstrated that a significant amount of the federal funds awarded will go to farmers.”


Federal Fallout
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and whether to make up the difference.

Brooke Rollins, head of the USDA, said at the time that the Biden-era version of the program “was largely built to advance the green new scam,” a reference to policies undertaken by Biden to address climate change.
SDSU had already spent about $20 million when the climate-smart grants were terminated. The university lost an additional $1.4 million in other grant funding from the program. Two other South Dakota institutions also lost grant funding: the University of South Dakota lost $223,892, and South Dakota Mines lost $1.3 million.
The new program requires at least 65% of funding to go toward producer incentives, instead of 35% under the earlier version of the program. Kristi Cammack, assistant dean for SDSU agriculture West River operations, said the university renamed the project from “The Grass is Greener on the Other Side: Developing Climate-Smart Beef and Bison Commodities” to “Producers first: incentivizing land management and advancing markets for US beef and bison operations,” and shifted some funding originally intended for research toward producer incentives.
“We learned quite a bit over the two years we’ve been working on this, so we’ve been able to make educated shifts from research to producers while still being able to answer research questions,” Cammack said.
SDSU resubmitted its research proposal at the end of June with the hopes of regaining the award by the end of the summer.
“Producers are at the crux of the whole project,” Cammack said.
The five-year program encourages bison and cattle producers to implement conservation land management and grazing practices. They collect soil samples measuring microbes and other indicators of soil health and carbon sequestration as a result of the changes. The program also has a goal of introducing those producers to new markets with customers interested in eco-friendly practices.

More than 100 producers, primarily raising cattle, were participating in the project at the time of termination. More were preparing to enroll this year. SDSU had eight faculty members working on the project, along with four other staff members and several graduate students, Cammack said. 
If re-awarded the funding later this summer, Cammack said the team will have a “busy fall” collecting soil samples before the ground freezes.
The grant cancellation is “interruptive,” she added, but her group is “nimble” and “research projects never go perfectly.”
The grant cancellation comes during a period of broader concern about university research funding. Federal funding for science is the lowest in years due to cuts made by the Trump administration and has been declining for decades as a share of gross domestic product.
President Donald Trump proposed “draconian cuts” this spring, said Daniel Scholl, vice president of research and economic development at South Dakota State, to federal research funding agencies such as the USDA, National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation – the three largest funding agencies from which SDSU receives research grants.
Scholl said he hopes Congress will resist the cuts, but is “uncertain where things will land.”
“We’re optimistic based on the efforts members of Congress are putting out to restore research funding and preserve the prowess of U.S. research and enterprise that’s largely driven by universities,” Scholl said.
If the university isn’t able to reinstate the remainder of its grant for the bison and cattle research project, Cammack said her team plans to apply for other grants and work with other partners to continue the program.

(Niki Kelly/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Two decades ago, after a prolonged and heavy lift through the 2005 legislative session, former Gov. Mitch Daniels signed a monumental piece of legislation into law: establishing daylight saving time in the Hoosier State. 
The vote was so contentious that former House Speaker Brian Bosma left the voting machine open for hours, whipping up the votes needed to advance the priority bill for Daniels. 
“We just almost had a majority, and then people would switch,” Bosma, a Republican, told the Indiana Capital Chronicle. “We went up to caucus and I had to press on.”

In the end, lawmakers advanced the measure through the house by a single vote — a decision that cost the voting lawmaker his seat in the body.
Hoosiers first sprung forward in 2006.
Prior to the law, Indiana had a hodgepodge mashup of time zones that varied from county to county. As with today’s dynamic, most Hoosier counties aligned themselves with Eastern Time, but a handful located in the southwestern and northwestern tips opted for Central Time.
Just over a dozen counties clustered near the state’s borders — including all of the counties following Central Time and at least five Eastern Time counties — voluntarily followed daylight saving time with the majority of the nation. But roughly 76 counties didn’t, which meant they switched from Eastern Time to Central Time and vice versa when other states sprung forward or fell back. 
“There are 13 states with more than one, but Indiana had three (time zones),” said Daniels. “… as a practical matter, we were in the Eastern zone during the winter, and in the Central zone during the summer.”
Synchronizing all of the time zones to make it easier to do business with national counterparts was critical to Daniels’ first-term agenda, which sought to “make Indiana, once again, a competitive state.”
“Economically, we were at the bottom of people’s lists of places where you might bring jobs and do investment. We did dozens of things: taxes, regulation, litigation, building, infrastructure. Everything that might make Indiana a more attractive place and more prosperous place,” said Daniels. “And daylight savings was a small part of that.” 
Because of the confusing time zone distinctions — which The West Wing mocked in a famous 2002 episode — deliveries were missed or rescheduled, conference calls were dropped and even airlines avoided locating hubs in Indiana, Daniels said. 
“It’s an interconnected world, more so today than twenty years ago,” Daniels said. “… It used to be you’d have to look at the calendar before you look at your watch.”
 Gettting it through the chamber

A 2005 story in the Fort Wayne Journal Gazette reported that 43 Republicans and eight Democrats pushed the proposal across the finish line. At noon, the vote stood at 49-48 but, 11 hours later, four Republicans changed their minds.
“I’ve introduced and closed on this bill so many times I’m running out of things to say,” said Rep. Jerry Torr, R-Carmel. Torr authored the 2005 measure and retired last year. “It’s past time for daylight saving time. Let’s get this bill passed.”
Bosma said his caucus identified five Republicans it believed could vote for the measure “without political consequence,” believing that Indiana was “losing economic development opportunities, big ones, because of the anomaly.”










I think that for those who were restless about the speed and the dimension of the changes that we were able to make, daylight savings time became a symbol.


– Former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels


“My clearest recollection is getting a call at about 10:30 (p.m.) from (Gov.) Mitch Daniels, while we were in caucus, and the governor saying, “Brian, just pull the plug on this,’” recalled Bosma. “And I said, ‘Governor, I’ve spent way too much capital on this not to complete the job.’”
Returning to the floor, the body still didn’t have the final votes needed, with the tally stuck at 50 votes. After some final debate, one vote flipped — and Bosma told the body’s parliamentarian to lock it in.
“And the 51st vote was the one person that I told, ‘Under no circumstances, are you to vote for this,’” Bosma said. “… Troy (Woodruff) was a Marine, and he saw a grenade and jumped on it despite instructions not to.”
Woodruff, a freshman lawmaker from southwestern Indiana, had a district split between counties observing daylight saving and those that didn’t. He said the final tally came after nearly a dozen rounds of voting, none of which were enough to either pass or kill the bill.
“More than anything, it was just … time to move on and move forward,” Woodruff told the Capital Chronicle. “I just thought, in my head, if this is one thing we can do for free that could help … we really need to do this.”
He went on to lose his seat, but Woodruff said he didn’t regret his actions — even if he still gets the occasional message about a decades-old vote.
“I still get emails to this day about daylight savings time,” he said. 
After his term in office, Woodruff was later appointed chief of staff to the Indiana Department of Transportation in 2012, resigning two years later before launching his own business and serving as president of a Fishers-based architecture firm.
 The conversation today

The tumultuous 2005 session left such scars that, decades later, some veteran lawmakers say they won’t touch the topic. 
“When I got to the General Assembly in 2010, there was a discussion where they said, ‘You can bring up bills for this, that and the other.’ But they said, ‘Whatever you do … don’t bring up the time zones,’” recalled Sen. Sue Glick, R-LaGrange. 
Still, there’s usually a bill filed each year on the topic — though they don’t advance. In 2025, three bills were filed to exempt Indiana from daylight saving time but none moved.

Glick, whose district borders Michigan, acknowledged the difficulty for families navigating boundaries where crossing means gaining or losing an hour. Living at the western edge of the Eastern Time zone has its own drawbacks, with later sunrises and sunsets. 
“In the evening, it’s still daylight, and kids aren’t ready to go to bed,” Glick said. “… (or) your kids are standing out by the side of the road to catch the bus in the dark.”
Outside of potential safety issues for children, daylight saving time also appears to increase electricity consumption along with car emissions. In the weeks following a shift to and from daylight saving, health risks and accidents spike while productivity dips.
On the federal level, the biannual grumblings about changing the clocks revive the ongoing debate: should states move to a permanent standard time or a permanent daylight saving time? 
Moving to permanent daylight saving time would require federal permission — though both Arizona and Hawai’i use standard time year-round. In cases where the states made a change, like with Indiana, the U.S. Department of Transportation ultimately picks the time zone. 
But, perhaps due to the pushback from 2005, Indiana is one of just two states who haven’t advanced legislation or resolutions supporting a permanent, year-round time, according to NBC News. Nineteen other states support permanent daylight savings time while the remaining 27 favor standard time.
The Indiana Chamber of Commerce, a big supporter of the time zone legislation 20 years ago, said they wouldn’t be a fan of moving Indiana to permanent daylight saving time — as proposed by the federal “Sunshine Protection Act.”

Hooiers have to fall back one hour on Nov. 2.

“From our perspective, moving to that permanent observance is a significant departure from the established system that Indiana businesses have used since 2006,” said President and CEO Vanessa Green Sinders. “…If there was consensus around eliminating the semiannual clock change, our preference would be standard time because it better aligns with winter daylight patterns and supports morning operational needs for all of our companies.” 
Aligning all 92 counties with daylight saving time did bring a small, yet statistically significant job boost to the Hoosier state, but Daniels said it was also emblematic of a changing Indiana.
“I think that for those who were restless about the speed and the dimension of the changes that we were able to make, daylight savings time became a symbol,” Daniels said. “I can’t tell you how often people said, ‘Yeah, maybe (you’ll accomplish) the rest of all these plans, but you’ll never change that.’
“And I think when it did finally pass, it sent a message that we’d turned a corner here in Indiana and we intend to be a leader, not in the middle of the pack.”

They say recent state laws encouraging higher density development have led to more properties with multiple single family residences, or accessory dwelling units, squeezed onto them.
In some situations, the path to reach a front door is no more than 3 feet wide, too narrow to get a gurney through in a medical emergency and too little space to safely lean a ladder if there is a fire, they say.
Fire marshals are pressing the state Building Code Council to mandate a minimum 5-foot wide path to access any new home that does not face a street, alley or parking lot. 
“This poses a safety issue to firefighters, occupants and patients,” Dave Kokot, past president of the Washington State Association of Fire Marshals, told the council Friday.
Kokot filed a petition for an emergency rule change and hoped the Building Code Council would grant it in its Friday meeting. Instead, the panel opted to have one of its committees review the request. It will decide later whether to grant the request.
Some jurisdictions, like Vancouver, already have a 5-foot minimum standard.
The fire marshals’ proposal contains exceptions. For example, if a building has an approved automatic fire sprinkler system, a four-foot width would be allowed. If adopted, the new requirement would not be retroactive. Projects already submitted would not be subject to the change.
In Friday’s extensive debate, some council members questioned the degree to which this was an emergency. 
“It has not come into play in a lot of developments yet. We anticipate that it will,” Kokot said.
Others said they thought fire marshals already had the power to ensure adequate access into homes and buildings. Kokot said building officials can override fire officials but having a statewide requirement could make it harder.
Kokot said he realized this situation is an unintended consequence of the Legislature trying to come up with ways to address the housing shortage. “We are open to delaying implementation to a reasonable date to allow new projects to get through the process,” he said.
Patrick Hanks, codes and policy manager for the Building Industry Association of Washington, said the proposed change could be interpreted to require five feet of clearance around an entire accessory dwelling unit. That would choke off construction of ADUs because there would not be enough space to comply.
In an email, Hanks said detached accessory dwelling units, commonly called “mother-in-law” units, are often built within three feet of another structure, fence, or property line. This allows for increased density in areas that used to be zoned exclusively for single-family homes, he said.
“It’s one tool that helps improve housing affordability,” he said, adding BIAW will work on getting “more workable code language that will improve fire safety while reducing negative impacts to housing affordability, with a delayed implementation to give the industry time to adjust designs if they would be affected.”
Though the rule didn’t get adopted, Kokot said afterwards he’s glad they’re still talking about doing so.
“I am encouraged that the council, for the most part, acknowledges there is an issue,” he said. “I’d like to get the language done. I think we can.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/housing-construction.jpeg,,,2025-08-18 07:58:03.330138

,Mississippi Today,2025-08-18 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,‘Did it make me deserve what he did to me?’: How Mississippi denies domestic violence victims critical aid while letting their offenders off,Leonardo Bevilacqua,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/08/18/did-it-make-me-deserve-what-he-did-to-me-how-mississippi-denies-domestic-abuse-victims-critical-aid-while-letting-their-offenders-off/,Crime victim Cheryl Baier felt further victimized by a justice system that denied her critical aid while giving her abuser one of the lightest sentences possible for an attack that left her homeless and with failing sight,"FOREST – Cheryl Baier pushed her car key into the ignition when her boyfriend approached her passenger window in a Walmart parking lot in Forest. Bilbo Faulkner then pushed the passenger door open, sat down beside her and began to punch. 
Baier saw red and black. Blood dripped from where her vision grew blurry. She screamed but only choked. He pried the car keys from her grasp and strangled her with her seatbelt. She cried for help as he hit. She reached for the horn. No honk. She felt one of her eyes come loose after what seemed like 20 blows.
“I was hoping he’d just knock me out and put me out of my misery. So I didn’t feel it no more,” Baier remembers.
It was dark outside at 9 p.m. The car was parked yards from the main entrance underneath a lamp. She had agreed to meet her boyfriend in the lot because it was a public space. Few shoppers stopped to see his fist against her face or hear her cries, though. She saw a couple pull their child away before she lost vision in her right eye. That’s when she says Faulkner threatened to burn down her house before speeding off in his car. A witness eventually called the police, who instructed the fire department to rush to her home.
When she arrived at the hospital, she wasn’t sure if she was alive.
Victimized by crime, Baier later found herself victimized by a justice system that denied her critical aid because she had a more than decade-old drug conviction, even while the system gave her abuser one of the lightest sentences possible for an attack that left her temporarily homeless and with failing sight. Even though Mississippi has long boasted long sentences and high incarceration rates, domestic abuse cases still rarely rise to felony status – and offenders in those cases receive lighter sentences than other protected classes.

Unable to cover the over $12,000 in medical bills, Baier, a convenience store clerk, filed a claim for crime victims’ compensation through the attorney general’s office. The maximum payout to cover medical bills is $15,000. After her night stay at the hospital and 10 days of recovery, she was able to return to work. Paid $10 per hour at 45 hours a week, she knew it’d be several years before she could pay off her medical debt.
Weeks out from her surgery, she pulled a letter from the mailbox and squinted to make out the writing. The attorney general’s office denied her claim because of her felony drug conviction from 13 years ago. Victims, she learned, must be five years out from the last day of their probation to qualify for the program. Baier was weeks away.
“My pain is just the same. My loss is just the same,” Baier said in an interview with Mississippi Today. “What happened to me had nothing to do with what I did over a decade ago.”
While five other states deny victims’ compensation for prior felony convictions, Mississippi and Louisiana count all felonies, including victimless and nonviolent ones. Mississippi is also unique in counting probation, post-release supervision and court-ordered drug treatments, among other programs sponsored by the Department of Corrections, as part of their incarceration time.
Nearly a quarter of denied applications between 2021 and 2023 were based on prior felony convictions. The amount the AG’s office paid out to cover medical costs for assaulted crime victims decreased by half each year from 2021 to 2023, from a total of $1,424,475 in 2021 to $534,026 in 2023.

“The rules can unintentionally create barriers, and we must stay mindful of the fund’s original purpose,” said Stacey Riley, who provides shelter to 25 children and 30 adults through the Gulf Coast Center for Nonviolence in Biloxi. “Administrators should approach this work with an understanding of survivors’ trauma, their specific needs, and the often challenging environments in which they live.”
Some justice
In the months after her assault and the arson at her home, Baier lived out of a camper parked in her front yard. She wore a purse around her neck with a deer-skinning knife inside. Some nights she wet herself, too afraid to push open the RV door and use the restroom in her burnt home. She stayed up most nights with a pain in her mouth and eyes, unable to rest after working double shifts at the convenience store.

She lived for her day in court when restitution would be set and she could deliver her statement. She wrote out the facts on a piece of loose-leaf paper for the judge, jury and court officers to hear. She had June 2 marked on the calendar on her phone and in her kitchen. She called the district attorney’s office and the victim service coordinator each week, checking to make sure she had the date of the hearing correct.
She missed 15 days of work for court, many of them earlier trial dates that were bumped. She missed close to a month from surgery that eased her right eye back into its socket. In total, she estimates that she lost about $5,800 in wages.
When the hearing date arrived, Baier waited in a room in the courthouse with a printout of her victim impact statement. She was told to come back the next day when Faulkner would only plead. Restitution was set the next day, too. The victim service coordinator promised to let her know when she’d get a chance to tell her story in court and impress upon the judge the need for a substantial restitution payment. Baier waited for hours.
During the hearing, District Attorney Chris Posey remarked, “This does come with the approval of the victim in this case who I’ve spoken with many times and believe is actually in the courthouse today although not in the room at the moment.” But Baier said Posey never spoke to her about the plea deal.
The Victims’ Bill of Rights entitles victims to be present for all hearings before a judge. Baier wasn’t present to dispute the characterization of the attack she experienced. Posey attributed the attack to “some type of argument” between Faulkner and Baier.
Faulkner pleaded guilty to three years for aggravated domestic violence with time served for the 767 days spent in the Scott County jail for assaulting a jail guard. Restitution was set at $14,000 shy of the amount Baier asked for. She would get $2,000 at the end of the month – with the rest paid in $150 monthly installments once Faulkner’s court fines and fees were paid. The clerk then let her know she could leave.
Faulkner was also assigned an anger management course that he already took for a prior assault.
In an interview with Mississippi Today, Posey said that because the hearing took place in the courthouse while jury selection was happening for a separate trial, it would’ve been impossible for Baier to give her statement. The hearing was in the judge’s chambers, not the courtroom.
The victim service coordinator in the case refused a request for comment by Mississippi Today.
“What was said was further from the truth because that just makes it seem like he’s responding instead of the psychopathic behavior it truly was,” Baier said. “There was no foundation.”
Six percent of domestic violence cases were prosecuted as felony domestic aggravated assault in 2024, according to data from the Mississippi Administrative Office of Courts compiled by the Center for Violence Prevention.
“Too often, the gravity of domestic violence is misunderstood,” Riley said. “These are not simply individuals who ‘can’t get along’ with their partners — they are perpetrators of violence, many of whom will go on to commit even more serious crimes.”
On the street where she lives

Baier was pulling out of her driveway in Pulaski in Smith County when she saw a familiar face picking up a neighbor’s trash bin – and dumping the contents into the compactor. It was Faulkner. He was wearing the county jail striped orange pants. They locked eyes as she passed him on the gravel road by her house.
“There was no guard,” Baier said. “The way he beat me in the Walmart parking lot in front of God and everybody – you think he would hesitate in front of that trucker or another inmate?”
Mississippi Today was able to confirm that Faulkner, convicted of aggravated domestic violence along with two other prior violent felonies, was made a trusty at the Smith County jail — and was on work detail as a garbage collector on her street.
When Mississippi Today brought this to the Smith County Sheriff’s Department’s attention, the sheriff relayed that Faulkner was no longer in the program. He didn’t know Faulkner had been convicted, he was only going off the man’s criminal record in his county. 
Mississippi Department of Corrections policies prohibit inmates convicted of violent felonies, including aggravated domestic violence, from serving as trusties.
“Much of the problem comes down to communication,” said Riley, whose organization operates in 24 municipal justice courts in the lower six counties in Mississippi. “The issue isn’t that our justice system fails to act — it’s that it has long operated in silos. This entrenched way of functioning must change if we are to respond more effectively to interpersonal violence.”
In 2022, Attorney General Lynn Fitch established the Mississippi Domestic Violence Registry, which gives law enforcement access to information helpful for keeping law enforcement, victims and bystanders safe when answering domestic violence calls. It has been “a little slow” to get cooperation from agencies, said Michelle Williams, a spokesperson for the attorney general’s office, as officers have a lot of competing paperwork requirements. In an attempt to reduce this, Fitch’s office incorporated the registry into existing law enforcement reporting platforms.
Luke Thompson, former Byram police chief, said it was hard to convince his deputies to investigate domestic violence cases. He advocated for the attorney general’s office’s registry to be incorporated into the National Incident Based Reporting System, administered by the FBI.
Domestic violence cases require dual reporting and more paperwork than other cases. Officers are expected to determine a primary aggressor, which requires more discretion. Since 1992, just over a third of shootings of officers happened during domestic violence calls, Thompson found in his agency’s data.
Since retiring as chief, Thompson has been helping Mississippi agencies implement the Lethality Assessment Program, a questionnaire that helps law enforcement identify victims and serial abusers in their communities. The program helped his department connect victims with services faster and provide prosecutors with a more thorough history of abuse.
“It’s one of the hardest types of cases to sort through,” Thompson said. “Cops focus on ‘bad guys.’ We’re empathetic to victims. But sometimes we don’t always take that extra step to get a victim’s help.”
‘There was nothing in his eyes’
While the father of Baier’s children was incarcerated, he had sent Faulkner to be her protector. She felt taken care of by Faulkner, with his wide back and a muscular frame. She remembers the first day he arrived at the convenience store where she worked. She was drawn to the kindness he showed to another single mother. He provided money to her when she fell behind on car payments.
They were friends before they began dating. She enjoyed going on evening drives listening to “Good Ol’ Girl” by Frank Foster around Smith County when they were both off work. She knew he had been to prison, was first put off by his many tattoos, but was taken by his “big heart.”
For one month, he had been living with Baier, who was surprised when he announced he would be moving out. He had recently begun accusing her of cheating, which she thought was a joke. A relative of Faulkner’s attributes his behavior to untreated bipolar disorder. Baier said that he had been drinking alcohol. 
Before that day at Walmart, when he assaulted her, Baier had never seen his violent side. He asked to meet up while she was still working at the convenience store that night. She chose a public space because “there was nothing in his eyes.” He just looked different, she said.

“It was premeditated,” Baier said, clutching a charred family photo in her Smith County home. “That’s part of what’s gotten me all this time.”
Although she was able to clean her house, the smell of smoke persists. The fire damaged a photograph of four generations of her family. It was the last picture she had with her grandfather before he died from cancer.
Baier is well known in her community. She meets most locals as a clerk at a popular store in Forest where checks are cashed. She knows the farmhands who buy equipment and the waitresses at the local restaurants. Young and old, from out of town and native, they all chat with her at the store.
Lately, she’s been acting as her own investigator. She collected a list of witnesses from her assault as well as to the arson to hand to authorities. She helped the boss at her place of work transfer security footage onto a flash drive to capture the moment Faulkner entered the convenience store earlier in the night of her assault when he allegedly bought alcohol. The arson at her home has not gone to trial. No witnesses have been interviewed.
Her first eye surgery wasn’t considered a success because the muscles and tissues were damaged, pushing her right eye forward and causing pressure and migraines.
In a handwritten letter to the crime victim compensation director, Baier wrote, “After the fire, all I had was the torn, blood stained clothes on my back. My home was not habitable for four months. I’m telling you all this so you can understand the great financial strain, not to mention the physical and emotional damage that I will probably always suffer.”
Over half of completed victim compensation claims were denied in Scott County between 2021 and 2023, according to records obtained by Mississippi Today. Thirteen were denied and 11 were approved with an award. 
“When I got your denial and read the explanation, I felt abused and victimized all over again in a different way but just as damaging. Does a mistake from 13 years ago make me any less of a victim?

Paul Sarlo, a Democrat who chairs the Senate’s budget panel. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)The $700 million-plus in projects state lawmakers added to this year’s budget favored competitive districts and those represented by Democrats, according to a New Jersey Monitor analysis of budget documents recently made public.
A review of the nearly 600 budget resolutions approved as part of this year’s $58.8 billion annual spending bill found that municipal and school district aid approved outside of the state’s formulaic awards and competitive grants flowed almost exclusively to areas represented by Democrats. The budget cleared the Legislature on June 30, but the resolutions were not made public until Aug. 8.
In New Jersey, lawmakers and officials with the other branches of government can seek changes to the budget the governor proposes in February by submitting requests for funding or language changes through budget resolutions.
Because funding introduced as a result of budget resolutions often skirts the public dialogue that surrounds New Jersey’s annual spending bill, they are sometimes derisively called “pork” or “Christmas tree items,” though some legislators view them differently.

“I look at budget resolutions through two very distinct lenses: One is what can be the most impactful things in partnership with my local leaders for their towns, and secondarily from a broader statewide perspective, things that fit not only the legislative agenda that we try to push, which is affordability and accessibility of state services,” said Sen. Troy Singleton (D-Burlington), the chamber’s Democratic caucus chair.
Legislators who secure budget resolutions that send money to their districts don’t hide that fact — they announce it.
Senate Democrats in recent days have boosted resolutions sponsored by Singleton and others that provided $8 million for Rowan University for what would be the state’s first veterinary school and $200,000 for lighting upgrades at Cinnaminson’s municipal complex. 
“We were having children and seniors coming out of that building into dark parking lots and dark avenues. We have a ballot box that sits right there,” said Singleton. “What we tried to do is listen and then be responsive to those we work for, and the local community said this is something that matters to them.”
Promoting state funding for local projects becomes especially important during election years. This November, Democrats are hoping to retain control of the governor’s seat and the Assembly.
Though budget resolutions that send money to specific projects, municipalities, or school districts often face criticism, they are seldom the largest tranches of spending approved this way.
This year, the largest items dealt with university funding or state revenue. Those included a $76 million resolution to boost financing of a fund that supports some costs related to NJ FamilyCare, the state’s Medicaid program, and $70 million to reverse a cut to aid for universities that graduate low-income students.
Either one of those appropriations alone exceeds the roughly $62.1 million sent directly to school districts as a result of budget resolutions.
 Most funding went to Democrats

Democratic legislative districts had a near monopoly on money disbursed to towns and school districts as a result of budget resolutions.
Legislative districts represented by Republicans received additional school funding via budget resolutions in only two cases, and in both, the investments touched on areas represented by Democrats.
West Essex Regional School District, which serves students from Essex Fells, Fairfield, North Caldwell, and Roseland, received $150,000 through a resolution sponsored by Sen. Vin Gopal (D-Monmouth) and other Democrats. The regional school district’s towns span the Republican-held 40th District and the Democrat-dominated 27th District.
The Lenape Regional School District received $1 million for capital improvements. Its towns fall fully within the 8th Legislative District, which is represented by Sen. Latham Tiver (R-Burlington), Assemblyman Michael Torrissi (R-Burlington), and Assemblywoman Andrea Katz (D-Burlington). The 8th is one of only two New Jersey legislative districts with split partisan representation.
Budget resolution funding to municipalities showed a similar dynamic. Towns in legislative districts with Republican representation received direct funds through budget resolutions in only three instances, including one covering the 30th District in Monmouth and Ocean counties, the other New Jersey legislative district with split partisan representation.
Together, those line items amounted to roughly $2.3 million. In total, nearly $83 million for municipalities was approved through the budget resolution process.
The New Jersey Monitor’s review singled out budget resolutions that sent money directly to school districts or municipalities. The tallies do not include money that went to counties or private institutions within a given legislative district that may have reduced some municipal costs for certain projects.
The New Jersey Monitor identified only one instance among the 585 budget resolutions approved this year where the first prime sponsor was a Republican.
Sen. Bob Singer’s (R-Ocean) resolution awarded $1 million for a Lakewood food and clothing assistance charity to purchase a warehouse (Singer’s district is also represented by a Democrat, Assemblyman Avi Schnall). GOP members appeared as co-sponsors on five other resolutions.
The imbalance is unsurprising. Democrats control both legislative chambers and the governorship, limiting Republicans’ influence in budget negotiations. To some degree, it is intentional, even on the side of GOP members.
 Sen. Declan O’Scanlon (Hal Brown for New Jersey Monitor)
Sen. Declan O’Scanlon (R-Monmouth), the chamber’s GOP budget officer, said he encouraged his members to avoid seeking budget resolution funding.
“The message to all our members was we need to not be part of the problem here,” he said, adding, “If everybody’s job in the Legislature is to bring home the bacon, the pig dies pretty quickly.”
Nor is the imbalance necessarily new. A more cursory review of budget resolutions approved for the 2023 fiscal year that did not measure appropriation levels revealed just three measures where a Republican was a prime sponsor. A review of resolutions from fiscal year 2018 found a single budget resolution with a GOP co-sponsor and none with Republican prime sponsors.
“They’ve been trying to say it’s always been like this. That’s bullsh*t. It has not always been like this. This is so blatant,” said O’Scanlon.
 Competitive districts

Competitive legislative districts were likely to benefit from budget resolution funding, though other districts received greater amounts of funding as a result of legislators’ requests.
The 28th and 29th Districts — which include portions of Newark and are considered safely Democratic — received a combined $24.7 million in school aid, chiefly due to a resolution that awarded Newark public schools $21 million for capital expenses.
The 36th District was the only one to see at least half as much budget resolution school funding.
The district, which is represented by Sen. Paul Sarlo (D-Bergen), the Senate’s budget chair, received roughly $17 million in school and municipal aid as a result of budget resolutions. More than half of that money was for school capital improvements in Wood-Ridge ($9.5 million), where Sarlo is mayor.
A similar dynamic played out in the 38th District, which got $9.5 million as a result of budget resolutions.
Though Democrats are perennially concerned about a Republican upset in the 38th District — a Bergen County district that includes towns like Paramus and Lodi — the 36th has generally not been considered competitive. There’s some reason to think that could change this year: President Donald Trump carried both districts in last year’s presidential race.
“If a legislator is threatened, if their district is more at risk, they get greater consideration,” said Marc Pfeiffer, a senior policy fellow at Rutgers University’s Center for Urban Research who has long experience in state and local government.
Pfeiffer added that other factors, like a legislator’s relationships with caucus leaders or an ability to fundraise, also play a role in how budget resolution funding could be spread.
“It’s that combination of factors that us mere mortals are not necessarily privy to or, in some cases, capable of understanding,” he said.

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Troubled venture capital company Elevate Ventures has been deemed “in breach of” lending language in all of its active loan agreements with the Indiana Economic Development Corp. after defaulting on an angel investment program this month.
David Watkins, IEDC’s senior vice president of entrepreneurship and small business, gave the firm 30 days to cure the breaches before it nears default on those agreements.
In a Wednesday letter, he asked Elevate Ventures to provide a detailed financial plan and schedule, also within 30 days, to “demonstrate how it will be able to fulfill all of its outstanding obligations” — and why the IEDC shouldn’t make all outstanding loans due immediately.
The agency has “unreconciled, ongoing concern” that the company, “in its current state, will be unable to fulfill any of its current or future obligations,” Watkins wrote.
Elevate Ventures did not reply to multiple requests for comments.
The firm operates the Indiana Angel Network Fund, intended to entice and aid angel investments to Hoosier startups. It nabbed the contract with IEDC on Aug. 2, 2011, with repayment due exactly 14 years later.
IEDC sent a request for repayment of nearly $17.2 million the day before. Elevate Ventures repaid about $12.9 million on Aug. 4 — falling more than $4.3 million short.
That prompted another letter, this time a notice of payment default that requested full payment within five business days. The Aug. 5 document warned that the unpaid principal balance would rack up interest at 8%, or about $956 daily.
Elevate Ventures failed to pay in full by Aug. 12, constituting an “event of default” under the contract. Watkins’ letter, sent the next day, noted more than $7,000 in interest had accumulated.
The company offered to repay with a new loan from the returns of the Indiana 21st Century Research and Technology Fund, according to Watkins.
“However, this proposal appears to merely utilize assets designated to pay back other future obligations to pay back the Loan, which would only impair the ability to repay those other obligations,” he wrote in the letter.
IEDC also froze all accounts related to Elevate Ventures. Monthly payments on a separate professional services agreement during the “period of open collaboration” and  specific investments that were allocated capital at an IEDC board meeting in June are explicitly approved, however.
The company’s repayment struggle comes about three months after it was dubbed an “entity of interest” — alongside IEDC and its nonprofit arm — in a forensic investigation of potential financial wrongdoing.
The contract with FTI Consulting began May 13 and lasts one year. It’s worth up to $800,000 and will be paid for by IEDC funds, according to Commerce Secretary David Adams.
Gov. Mike Braun promised an audit just days after Indiana Legislative Insight reported allegations of self-dealing, unreported side gigs and more among IEDC and its partners.

(Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)For years, Idaho state lawmakers have worried the federal government might cut Medicaid funds.
That’s partly why the Legislature didn’t expand Medicaid to more low-income earners. In 2018, voters approved that policy through a ballot initiative.
Now, as many states brace for federal cuts and policy changes to Medicaid under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed by Republicans in Congress and signed by President Donald Trump, Idaho is well-positioned to handle the changes, said Idaho Sen. Julie VanOrden, who chairs the state Senate’s Health and Welfare Committee.

The Pingree Republican pointed to a range of Idaho’s systems that other states are looking to set up, like a panel of state lawmakers to oversee contracts and an emergency fund to deal with higher-than-expected costs.
“A lot of it came from the rising cost of Medicaid. So I think we have that in common with what the federal government is looking at,” she told the Idaho Capital Sun in an interview. 
But the new law passed by Congress gets in the way of Idaho’s plan to tap into one tool to pay providers more for Medicaid services, by capping state-set payment rates.

 Medicaid pays a portion of what health care services cost. Mega bill caps payments to providers. 

Medicaid, which insures around one-fifth of Americans, often pays much lower than what it costs health care providers to give out services. 
That’s why in April 2024, the federal agency that regulates Medicaid allowed states to require private companies that manage Medicaid benefits to pay providers rates for services as high as commercial insurance plans pay. 
In the future, Idaho plans to use that structure, called state-directed payments, as part of a new large Medicaid cost-cutting bill approved by the state Legislature this spring that will shift all Idaho Medicaid benefits to being run by private companies. That model, called managed care, is used widely across the country. 
Idaho Medicaid to be privately managed in 2029, health officials expect

The bill didn’t spell out how high Idaho’s state-directed payments would be. But VanOrden said lawmakers were “banking on” getting the average commercial state-directed payment rates.
“Certainly, it’s a disappointment that we won’t be able to apply for those waivers anymore to get that average commercial rate, which we were banking on,” she said.
But she doesn’t think losing that higher rate will affect Idaho’s funding plans as part of the shift to managed care.
The new federal law caps Medicaid state-directed payments at as high as rates for Medicare, which reimburses more but still not as much as providers say the true treatment costs are. 
The mega law’s new cap on state-directed payments won’t affect the status quo in Idaho, Idaho Medicaid Deputy Administrator Sasha O’Connell told a state legislative panel last month. It could limit Idaho’s ability to raise that in the future, she added. 
But the status quo in Idaho — which has the worst doctor shortage in the nation — isn’t really ideal, Idaho Hospital Association CEO Brian Whitlock told the Idaho Capital Sun.
“Status quo is we’re still 50th in the nation in physicians per capita. Status quo means we’re still having a workforce shortage throughout the health care system,” he said. “Status quo still means that more than half of our rural hospitals have less than a 1% operating margin, which is razor thin. Status quo means some of our hospitals are well below the standard of days cash on hand to operate. Status quo means you’re going to wait months to get in to see a specialist.”

States with state-directed payment rates higher than the new cap will have to ratchet down over time. That means Idaho’s new ceiling for state-directed payments will be every other state’s floor, Whitlock said.
“It may take some states 10 years to ratchet down and get to the Idaho level of 100% of Medicare,” he said. “And in the meantime, every other state that is participating in state directed payment programs has a distinct competitive advantage over Idaho, including our neighboring states.”
 Idaho was already working toward Medicaid work requirements, more eligibility checks

But some other new Medicaid changes that are part of the new mega law might not affect Idaho as much.
The new federal law calls for Medicaid work requirements and twice-a-year eligibility checks. The Idaho Legislature already passed a law this year to ask the federal government for permission to do that.
And Idaho’s status quo won’t be affected by new federal limits on taxes on health care providers, which states use to access more federal funds, state health officials say. That’s because Idaho’s taxes on providers like hospitals and nursing homes are below the new caps, O’Connell said. 
How Congress’s megabill will impact Idaho: Cuts to taxes, Medicaid, SNAP and more

Idaho is also looking to tap into a new $50 billion, five-year rural health fund established through the new federal law. 
In a column published last month in the Times-News, Idaho’s U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo — a Republican who pushed for several aspects of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — said Idaho wouldn’t be affected by the new Medicaid reforms on provider taxes and state-directed payments.
“Instead, Idaho’s rural hospitals will benefit from a new Rural Health Transformation Program that allocates money to all states, not just those using gimmicks to draw down more federal money,” Crapo wrote.
For five years, Idaho could receive $100 million each year from the fund, he said.
“This is arguably the single largest investment in rural health care in more than 20 years,” Crapo wrote in the column for the Twin Falls newspaper. “While it provides a way for states that do rely disproportionately on federal funding to make a financial plan, states like Idaho can provide immediate relief to rural hospitals and establish the tools necessary to be successful in the future.”
Over the next decade, the bill is expected to cut federal funds for Idaho Medicaid by $4.3 billion and reduce Idaho Medicaid’s enrollment by as much as 40,000 people, estimates in early June from the group Manatt show. The analysis assumes work requirements will cut Medicaid enrollment and costs.

(Photo by Liam Niemeyer/Kentucky Lantern) Mandates from President Donald Trump’s administration to retain aging coal plants could cause a massive spike in energy costs, according to an independent analysis commissioned by several environmental groups.
Orders from the U.S. Department of Energy to save coal plants from retirement could cost ratepayers more than $3 billion per year, according to a report from Grid Strategies, a power sector consulting firm. It was carried out on behalf of Earthjustice, Environmental Defense Fund, Natural Resources Defense Council and Sierra Club.
Under Trump, the agency has issued emergency orders to maintain operations at coal plants that were scheduled for retirement. While federal officials say the coal plants need to stay online to avoid blackouts, power plant owners and state regulators planned their closures because they were no longer economically viable or needed for reliability.
“DOE mandates override those well-informed decisions, inflating electric bills for homeowners and businesses and undermining the competitiveness of U.S. factories and data centers,” the Grid Strategies analysis found.
Across the country, coal plants have phased out as they’ve struggled to compete with cheaper renewables and natural gas. A 2023 analysis by Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan think tank, found that 99% of existing U.S. coal plants “are more expensive to run than replacement by local wind, solar, and energy storage resources.”
But Trump, who has pushed to unleash more fossil fuel development and to stymie wind and solar, has ordered a retiring coal plant in Michigan to stay online, along with an oil and gas plant in Pennsylvania.
“Based on the trend to date and indications that DOE has approached the owners of many retiring fossil power plants about potentially mandating their retention, DOE may attempt to mandate the retention of nearly all large fossil power plants slated for retirement between now and the end of 2028,” reads the Grid Strategies report.
The cost of keeping those plants online would be immense. By 2028, if Trump were to mandate the retention of all fossil fuel plants slated for retirement, the annual cost to ratepayers would be more than $3.1 billion, the analysis found.
The report also considers a number of aging plants that are not yet scheduled for retirement. It finds Trump’s actions could create a “perverse incentive,” causing plant owners to claim they’re planning to shut down, inducing the feds to step in and keep them open, with the cost borne by ratepayers.
Accounting for that possibility, the report found that ratepayer costs could reach $5.9 billion per year to keep the entire aging fossil fuel fleet online. California, Texas and Colorado would see the highest increases in electricity bills.

As lawmakers mull penalizing libraries that allow children to access inappropriate books, opponents have quoted the Bible and lawmakers have read lists of sex acts.
The post Debate over sexual material in Wyoming libraries is heating up… and getting awkward appeared first on WyoFile .","Rev. Dan Odell wore his clerical collar to address lawmakers on the Joint Judiciary Committee on Tuesday evening in Casper.
The Methodist pastor wanted the committee to know that if a bill to ban books containing sexually-explicit material from the children’s sections of Wyoming libraries passed as currently written, it could block minors from one book many lawmakers might say is their favorite: the Bible. 
To illustrate his point, Odell read aloud some of the religious text’s more graphic passages, like this one from the Book of Ezekiel: 
“She lusted after her lovers, whose genitals were like those of donkeys and whose emission was like that of horses,” Odell read. 
That passage was one of five containing what Odell called “frank descriptions of sexual acts,” that he read or cited for the committee. The reverend had more examples, he told lawmakers, than his allotted time for public comment on the bill would permit.
A notable swathe of Wyoming legislators have joined a nationwide movement of social conservatives who say sexually explicit content, mostly in books written for young LGBTQ+ readers, is corrupting children. They hope to keep minors from seeking out, or stumbling upon, sexual material in Wyoming libraries. As the packed committee room in Casper suggested, their opposition, largely led by the state’s educators and librarians, is growing larger and more organized.

And as demonstrated by Odell’s testimony, the debate is injecting an unusually carnal note into Wyoming politics. 
That includes the language of the bill draft itself, which requires public and school library employees to make sure sexually explicit materials aren’t available to minors, or face severe penalties. Like other conservative social issue measures the Wyoming Legislature has passed recently, the bill would let citizens sue institutions they catch violating the new rules. 
The draft contains a six-point definition of sexual acts that cannot be depicted in literature available to a minor. The definitions include graphic descriptions like “ejaculation onto the person of another” or “contact between the mouth and genitalia or mouth and anus,” that are a far cry from the often staid and technical language of statute. 
“Sorry if I get flush,” an embarrassed Rep. Jayme Lien said at the committee’s May meeting in Torrington, as the Casper Republican read the bill language, which mirrors statute passed in Iowa, to her colleagues. 
Staff attorneys from the Legislative Service Office have suggested that lawmakers could instead rely on a definition of “obscene materials” that already exists in Wyoming statute. That language describes obscene material as something the average person would find prurient or offensive — without getting into the detailed definitions proposed by Lien. But the existing language also notes that, to be considered legally obscene, the material in question, “taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.”
That definition borrows from a pivotal U.S. Supreme Court decision, Miller v. California. In that decision, the justices found that for material to be considered obscene under the law it had to lack those other societal values. Rep. Anne Lucas, the Cheyenne Republican who has been a vocal proponent of the legislation to ban books, says the Miller test was written for adults, not children. 
“The Supreme Court, when they heard that case, it never occurred to them, I suspect, that we would be talking about this in reference to children and obscene materials,” she told lawmakers in Casper on Tuesday, as she argued against using the language suggested by legislative staff. The high court heard Miller v. California in 1973. 
The bill’s opponents argue lawmakers are flirting with unconstitutional suppression of free speech in their quest to legislate what books are available where. 
Though Odell, the pastor, didn’t name the Miller case, he echoed the justices’ notion that sexual imagery or language can be embedded in texts with deeper meaning. 
“I mention these not for the sake of sensationalism,” the clergyman said of the graphic biblical passages he read lawmakers, “but because they’re a part of larger passages that reflect spiritual and moral truths.”
Rep. Marlene Brady, a Green River Republican who’s been outspoken on her belief that sexually explicit content endangers minors, took issue with Odell’s quoting of scripture. 
“The Bible is a book of history,” she said, “and some of those passages you’re referring to in my understanding of the Bible is the creator’s message to the beauty of the relationship, of a marriage, between a man and a woman… so to use it as support for what I would consider immoral material, I just take offense to that.”

Lawmakers did not act on the legislation in Casper. After hearing two hours of public testimony, nearly all of which was in opposition to the bill, lawmakers postponed a vote on whether to sponsor it as a committee bill until an October meeting in Cheyenne. 
Opponents of the legislation include advocates for LGBTQ+ Wyomingites. They accuse lawmakers of taking aim specifically at books that help gay youth understand their sexuality, in a state that isn’t always welcoming to them. Some of the definitions of sexually explicit material appear to originate from passages of a book called “Gender Queer,” which has generated outrage among conservatives nationwide.
“Wyoming already has obscenity laws that protect us from material with no redeeming value,” Marylee White, a Teton County library board member, told lawmakers. “This proposal goes further, allowing one group’s personal beliefs about morality to dictate what all families can access.”
The meeting drew a packed room of librarians, educators and other opponents who said the measure would stifle free expression and erode the role of the state’s libraries as places Wyomingites, including young people, can go to explore. 
“It ruins what the library is,” Lindsey Travis, president of the Wyoming Library Association and head librarian in Sweetwater County, told the committee. Despite the graphic definitions, librarians remain concerned that the general ban on “sexually explicit” materials was so broad that it would be nearly impossible for them to police all the books available to teens and children. 
Opponents asked legislators to respect library professionals’ processes for selecting books, and the existing avenues people can take to request a text’s removal. Those structures allowed local communities, not distant politicians, to shape their library collections, Travis said. 
But many legislators believe it’s within their purview to regulate library books. Sheridan Republican Rep. Laurie Bratten cited a section of the Wyoming Constitution that deals with protecting Wyomingite’s morality. 
“As the health and the morality of the people are essential to their well-being, and to the peace and permanence of the state, it shall be the duty of the legislature to protect and promote these vital interests,” reads the section of constitution Bratten quoted.
Travis offered to pair librarians with lawmakers in a working group to see if the two parties could reach a better compromise than the current legislation, which exposes libraries and schools caught violating the new rules to a $50,000 fine for each offense. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Jared Olsen, R-Cheyenne, told Travis the committee would not pursue the working group, she told WyoFile on Wednesday. 
The committee will also not hear further public testimony in Cheyenne, Olsen said at the Casper meeting. 
Lawmakers’ email inboxes, however, may not be so spared. Committee members received hundreds of emails asking them to vote down the bill ahead of the Casper meeting, lawmakers said. More than 850 people answered a call from the political organizing group Better Wyoming to write and oppose the legislation, executive director Nate Martin told WyoFile. 
“Those aren’t just librarians,” Martin said. “Those are parents, those are people who care about their libraries and those are people who are tired of watching the Freedom Caucus advance their extremist religious agenda.” 
A majority in the state House of Representatives aligns with the Wyoming Freedom Caucus, whose members have pushed for regulating library books both at the statehouse and at the local government level. The Freedom Caucus notched up legislative wins last year after taking control of the House, but Martin predicted the group will see increased opposition on this particular issue. 
The response to the group’s call to write lawmakers opposing the legislation was “overwhelming and frankly larger than that on most issues we deal with,” said Martin, who also serves on Laramie’s school board.

That’s why it’s so puzzling that Oklahoma’s third largest public university has decided the best way to position their journalism and communication students for success is by eliminating the print edition of its student-run newspaper, The Vista.
Administrators at the University of Central Oklahoma insist that abruptly ending printing a publication with a 122-year history is necessary because it will save the university $12,000 a year.
Student outcomes be darned.
To be clear, $12,000 equates to a few pennies at an institution that had an annual budget topping $170 million. This university’s governing body in 2023 also agreed to hire and pay President Todd Lamb, a former lieutenant governor, a guaranteed annual salary of $325,000 plus other benefits.
So this seemingly random pennypinching makes me wonder if this university is truly vested in setting its students up for success or if this amounts to someone at the highest levels attempting to censor the press. 
It’s also odd that the administration seemingly waited until just before the start of the school year to disclose it is essentially canceling The Vista when it’s probably too late for students to transfer to other universities that can better support their goals. (Keep reading for the digital media part of the news equation.)
The dean of UCO’s liberal arts college evidently believes the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education and the Regional University System of Oklahoma, which both govern the school, have issued a “mandate” to be more efficient with resources. Leaders believe this is a good program to chop.
Late last week, a UCO student media governing board indicated it was under pressure, and that funding for other student-produced media would be withheld until they submitted a budget that didn’t include printing The Vista.
Our state regents, meanwhile, have been touting their blueprint for success, which they identify as a “bold strategic plan” that “emphasizes the key role Oklahoma’s public colleges and universities play in producing the state’s workforce.”
You know what my industry needs? College newspapers. 
But apparently higher education leaders don’t care about that.
Is this governing board actually envisioning an environment where we end hands-on learning and programs that give students real-world experiences that set them up for employment opportunities and internships?
If so, the public deserves to know that.
As someone who makes hiring decisions, I’m looking for employees that have training and experience. And I need higher education leaders who understand what my industry’s needs are.
In the journalism and communication fields, the building blocks for most future employees typically begin at the college paper.
For decades, student newspapers have served a tri-purpose. 
They give students the opportunity to try their hand at writing, editing and laying out the paper. It also doubles as a way to teach those who want to work in marketing, public relations or film how to write a usable press release, design and sell ads or make a pitch.
College newspapers also serve as a training ground for students who hope to land a professional internship or full-time job in the communications industry, and they signal to employers that schools are producing graduates that have some experience at that, which makes them marketable.
And, finally college newspapers inform their campuses about news that impacts them. Universities are their own miniature ecosystems, complete with housing, food services and education. It’s often the student journalists living or going to school who first hold their university leaders to account. UCO served over 12,000 students last year and is located in a community, Edmond, that no longer has a local daily news source.
Their media outlet is the one who revealed Lamb’s ridiculously large salary that I quoted.
Earlier this year, a UCO official reached out to me to ask if I supported a proposal to stop printing The Vista.
I told the university that I believed it should have at least one print edition a week to give students the experience of laying out papers, designing advertisements, writing punchy headlines that fit in small spaces and meeting deadlines.
While it’s true that more people are consuming their news online, print newspapers are still alive and kicking in communities across Oklahoma. Every community deserves to have talented journalists. And every paper is a business that has subscribers and people who rely on them to receive their news.
Last time I was on UCO’s campus, I picked up a copy of The Vista and looked through the articles to see if there might be someone who would be a good fit for our summer internship.
I was on campus because our newsroom is partnering with a UCO reporting class to give participants – many of whom are first-generation college students – an opportunity to have a story professionally published online and in print. That can give them a leg up in the hiring process after they graduate.
Imagine how disheartening it is to find out UCO’s administration doesn’t see the same potential.
I’ve also worked with papers in this state, which have struggled to find people to work at their publications with the basic skillsets, which includes the ability to lay out a print edition. I myself have had difficulty finding college students who have state government reporting experience.
That should be a clear SOS to leaders of our universities that there’s a disconnect and that scrimping isn’t working.
I did tell UCO that it needed to invest in and beef up The Vista’s website because it’s not very user friendly.
Either way, UCO has reached a point where it either needs to put up or shut up. If a college doesn’t want to invest in the tools needed to make this degree successful, they need to end it and stop accepting tens of thousands in tuition money from those students.
Because students need to know their degree will lead to opportunities, and they trust colleges and universities to have policies in place to help them achieve their goals. Employers desperately need an educated workforce that meets their needs.
We can’t cut our way to greatness. 
It’s unfortunate that UCO has resorted to prioritizing pennies over its students.

A committee voted to sponsor three failed bills from the 2025 session that would continue the overhaul of Wyoming’s elections system. 
The post As Wyoming lawmakers rehash election reforms, two familiar camps remain divided appeared first on WyoFile .","As they have before, lawmakers gathered Friday to debate a bevy of bills aimed at redesigning the state’s elections. And like before, hours of testimony before the Wyoming Legislature’s Joint Corporations, Elections and Political Subdivisions Committee appeared to do little to change anyone’s mind. 
Those who have aligned themselves with Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray and his election-reform agenda were steadfast, while those who have been skeptical of the years-long pursuit to revamp the state’s elections remained skeptical. 
Lawmakers filed 45 election-related bills in the 2025 general election — accounting for about 8% of all legislation in both the House and the Senate. A fraction became law. 
In May, the committee voted to reanimate 10 of the bills after Gray asked lawmakers to consider roughly 20 bills from the last session. Then an 11th election-related bill was added to Friday’s agenda. 
“It’s probably the thing that Wyoming gets right more than anything in the whole country, is our elections. And we have for a long time, and we keep messing with it,” committee co-chairman Sen. Cale Case, R-Lander, said at the meeting in Casper. 
Ultimately, a majority of the committee saw things differently from Case, voting to sponsor three pieces of legislation and draft a new version of a fourth to be discussed at a November meeting. 
As for the seven other bills revived in May, the committee voted to make the final decision on their fate at the November meeting. Lingle Republican Sen. Cheri Steinmetz offered that suggestion as the meeting ran long. 
“I really think these are important bills, and we have a lot of public testimony on some of these, and then we’ll also have to work them,” she said. 
One of the bills to earn the committee’s sponsorship would require counties to use pen and paper as the default method to mark ballots for elections in Wyoming. For 22 of the state’s 23 counties, the bill would have little effect.
In Laramie County, where touch-screen voting machines have long been used, the change could “completely upend” elections, according Debra Lee, the local county clerk. 
The committee also voted to sponsor a bill banning ballot drop boxes and to move a bill to the next meeting to ban ballot harvesting. Gray has had his sights on the two prohibitions since running for secretary of state in 2022. 
Lastly, lawmakers voted to adopt a bill to clean up language related to Wyoming’s new voter registration law requiring proof of state residency and U.S. citizenship during voter registration. A federal court recently tossed a lawsuit challenging the new requirements as unconstitutionally vague and imposing an undue burden on the right to vote. 
The committee’s next meeting is Nov. 3 in Cheyenne.

(Photo by Kevin Hardy/Stateline)BOSTON — During this year’s budget cycle, Oklahoma state Sen. John Haste said lawmakers had two major things on their minds.
“Number one was tax cuts. Number two, what the hell is going on in Washington?” he told a national gathering of state lawmakers last week in Boston.
While Oklahoma lawmakers secured another round of income tax cuts, they are still wrapping their heads around the fiscal impacts of President Donald Trump’s massive spending and tax law, Haste said. The measure slashes funding for health care and food assistance.
That legislation, and other Trump actions, proved a central theme of discussion during the National Conference of State Legislatures summit, which organizers said was the largest ever gathering of state lawmakers with more than 1,600 in attendance. Aside from cutting funding, the law imposes costly new administrative burdens on states.
States are still sorting through the long-term impacts of the legislation — and what, if any, actions they can take to soften the blow.
Haste, a Republican, said concern is highest in rural areas, where reduced Medicaid funding could threaten hospitals. He said that just one provision of the law will cut $209 million in funds that help Oklahoma cover the cost of Medicaid, and that the state will need to spend an estimated $30 million on the new cost of checking eligibility twice per year.
“All of those things added together come up to a really big number,” he said, but added: “We don’t know exactly what that is.”
Lawmakers from liberal and conservative states said they are still grappling with the implications of Trump’s signature legislation. With most states boasting solid fiscal positions, some expect to cover new up-front administrative costs by tapping into strong reserve funds. But many are considering reducing services.
Nevada state Sen. Fabian Doñate, a Democrat, said state leaders will have to cut Medicaid eligibility or services since Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo has said he will oppose any efforts to raise taxes.
“That becomes a challenge, right?” Doñate said during a panel discussion on Medicaid. “Do you cut the pregnant mom or the person that makes above 180% of the federal poverty level who’s under 50, or do you cut diapers for seniors?”
At the same time, states must gear up for new bureaucratic mandates from Washington.
“Regardless of how you feel about these provisions — whether these are opportunities or challenges, fantastic or awful — regardless, it’s going to be a heavy lift for states,” said Lauren Kallins, NCSL’s senior legislative director for state-federal affairs.
She said states and organizations, including NCSL, are still awaiting detailed federal guidance on all the changes, which are spread out over several years. But states will need to react quickly.
One provision in the law requires the 40 states plus Washington, D.C., that have expanded Medicaid to check paperwork at least twice a year to ensure those enrollees are meeting new work requirements. The legislation provided states $200 million, but experts question whether it will be enough to help states implement the changes by the end of 2026.
To meet that deadline, states will need to increase outreach to Medicaid recipients and make new investments in technology, Kallins said. Similarly, states must cover new administrative costs for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, commonly called food stamps.
Traditionally, the federal government has fully funded SNAP benefits and split administrative costs of the program with states. The new law requires states to fund 75% of administrative costs and requires some states, depending on the accuracy of their eligibility determination, to fund a portion of benefits.
“So that’s another very significant increase for states,” Kallins said.
 States in a ‘very, very strong position’

Though revenue growth is slowing, lawmakers and experts pointed out that many states currently enjoy strong budget fundamentals.
That’s true in Utah, which touts deep reserve funding and a rapidly growing economy.
Jonathan Ball, Utah’s legislative fiscal analyst, told conference attendees that the state could rely on some of its reserve for one-time administrative and technical costs associated with the federal legislation.
He said lawmakers and budget writers always have to find creative ways to solve their state’s budget puzzles.
“It’s a little bit maybe scarier, but it’s not a new sort of problem,” he said. “I think you all have the tools, we feel like we have the tools to fix it.”
Still, he said the potential for further federal funding cuts has raised many questions.
“The uncertainty about what happens in the future is huge,” Ball said.
At a separate session focusing on state budgets, financial analyst Geoffrey Buswick said most states have enviable credit ratings, meaning investors can be confident in a state’s ability to pay back debts, which affords it lower interest rates.
Buswick, the managing director and sector leader for public finance at S&P Global Ratings, said states likely have the budgetary cushion to adjust to federal policy changes.
“The states are in a very, very strong position — about the strongest we’ve ever seen,” he said.
Maryland Democratic state Sen. Karen Lewis Young didn’t buy that assessment.
She said her state touts strong reserve funds, but that those can only be used for one-time expenses and not to replace eliminated funding on an ongoing basis. Maryland is facing a huge decline in federal jobs, along with federal cuts in transportation, health and education funding.
“What am I missing in your optimism?” she asked the financial analyst.
Afterward, she told Stateline that Maryland may tout a stronger position compared with other states. But she added that even with low unemployment and a high average income, the federal legislation forces difficult decisions for lawmakers, who are constitutionally mandated to balance the state budget.
“You’ve got to cut from someplace else,” she said. “If you’re losing a pretty large share of your federal match, who do you cut?”
 A ‘substantial headache’

Across the country, Democratic lawmakers hope to underscore the cuts in Trump’s new law to weigh down Republicans in state races this year and next.
Hawaii Democratic state Sen. Ronald Kouchi said lawmakers need to ensure constituents understand where the spending cuts originated.
“Who’s going to be blamed when people are left out, when people are hungry and they lose out on educational opportunities?” he asked during a panel. “If we as state legislators do not convey that it is a result of the decisionmakers in Washington, D.C., they will be at our doorstep as the place of last resort.”
Kouchi, the president of the state Senate, said Hawaii leaders had socked away more than $1 billion in reserves. But he said the state cannot fill in all the financial gaps, especially during a time when officials are trying to set aside more in disaster funding and grapple with a slowdown in tourism.
“There is no current financial ability for the state to meet the needs of everyone who is currently being impacted,” he said in an interview.
New Mexico state Rep. Meredith Dixon, a Democrat, said her state should be somewhat insulated after directing surplus oil and gas revenues into a new Medicaid Trust Fund. But she said it’s still unclear how much pressure the federal legislation will put on the state.
“We are not protected by any stretch. So we are going to have to look at how we cover those costs. … We’re still digging into everything.”
West Virginia House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, a Republican, said no one in the federal government or at the state level seemed to have a full understanding of the implications of the legislation.
“I look at this bill as Obamacare 2.0: We have to pass this bill so we can find out what’s in it,” he told Stateline.
Hanshaw said the law has some provisions that will benefit West Virginia and others that will cause a “substantial headache.”
“We have no idea yet how we’re going to respond,” he said. “I don’t want to speak for any other state … but I would speculate that’s true for nearly every other state.”

Jim Pillen and State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood laugh after he signs a mock check signifying state investments in K-12 education. (Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A fund marketed as a sustainable source of state aid to Nebraska’s K-12 schools is on track to be completely depleted within five years of its creation.
The Education Future Fund (EFF) was designed in 2023 to lower property taxes while supporting school districts by providing resources that weren’t covered under Nebraska’s existing school funding formula. It launched with an initial investment of $1 billion and a commitment from state lawmakers to add another $250 million each year thereafter to keep it stable.
At the time, Gov. Jim Pillen said he hoped to build the fund to approximately $2.5 billion by 2029-30, but the state is spending money faster than it can grow. After that first $1 billion investment, expenses out of the fund have far exceeded revenue transfers into it by more than $150 million each year.
The Education Future Fund is now baked into Nebraska’s current school funding formula. Among other things, EFF offers per-pupil funding primarily to non-equalized school districts and assumes a higher level of state funding for special education.
Based on the fund’s projected ending balance in the state’s latest biennial budget and the trajectory of steadily increasing EFF expenses each year, if lawmakers only add the standard $250 million to the fund in fiscal year 2027-28, it will not have enough funds to cover its expenses by the end of that year, according to a Nebraska Examiner analysis.
This appears to be one of the worst-kept secrets among Nebraska state government and local education officials. Five school board members representing districts across the state told the Examiner that their boards had doubts about EFF’s lasting power when the fund was first introduced.
Barbara Baier, board member for Lincoln Public Schools, compared the state’s budgeting strategy of transferring revenues across different funds to “moving around deck chairs on the Titanic.”

Tim Royers, president of the Nebraska State Education Association, said lawmakers also know about this. When he approached Education Committee members in the Nebraska Legislature this session about adding resources to EFF, he said even his low-cost requests were rejected because lawmakers said there wasn’t enough money in the fund to support them.
Brad Wilkins, a board member for Ainsworth Community Schools, was on the task force that developed the idea for EFF. He said members of the governor’s staff claimed the fund would be sustainable for 10 years, but he said he questioned the estimate even then.
This touches on a longstanding lack of trust Nebraska’s education community has in the reliability of state government as a funding partner, Wilkins said. Lawmakers constantly ask school boards to lower their levy rates — and sometimes seek to cap them — while promising to take care of the districts if they comply, but they don’t always hold up their end of the bargain, Wilkins said.
“Some of those promises are hard to keep,” he said. “We need to keep this one.”
Despite the fiscal challenges, Pillen said he remains committed to ensuring the Education Future Fund remains alive. Lee Will, chief operating officer for Nebraska’s Department of Administrative Services, said the current plan is to increase the revenue transfers going into the fund.
“Fixing Nebraska’s property tax crisis while investing in our kids are my top goals as governor,” Pillen said in a statement. “We will ensure that the funding in the Education Future Fund is sustainable for generations to ensure we never give up on any kid in Nebraska.”
Where that additional revenue will come from, however, is a question that remains unanswered.
Foundation aid
The two biggest expenses out of the fund also come with the biggest statewide impacts: foundation aid and special education reimbursements.
Foundation aid was pitched as a way to support the vast majority of Nebraska’s 244 school districts that don’t receive equalization aid, what many know as state aid to K-12 schools. Foundation aid is a per-pupil funding mechanism that offers districts $1,500 for each student, minus any equalization aid the district already receives. Foundation aid costs roughly $112 million each year out of the fund.
Foundation aid’s impact largely depends on the district. At Lincoln Public Schools, Baier said they didn’t get much of a funding boost from foundation aid because the district already received a high amount of equalization aid.
But for smaller school districts like Ainsworth and West Point Public Schools, foundation aid makes a huge difference. Steven Blocher, board member at West Point, said the only state aid the district received prior to EFF’s implementation was allocated income taxes, which brought the district roughly $140,000 per year.
Foundation aid alone boosted West Point’s state aid by $1 million, Blocher said, and state special education reimbursements added another $360,000. He said the extra support helped the board approve an increase to teacher salaries.
In Ainsworth, Wilkins said foundation aid brought his district’s state aid from roughly $40,000 per year to about $450,000. He said that money was used nearly dollar-for-dollar to reduce the amount of property tax funds sought to operate their schools.
Special education reimbursements
Special education reimbursements make up an even larger chunk of the annual EFF payouts, ranging from $246 million in the fund’s first year to a projected $309 million in 2026-27. When the fund was created, lawmakers also approved increasing the state’s share of special ed costs covered from 40% to 80%. The program is largely split among federal and state funds, along with money from local school districts.
The demand for special ed services has been higher than both state and education officials expected, which is why the expenses have grown so much. Dave Welsch, board member for Milford Public Schools, said over the last decade his district’s special ed population has doubled.
Several other board members said their district’s special ed costs have increased much faster than they expected. This change is a factor in eroding the sustainability of the EFF in its current state, but it also brings the most consistent benefits from the fund to school districts, regardless of size.
Milford, for example, is “on the bubble” of Nebraska’s equalization formula, Welsch said, so the district can’t count on that support every year. But its reimbursements have raised the state aid the district receives by more than $600,000 each year.
LPS doesn’t receive much in foundation aid because of its equalization aid, but Baier said the special education funding has helped the district stabilize its budgets.

Levies
A big purpose of the EFF was to encourage school boards to lower local property tax asking — the amount of money sought from local property taxpayers to fund schools — by providing the additional state support. That strategy appears to have worked, to some degree.
All five board members who spoke with the Examiner said their local levy rates had either dropped or remained level since the EFF was created.

Will noted that since 2023, school district property taxes have risen 1.7% year-over-year. He argued this is a sign that the fund is working, because city and county property taxes have risen 5.5% and 4.7%, respectively.
Steve Koch, board member for Hershey Public Schools, said EFF aid helped his board lower the local levy rate by more than 15%, reducing Hershey’s overall tax asking by roughly $400,000.
At West Point, Blocher said the board was able to lower the district’s levy from over 69 cents in 2022-23 to 57 cents in 2024-25.
Milford’s levy rate has been rising over time from 84 cents in 2019-20 to 93 cents in 2024-25, Welsch said. He argued that due to rising property valuations and the district’s equalization aid dropping, Milford’s levy growth likely would have been much higher without EFF support.
At Omaha Public Schools, the largest school district in Nebraska, the district’s allocation of state aid remained relatively unchanged in the first year EFF was implemented in 2023-24. The following year, however, state aid to OPS jumped from roughly $285 million to more than $316 million, according to documents a district spokesperson sent the Examiner to review.
Over the same period, OPS also lowered its total levy rate from $1.21 to $1.10, the lowest it’s been in over a decade.
Multiple OPS board members either declined or ignored requests for comment in recent weeks.
What happens next?
If EFF were to suddenly dissolve, multiple board members said it would be “catastrophic” for their districts. Several board members said they would likely have no choice but to raise tax levies, though Wilkins noted that might be its own challenge due to levy caps state lawmakers also put in place that limit year-over-year increases.
Other board members said they may consider cuts to personnel costs, which consistently make up the biggest portion of school district budgets across Nebraska.

These worst case scenarios are unlikely, Will said, as he confirmed state officials remain committed to fueling the fund. At this point, he said the primary strategy is simply to increase the funds transferred into it.
While EFF was originally marketed as a largely self-sustaining system, Will argued it’s actually more sustainable for the state to control exactly how many dollars are going into it through transfers.
The only revenue source for EFF that isn’t a fund transfer is investment income, which is expected to drop from roughly $29 million in 2024-25 to about $16 million in 2025-26 and $11 million in 2026-27, according to state documents.
Many board members said they are nervous about the state having the money to make the fund whole, especially considering Nebraska’s current financial situation. This session, lawmakers grappled with a large projected deficit, which contributed to them reducing the amounts the state transferred into the EFF to $242 million for both years of the current biennium, rather than $250 million.
Nebraska is facing yet another projected deficit of about $95 million, according to the latest financial status, and Pillen has made clear his intention to cut the state budget an additional 10%, or roughly $500 million.
That prompts the question: If Nebraska is going to increase funding to EFF, where would that money come from?
Lou Ann Linehan, a former state senator from the Elkhorn area who helped develop the fund, had doubts that state revenues would actually be that bad when push comes to shove. She recalled during her first year in office in 2017 that revenue forecasts predicted a budget deficit of more than $1 billion.
This turned out to be an inaccurate reading, as lawmakers ended that year growing the state’s cash reserve, Linehan said. She said she feels Nebraska’s revenue forecasts are usually too conservative.
Will expressed confidence that raising the revenue transfers into EFF would be manageable. He said lawmakers have multiple years to figure this out and noted there are many outside factors that impact state revenues.
He further argued that on average, Nebraska’s tax receipts grow about 4.5% each year, although that hasn’t been the case so far in 2025.
“I don’t want to say that $100-$125 million isn’t a problem we [have] got to solve, but it’s definitely not our biggest one,” Will said.
Education officials, however, remain on edge. Royers, of the NSEA, said if lawmakers pull back on EFF aid, that would hardly be the first time that state officials have made lofty promises to schools they later rescinded.
Linehan pushed back on the lack of trust school officials have with the state. While in the Legislature, she said it was frustrating to hear school representatives say they don’t trust her or other lawmakers when they consistently increased education funding, including through EFF itself.
It’s worth noting, however, that there have been two years over the past decade that aggregate state funding to school districts has dropped, according to Legislative Fiscal Analyst Keisha Patent. However, the total amount of state aid to schools has continued its upward trajectory after those blips.
Trust issues aside, most people tend to agree that the biggest obstacle facing the fund is finding new revenues to support it. That is a challenge that will take time to overcome.
“The writing is on the wall if they don’t come up with new ways of raising income,” Koch said.

Autocrats have historically used fear of violent crime to grow and consolidate their power, writes constitutional scholar David Adler.
The post Trump’s takeover of D.C. police force unleashes new legal and constitutional concerns appeared first on WyoFile .","To justify his deployment of the National Guard to the streets of Washington, D.C., in conjunction with FBI, Border Patrol, Secret Service, ICE and DEA agents, as part of his federal takeover of the city’s police force, President Donald Trump has declared a “crime emergency” in the nation’s capital. That declaration comes despite the fact that federal officials in his own administration recently announced that violent crime in the District of Columbia has hit a 30-year low. 

Opinion

In an Aug. 11 press conference, Trump announced that these forces “can do whatever the hell they want” to curb crime, an unprecedented presidential action, and another assertion of his belief that he enjoys absolute power under Article II of the Constitution.
Trump has invoked a provision of the 1973 Washington D.C. Home Rule Act, which permits the president to take control of the city’s police force for a temporary period, up to 30 days. After that period, Trump must receive authorization from Congress if he wishes to maintain control of law enforcement. Trump’s false pretext for deploying the guardsmen, one exposed by his administration’s report that violent crime in the nation’s capital is down 35% from 2023, and has fallen to its lowest point since before the pandemic, is the latest in a string of troop deployments for domestic purposes. 
Just two months ago, he sent 4,000 national guardsmen and 800 active-duty Marines to quell protests in Los Angeles over his immigration policies, despite the fact that the protests, which were overwhelmingly peaceful and efficiently handled by local law enforcement, had largely ended. Trump’s actions appear to have violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which sharply limits use of the military in domestic law enforcement, as well as the 10th Amendment, and are the subject of a federal trial underway this week.
Trump’s executive takeover of law enforcement in the nation’s capital — long a goal of his — is predicated on his baseless description of the city as an urban hellscape and reflects his authoritarian trajectory. Devoid of a factually based rationale, since there is no street crime epidemic in the District, the legality of Trump’s action is specious and raises questions about his motives. Historically, autocrats have painted wildly exaggerated portraits of violent crime in cities before taking control of local law enforcement, pursuant to national expansion.
Indeed, Trump announced that he may also deploy the National Guard to other cities, naming New York, Chicago, Baltimore and Oakland, among others. Each city is governed by a Democratic mayor and located within a “Blue State.” FBI statistics indicate that crime is down, however, in New York and Baltimore, and the National Mayors Association has confirmed the reduction of crimes in cities across America. Historically speaking, authoritarian leaders have deployed the military into civilian populations as projections of power and presence, aiming to intimidate local populations and suppress dissent. The infliction of fear among the people has been a common technique among autocrats in other nations and across the decades, as a means of cowing opponents, silencing dissidents and preventing protests. Residents of Washington have already expressed fear at the sight of military boots in their streets.  
While it is likely that the deployment of forces in the nation’s capital also represents an additional effort to divert the attention of Trump’s MAGA base, outraged by the president’s failure to deliver on his promise to release the Epstein Files — a political and moral scandal that has engulfed his administration’s time, resources and energies, and which seemingly defies resolution — the broader legal and constitutional concerns arising across our nation ask about state authority, in the event of forthcoming deployments, to respond to presidential acts that swallow up the 10th Amendment. Mindful of the fact that all governmental acts, including those of presidents, must be tethered to the Constitution, citizens are right to ask about measures to restrain the federal government and prevent, as former Chief Justice Marshall wrote, transgression of legal boundaries. 
As is often the case, history offers valuable insights for our time. In 1798, when Congress passed the Alien and Sedition Acts. Founders, including James Madison and Thomas Jefferson, wrote resolutions — the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions — that decried violations of the Constitution which they believed constituted a fundamental threat to the republic, federalism and American liberties. We turn next week to their response.

In an era when infrastructure backlogs are long and government funding is thin, a public-private partnership in Converse County gets a job across the finish line.
The post Ayres Natural Bridge Park gets makeover thanks to unconventional approach appeared first on WyoFile .","Scrubby plains and strafing winds dominate the landscape of central Wyoming. But from an Interstate 25 exit west of Douglas, a narrow road leads down a lush canyon where a natural stone bridge spans a serene creek. 
“It is a gorgeous park,” said Ayres Natural Bridge Park caretaker Christy Smith. “It is very, very tranquil.”
With red rock walls hugging a green expanse of lawns, campsites and leafy trees, the park attracts local visitors as well as tourists who marvel at Ayres Bridge — one of only three natural stone bridges in the U.S. that spans running water. But in recent years, the park facilities were showing their age, said Smith, who lives in the park and manages it with her husband, Traves. 
Cracks and rust appeared on decades-old playground equipment, and picnic tables weren’t up to Americans with Disabilities Act standards. The sprinkler system was ancient and the grills were run down. The Smiths started looking around for funding to help bring the park up to date, but funding isn’t easy to come by, Smith said. Grants are hard to get for established parks, she said, and the county has its own budget constraints. 
“And then I get this email,” Smith said. 
The missive proposed a grant to fund the park rehabilitation project. Smith was incredulous, she said. “At first I thought it was a scam.”
It wasn’t a scam. The author of the email was Lori McCullough, founder and CEO of the Great Outdoors Fund. The national organization is dedicated to expanding access to the outdoors and improving recreation opportunities through public-private partnerships. And she had zeroed in on the Ayres Natural Bridge Park as a candidate. 
Fast forward to June, and crews with project sponsor Occidental Petroleum, or Oxy, as well as Converse County commissioners and others spent two days pouring cement, installing playground equipment, replacing grills and building a new fire pit. 
The project has substantially improved the park, Smith said.

It also sets out a model for alternative funding for outdoor recreation infrastructure and access in an era when government resources are challenged, inconsistent or in flux. 
“As these other funding sources become in jeopardy, it just makes more sense” to look to alternative ways to fund the projects, McCullough said. Across America, she added, “the need makes for limitless opportunities.”
Creative solutions
Wyoming’s outdoor recreation crowds have been growing for decades, and the COVID-19 pandemic fueled the trend when it fueled new interest in getting outside. 
Federal land management agencies like the U.S. Forest Service have been unable to keep staffing levels up even as maintenance and infrastructure backlogs have grown. Federal job layoffs and funding cuts in 2025 further limited their bandwidth, and nonprofits have attempted to fill the gaps with measures like hiring personnel to assist forest crews. 
The model used for the Ayres Natural Bridge Park project is another untraditional strategy. 
McCullough’s Great Outdoors Fund acts as a facilitator between private donors and outdoor projects that need resources. The end goal is to make the outdoors accessible to all, she said. Oxy, an energy company that has a significant presence in Converse County, went to her looking to fund a project in its target area, she said.
When she started researching potentials, she discovered the Ayres Natural Bridge Park. “And it just so happened that the county had decided on a significant investment in the irrigation system … and they didn’t have funding for any other upgrades,” McCullough said. 
She got in touch with the county, and soon after, sent the email that Smith suspected was spam. Agreements were drawn up, and with Oxy’s donation, the Great Outdoors Fund provided more than $100,000 for concrete pads, picnic tables, grills, a new four-way teeter-totter and a playground set, among other things.

Though well used, playground and other equipment in the Ayres Natural Bridge Park in Converse County was outdated. An untraditional funding model was used to find the money and manpower to undertake a 2025 park rehabilitation project. (Great Outdoors Fund)
Over two days in June, work crews and volunteers gathered in the park to complete the project.
The county is “thrilled” to be a beneficiary of the project, Commissioner Robert Short said, “because we want everyone to have the opportunity to enjoy this park.”
Along with addressing backlogs, Short said, he sees the project as an example of industrial development folks giving back to the communities where they work. 
Benefits
“It has completely changed the look of that area, and we are so happy with it,” Smith said. 
Smith has spent time in Ayres her entire life; her grandparents ran the park when she was a child. When she and Traves became caretakers four years ago, their priority was improving it for users, she said. This project took care of a lot of that work.

The benefits of natural spaces like Ayres Natural Bridge Park are immeasurable, McCullough said. “We can calculate the economic impact of recreation, but the impact on our health and well-being is incalculable,” she said. 
The county has plans to continue Ayres improvements. Phase two will entail redoing the walking path that encircles the park.

(Stills Congressional Campaign photo)The number of Democrats hoping to represent the party in the 2026 race for Wisconsin’s 1st Congressional District has grown to three, all from Racine County and all positioning themselves as working-class candidates who contrast sharply with the incumbent.
Gage Stills, a 25-year-old community activist, said he comes to the race with “a strong working-class perspective on things, and I know what a lot of these families are going through — I’ve lived it.”
Stills said Friday that he launched his campaign in mid-July, running “under the radar” without a mass media announcement but with a campaign website and a Tik-Tok account to which he posts videos once a week.
That made him the second entry into the Democratic field for the 1st District, following Randy Bryce, who ran and lost in 2018 and announced May 20 he would try again. A third Democrat, nurse Mitchell Berman, entered the race August 12.
Each of the three are seeking the Democratic nomination to run against U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil (R-Janesville), the incumbent now in his fourth term.
In an interview, Stills described his upbringing as one of a family “living paycheck to paycheck and not entirely certain where the next meal is going to come from.”
Even in those circumstances, however, he added, “My parents, they took good care of me and they raised me right and they raised me to care about the world and care about people.”
Stills said that “a big factor” in his decision to run was “the One Big Beautiful Bill and how much it does to hurt the working class and how much it does to hurt folks who are in the lower middle class.”
The “One Big, Beautiful Bill” is what Trump and the legislation’s GOP backers dubbed the mega-bill that extended tax cuts enacted during Trump’s first term in 2017. The legislation, which Trump signed on July 4, also made significant cuts to Medicaid and federal food assistance and rolled back clean energy tax breaks that Congress and then-President Joe Biden enacted in 2022, among a number of other provisions.
Stills said Trump’s policies that ramped up the deployment of federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers with arrests that have swept up immigrants, a number of whom were legally authorized to be in the U.S., were an additional factor in his decision.
“I have a lot of family who are Hispanic,” Stills said. “Some of my family members have married immigrants, and they came here legally, but you know, that’s not entirely guaranteed protection these days.”
He said his upbringing led him to believe “that it doesn’t make sense to complain if I’m not going to get in there and try to do the work.”
Stills said he as a cybersecurity analyst after working for about five months as a state corrections officer and before that in retail sales. He said he was active in Black Lives Matter demonstrations in Racine in 2020 and has volunteered with local environmental organizations and at a community homeless shelter.
The race for Congress is his first time running for a political office. While he acknowledged some voters might be wary, he said that he has “no political ties to anybody. I don’t owe anything to any corporation” — making him a fresh face that voters would appreciate.
“I think for too long we’ve seen politicians that, sure they’ve held political office, but they don’t use that office to help the people,” Stills said.
Steil is a corporate lawyer who previously worked as an aide to former U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, the Janesville Republican who represented the 1st District for 20 years after he was first elected in 1998.
Steil won his first term in 2018, defeating Bryce by a 12-point margin, and won subsequent races with a similar spread.
Stills said he believes he can overcome that gap. “I plan on speaking to the people’s needs,” he said.
While he didn’t attend a listening session that Steil held July 31 at which many constituents directed angry comments to the congressman, Stills said he followed news accounts of the event.
The people who attended “raised valuable concerns that it seemed that he just tried to brush off, or blame on Biden, which doesn’t work anymore,” Stills said.
“We know the votes that he’s casting,” he said of Steil. “We know that they’re not for us. And I think that the people are waking up to that.”
Stills said he wants to aim his message to people all across the political spectrum — left, center and right alike.
“I think that more and more people are going to look for an alternative,” he said. “I think that alternative should be a voice that speaks for them, that comes from the same place as them, a working class perspective.”

Holy Name Housing Corp. next will add on-site touches such as shingles, basement finishings and possibly a garage to the bungalow also designed by students at Metropolitan Community College.
If all goes as planned, the four-bedroom residence will be sold to a family for under $275,000, a homeownership opportunity in a high-rental pocket of one of the state’s more distressed areas.
Belying its swift, pop-up entrance — a captivating spectacle for onlookers — the house at 2452 Camden Ave. is the result of a lengthy and multi-organization process also involving an ‘at risk’ state housing fund intended to help ease Nebraska’s affordable housing shortage.
 Housing for middle income workforce  

Matthew Cavanaugh is executive director of Holy Name Housing, a grant recipient of the state’s Middle Income Workforce Housing Investment Fund, which since its 2020 creation by the Legislature has distributed about $42 million to help multiple nonprofits develop houses in qualified older and urban neighborhoods of the state’s three largest counties.

The fund for Douglas, Sarpy and Lancaster Counties is competitive. Holy Name over the years has been awarded a total of about $7 million, for which its private donors provide a partial match. The agency used recent grant funds to boost a revolving loan program that helps build homes such as the one that popped up in Miller Park. 
A relatively new partnership with Metro offers a different twist: Holy Name pays for building and materials while the students prepare architectural plans and housing components.
Holy Name covered the cost to transport the Camden Avenue house in sections from the college’s Fort Omaha campus a half-dozen blocks to the neighborhood. The bungalow was the second house produced via the partnership.
The idea is that repayment of loans into the nonprofit’s revolving fund will multiply the number of houses available for sale at relatively affordable prices. The targeted population of working-class homeowners is expected to help build stability and mixed-income neighborhoods. That ideally would lead to more jobs and economic prosperity in historically disinvested areas.
An even quicker benefit of the Metro partnership, said Cavanaugh, is hands-on training and enthusiasm-building provided to budding workers in construction trades — an understaffed industry he said is a key reason for high housing costs.

“They’ll be able to see the finished product, the contribution they made in a home that will be there for the next generations,” he said. “So hopefully it inspires students to continue to work in the trades … that’s what we’re excited about.”
The Middle Income Workforce housing fund has no income restrictions for homebuyers, but the Holy Name team says it screens applicants to weed out investors seeking to rent the property. Rules limit construction costs per house to no more than $330,000. A law change this year allows the grant funds to also be used to construct or renovate rent-to-own housing in qualified urban areas.
 ‘It’s all at risk’ 

Continued state funding for the program has been in jeopardy in recent years.
With the state budget facing major shortfalls, the Appropriations Committee sought to cut $4 million from each of the Middle Income and the separate Rural Workforce housing funds.
Instead, the Legislature approved a one-time $8 million transfer from the state’s longest-running housing program, the Affordable Housing Trust Fund, to help with budget woes. Unlike the two newer funds, that pot is fueled by a portion of the documentary stamp tax from real estate transactions.
“It’s all at risk,” Carol Bodeen, director of policy and outreach for the Nebraska Housing Developers Association, said of state funding for housing programs.

She said the last time the Legislature and governor committed new money for the housing funds was in 2022. Last year, the Legislature shifted $25 million from the Affordable Housing Trust Fund to put in the two workforce funds. 
State lawmakers have named affordable housing a priority, but less than a month ago the Legislature’s fiscal office confirmed Nebraska’s current two-year budget was back into a projected deficit of about $95 million.
Meanwhile, housing advocates hope philanthropy and other innovative housing programs will help fill gaps.
 ‘A win-win’ 

The Craftsman-style bungalow on Camden Avenue was the second house Metro has worked on with Holy Name, but the college’s students previously completed four similar residential projects.
Metro said 170 students were involved over the past year in creating the bungalow. The cross-section of students represented architecture, electrical, plumbing, building and construction science programs. Built in four modules, the house features a welcoming foyer with custom-built cabinets, a kitchen pantry and an open floor plan.
“Beyond the education and skills that they developed over the past year finishing the home, it’s a tangible place that can always be a source of pride for our students long after they complete their degrees at MCC,” said Andrew Henrichs, the faculty member who led the project.

Cavanaugh hopes for a continued partnership with Metro as Holy Name continues its focus on building up neighborhoods near the Fort Omaha campus.
He said Holy Name, which acts as developer and general contractor, is enthused to have fresh and creative student ideas complementing the agency’s other affordable housing models. 
“It’s a win-win,” said Cavanaugh. “It’s awesome to give students that opportunity — and we get to see a new style of house designed by their architecture program.”

Mike Flood, R-Neb., touted the news as “a message that they’re focused on strengthening the NWS for years to come.”","Nebraska U.S. Rep Mike Flood, R-Neb., during his town hall in Lincoln on Aug 4. 2025. (Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner) LINCOLN – The National Weather Service announced this month that it would hire back 450 meteorologists, hydrologists, and radar technicians after making sweeping cuts earlier in the year. 
The announcement came as the agency tries to recoup losses from the Department of Government Efficiency’s effort to reshape the federal bureaucracy. While the Weather Service faced staffing issues long before President Donald Trump’s second term, recent cuts required “urgent action,” according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 
Nebraska U.S. Rep. Mike Flood, R-Neb., touted the news as “a message that they’re focused on strengthening the NWS for years to come.”
“For decades, the National Weather Service has helped keep our communities safe with accurate and timely forecasts,” Flood said in a statement.

Flood led the push among Nebraska’s federal delegation to reverse a DOGE cut that caused a Weather Service office in the Omaha area and other Great Plains offices to pause the deployment of weather balloons in April. The station is launching two weather balloons a day, Flood has said, but the Omaha-area Weather Service office has said it still faces staffing issues. 
Retiring U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., also sent a letter to U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick expressing his concerns about the NWS cuts. The Trump administration fired roughly a combined  600 workers from both agencies earlier this year. The cuts contributed to two forecasting offices that cover some rural parts of western and southwestern Nebraska to no longer monitor local weather around-the-clock, which Nebraska and local rural weather experts said threatens public safety.
Flood has introduced bipartisan-backed legislation that would make it harder for National Weather Service employees to be fired in the future. 
“It doesn’t matter if you’re a Republican or a Democrat or an Independent,” Flood said in June. “Everybody wants accurate weather forecasting.”

Bill Lee confirmed the state will not require the Boring Company to pay for land it uses to build a series of tunnels under Nashville to the airport and other destinations.
Lee said recently final negotiations for the state’s inspection process for Boring haven’t been finalized, but he doesn’t expect the company to be required to pay for use of state property to construct tunnels. A business dubbed the “Music City Loop” is planning to use electric vehicles to ferry riders from downtown Nashville to a series of stations and the airport.
“The Boring Company’s going to do this at no cost to the state,” Lee said. “The state will give right of way for them at no cost to the Boring Company because of the enormous investment they’re making on the state’s behalf.”

The company hasn’t given an estimated cost for the project or said how much riders will be charged to use the electric vehicles.
Previously, state Sen. Becky Massey said the state would provide the right of way to Boring under state roads for tunnel construction through a long-term lease. Routes haven’t been finalized, and it’s unclear whether tunnels would go only under state routes or Metro Nashville streets as well.
The company started digging a test hole in a state-owned parking lot near the Capitol this week. Boring Company President Steve Davis previously projected the tunnel could be put into use within two years.
Facing myriad questions from skeptics of the project, as well as Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell’s office, Lee defended the proposal to reporters in a press conference, saying the Boring Company has a “history of tunnels,” mainly a Las Vegas “loop” where the company has moved 3 million passengers safely.
But the Las Vegas project has failed to live up to the projections made by Boring Company officials in 2019, when Las Vegas officials approved the project. Intended to stretch for more than 68 miles, the tunnel only runs 2.2 miles under the convention center and the company took one year to dig 1.7 miles. According to the Nevada Current, construction at that rate could take 40 years to complete the entire loop.
Nashville mayor’s office queries Boring Company about tunnel plan

Reports also show the company built tunnels without permits, dumped untreated water into storm drains and sewers and was fined $112,000 over workers’ complaints about severe burns and muck spills. Boring is contesting the violations. 
O’Connell’s office submitted about 70 questions to the Boring Company, and Lee said he believes it is answering them. The questions deal with everything from emergency responses in the proposed tunnel to maintenance, ownership and safety standards.
Lee called Boring “a highly sophisticated company” that will be required to meet safety standards to ensure the tunnel is structurally sound for transportation.
“It’s incredibly important that we do it right,” Lee said. “But it’s also an incredible opportunity for our state to have a modern, state-of-the-art transit system that will move millions of people in our city and particularly in our state, entirely at no cost to the taxpayers.”
Tennessee Democratic leaders have criticized Lee for giving the right of way to the Boring Company for a private enterprise. The company is owned by Elon Musk, the world’s richest person.

(Kevin Hardy | Stateline)BOSTON — During this year’s budget cycle, Oklahoma state Sen. John Haste said lawmakers had two major things on their minds.
“Number one was tax cuts. Number two, what the hell is going on in Washington?” he told a national gathering of state lawmakers last week in Boston.
While Oklahoma lawmakers secured another round of income tax cuts, they are still wrapping their heads around the fiscal impacts of President Donald Trump’s massive spending and tax law, Haste said. The measure slashes funding for health care and food assistance.
That legislation, and other Trump actions, proved a central theme of discussion during the National Conference of State Legislatures summit, which organizers said was the largest ever gathering of state lawmakers with more than 1,600 in attendance. Aside from cutting funding, the law imposes costly new administrative burdens on states.
States are still sorting through the long-term impacts of the legislation — and what, if any, actions they can take to soften the blow.
Haste, a Republican, said concern is highest in rural areas, where reduced Medicaid funding could threaten hospitals. He said that just one provision of the law will cut $209 million in funds that help Oklahoma cover the cost of Medicaid, and that the state will need to spend an estimated $30 million on the new cost of checking eligibility twice per year.
“All of those things added together come up to a really big number,” he said, but added: “We don’t know exactly what that is.”
Lawmakers from liberal and conservative states said they are still grappling with the implications of Trump’s signature legislation. With most states boasting solid fiscal positions, some expect to cover new up-front administrative costs by tapping into strong reserve funds. But many are considering reducing services.
Nevada state Sen. Fabian Doñate, a Democrat, said state leaders will have to cut Medicaid eligibility or services since Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo has said he will oppose any efforts to raise taxes.
“That becomes a challenge, right?” Doñate said during a panel discussion on Medicaid. “Do you cut the pregnant mom or the person that makes above 180% of the federal poverty level who’s under 50, or do you cut diapers for seniors?”
At the same time, states must gear up for new bureaucratic mandates from Washington.
“Regardless of how you feel about these provisions — whether these are opportunities or challenges, fantastic or awful — regardless, it’s going to be a heavy lift for states,” said Lauren Kallins, NCSL’s senior legislative director for state-federal affairs.
She said states and organizations, including NCSL, are still awaiting detailed federal guidance on all the changes, which are spread out over several years. But states will need to react quickly.

One provision in the law requires the 40 states plus Washington, D.C., that have expanded Medicaid to check paperwork at least twice a year to ensure those enrollees are meeting new work requirements. The legislation provided states $200 million, but experts question whether it will be enough to help states implement the changes by the end of 2026.
To meet that deadline, states will need to increase outreach to Medicaid recipients and make new investments in technology, Kallins said. Similarly, states must cover new administrative costs for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, commonly called food stamps.
Traditionally, the federal government has fully funded SNAP benefits and split administrative costs of the program with states. The new law requires states to fund 75% of administrative costs and requires some states, depending on the accuracy of their eligibility determination, to fund a portion of benefits.
“So that’s another very significant increase for states,” Kallins said.
States in a ‘very, very strong position’
Though revenue growth is slowing, lawmakers and experts pointed out that many states currently enjoy strong budget fundamentals.
That’s true in Utah, which touts deep reserve funding and a rapidly growing economy.
Jonathan Ball, Utah’s legislative fiscal analyst, told conference attendees that the state could rely on some of its reserve for one-time administrative and technical costs associated with the federal legislation.
He said lawmakers and budget writers always have to find creative ways to solve their state’s budget puzzles.
“It’s a little bit maybe scarier, but it’s not a new sort of problem,” he said. “I think you all have the tools, we feel like we have the tools to fix it.”
Still, he said the potential for further federal funding cuts has raised many questions.
“The uncertainty about what happens in the future is huge,” Ball said.
At a separate session focusing on state budgets, financial analyst Geoffrey Buswick said most states have enviable credit ratings, meaning investors can be confident in a state’s ability to pay back debts, which affords it lower interest rates.
Buswick, the managing director and sector leader for public finance at S&P Global Ratings, said states likely have the budgetary cushion to adjust to federal policy changes.
“The states are in a very, very strong position — about the strongest we’ve ever seen,” he said.
Maryland Democratic state Sen. Karen Lewis Young didn’t buy that assessment.
She said her state touts strong reserve funds, but that those can only be used for one-time expenses and not to replace eliminated funding on an ongoing basis. Maryland is facing a huge decline in federal jobs, along with federal cuts in transportation, health and education funding.
“What am I missing in your optimism?” she asked the financial analyst.
Afterward, she told Stateline that Maryland may tout a stronger position compared with other states. But she added that even with low unemployment and a high average income, the federal legislation forces difficult decisions for lawmakers, who are constitutionally mandated to balance the state budget.
“You’ve got to cut from someplace else,” she said. “If you’re losing a pretty large share of your federal match, who do you cut?”
A ‘substantial headache’
Across the country, Democratic lawmakers hope to underscore the cuts in Trump’s new law to weigh down Republicans in state races this year and next.
Hawaii Democratic state Sen. Ronald Kouchi said lawmakers need to ensure constituents understand where the spending cuts originated.
“Who’s going to be blamed when people are left out, when people are hungry and they lose out on educational opportunities?” he asked during a panel. “If we as state legislators do not convey that it is a result of the decisionmakers in Washington, D.C., they will be at our doorstep as the place of last resort.”
Kouchi, the president of the state Senate, said Hawaii leaders had socked away more than $1 billion in reserves. But he said the state cannot fill in all the financial gaps, especially during a time when officials are trying to set aside more in disaster funding and grapple with a slowdown in tourism.
“There is no current financial ability for the state to meet the needs of everyone who is currently being impacted,” he said in an interview.










We have no idea yet how we’re going to respond.


– West Virginia Republican House Speaker Roger Hanshaw


New Mexico state Rep. Meredith Dixon, a Democrat, said her state should be somewhat insulated after directing surplus oil and gas revenues into a new Medicaid Trust Fund. But she said it’s still unclear how much pressure the federal legislation will put on the state.
“We are not protected by any stretch. So we are going to have to look at how we cover those costs. … We’re still digging into everything.”
West Virginia House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, a Republican, said no one in the federal government or at the state level seemed to have a full understanding of the implications of the legislation.
“I look at this bill as Obamacare 2.0: We have to pass this bill so we can find out what’s in it,” he told Stateline.
Hanshaw said the law has some provisions that will benefit West Virginia and others that will cause a “substantial headache.”
“We have no idea yet how we’re going to respond,” he said. “I don’t want to speak for any other state … but I would speculate that’s true for nearly every other state.”

Hery McMaster leads a briefing at the South Carolina Emergency Operations Center in West Columbia on Friday, Sept. 27, 2024, after the damage caused by Tropical Storm Helene. (Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Gov. Henry McMaster authorized deploying 200 National Guard members from South Carolina to Washington to support the Trump administration’s policing of the nation’s capital.
They leave Monday.
According to McMaster’s office, his order Saturday was requested by the Pentagon.
The troops are activated under Title 32, or “federal-state status” authority, which means the federal government pays for their deployment but McMaster remains in control.
The governor said he will bring the troops back immediately if a hurricane or other natural disaster threatens the state.
“South Carolina is proud to stand with President Trump as he works to restore law and order to our nation’s capital and ensure safety for all who live, work, and visit there,” McMaster said in a statement.
The National Guard in South Carolina includes more than 9,300 Army National Guard and 1,300 Air National Guard members.
President Donald Trump asserted control of the Washington police force Aug. 11 and mobilized 800 National Guard troops after declaring a “crime emergency.”
It marked the first federal takeover since 1973, when the Home Rule Act allowed the city’s residents to elect their own mayor and city council. The law allows the president to take control when “special conditions of an emergency nature exist.” But it limits a takeover to 30 days, unless Congress passes a resolution extending the authority.
District officials sued Friday, arguing the Trump administration “far exceeded” its authority with an executive order making the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration the emergency police commissioner. In response, the Trump administration agreed to leave Washington’s police chief in charge of the city’s 3,400 officers.
But the lawsuit did not challenge Trump’s ability to deploy 800 National Guard members. Since the district is not a state, the president has sole authority over National Guard units in the capital city.
State Democratic Party Chair Christale Spain called it reckless for McMaster to send 200 troops to Washington in the middle of hurricane season.
“The gall of Henry to think so little of our friends, neighbors and loved ones as to send our heroes away during the very time they are most needed here at home is a disgusting act of betrayal,” she said in a statement Sunday.
“South Carolinians know all too well how devastating a storm can be,” she continued. “Instead of putting South Carolina first, Governor McMaster has chosen political loyalty to Donald Trump over the safety and security of the people he was elected to serve.”
State Rep. John King also questioned the deployment and its costs.
“We are told federal reimbursement will cover the expenses, but history has shown there are always hidden costs that fall back on taxpayers,” the Rock Hill Democrat wrote Sunday in a letter to McMaster also sent out in a news release.
He called the deployment “political theater.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/mcmaster-briefing-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-18 08:56:48.562036

The commission has received 39 applicants for the three open positions. The next commissioners will be selected by a consensus vote of the governor, Senate majority leader and Senate minority leader.
39 apply to serve on North Dakota Ethics Commission

Gov. Kelly Armstrong and Senate Majority Leader David Hogue are among those who have openly disagreed with the commission about the scope of its authority and some of its practices.
“I don’t think it’s a secret that I have some questions I would like answered about the role and guardrails,” Armstrong said during a Friday meeting of selection committee members.
Hogue said he also wants to know how candidates would handle so-called frivolous complaints. Some lawmakers during the legislative session said that people were weaponizing the Ethics Commission by filing baseless complaints against their political opponents.
“I’m not willing to support anybody who is not willing to dispose of non-serious complaints in short order,” Hogue said.
Senate Minority Leader Kathy Hogan, D-Fargo, suggested that the committee ask candidates if there are any broad structural changes they would like to see the commission make.

She also suggested that the selection committee ensure candidates can articulate the basic purpose and responsibilities of the commission, which she said many people misunderstand.
The selection committee said it would prepare a list of questions to send to applicants by the end of this week. After that, they would select a smaller group of candidates for the first round of interviews.
One winning applicant will finish out the term of former chair Dave Anderson, who died unexpectedly in May. That term ends in 2026.
Another will replace Commissioner Ward Koeser, whose term wraps up Aug. 31.
Commissioner Murray Sagsveen’s term also ends on Aug. 31, though he is seeking to be reappointed. Sagvseen joined the commission to fill the seat left by former Ethics Commission Chair Paul Richard, who retired last year. The commission sent a letter to the Governor’s Office supporting his reappointment.
The Ethics Commission was created through a constitutional amendment approved by voters in 2018. It’s tasked with enforcing ethical behavior in the areas of elections, lobbying, corruption and transparency.
Commissioners’ duties include adopting ethics rules, investigating alleged violations and issuing advisory opinions to help public officials navigate ethical issues. They are paid a stipend for every day they meet, plus reimbursement for travel.

Yes, the state’s economy slowed last year along with the nation. But Michigan hit some important positive milestones that threaten to be undone by President Donald Trump’s economic wrecking ball.
The number of people in the state’s labor force—nearly 5.1 million—was the highest in 23 years. And the labor force participation rate—the percentage of working-age adults employed or looking for work—returned to pre-COVID levels.
Michigan also recorded the largest number of payroll jobs in 20 years, averaging 4.5 million positions last year.
Most important, incomes rose as inflation softened and the state produced more high-wage jobs. Last year was the first year since 2020 that the average Michigan worker saw a gain in real earnings. Just 14% of jobs in the state paid $15 an hour or less, down from more than 22% in 2022.
Those numbers come from the Michigan Center for Data and Analytics, a state agency that doesn’t hesitate to publish unflattering economic data about Michigan’s economic performance.
Its annual report highlights a number of areas, including the unemployment and labor force participation rates, where Michigan lags competitor states. And the report, released in April, noted the state’s economy, while still growing, was continuing to slow in the early months of this year.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
But Trump’s chaotic implementation of tariffs and other moves by the administration could throw the state’s economy into reverse.
Detroit’s automakers have been some of the hardest-hit U.S. corporations as Trump has slapped big tariffs on almost every country in the world in an attempt to end trade deficits with the U.S. He’s tariffed countries such as Brazil and Canada where the U.S. has trade surpluses.
Ford, General Motors and Stellantis have collectively paid $2.1 billion in tariffs so far this year and expect to pay billions more by the end of 2025. They’ve largely eaten the tariffs, but analysts say they will soon have to pass a hefty chunk of those costs to consumers.
The tariffs’ hit on automakers and other employers has alarmed Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who scored a recent private meeting with Trump to discuss how the levies were hurting the Detroit Three and the state’s economy. The outcome of that meeting wasn’t disclosed, but it seems unlikely Trump will back away from what he sees as the centerpiece of his economic blueprint.
Ironically, tariffs might give some foreign automakers an advantage over the Detroit Three.
Ford Motor Co. CEO Jim Farley has complained that the 15% tariff Trump slapped on imported Japanese cars is less than the 25% tariff Detroit automakers pay on some of the vehicles and parts they import from Canada and Mexico. Trump had earlier assessed a 25% tariff on Japanese-built vehicles but lowered it as part of a broader trade agreement.
Farley told Bloomberg TV that the new tariff, combined with Japan’s lower labor and currency costs could make a Japan-built Toyota 4Runner $10,000 cheaper than a Michigan-built Ford Bronco.
Trump’s deal with Japan outraged the United Auto Workers union, which said it “hands a win to transnational automakers that rely on low-road labor practices, substandard wages, excessive (temporary workers), and union-busting.”
UAW President Shawn Fain was an early supporter of Trump’s tariff strategy, but the duties could prove costly to his members’ pocketbooks. Analysts say tariff-induced losses at the Detroit Three could cut thousands of dollars from autoworkers’ profit-sharing checks this year.
It almost seems as if Trump is rooting against the home team with his trade war.
And it’s not just automakers and large corporations that are reeling from the tariffs. Small businesses in the state are being hit as well by the levies and an overall uncertainty caused by the president’s economic policies.
A June survey of 644 small-and-medium-sized businesses, conducted by the Lansing-based Michigan Business Network, found those business owners in a gloomy mood because of tariffs, inflation and other issues.
Expectations of increases in profits, sales and investments were at their lowest points in the 16-year history of the semiannual survey, MBN founder and CEO Chris Holman said.
“We have never seen less enthusiasm by business owners for expecting increases in their revenue or profits this year because of tariffs and inflation,” Holman told Detroit Free Press business columnist and “Michigan Matters” television show host Carol Cain.
Trump, you may recall, promised to lower prices “on day one” of his administration. But inflation has remained stubbornly high.
Fewer than half of business owners surveyed said they were optimistic about how Trump’s election would favor their businesses. That’s down from 60% who were enthused about his election six months ago.
Trump has warned his sweeping economic overhaul will create a painful transition period on the way to a revitalized domestic auto industry and a “golden age of America.”
Michigan businesses and workers are feeling the pain. But they’re not so sure it’s going to subside any time soon.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/gettyimages-2208184612_0-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-18 06:56:43.885740

(Photo by Alex Kormann/Minnesota Star Tribune pool photo)In June, the assassinations of Melissa Hortman, the speaker emerita of the Minnesota House of Representatives, and her husband Mark Hortman, and the attempted murder of Minnesota State Sen. John Hoffman, his wife, Yvette, and their daughter Hope, shocked the nation.



“This isn’t just a murder case,” Acting U.S. Attorney for Minnesota, Joe Thompson told the Associated Press in July after a court hearing for 58-year-old Vance Boelter who was charged with the killing, “This is a political assassination.”





Beyond the headlines, Boelter may have a singular place in the history of bombings, arsons and assassinations that have marked the era of legal abortion in the United States: He is (allegedly) the first to kill a public official.
When Boelter was indicted on federal charges (to which he has pleaded not guilty), The New York Times reported, “Nothing revealed by the prosecutors suggests that the shooter was motivated by religious fervor.” The Times offered no other motive, but Boelter’s past, and his own words, point to a likely religious motive — like those of every other anti-abortion assassin.
The rest of us needn’t turn a blind eye to the obvious. In fact, the preservation of democracy in our time requires that we don’t.
Available evidence suggests that Boelter was thwarted early in a campaign he had been planning for as much as two years — to assassinate pro-choice Democratic elected officials, abortion providers and abortion rights advocates. No other professions or viewpoints have surfaced from among the 45-70 names reported in various media to have been found in his car and in other of his writings.
In addition to Hortman and Hoffman, the list includes other Minnesota state and federal legislators as well as U.S. Representatives from Illinois, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, Texas and Wisconsin. It also included Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan and Attorney General Keith Ellison, along with former Minnesota State Rep. Ruth Richardson, now president of Planned Parenthood of the North Central States.
  In this handout provided by Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office, Vance Luther Boelter poses for a booking photo on June 16, 2025 in Green Isle, Minnesota.
Boelter was identified by police when he had to abandon his car at the murder scene. He was on the lam for several days before he was arrested near his home in Green Isle, a town of 556 in rural Sibley County.
Academy for the End Times
The key part of Boelter’s religious history is his attendance at Christ for the Nations Institute (CFNI) in Dallas, Texas, from 1988-1990. He graduated with a Diploma in Practical Theology in Leadership and Pastoral. The school, founded in 1970, is best known for training missionaries, and for its founder Gordon Lindsay who was part of the Pentecostal Latter Rain movement, which was inspired by William Branham in 1948 in Canada. Lindsay founded the ministry Voice of Healing that year to promote Branham’s work. As Kari Lardner reported in Religion Dispatches, they were also part of the British Israelism movement:


        According to this movement, White people were the true Israel of the Bible, a belief that was pivotal to the mid-century Latter Rain revival Lindsay helped organize … In fact, Branham had been ordained into ministry by the National Imperial Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, and Lindsay had strong connections with white-supremacist networks throughout North America.    
 
Lindsay later distanced himself from Branham because of his violent antisemitic views, “though it’s unclear,” Lardner writes, “whether Lindsay ever actually recanted his views on British Israelism.” The Christian Identity movement in the U.S. informs some of the most violent white supremacist groups.
Lindsay’s post-Branham ministry became an early training school for the formation of apostolic networks — a feature of what came to be called the New Apostolic Reformation.
End Times war in the here and now
As I reported last year in Barn Raiser, the term New Apostolic Reformation (NAR) was coined in the 1990s by the late C. Peter Wagner, a professor at Fuller Theological Seminary. He and his colleagues had observed that Pentecostal and charismatic churches that operate outside of denominational structures, were the fastest growing sector of Christianity in the United States and worldwide. In this movement, Wagner saw a trend, an emerging new paradigm, that he and his close associates eventually sought to shape, organize and lead.
The NAR movement comprises loosely organized, often international networks of independent or nondenominational churches and ministries. NAR leaders believe that Christian institutions have mostly gotten it wrong for the last 2,000 years. They have sought to replace historically democratic church governance in Protestant churches with what they call “apostolic governance.” They are trying to do the same in government. To achieve this, they seek the restoration of modern-day apostles and prophets and the church of the first century, as they imagine it.
The NAR vision draws on beliefs and practices from earlier religious movements, such as Latter Rain, as well as Christian Reconstructionism, which emerged from Calvinism and helped shape the theocratic trend of the Christian Right in the 1980s and 1990s, and has become prominent in the persons of Idaho pastor Doug Wilson and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.
The NAR is spearheading an increasingly politicized movement that seeks religious and political “dominion” in the U.S. and the world. In the view of Latter Rain/NAR, many existing churches, church offices and doctrines are obstacles to advancing of the kingdom of God on Earth. In a guest sermon when he was a missionary in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Boelter’s prophecy that God will send apostles and prophets to correct the churches is consistent with this idea.
C. Peter Wagner called this obstacle the “spirit of religion.” Some apostolic leaders express this idea forcefully. Apostle Greg Hood of Franklin, Tennessee, for example, sells a T-shirt emblazoned with the quote: “We are here to put a knife to the throat of religion.”
These movements generally see themselves as part of an emerging global army engaged in an End Times war. The theater of this war is first a matter of “spiritual warfare” — organized collective prayer against demonic forces in heaven and on Earth. But important apostolic leaders warn that the theater of the war may expand — and become physical at any time.
This final force features the rise of what is variously called the “Manifest Sons of God” and “Joel’s Army” — an elite mobilization of Christians who will acquire supernatural powers and ultimately defeat Satanic forces. Accounts vary as to exactly how and when these things will unfold. But many believe it is already underway.
Heroes know which villains to kill
There’s a relationship between “spiritual warfare” and physical warfare. NAR leaders increasingly refer to Democrats, liberals, feminists and LGBTQ+ people — basically anyone with a different political, religious or gender identity — as demonic, and blame them for society’s problems. There are potential consequences for this kind of thinking.
“Social science since World War 2 and the Nazi genocide has shown that under specific conditions, virulent demonization and scapegoating can and does create milieus in which the potential for violence is increased,” Chip Berlet, a former longtime researcher with Political Research Associates, wrote in 2014. “What social science cannot do, is predict which individual upon hearing the rhetoric of clear or coded incitement will turn to violence.”
Berlet’s essay was titled “Heroes Know Which Villains to Kill: How Coded Rhetoric Incites Scripted Violence.” Indeed, villain identification has been going on for a long time, and NAR leaders have been increasingly featuring scripts for contemporary violence and religious war.
Prosecutors are so far saying Boelter acted alone. However, scholars report that those said to be “lone wolves” rarely, if ever, act entirely alone. Thus, it was intriguing when Boelter texted his family while he was on the lam: “Dad went to war last night … I don’t wanna say more because I don’t wanna implicate anybody.” Given that NAR leaders understand themselves to be in a war with secular government and other established institutions, it would not be surprising if it turns out that Boelter is not a lone vigilante warrior.
Boelter’s war
Boelter apparently kept his violent intentions to himself over the months, and perhaps as long as two years of planning his assassination campaign.
His friends have described him as religiously and politically conservative, but reserved about it.
He was less reserved while serving as a missionary in the Democratic Republic of the Congo between 2021 and 2023, where he is known to have given three sermons at La Borne Matadi, a Pentecostal church in the Atlantic seaport city of Matadi, in which he expressed views consistent with NAR thought.
In one sermon Boelter preached:


        They don’t know abortion is wrong, many churches. They don’t have the gifts flowing. God gives the body gifts. To keep balance. Because when the body starts moving in the wrong direction, when they’re one, and accepting the gifts, God will raise an apostle or prophet to correct their course.    
 
When Boelter speaks here of the body, he is evidently referencing the Body of Christ, meaning the church. In the general Latter Rain/NAR view, the Body of Christ is being transformed into an End Times army, led by apostles and prophets. Boelter added:


        God is going to raise up apostles and prophets in America, to correct his church. … Many churches in America didn’t listen to Jesus. … They’re divided. This little group here, this little group here, this little group here. … And the enemy, the devil, comes through and rips everything apart. The churches are so messed up, they don’t know abortion is wrong, many churches.    
 
In another sermon, he tells the audience that “people don’t know what sex they are” because the devil “has gotten so far into their mind and their soul.”
The idea of God sending apostles and prophets to “correct his church” is significant because of the Latter Rain/NAR idea that traditional Christian denominations, doctrines, and officers are seen as obstacles to advancing the Kingdom of God as they see it.
Diversity, equity and inclusion
CFNI (Christ for the Nations Institute) has remained a key institution in the NAR movement. Dutch Sheets, a leading apostle, graduated from CFNI and later became its executive director. According to Matthew D. Taylor of the Institute for Islamic, Christian, and Jewish Studies, “No Christian leader did more to mobilize Christians to be in DC on January 6th than Dutch Sheets,” who Taylor says helped develop “strategic-level spiritual warfare programs to mobilize charismatic evangelicals to do spiritual warfare on Trump’s behalf.” Apostle Cindy Jacobs — who helped develop the NAR’s distinct style of intercessory prayer and was present at the Capitol on January 6 guiding the nation in prayer — teaches at the Institute where she received an award in 2025. That said, this doesn’t necessarily mean that everyone involved in CFNI believes exactly the same things. What’s more, like NAR itself, CFNI’s student body has always been multiracial, multiethnic and multinational, its roots in Latter Rain/British Israelism notwithstanding.
And in fairness, the institutions with which Boelter has been affiliated have denounced and distanced themselves from his alleged crimes. These include Christ for the Nations Institute, La Borne Matadi (the Congolese Pentecostal church where he gave several sermons) and Jordan Family Church in Jordan, Minnesota, a town of 5,000, 40-miles southwest of Minneapolis where he is a member. Since Boelter’s arrest, his church has removed its sermons from the web.
It is also important to note that while Boelter’s acts may not represent those organizations, nor of the broad conservative, anti-abortion wing of Christianity, they are definitely not representative of Christianity at large. In fact, mainstream polling consistently shows that many American Christians, including most Catholics, are pro-choice. What’s more, leading denominations of mainline Protestantism have been officially pro-choice since the 1970s. These include The Episcopal Church, United Church of Christ and Presbyterian Church (USA).
Nevertheless, the religious origins of Boelter’s alleged criminal, and arguably revolutionary, mission is clear, even as some tiptoe around it. This squeamishness is typical when Christianity of any kind informs the motives of violent criminal suspects. We can assume, however, that law enforcement, politicians and the media would have been far less demure if Boelter was a Muslim.
The past is prologue
There is precedent for an anti-abortion hit list that includes government officials. Two decades ago, a web site called the Nuremberg Files listed abortion providers alongside pro-choice celebrities, government officials from both parties and federal judges, including members of the U.S. Supreme Court.
It was named for the city where the German war crimes trials were held after World War II. Site proprietor, the late Neal Horsley explained, “A coalition of concerned citizens throughout the USA is cooperating in collecting dossiers on abortionists in anticipation that one day we may be able to hold them on trial for crimes against humanity.”
Originally, the Nuremberg Files listed only abortion providers, but the list grew to comprise several hundred others who were called “abortionists” because of their political support for reproductive rights or their efforts to enforce the law to protect women needing an abortion.
“Judges and politicians who pass or uphold laws authorizing child-killing or oppressing pro-life activists: These classes of individuals,” among others, Horsley declared, “are all committing various crimes to which they should answer. We regard them all as ‘abortionists.’ ”
The site was regarded as a hit list after he began crossing out the names of murdered doctors and clinic staff after their demise; and graying the names of those who were wounded.
Pointing to the crossed-out name Dr. Barnett Slepian on his computer screen in one scene in the 2001 HBO documentary “Soldiers in the Army of God,” Horsley recalled his reaction to the murder: “When I drew a line through his name, I said ‘See, I told ya. There’s another one. How many more is it gonna take?’ ”
“The evidence is at hand,” Horsley declares. “There are people out there who [will] go out and blow their brains out.”
As I reported for Salon at the time, Horsley was involved in the Army of God, the largely underground network in whose name antiabortion violence had been carried out since the early 1980s.
In an essay titled “Understanding the Army of God,” Horsley described the enemy as a culture and a country that have fallen away from God’s laws. He therefore saw the Army of God as holy warriors engaged in “terrorist actions” because “the government of the USA has become a godless and apostate body.” Therefore, he declared, “the people who rise up in arms against such idolatry deserve the name ‘The Army of God.’ ”
The Army of God splintered in the wake of a wave of arrests, prosecutions and a massive monetary judgement by a federal court against some of its leaders. Its website is currently under construction but promises to be back. One feature of the site is a list of people incarcerated for their anti-abortion crimes, called Prisoners of Christ. It would not be surprising to see Boelter added to the list when the site is relaunched.
In any case, the idea that the government has fallen away from God’s laws and needs to be overthrown, lives on. Boelter’s inclusion of elected officials on his hit list suggests that he shares Horsley’s view of the complicity of government and government officials in abortion and tolerance of homosexuality.
Like all other known anti-abortion assassins, Boelter’s Christianity informed his alleged crimes. Here are three of his predecessors.

James Kopp assassinated abortion provider Dr. Barnett Slepian at his home in Amherst New York in 1998. Slepian had just returned from his synagogue where he had said kaddish in remembrance of his father. Kopp was a member of the itinerant Catholic-led antiabortion group, Lambs of Christ. He is also a suspect in a series of shootings across Canada.
Paul Hill assassinated abortion provider Dr. John Britton in Pensacola, Florida in 1994. Hill was an ordained minister in the evangelical Presbyterian Church in America (later defrocked) and was a graduate of Reformed Theological Seminary in Jackson, Mississippi.
Scott Roeder assassinated abortion provider Dr. George Tiller while he served as an usher during Sunday service at his Lutheran church in Wichita, Kansas in 2009. Roeder had no known previous antiabortion involvements. However, at his sentencing he read aloud from a book by Paul Hill titled, “Why Shoot an Abortionist?”

What is different about Boelter is that while abortion providers were also on the hit list, like Neal Horsley, he targeted elected officials as well. This suggests that when he texted his family that “dad’s gone to war,” his war was not just with abortion care, but the system of government that allows and protects it. Special Agent in Charge Alvin M. Winston, Sr., of FBI Minneapolis, correctly characterized Boelter’s alleged crimes “an attack on the rule of law.”
Others who have committed violence against abortion providers have held to revolutionary theocratic views of various sorts, but Boelter was allegedly the first to strike government officials. He may not be the last.

Santiago/Getty Images)BILOXI, Miss. — The Trump administration is developing a powerful data tool it claims will let states identify noncitizens registered to vote. But Democratic critics and data experts warn it could allow the federal government to vacuum up vast quantities of information on Americans for unclear purposes.
Some Democratic election officials and opponents of the effort fear President Donald Trump wants to build a federal database of voters to target political opponents or cherry-pick rare examples of noncitizen voters to fuel a sense of crisis. Republican election officials allied with the president counter that he’s helping states to maintain accurate voter rolls.
The Trump administration has rolled out changes to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, tool at the same time the U.S. Department of Justice is asking states for copies of their voter rolls. The timing, combined with questions about what happens to voter data uploaded to the program, has alarmed critics.
Trump wants Congress to pass a national proof of citizenship voter registration requirement and in March tried to unilaterally impose one for federal elections through executive order. But with the legislation stalled and the order halted by the courts, the citizenship data tool may offer a backdoor way to accomplish the same goal.
SAVE was originally intended to help state and local officials verify the immigration status of individual noncitizens seeking government benefits. But U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, this spring refashioned it into a platform that can scan states’ voter rolls if election officials upload the data.
The changes to SAVE, rolled out over just a few months and with little public debate, are “tinkering with sort of the bones of democracy,” said John Davisson, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington, D.C.-based research and advocacy group that argues privacy is a fundamental right.
“You’re talking about the voting process and who will be eligible to vote,” Davisson said. “And to take a system that is not designed for use in that process and repurpose it, really on the fly, without a formal comment process, without formal rulemaking, without congressional intervention — that’s pretty anomalous and pretty alarming.”
Previously, SAVE could only search one name at a time. Now it can conduct bulk searches, allowing state officials to potentially feed into it information on millions of registered voters. SAVE checks that information against a series of federal databases and reports back whether it can verify someone’s immigration status.
Since May, it also can draw upon Social Security data, transforming the program into a tool that can confirm citizenship because Social Security records for many, but not all, Americans include the information. NPR reported earlier on changes to SAVE.
“It is incredible what has been done, really since March,” Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray, a Republican who supports proof of citizenship requirements and the SAVE tool, told a gathering of state secretaries of state in Biloxi, Mississippi, last week.
Individuals registering to vote in federal elections must already sign a statement affirming they are citizens under penalty of perjury, and those who cast a ballot face criminal penalties and deportation. One study of the 2016 election placed the prevalence of noncitizen voting at 0.0001% of votes cast.
But as Trump has spread falsehoods about elections, Republicans have made purging noncitizens from voter rolls a central focus.

Democratic concerns were on display last week at the National Association of Secretaries of State conference, held at the Beau Rivage casino-resort in Biloxi. In interviews on the sidelines of the conference, Democratic secretaries of state voiced deep reservations — or outright opposition — about plugging their voter data into SAVE.
Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said Aug. 6 that the federal government appeared to be trying to take over election administration. She formally rejected the Justice Department’s voter roll request two days later.
Bellows said the Department of Homeland Security told her in a recent phone call that it planned to retain SAVE data for 10 years for “audit purposes only.”
“Just like the [Justice Department] is asking us to hand over an electronic file of all the voters in our state, it seems like the Department of Homeland Security is through this backdoor system also asking us to share voter information about every voter in our state,” Bellows said.
At least one state appears to have granted the federal government sweeping authority over any voter data it provides to SAVE.
Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales announced in July he had reached an agreement with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to access the newly expanded system for voter list maintenance. Indiana’s agreement allows the federal agency to use information the state provides for any purpose permitted by law, including criminal prosecutions.
Morales, a Republican, said in a news release that SAVE represented “another step in safeguarding the rights” of eligible voters. His office didn’t respond to Stateline’s questions.
The Trump administration has ramped up efforts to encourage state election officials to use the expanded program. The White House hosted a bipartisan “fly in” event for state secretaries of state on July 29. Multiple secretaries of state told Stateline that USCIS Director Joseph Edlow, who was confirmed on July 15, spoke at the event.
“The president is very much keyed in on voter list maintenance,” Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, a Republican, said in an interview — echoing other GOP secretaries of state who released statements praising the Trump administration after the meeting.
Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, a Democrat who attended the meeting, said he questioned how the federal government would handle voter information provided to SAVE. He added that the Justice Department’s request for his state’s voter rolls raised his level of concern about how data would be used.
“When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances,” Simon told Stateline.
The White House referred questions about SAVE and the event to the Department of Homeland Security and USCIS.
In response to questions from Stateline, USCIS didn’t directly answer whether the agency would share voter roll data with other parts of the federal government but confirmed it disposes of records after 10 years.
“The SAVE application is a critical tool for state and local governments to access information to safeguard the integrity of elections across the country. It’s no wonder many states have quickly adopted it, and we continue to promote the tool to other states and counties not using SAVE,” USCIS spokesperson Matthew Tragesser said in a statement.
“We look forward to continued optimization efforts and implementing more updates to SAVE.”
GOP pressure
Some Republican election officials and Trump allies have long wanted the federal government to take an expanded role in searching state voter rolls for noncitizens.
Last summer the Trump-aligned litigation group America First Legal, co-founded by Trump adviser Stephen Miller, encouraged states to submit to the Department of Homeland Security the names of individuals for citizenship or immigration status verification.
Some states did just that. Texas, for example, asked USCIS to verify the citizenship of some voters in September, and Indiana asked the agency to verify 585,774 voters in October. The same month, 16 Republican state attorneys general signed a letter criticizing Homeland Security, then under the Biden administration, for failing to work with states on verification.
After Trump took office, GOP state officials kept up the pressure. Twenty-one Republican secretaries of state urged Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in February to prioritize SAVE improvements.
On April 16, Indiana sued the department in federal court for not responding to its verification request last fall. USCIS announced an overhaul of SAVE less than a week later.
As the agency continues to remake SAVE, the tool will soon allow searches using the last four digits of a Social Security number, multiple state secretaries of state told Stateline. The agency confirmed the feature is under development and will be available soon but didn’t provide an exact date.
The change would mark another significant expansion of the program because most states collect the last four digits when individuals without a driver’s license register to vote.
Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican, said SAVE represents a better way to verify citizenship than a state law requiring voters to produce documents. “I think there’s a real opportunity for us to do a lot of this through just sharing of information and I think that’s what we’re seeing happen,” McGrane said in an interview.
Unreliable data
But some voting rights advocates and experts on government data caution against an overreliance on Social Security data.
The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, a progressive policy nonprofit, has noted that Social Security only began tracking the citizenship status of all applicants in 1978 — meaning the database doesn’t include comprehensive citizenship information for older Americans. Additionally, Social Security may not always have up-to-date information on the status of naturalized U.S. citizens.
The nonpartisan Institute for Responsive Government also warned in May that since SAVE hasn’t used Social Security numbers to verify citizenship in the past, its accuracy and effectiveness are unknown. The success of the expanded SAVE program may also partially depend on whether it has adequate staff and resources, it said.
A 2017 Government Accountability Office report found that between fiscal years 2012 and 2016, about 16% of the nearly 90 million SAVE searches required additional verification, which the institute says often translates into federal workers manually checking files. Now that SAVE allows bulk searches, the need for manual checking could rise dramatically.
Nick Doctor, director of implementation at the Institute for Responsive Government, said in an interview that a tool confirming the eligibility of registered voters in a way that doesn’t burden individuals can be a good thing. But he emphasized that it depends in large measure on SAVE’s implementation.
“The changes that have been made to SAVE happened very quickly and, to my knowledge, we haven’t seen releases on the level of accuracy of that information,” Doctor said.
During interviews, Republican secretaries of state stressed that voters aren’t kicked off the rolls because SAVE can’t verify their citizenship. Instead, an inability to verify would likely trigger a follow-up process with the voter.
“Just because we get something back from the SAVE database, it’s not a cut and dry, especially on those they’re not sure about,” Hoskins, the Missouri secretary of state, said.
Election security or overkill?
Still, Arizona illustrates why some Democrats worry about any large-scale effort to ask voters — especially longtime, older residents — to prove their citizenship. After the state discovered errors in how it tracked voter citizenship dating back years, election officials are contacting some 200,000 voters seeking proof of citizenship documentation.
Some have been casting ballots for decades without incident and many feel targeted, Arizona Democratic Secretary of State Adrian Fontes said during a presentation at the state secretaries of state conference. “They feel insulted when they get that letter,” Fontes said.
Charles Stewart III, a professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies elections, said Arizona may actually point to the potential usefulness of SAVE. If Arizona runs its voter roll through the program, a list of 200,000 voters needing citizenship verification would perhaps drop into the hundreds, he suggested.
“There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside,” Stewart said.
Connecticut Democratic Secretary of State Stephanie Thomas told Stateline that every secretary wants tools to keep voter lists as clean as possible. But the details are important.
When she hears of something new, Thomas said she asks whether it’s the best option available and whether “the i’s are dotted, the t’s crossed.” She said she’s asked USCIS a series of questions about SAVE and is waiting on some responses.
“When it comes to voter lists,” Thomas said, “I don’t want Connecticut voters to be a guinea pig.”

The Town of Mason’s Board of Mayor […],"Attendees at Tuesday's meeting of the Mason, Tennessee Board of Mayor and Alderman look on from seats in the non- air conditioned  Mason Fire Department Garage. (John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)The American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee is challenging the outcome of a vote in Mason that would enter the city into a detention facility contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
The organization sent a letter to town officials Friday demanding that Mason leadership halt the contract’s execution.
The Town of Mason’s Board of Mayor and Aldermen approved a contract with private prison corporation CoreCivic to reopen the West Tennessee Detention Facility as an immigration detention center on Tuesday, voting 4-1 with two abstentions.
The town’s separate but related contract with ICE received three ayes, two nays, and two abstentions. 
Questions over the vote’s outcome surfaced immediately after the chaotic meeting concluded. Some officials reported that the vote was successful in approving the ICE contract, claiming the abstentions did not count toward the vote total and therefore the vote passed 3-2, a simple majority of the votes counted (but not the number of members present).
West Tenn. town approves CoreCivic to run immigration detention facility after chaotic meeting

But the ACLU says this is an error, according to the letter sent to the town’s mayor, recorder and an attorney who spoke on behalf of the municipality during Tuesday’s meeting. The organization stated that, according to the town’s charter, the vote should have been counted based on members present. Thus, it would need four votes out of seven total votes to pass.
“The Town of Mason Charter says any form of board action should be passed by a majority of members present if there is a quorum,” ACLU of Tennessee Policy Director Bryan Davidson said Friday. The charter also states that the board can determine its own rules, and has chosen to follow Robert’s Rules of Order.
Based on the charter, state law and Robert’s Rules, the ACLU said the contract was not approved.
“We do not believe that this contract passed, and therefore any action taken by the mayor and board of the Town of Mason to further the execution of this contract is illegal and it’s invalid,” Davidson said.
Mayor Eddie Noeman, City Recorder Lureatha Harris, and attorney Nathan Bicks could not be immediately reached for comment.
The ACLU also states that because the start date of the contract with CoreCivic is dependent on the start date of the ICE contract, the CoreCivic agreement is also void.
ACLU Tennessee Legal Director Stella Yarbrough requested a written response from town leadership within seven days of the letter’s receipt. The organization also included a request for all communication between the mayor and board members and representatives of both CoreCivic and ICE, beginning in November 2024 through present day.
“Zooming out from the procedural deficiencies, there’s a lot of questions here around the total lack of transparency in this process,” Davidson added.
The ICE contract, a 200-page document, was presented to board members as a physical copy immediately before the Tuesday vote, he said, and was not available for public review online until two days later.
The majority of people who spoke at Tuesday’s meeting opposed using the currently empty prison facility as an immigration detention center.
Eloise Thompson, whose family has roots in Mason and surrounding areas going back to the 1870s, was one of the residents to stand in opposition.
“We’re just absolutely not interested in a for-profit prison operation … at the expense of human suffering,” she said on a media call Friday. “Not only does it come down to the human suffering part, it really can eat at one’s soul to feel a part of something like that.”
The community in Mason is interested in economic growth, she said, but “moving forward in the right way and in the way that lifts those around us and lifts our community.”

(Courtesy photo)Advertisements promoting the abortion pill will be at gas stations across West Virginia and Kentucky over the next few weeks. 
Mayday Health, a New York-based health education nonprofit, will run the ads at 104 rural gas stations through Sept. 7. The campaign started Aug. 11. 
The advertisements say “Pregnant? Don’t want to be? Learn more at Mayday Health.”
Executive director Liv Raisner said it’s crucial to advertise at gas stations, which serve as community hubs in rural areas.
“Many rural counties in West Virginia and Kentucky have few or no OB-GYN providers. Some have lost their only hospitals, their only clinics,” Raisner said. “So routine education and preventative reproductive health information is much harder to access through traditional medical channels. And so that’s why we decided to advertise at gas stations.”
The organization started after the Supreme Court overturned Roe V. Wade and the constitutional right to abortion in 2022.
“We heard this sobering statistic that only 10% of Americans even knew what abortion pills were,” Raisner said. “And with clinics closed, reproductive options became very limited for women across the United States. We knew that a massive education campaign needed to be executed to inform people that they still have options.”
According to the Guttmacher Institute, in 2023, medication abortion accounted for 63% of all abortions in the United States, up from 53% in 2020. 
In 2022, West Virginia lawmakers passed a law banning abortion with narrow exceptions. Earlier this summer, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the ban in a challenge brought by abortion pill manufacturer GenBioPro. 
Despite abortion being illegal in West Virginia in most cases, Raisner said the organization does not fear legal repercussions from the campaign. 
“We don’t have concerns about advertising because we don’t sell, distribute or package abortion pills,” they said. “We’re merely spreading First Amendment-protected free speech. So if anyone wants to come after us, what they’re coming after is the First Amendment.”
Earlier this year, Mayday Health launched a digital billboard and poster campaign in Tennessee and an aerial campaign above the Indy 500.
While abortion is mostly illegal in West Virginia, states with abortion bans may have trouble prosecuting out-of-state providers and entities mailing pills to people within their borders.
Since the Supreme Court struck down Roe V. Wade, 22 states and Washington D.C. have enacted shield laws that protect patients, providers and people assisting in abortion from the reach of states where it’s illegal, according to KFF. Some shield laws protect providers who send abortion pills to people in states with abortion bans. 
Earlier this year, the West Virginia Senate passed a bill aimed at out-of-state providers that would have made it a felony to prescribe or distribute medications used for abortion to people in West Virginia unless the abortion is legal. The bill was not taken up by the House of Delegates. 
West Virginia Attorney General J.B. McCuskey recently signed on to a letter urging Congress to ban shield laws, calling them “blatant attempts to interfere with states’ ability to enforce criminal laws within their borders.”
“People in [states with abortion bans] should be and are empowered to make their own decisions,” Raisner said. 
The website directs people to sites where they can order abortion medication.
People who visit Mayday Health are also linked to a helpline where they can get free, private advice on state specific abortion laws, they said. The group encourages website visitors to reach out to a hotline where a group of doctors provide free advice. 
Raisner said it’s also important for people to know that abortion pills are safe and effective. 
“There’s so much misinformation peddled by the anti-choice movement about the dangers of abortion pills, and it’s just not true,” Raisner said. “Abortion pills are so safe that they are even sold over the counter in some foreign countries. 
“Clinics are closing across the country, but people everywhere still have the power to make the choices that are right for their reproductive health,” they said.

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)As historic drought conditions on the Western Slope fuel another dangerous wildfire season, a new paper from researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder warns that human-caused climate change is playing a major role in making those conditions worse.
Previously published climatological research has found that the Colorado River Basin’s current “megadrought” is the worst dry spell the region has experienced in at least 1,200 years. But a new study, published last week in the journal Nature,  concludes that those persistently dry conditions are being driven by human activity “more intensely — and more directly — than previously understood,” its authors say.
Jeremy Klavans and Pedro DiNezio of CU Boulder’s Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences worked with other scientists from around the country to model how global climate patterns affect rainfall across the U.S. southwest.

Their findings concern a climate pattern known as the Pacific decadal oscillation. Related to the better-known El Niño-La Niña cycle to the south, the PDO is a natural fluctuation that brings warm water to the northeastern Pacific Ocean near the U.S. West Coast during its “positive” phase, leading to more storms and higher-than-average rainfall. During its “negative” phase, however, cooler water and air temperatures result in less precipitation in Western states.
Despite typically reversing itself every one or two decades, the PDO has been “stuck” in the negative, dry phase since the 1990s. By analyzing more than 500 climate model simulations developed by climatologists around the world, the study’s authors were able to paint the clearest picture yet of the influence of human activity on the PDO, and the resulting Southwestern megadrought.
“All of them had this common signal when we averaged them together,” DiNezio said in an interview. “By having so many simulations, we could be absolutely sure that this was not an artifact of a single model, or of a subset of simulations.”
Severe drought conditions have persisted in the Colorado River Basin since 2000, putting increased stress on the water supplies relied on by about 40 million people in Colorado and six other Western states. Water levels in two key reservoirs, Lake Mead and Lake Powell, have fallen to record lows in recent years.










What's important here is that we're showing that rainfall has also been influenced by humans, in addition to just evaporation ... Both contribute to drought.

Rising levels of greenhouse gases, mostly the result of fossil-fuel combustion, have caused much of western Colorado and neighboring states in the Colorado River’s Upper Basin to warm by an average of more than 4 degrees Fahrenheit above pre-industrial levels, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration data.
Prior research has attributed about 40% of the post-2000 megadrought to higher temperatures alone, as hotter weather leads to greater evaporation of moisture from water surfaces and soils. Modeling global warming’s precise impacts on rainfall patterns has proved more elusive, but DiNezio said the new research “add(s) more human influence to that previous number.”
“What’s important here is that we’re showing that rainfall has also been influenced by humans, in addition to just evaporation,” he said. “Both contribute to drought.”
Colorado and other states that are parties to the 103-year-old Colorado River Compact have negotiated for years over how to distribute the cuts to water use made necessary by the basin’s ongoing drought. The federal Bureau of Reclamation on Friday announced another year of reduced water allocations for the Lower Basin states of Arizona and Nevada.
Not long ago, the possibility that the Pacific decadal oscillation would eventually reverse itself offered hope that the long-term drought outlook for the U.S. Southwest wasn’t as bad as it seemed. Instead, evidence now suggests the last two decades are the region’s “new normal.”
“I was a Ph.D. student in 2012, and there was a consensus that eventually (the PDO) was going to flip,” DiNezio. “We had a big El Niño in 2015, and there was this idea that El Niño will flip the PDO back to the opposite, rainfall-producing phase. And we had that big El Niño event, and the PDO remained stuck. We just had an El Niño event in 2023 … and (it) also didn’t flip the PDO.”
“That’s the most important implication of  our findings,” he added. “That this drought is here to stay, unless we we do something about rising temperatures and global warming.”

(Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)In the quiet corners of Idaho — Bonner and Boundary counties — where neighbors wave from passing cars and acknowledging neighbors still matters, something unsettling has taken root. The handshake, once a symbol of trust, is now shadowed by ideological scorecards. A new playbook is unfolding, and the rules are being written in rooms most Idahoans will never enter.
The stories of Republicans Rep. Mark Sauter and Sen. Jim Woodward are not isolated tales of political contest. They are warnings. Warnings of what happens when conscience is punished, and control becomes the highest value.
 Manufactured dissent and the illusion of betrayal

Take the Bonner County Republican Central Committee’s vote of no confidence in Sauter. Was it about performance? Principle? Or was it a choreographed act of party purification— a signal to those who think for themselves that deviation will be punished?
Sauter supported education funding, common-sense health care provisions, and resisted attempts to censor libraries. Woodward stood firm on abortion exceptions, budget transparency and a consistent approach to civic policy. Yet both were vilified. Not by the general public, but by operatives who frame moderation as betrayal.
“This is not about public service — it’s about ideological obedience.”
 The machinery behind the message

These attacks don’t form in daylight. They emerge from back rooms and obscure donor rolls. The Idaho Freedom Foundation and its affiliate Idaho Freedom Action function as ideological enforcers — not just issuing policy positions, but publishing scorecards, endorsing primary challengers and drowning elections in hyperbole.
Behind them stand shadow networks like Donors Trust and the State Policy Network — national groups that shield billionaire backers and fund far-right campaigns across the country. Their goal isn’t better Idaho policy. It’s control. If a candidate like Sauter or Woodward won’t follow the script, the machine finds someone who will — and funds them to the hilt.
I call that “dark money governance,” and that’s exactly what it is — unelected influence in a state that prides itself on sovereignty.
 Ideology over Idaho

The talking points? “Freedom.” “Choice.” “Constitutional conservatism.” But the actions tell another story — defunding public education, dismantling social services and redirecting taxpayer dollars to private interests.
Scott Herndon’s campaign against Woodward was a case study in distortion: twisting nuanced votes into political grenades, vilifying civility as weakness. Now the same tactics are being aimed at Sauter: cherry-picked votes framed as betrayals, balanced decisions distorted into dogma.
In past editorials on political extremism I called this what it truly is: “ideological colonization.” The scripts aren’t written in Idaho — they’re imported.
 The cost of conscience

And still, these men stand. Woodward didn’t hide from his critics — he met them, clarified his views and continued serving. Sauter ran without the local GOP’s endorsement — and won. Neither man surrendered principle for praise.
They remind us of what governance used to mean: showing up, listening, deciding with care. It isn’t always flashy, but it’s real. It’s Idaho.
As it has been said before, “Leadership isn’t loud — it’s loyal to the people, not the platform.”
 A call to clarity

Idaho now faces a choice. Not between left and right, but between reality and rhetoric. Will we elevate those who serve quietly and thoughtfully? Or will we hand the reins to operatives who answer only to distant donors and unforgiving dogma?
The attacks on Mark Sauter and Jim Woodward are more than politics — they are philosophical ruptures. We must decide whether our communities deserve representatives who think and feel — or only those who comply.
Let us not confuse volume with virtue. The loudest voices may not speak for the people — they may speak for the strings being pulled behind them.
And in that clarity, we just might reclaim the Idaho we know.

(Photo: Cassandra Stephenson)West Tennessee Healthcare is piloting a new technology that uses artificial intelligence to help case managers prevent patients from being kept in the hospital longer than necessary.
The nonprofit health care system will test Dragonfly Navigate, a product designed by Franklin-based AI technology company Xsolis to streamline administrative decisions between a patient’s hospital admission and discharge.
West Tennessee Healthcare serves around half a million West Tennesseans, including residents in rural areas, and began construction of a new Bolivar Hospital in July. WTH has used other Xsolis products since 2022. 
The new workflow technology uses artificial intelligence (AI) and real-time data from the hospital to model whether a patient can be discharged and where they should go after leaving the hospital (a skilled nursing facility, home, or to long-term care, for example).
“When a patient is in the hospital longer than what the model is predicting, then it alerts the (case manager) to go back into the case to look to see what’s stopping the patient from being discharged,” Xsolis CEO and founder Joan Butters said.
Barriers can include uncompleted testing, X-rays, treatments, doctor signatures and more. The workflow technology aims to help case managers quickly identify these needs without manually combing through clinical data and documentation.
“Our models are not meant to replace the clinical determination or the clinical expertise of the people that are using our solutions,” Butters said. “We are simply ensuring that they can get to that answer more efficiently.”

Debbie Ashworth, executive director of care management for West Tennessee Healthcare, said in a statement that the workflow will complement clinical expertise and “supports more proactive discharge planning, which will give my teams more time to focus on addressing patient needs.”
Starting discharge planning early helps cut down on extra time spent in the hospital due to logistics. If a patient is being discharged to a skilled nursing facility, for example, pre-planning can ensure there is a bed ready for that patient when they are cleared to leave the hospital, Butters said.
This can save the hospital, health insurance companies, and the patient money, she said.
“Every day a patient is in the hospital more than they need — an extra day — that costs the hospital, on average, about $3,000 a day,” Butters said. “If a hospital has 10,000 discharges and 20% of their patients remain in the hospital one day more than they need to, that’s millions of dollars … that they’ve lost … and that bed’s not available for new patients to come in as well.”
The workflow also helps cut out “a lot of the friction and the back-and-forth” between healthcare providers and insurance companies, she added. 
Patients may also see benefits.
“The longer that a patient stays in the hospital inappropriately, there’s higher risk of complications, increased risk of hospital-acquired infections, and higher risk of readmissions,” Butters said.
Xsolis’ AI models are retrained every quarter to adjust them to new conditions and patient populations. The company also goes through a series of annual audits covering data, system and physical security.

Missouri lawmakers are poised to return to Jefferson City next month to redraw the state’s eight congressional districts in order to gerrymander the Kansas City-based seat of Democratic U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver. They’re also considering changes to the initiative petition process to make it harder for Missourians to change the state constitution. 
Both have been longtime priorities of the Freedom Caucus, a group of hard-right GOP state lawmakers whose quarrels with party leaders led to years of Missouri Senate gridlock.
Yet after years of holding outsize sway in Missouri politics, the Senate Freedom Caucus is down to only two members.

State Sen. Rick Brattin, a Harrisonville Republican and former caucus chairman, quit in June following a break with the group over a $1.5 billion incentive package to finance stadiums for the Chiefs and Royals. 
State Sen. Brad Hudson of Cape Fair, who also voted in favor of the stadium bill, soon joined him. He told The Independent last week that his differences with the caucus focused on tactics, not policy. 
“I’ve got nothing but respect for my friends in the Freedom Caucus,” Hudson said.
The departures mean only two state senators from St. Charles County — Nick Schroer and Adam Schnelting — are still aligned with the Freedom Caucus. 
Schroer, who took over as caucus chairman after Brattin stepped down, insists the group is “stronger than ever” despite the loss of half its Senate membership. 
There are 11 members of the caucus in the House, Schroer said, and numerous candidates likely to join the group who are running in GOP primaries for open Senate seats next year. Not to mention, he said, Missouri’s secretary of state and two congressmen are Freedom Caucus alums. 
“I’m not concerned whatsoever that at this moment we only have two very strong senators,” he said. “And I think those numbers are going to grow. But just like in years past, there are going to be senators who may not be wearing the Freedom Caucus insignia, but they are going to be with us on 99.9% of issues.”
But the caucus’ dwindling numbers in the Senate, where its influence was always most acutely felt, has some wondering if its days in the center of the Missouri political spotlight are drawing to a close. 
Freedom Caucuses push for conservative state laws, but getting attention is their big success

It began in 2018, when a group of GOP senators formed what they called the conservative caucus. 
The group’s formation set off an escalating war with Republican leadership that culminated four years later when acrimony became so bad that the Senate adjourned a day early for the first time since a fixed adjournment date was set in the state constitution in 1952.
Soon after, the conservative caucus announced it was disbanding. 
A year later, six Republican senators — most of whom were part of the conservative caucus — announced the formation of the Missouri Freedom Caucus.  
And the Republican civil war resumed almost immediately. 
The 2023 legislative session saw Freedom Caucus members using near-daily procedural maneuvers to gum up the Senate. Republican leadership responded by stripping caucus members of committee assignments and musing about their expulsion. 
The 2024 session saw no improvement, resulting in fewer bills passed than any year in living memory, including the COVID-shortened session in 2020. 
Throughout the turmoil, the group kept losing members. 
State Sen. Cindy O’Laughlin, a Shelbina Republican, quit in 2021, telling The Independent at the time that she grew tired of the group’s disruptive tactics. She went on to become majority leader and president pro tem of the Senate, routinely squabbling with her former caucus colleagues. 
GOP state Sen. Jill Carter of Granby left the group last year, saying she could no longer in good conscience be a part of “actions behind the scenes that defame grassroots and violate the needs of my constituents.”
Tensions in the Senate cooled this year, with term limits pushing key figures on both sides of the fight out of the chamber. The detente led to a much more productive session, marked more by partisan squabbling than GOP infighting. 
Deal to pay for Chiefs, Royals stadiums fractures Missouri Freedom Caucus

That changed after Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe called lawmakers back into special session in June to pass incentives aimed at keeping the Chiefs and Royals from moving to Kansas. 
The Freedom Caucus vowed to oppose the funding scheme, which it decried as a “handout to billionaire sports team owners.” But Brattin and Hudson voted in support of the plan after a provision was added making changes to local property tax bills.
Both were accused of betraying the caucus’ principles, with the group’s longtime political adviser publicly calling for the Freedom Caucus to “disband and join the uniparty that runs Jefferson City.”
Brattin quit soon after, saying he opposed the stadium funding but voted in favor after the property tax provisions were added that he believed would benefit his constituents. 
Hudson quit a month later. 
“I agree with the caucus probably on 95% of the issues,” Hudson said, “and I intend to continue to be allies with them and work with them on issues that we agree on. There have been some times where tactically, there may have been some disagreements where I may have wanted to go a different direction.”
Schroer said the fact that the legislature is poised to debate a congressional map that seeks to eliminate the Democratic-leaning seat in Kansas City shows the Freedom Caucus is anything but dead. 
“Back in 2022, the Freedom Caucus pushed for a 7-1 map and couldn’t get enough Republicans to help us,” he said. “Now we’re going to do it.”
The overarching goal, he said, is that the Freedom Caucus will pull the party to the right so the caucus will no longer need to exist at all. 
“When we’ve got enough of these strong-willed conservatives that are able to stand up to the establishment and stand up to special interest groups, hopefully at that point we’ll have a majority of the majority,” he said, “ and there will be no need for the Freedom Caucus.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/040925_schroer1-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-08-18 06:56:43.885740

(Emily Previti/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)Across Pennsylvania, counties and providers of essential human services are bracing for what many fear will be a protracted state budget standoff in Harrisburg that’s already nearly seven weeks past the deadline. 
For many, it’s bringing up fears of another impasse like in 2015, when lawmakers went nine months without finalizing a spending plan. 
While most Pennsylvanians won’t have noticed any change in their day-to-day lives so far, for some of the most vulnerable people in the state, that may soon change. That’s because, until a budget is signed by Gov. Josh Shapiro, state payments for county-run services — like child welfare enforcement, senior citizen care, county health department programming, and more — are effectively on hold.
So, county governments are beginning to dip into their reserves. Now, officials and the nonprofits they contract with are rushing to develop contingency plans for when those run dry.
According to reporting by Spotlight PA, more than $2.5 billion in state payments for education and human services will be delayed in the coming weeks if lawmakers don’t come to an agreement.
“We’re hearing somewhere around the middle of next month as being the time some counties may run out of those reserves,” said Kyle Kopko, executive director of the County Commissioners Association of Pennsylvania. “Some may be before that. Some may be after. There’s going to be a lot of these human services that they’re mandated to provide, and if that’s the case, county commissioners are going to have to start looking at where they can move that money around.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
For many counties, that will mean a temporary stop or reduction in some social services. For others, it could mean taking out loans against expected tax payments, which come with interest that won’t be covered by the state when a budget is eventually passed and signed into law.
“In October, if we get that far and there’s still not a state budget, there’s going to be some real financial pressures for counties,” Kopko said.
But some won’t be able to wait that long. While most have not had to disrupt services yet, the longer the budget stalemate drags out, the more likely that becomes. And for many county officials and service providers, the current impasse brings back memories of the longest in recent memory in 2015. It lasted nine months, and led to many cuts in services and loans that, in some cases, providers are still paying back.
For instance, the Pennsylvania Council of Children, Youth and Family Services represents agencies and nonprofits that contract with counties to provide child and family services. They help recruit foster families, get those families’ homes ready to take kids, staff group homes, and more. Collectively, they employ more than 12,000 people. 
While some receive money from federal sources like Medicaid, President and CEO Terry Clark says about 90% are paid or reimbursed for their work by counties. As it stands, those counties may soon be unable to pay them.
“Some of those providers, they’re going to continue to work, regardless of whether the county or the state is paying them,” Clark said. “They have to. They have to be there for those kids and families.”
While most child service providers have not had to dip into reserves yet, it’s been a scramble to figure out what they’re going to do if the budget impasse drags out any longer. That may mean cutting their workforce, temporarily lowering pay, halting some services, or foregoing pay altogether until the stalemate in Harrisburg is resolved. 
It could also lead to a situation that counties also face – taking out loans, with interest that won’t be covered by the state. Clark says some of the contractors he represents are still repaying loans taken out during the 2015 impasse. Back then, he says, more than 100 service providers had to borrow over $172 million.
“Some people, to get that loan, had to put up their personal property,” Clark said. “That’s pretty sad when you might have to have a nonprofit CEO take out a loan on their home and know that they’re never going to get reimbursed [for the interest].”
During that nine-month impasse, Clark was working on the government side, as a county administrator in York County.  He remembers what it was like having to triage social services, figure out how they could shift around funds, and take out loans on the county side.
“The biggest lesson I learned is a lot of these nonprofits, they just don’t have a lot of money sitting there waiting,” he said. “They don’t have a slush fund or rainy day fund like the government has.”
Janine Maust is the executive director of Aging Services Inc., a private nonprofit that partners with Indiana County to provide services for seniors. They provide free meals for seniors, help them with bathing, provide in-home services for some who can’t travel, and offer an emergency button service in case of falls or other health issues.
Since the June 30 deadline for Pennsylvania to implement a budget, her organization has implemented a spending freeze. Except for covering operating costs, like keeping the lights on, and paying employees and providers, they’re unable to spend additional funds. 
That has led to cutting back on social events they hold for seniors, or at least finding ways to hold events at little to no cost. It has also meant a growing waiting list for services. While the wait list began last April, it’s been growing and being exacerbated by the impasse.
“If we’re flat-funded, those waiting lists are going to continue,” Maust said. “We need money above what we’re allocated to take people off a waiting list.” 
Already, Maust said her organization is dipping into reserves, and looking at the possibility of taking out a credit line, the interest on which they’ll be responsible for without state help. She expects it will be around two to three months until that becomes a necessity.
“Once the budget is passed and signed by the governor, it takes probably 45 to 60 days to get the money to come in,” Maust said. That could mean, even if a budget passed, they may still have to take a loan.
“We’ll have to pay interest on that, and we’ll have to use dollars to do that that could be spent on older adults,” she added.
According to Brian Bornman, executive director of the Pennsylvania Children and Youth Administrators Associations, some service providers that work with vulnerable kids and the families that care for them, are already seeing cuts to their pay,
“Generally what I’m hearing is some are already starting to provide reduced payments to providers,” Bornman said. “It may start that month one, they’re paying 80% of the invoice, and then 60%, and on down.”

Bornman says that’s in part that’s because, while lawmakers and their staff will continue to be paid as a standoff continues, counties will not receive state funds that are typically directed to providers of child welfare services and other mandatory, county-run programs.
“One can go down a cynical road there, if they were so inclined,” Bornman said.
However, he stressed, while some programs may be cut, when it comes to crucial services like child protective programs, work will continue, regardless of what happens in Harrisburg.
“If you have concerns that any child is being abused, continue to call as you normally would, because those services are going to be continued,” Bornman said. “The child welfare workforce is incredibly dedicated, and the counties are extremely committed to making sure the kids are protected.”
Following safety net services, schools will likely be the next to feel the squeeze. Though, for now, many are able to operate as usual.
The Pottstown School District is an example.
“The reality is school districts get a decent amount of funding from real estate tax revenues, which are all coming in right now, said Pottstown Superintendent Stephen Rodriguez, superintendent of the Pottstown School District. “Nevertheless, the short term effects are negligible. The long-term effects are detrimental. So we would like for there to be a budget.”
Matt Vannoy, the vice president of the Pennsylvania School Boards Association and a school board director for Sharon City School District, said in a public meeting last week that, while many school districts have enough funds to last for several months, some will have to take action as soon as next month.

Those  districts, he said, may have to take out loans, with interest costs that will be passed to taxpayers, or delay purchases of things like textbooks, electronics, classroom supplies and other materials.
“Ultimately that trickles down,” he said of costs borne by school districts to offset a delay of state funds. “You’re hurting kids and you’re impacting your instructional programs.”
Vannoy said his own school district  is “not in a terrible spot as of today,” and has enough funding to last for four or five months.
Spokespeople for Gov. Shapiro and House Majority Leader Matt Bradford (D-Montgomery) did not respond to requests for comment. 
A spokesperson for Senate President Pro Tempore Kim Ward (R-Westmoreland) sent a statement.
“The Senate passed a responsible short-term budget that immediately released funding for schools, nursing homes and human services,” she said. “Gov. Shapiro and House Democrats blocked that deal. Any cuts in services to schools, nursing homes, hospitals, and essential services lies with Gov. Shapiro and House Democrats to answer as to why they are holding the funds hostage.”
While the Democratic-led House rejected a stop-gap budget passed by the Republican-controlled Senate earlier this month, the House also passed a budget bill in July, which stalled in the Senate.
Leaders of both parties have blamed the other for the impasse, while emphasizing negotiations continue.
Mass transit agencies across the commonwealth are also feeling the squeeze, with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA), the state’s largest transit authority, set to begin a 20% service cut later this month. They say deeper cuts will follow if the state does not increase their funding. 
Other transit agencies in urban, rural and suburban areas have said they would have to cut services as well if a budget with increased funding isn’t agreed to soon..",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Shamokin3-1024x742.jpeg,,,2025-08-18 08:56:48.562036

The books portray gay characters and historical figures or explore LGBTQ+ themes.
Pamela Wilson Federspiel, who has been director of the library in downtown Shelbyville for 34 years, says the action is tantamount to “stealing.”
But three leaders of the Reformation Church of Shelbyville defend what they call an “act of civil disobedience.”
  Austin Keeler
“Yes — we have urged Christians, both locally and across the country, to search their libraries for books that promote sodomy, gender confusion and rebellion against God — and if found, to check them out and never return them as an act of civil disobedience,” pastors Jerry Dorris and Tanner Cartwright and Austin Keeler, an evangelist with the church mission, Reformation Frontline Missions, recently told the Lantern in an email.
The library has “lost” 16 books valued at $410.85 since a member of the church checked them out last year with due dates in late June 2024, said Federspiel. Some of the books were written for children, some for adults. (The list of books is at the bottom of this story.)
Federspiel did not identify the library patron and said the books were never returned after several notices.
The titles include “The Art of Drag,” “My Two Moms” and “My Two Dads.”
Chris Hartman of Louisville, executive director of the Fairness Campaign, said he has never considered “theft to be a form of civil action.”
He also said he has never heard of a church encouraging its members “to steal from a public institution. It is shameful, unfortunate and disrespectful.”
Such activity often backfires by making people, especially young people, curious about the books and giving them more attention, he said.
  Author Sarah Prager
Sarah Prager of Boston wrote one of the 16 books the Shelby County Public Library has “lost.” It is called “Kind Like Marsha: Lessons from LGBTQ+ Leaders”  and  is for juveniles. Amazon.com says it celebrates 14 LGBTQ+ people throughout history, like politician Harvey Milk, scientist and painter Leonardo da Vinci, Mexican artist Frida Kahlo and Marsha P. Johnson, who took care of her trans community on the streets of New York City.
“My book is not about sexual acts. It is about real, caring people — and what is wrong about that? A library must always have a diverse inventory.  We can never let that change,” Prager said.
Complaints about books increase
The church posted its recommendation to check out certain library books and not return them in a 2 minute, 57 second video on its Facebook page on June 1, 2024.  Church leaders said recently their message has not changed.
“Friends, the Shelby County Public Library is promoting the vile LGBTQ agenda to groom and trans children in Kentucky,” a script accompanying the video says.
“Would you help us expose what’s happening here?” it asks before providing contact information for two library officials and listing books the church found objectionable. 
Complaints about books to public libraries are not new but are growing in Kentucky and the United States. There were 302 challenges to Kentucky public libraries in 2024, up from only 26 in 2023, according to the state Department of Libraries and Archives annual Statistical Report of Kentucky Public Libraries released in April.
But rare, if ever, is the practice condoned by the Shelbyville church for making books disappear from the shelves. 
“Strategically checking out books with no plans to return them as a method of permanently removing certain books from local public libraries is not a common practice, at least not one that has been reported to KDLA,” said Jill Midkiff, a spokesperson for the  Kentucky Education and Labor Cabinet and the Kentucky Department for Libraries and Archives (KDLA).
  Suzanne Trimel
PEN America, based in New York, tracks book bans and fights censorship across the country. Spokesperson Suzanne Trimel said she has never heard of the  book-removal tactic recommended by the Shelbyville church, though some conservative churches have urged members to seek public office to be in a position to censor LGBTQ+ books. She’s also heard of hiding controversial books where they aren’t likely to be found on library shelves
PEN America has seen censorship activities in public schools and public libraries intensify, she said, as public libraries have responded to pressure by canceling author visits and drag story hours. 
Trimel said public libraries also have been under pressure from the “Hide the Pride” campaign, largely led  by a conservative Catholic advocacy organization called CatholicVote.  In 2022, the leaders of CatholicVote estimated 50 to 100 libraries were targeted for “Hide the Pride.” 
The campaign instructs parents to go to the children’s section of a public library and check out all “Pride Month” books on the display shelves. The parents return the books on time but place them on other shelves out of reach of children.
The Reformation Church of Shelbyville does not return controversial books removed from the Shelby County library.
The church’s stance
Pastor Dorris said the church became aware of the controversial books when a member took their children to the library and the “children were exposed to some of them. Upon investigation they discovered the remaining books.”
Like librarian Federspiel, Dorris declined to identify the patron. He said the family did not want any public attention. Records of books checked out by patrons of public libraries are not subject to Kentucky’s Open Records Act, said Amye Bensenhaver, co-founder and co-director of the Kentucky Open Government Coalition.

Dorris said he is uncertain where the checked-out books are now. “They have not been destroyed to my knowledge.”
He said his independent church, which “shepherds 357 souls,” is taking a “public stand against sexual perversion being pushed upon children through taxpayer-funded institutions.” It will continue to take that stand without apology, he said.
“This is not literacy — it’s grooming,” Dorris said.
Asked about the removal of public property, Dorris said, “We reject the idea that civil rebellion is only legitimate when it’s done with rainbow flags or Marxist slogans. Civil disobedience is a biblical category when obedience to God and love for neighbor demand it.”
 Dorris said that when the church discovered the controversial materials in the local library, it contacted Shelby County’s state senator and representative. It also contacted the library’s staff and its board members “to express our deep concern and call for action.”
“No library staff or board member ever followed up with us, no request has been made for the return of these books, and — tellingly — the books themselves have not been replaced. Not that we would return them — but the silence itself speaks volumes,” said Dorris.
Matt Burgin, president of the library’s board of trustees, said Federspiel told the board about the situation but no one else has ever contacted him about the books.
The library has handled it like other cases of overdue books, he said.

Dorris said he did talk to then-state Sen. Adrienne Southworth, R-Lawrenceburg, but he would not divulge their conversation. She could not be reached for comment. State Rep. Jennifer Decker, R-Waddy, did not return phone calls to her Frankfort office seeking comment.
Dorris stressed that the book action is not a formal position of the Reformation Church and “not every member of our church is aware of and agrees with these actions, and that’s acceptable. We don’t discipline or pressure members over strategy. These actions — like the permanent removal of library books — were taken by individual Christians under personal conviction. We support their right to act or refrain in good conscience.”
The library’s stance
The 16 books director Federspiel says are “lost” due to the efforts of the Reformation Church range in cost from $19.99 to $35.
The library offers a variety of books for a diverse community, she said. “All are library property.”
Library materials that are not returned are not available for other patrons, said Federspiel, who declined to have her photo taken for this article. “The library is committed to providing materials that meet patron needs. Materials that are not returned are not available for other patrons. Replacing lost material is costly.”
Amanda Perry-Davis, the library’s collection manager, said the library acquires books generally based on their popularity. That can be determined by various book reviews, journals and magazines. Library professional journals recommended the “lost books” as appropriate titles for each age level.
Patrons also suggest specific books to acquire, said Perry-Davis.
Federspiel, who is retiring at the end of the year, said several staffers also provide their input on what books to buy but the final decision is hers.
Federspiel said that most of the “lost books” had not been in high demand by library patrons.

The library left a voicemail message with the patron about the overdue books and issued three other notices before turning the matter over to a collection agency, Unique Management, after 60 days, she said. The replacement cost is added to the patron’s card but so far the books remain missing.
Church has other targets besides library
The church has engaged in more public protests, including against a now closed Shelbyville bar and a fall fundraiser in Cynthiana in which people dress up as witches.
The church protested The Barrel Room, formerly a bar in downtown Shelbyville, for holding drag shows and the city’s conference center for allowing “drag queens to dance in front of children.”The church branded Cynthiana “a hotbed of witchcraft” in response to the Harrison County seat’s Witches’ Day Out event. 
“These displays grieve the heart of God and signal our community’s descent into spiritual decay,” said Pastor Dorris. “We do not hate the men who perform in drag, nor the librarians, nor the critics who accuse us of being hateful. We love them enough to tell the truth — that Jesus Christ is Lord, that sin leads to hell, and that the gospel alone can set people free.”
 The Barrel Room closed in October. Vicki Jones Lee, a local gay rights advocate, said she saw several drag shows there. “We would hear the protesters outside, making a lot of noise. The shows would just go on,” she said.
A spokesperson for the conference center said the center became the site for a Pride event in the summer of 2023 “to help it find a public venue.

James Smith, executive director of the Cynthiana-Harrison County Chamber of Commerce, said “Witches Day Out” is part of the community’s annual Halloween festivities. Participants dress like witches and try to raise money for a needy cause such as helping a family whose child had brain cancer
“It’s not a cult, it’s not a religion. Cynthiana’s Witches Day Out is a fun, community event with 130-plus vendors, food, readings, and a Victorian seance-themed Crystal Ball on the first Saturday in September in downtown Cynthiana to kick off the fall season,” said committee member Sam Lunger.
“But it is disappointing to hear anyone say it involves witchcraft. Everyone is entitled to free speech but this is misleading and out of bounds. We do provide a free space for the church protesters.”
Drag shows and witches are taboo to the church but it has given most attention to books.
Consequences
Dorris, the pastor, expects “some sort of reaction against the church” for its book removal efforts but does not know exactly what that will be.
“We know there will be consequences for saying what others are afraid to say. We will not be silent. We will not comply. We will not flinch. Our duty is to God, and our aim is the good of our neighbors — even those who revile us,” he said.
Madison Markham, a staff member on PEN America’s Freedom to Read team, said, “The alarming rise of book bans and censorship in the country is and will continue to have devastating consequences in our communities in the years to come.
“Regardless of whether you are a student, a parent, a librarian, an author, or a community member, this is an issue that affects all of us. Access to books with LGBTQ+ representation helps LGBTQ+ people and their families feel seen, and builds empathy. Everyone deserves the right to read and to be exposed to diverse ideas and experiences.”
Mark Adler, director of the Paris-Bourbon County Public Library and last year’s winner of the Kentucky Public Library Association’s Intellectual Freedom Award, acknowledges that community members have the right to voice their concerns about materials in a public library but suggested it be channeled through a reconsideration request.
Each individual library has its own reconsideration process, as each community is unique in its makeup just as the local library collections are, he said. “These reconsideration requests provide an avenue for community members to file objections while also providing a structured, consistent process for libraries to follow when requests are filed. We encourage community members who have questions to bring those directly to their local libraries so we can work with the affected citizens to address their concerns.”
Shelby County’s Federspiel concurred, adding a public library should always celebrate books for all kinds of people.
In 1903, when Andrew Carnegie built the library in Shelbyville and donated $10,00 to it  “he had inscribed on the floor as you enter …  ‘A University for the People,’ showing his dedication to unite communities,” she said.
“To this day, we proudly honor these words by acquiring acquisitions that celebrate both inclusiveness and diversity of our community.”

Mike Kehoe discusses the 2025 legislative session with reporters in his Capitol office on May 16 (Jason Hancock/Missouri Independent).Once upon a time, Missouri Republicans were proud to declare their independence from Washington, D.C., and anyone associated with it.
During Barack Obama’s administration, they authorized specialty “Don’t Tread on Me” license plates, decorated with the Gadsden Flag. A lot of red states have those now, but Missouri was a trendsetter.
Lawmakers were also fond of floating bills with “freedom” in the name. There was, for instance, a “light bulb freedom act,” a protest against federal energy regulations.
More recently, Republicans rammed through the Second Amendment Preservation Act, which tries to make it illegal to enforce federal gun laws in Missouri. It is unwise legislation that immediately ran into legal challenges, but it did reflect Republicans’ vaunted defiance.
I didn’t like any of those bills, but I kind of miss the defiance — now that so many Missouri Republicans have become quivering, gelatinous flunkies for Donald Trump.  
We are about to find out just how subservient our state’s leaders have become. Some time soon, Gov. Mike Kehoe is expected to announce if he will call a special session to redistrict the state’s U.S. Congressional districts. 
Most people are expecting he will. Of course he will. President Trump told him to. 
Missouri governor won’t confirm redistricting, but Republicans say it’s likely

In a bid to eke out every advantage for Republicans in the 2026 midterm elections, Trump is leaning on states with Republican governors and legislatures to redraw their Congressional districts now, instead of waiting for the next Census count, as is traditional in most states.
Kehoe felt cowed enough by Trump and his followers to do an about face on the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election. So he seems an unlikely prospect to withstand pressure from the leader now.
The aim of a special session would be to gerrymander Missouri’s Congressional districts so that Democrats have a reasonable chance of winning only one of eight. Right now two seats are obtainable for Democrats.
The likeliest scenario would be to distort the lines of the 5th Congressional District, currently held by Democrat U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, to encompass more Republican-leaning territory. Jackson County would likely be split into two or possibly three districts, and the now-compact 5th District would stretch farther into mid-Missouri. 
This is a terrible idea. Republicans know that. They passed on extensive gerrymandering three years ago when they looked at redistricting Congressional districts after the 2020 Census. Saner lawmakers argued that such a radical redrawing of the lines would invite expensive court challenges and possibly dilute Republican strength in the districts they consider safe.
All that is still the case. But some things are different since the legislature preserved the 6-2 Congressional map in 2022. 
Since then, Missourians voted to make abortion legal and Republicans in Jefferson City have taken steps to reinstate the ban that the people overturned. Missourians, by a hefty margin, voted for paid sick leave for workers. The legislature’s Republican majority overturned that. For good measure, they also weakened a voter-approved minimum wage increase.
People’s attitudes toward a legislature that doesn’t respect their votes are toxic now. As a Jackson County resident, I can tell you that a gerrymandering scheme to hand one of Missouri’s Democratic strongholds over to Republican congressional representatives will poison relationships with Jefferson City for years to come.
Kehoe has said he feels a responsibility to “keep the (U.S.) House in Republican control.” 
What about his responsibility to his state and his constituents? Is his calling to Missouri or is it to Trump?
This foolish redistricting scheme, it should be said, is purely a defensive crouch for Kehoe and Missouri Republicans — a way to avoid incurring the wrath of Trump and the MAGA multitudes.
There will be no actual reward for blind obedience to the president.
Just ask Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey. He has turned his office into an auxiliary law firm for Trump. But when Bailey threw his hat in the ring for the job as FBI director, the president casually dismissed him after an interview. 
“He just didn’t have the presence in the room,” Trump reportedly said.
Few people have tried harder to ingratiate themselves with Trump and the MAGA movement than Josh Hawley, Missouri’s senior U.S. senator. In 2021, he became the first senator to announce he would object to the certification of Joe Biden’s electoral victory, and he cheered the crowds that had gathered to storm the U.S. Capitol.
More recently, Hawley twisted himself into a pretzel trying to be a populist while at the same time staying on Trump’s good side.
First he said he wouldn’t vote for a bill that slashed Medicaid spending. Then he cast the decisive vote for Trump’s “big, beautiful bill,” which did indeed slash Medicaid spending. Then he introduced a new, dead-on-arrival bill to restore the slashed Medicaid spending.
All that, only to have Trump call him a “second-tier senator” a few weeks later, as Hawley attempted to take a stand on a different issue. 
This is the calculus for Kehoe. Call a special session and get the redistricting done and maybe Trump won’t blast him on Truth Social or exact some petty revenge down the road. But dysfunction in the legislature will worsen and so will the bad blood between the state of Missouri and Kansas City, its most dynamic region.
Courage is an elusive commodity these days. I think we can guess which way Kehoe will turn.  
Missouri earned its slogan as the Show-Me state in part because politicians through the years refused to take orders from outsiders.
We may have to change the motto on our license plates. Odds are Kehoe is about to turn Missouri into the Tell-Me state.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_1968-e1747406679213-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-08-18 05:57:12.008052

The six-month investigation, reported by Tom Loftus and John Voskuhl, found “the entire state-funded resurfacing program is plagued by a lack of competition.” 
Secretary Gray will recognize the names of the companies that benefited decades ago from the asphalt bidding schemes. According to the latest research published  by my organization – Kentucky FREE – many of those same highway contractors are still reaping the rewards from  the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet’s (KYTC) single-bid contracts. 
Our research shows that during the first six months of 2025, the Transportation Cabinet awarded $150,407,982 in single-bid asphalt contracts. Those awards translated to $12,765,410 in inflated project costs when compared to estimates based on competitive scenarios. Fifteen highway contractors secured single-bid contracts from January to June, however, six companies reaped 87% of their dollar value.
To be fair, some things have changed in the last 31 years.
Mountain Enterprises and Hinkle Contracting, once family-owned, are now subsidiaries of CRH-Oldcastle, the largest building materials company in North America. Also, Hinkle is part of a joint-venture with Nally & Gibson, another player in the single-bid asphalt game. 
Leonard Lawson, dubbed the “King of the Roads” by Loftus and Voskuhl, died in 2022. Steve Lawson, his son, now sits atop a road paving conglomerate that includes ATS Construction, L-M Enterprises, The Allen Company, Lexington Quarry and Walker Construction. 
In the 1980s, Leonard Lawson was an unindicted co-conspirator in a federal bid rigging trial. As reported by the Courier Journal, Lawson testified “he and another paving contractor agreed to cooperate on their bidding — splitting state jobs ‘right down the middle.’”
The days of contractors getting together in a room to divvy up territories are a thing of the past. However, a peer-reviewed study published in 2020 and co-authored by a University of Kentucky economist, raised questions of “tacit collusion” by the state’s asphalt industry. 
Tacit collusion refers to an implicit agreement among firms in an oligopolistic market to coordinate their pricing and output strategies. It can lead to higher prices and reduced competition, as firms avoid competition that could harm their profits. It’s revealed by patterns in bidding behavior over a long period of time.
The 2020 study argued that “stark evidence that county lines might provide a focal point for collusive bidding can be seen in the Lexington-Bluegrass market area.”  
Last year, the General Assembly’s Legislative Oversight & Investigations committee examined KYTC’s single-bid asphalt awards from 2018 to 2023. It found that “bidding is generally more competitive in counties surrounding Jefferson County and in northern Kentucky; counties (in the Fayette County area) have a high percentage of single-bid contracts even though multiple (asphalt) plants are in the region.”  
I’ve been examining asphalt bidding for five years. A small number of companies clearly maintain local monopolies. 
In central Kentucky (with rare exceptions), L-M Asphalt controls Fayette County, Lexington Quarry controls Jessamine and The Allen Company controls both Clark and Madison. Bourbon County is Hinkle’s and Scott County is Nally & Gibson’s. The Lawson-owned companies don’t bid into the CRH-Oldcastle counties and the CRH-Oldcastle companies don’t bid into the Lawson companies’ counties. 
L-M Asphalt has won countless single-bid projects in Laurel County, though none as eye-popping as the $147 million contract for an Interstate 75 project announced last week. It defies logic that the Transportation Cabinet couldn’t get another company to bid on such a big project. 
History isn’t repeating itself. The same story has continued unabated for decades. Unfortunately, the results are the same today as they were in 1994: The lack of competition wastes millions of the taxpayers’ dollars every year. 
In 2021, I testified about this issue in front of the interim Transportation Committee. Several legislators unloaded on me, trying to undermine my presentation with the industry’s talking points. 
Those legislators should’ve taken two lessons away from that committee meeting: Lobbyists’ talking points aren’t the same as facts and an industry that tries to silence its critics probably has something to hide.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gettyimages-83455071-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-08-18 05:57:12.008052

Julie Fedorchak, R-N.D., meets with Don and Sharon Zubke of Dickinson during a series of constituent meetings in Bismarck on Aug. 15, 2025. (Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)U.S. House Rep. Julie Fedorchak, R-N.D., said she plans to continue holding one-on-one meetings with North Dakotans going forward, but poured cold water on the possibility of a public town hall.
Fedorchak held 10 meetings in Bismarck on Friday with those who signed up for time slots in advance. She also held similar meetings in Fargo last month with seven constituents.
She said was encouraged by the meetings and believes people just wanted “to be heard.”
“People came in with issues and only a handful of folks really had grievances about the current administration, or what’s going on,” Fedorchak said in an interview after the meetings.
She said the constituent meetings are only one element of her outreach efforts to North Dakotans. The virtual public forums, meeting with advocacy groups and organizations around the state and responding to messages will also continue, she said, which provide multiple layers of interaction.
“The town hall would not be as productive,” Fedorchak said. “I’m not interested in creating an environment that just further underscores the partisan nature of our political arena today and that’s what those town halls generally do. They are a forum for political theater that has turned into yelling and screaming, and not a productive conversation about the consequential issues.”
One North Dakotan with a meeting slot in Bismarck was Mike Larson of Carrington. He said “cruelty” prompted him to sign up for a one-on-one meeting with Fedorchak.
 Poll: ND voters back tariffs, but mixed on impacts of Trump trade policies 

“We’re going backwards,” Larson said, prior to his meeting. “Everything. Just cruelty in general. It’s not her fault. It’s the party. The people. And I’m just kind of fed up with the cruelty. That’s the thing that bothers me the most.”
Larson said he has friends that he now describes as “people I used to know” because of their political disagreements.
After the meeting, Larson said Fedorchak listened and wrote down his concerns. He added he felt better upon exiting his meeting.
“I just hope she adheres to some of the things that I talked to her about and understands that there’s a lot of people like me that are very concerned about our future,” he said. “I hope she understands that a person needs to be an individual and make your own decisions.”
Fedorchak said she has crafted her political beliefs after more than 30 years in business and public service and she is a conservative, which shouldn’t surprise anyone.
“I am a Republican and I’m committed to the principles of the Republican Party and the conservative movement because I think they are right,” Fedorchak said. “Folks who don’t share those values are going to see it differently and wish I voted differently.”
Debbra Hill of Bismarck said she considers herself a Republican, but has major concerns about the high cost of child care and its accessibility. She also said she has issues with the way the United States is treating Ukrainian immigrants who fled their country, only to have problems with their visas being extended.
Poll: Trump, Armstrong support firm; Fedorchak, Cramer slip

“I have friends from Ukraine. They say they are not deporting them, but if they can’t work and the government is not helping them … that’s a horrible way to treat our Ukrainian friends,” Hill said. 
She also expressed concerns about the country’s $37 trillion debt and that the Republican reconciliation package will add to that debt, not pay it down.
“We thought we were going to decrease our debt. We thought we were going to have a better quality of life. This is all reversed and I’m very disappointed,” Hill said.
After her meeting, Hill said Fedorchak justified the Republican tax and spending package, which is what she expected.
“She justified everything they have done,” Hill said. “We’re not going to have growth with high tariffs and we’re not going to have growth when we don’t have workers to do the labor.”
Hill said her opinion of Fedorchak did not change as a result of the meeting.
Fedorchak said the meetings proved that people can still have respectful discussions about important issues.
“I think everyone appreciated being able to be heard and hearing where I stand on issues, even if it’s different from them,” Fedorchak said. 
Some North Dakotans met with Fedorchak to address personal issues regarding their missing tax refund or problems with the visa process for a family member.
In a statement from North Dakota Sen. Kevin Cramer’s office, Cramer said he holds a regular series of radio town halls that are listed on his website, which provides opportunities for North Dakotans from across the state to participate.
“Whether a person is speaking into a microphone or telephone, they are speaking directly to me, with the only differences being they don’t have to get in their car or wait for a town hall to align with their schedule,” Cramer said in a statement. “I also make it a priority to be available to local reporters, and in fact most of them have my cell phone number. If I am going to represent North Dakotans the best way I can, I need to hear from them, but it’s too important to rely only upon 20th Century tools and tactics when we all know how quickly things move today.”
In a statement, North Dakota Sen. John Hoeven’s office said, “Hoeven holds public meetings on issues important to our state and nation. These public events are in communities across the state, and North Dakotans are welcome to attend.”
The office said Hoeven has participated in meetings and discussions over the last several weeks involving: energy, border security, housing, grazing and flood protection. Hoeven is also available to meet with constituents regularly in Washington, D.C., and North Dakota.

(Jon Cherry/Getty Images)As participation in Arkansas’ school voucher program has grown, so too has tuition at the private schools receiving state funds. 
Since its creation under the LEARNS Act in 2023, the Educational Freedom Account program has provided state money for allowable education expenses such as private school tuition. The program has been phased in over three years with increasing eligibility and is open to all students for the first time this fall.
Of the 164 schools that applied for the 2025-2026 academic year, 160 have been approved to participate, according to Arkansas Department of Education spokesperson Kimberly Mundell. Students used the EFA program at 97 schools in the program’s first year in 2023-24 and 126 schools the second. Additional schools were approved to participate both years, but did not have students who accessed EFA funds, Mundell said. 
According to an Arkansas Advocate analysis of private school tuition obtained through a public records request, the average tuition for the 2025-2026 year is around $8,800, which is more than the roughly $7,000 the state will provide each student this year.
The average tuition increase among the 93 schools that participated in all three years of the program was about $1,400, the Advocate’s analysis showed. 
North Little Rock’s Immaculate Conception Catholic School had the largest three-year increase at $5,725.
Under EFA program rules, ADE may prohibit schools from participating in the program if the department determines tuition or fee increases “are unreasonable or arbitrary.” Asked if a school’s proposed increase has ever been rejected, Mundell said “each private school’s tuition is reviewed individually to ensure compliance with state law.”
“The department reviews each school’s proposed tuition before granting approval for the upcoming year,” Mundell said in an email. “If any concerns arise, the department contacts the school to learn more.”

High and low tuition
Fayetteville Christian School, which has participated in the EFA program since its inception, doubled its K-12 tuition from $3,000 to $6,000 this year. Students paid between $700 and $850 in additional fees last year that are included in this year’s tuition cost. According to the school’s application, its superintendent sent the 2025-2026 tuition structure to ADE for review on Dec. 9 with an explanation for the increase. An official reviewed and “pre-approved” the increase the same day, according to the application. 
Calvary Christian Academy, which joined the program last school year, included in its application three reasons for increasing tuition by $2,900 to $6,200 this year. Officials said they didn’t previously charge “the full amount available,” so they wouldn’t financially hurt families ineligible for the EFA program. They also didn’t charge for some operational and technology fees, which they didn’t realize could be included in the EFA program. Additionally, the tuition hike will provide teachers and staff “a much-deserved raise,” according to the application. 
The largest year-over-year increase belongs to PLUM’s St. Howard’s Academy in Forrest City, which increased its tuition by roughly $5,100 to $12,000. The average tuition increase from last year among participating schools was about $860. PLUM Foundation is a nonprofit dedicated to community development in impoverished areas of the state, according to its website.
First-time participant Ewing Adventist Junior Academy in Bonnerdale has the lowest tuition at $2,000 for K-8 students. 
Bentonville’s Thaden School has the most expensive tuition at $29,300 for high school students. Head of School Michael Maloy told the Advocate last summer that Thaden offers “a robust financial aid program” that includes indexed tuition, meaning families pay according to their income.
Three new EFA participants, Excel High School, Northgate Academy and Veritas Scholars Academy, are not included in the Advocate’s analysis because instead of traditional tuition, the online schools’ charges vary based on how many and what type of courses students register to take. 

Doing more
Although Christ Academy received approval to participate in the inaugural year of the EFA program, principal Nyesha Greer decided to wait until this fall when all of her students would be eligible. 
The Newport school, which opened in 2018 and can serve around a dozen students in grades 6 through 8, is affiliated with a church and has previously relied on private donors and grants for funding. 
This will be the first year the school charges tuition, $6,500 per student. That’s just under the $6,994 being provided to each EFA student this year. The per-pupil EFA amount in the program’s first year was $6,672 and $6,856 the following academic year. Each year’s amount was based on the prior year’s per-student foundation funding for public schools.  
Greer said delaying participation in the EFA program “was the best decision.” The state funding will reduce stress on parents and allow the school to provide more programs and expand extracurricular activities, she said.  
“It just means we’ll be able to do a little bit more. It opens doors for us,” she said. 
Those sentiments were shared by Esmerki De Los Santos, principal of Fe Viva Christian School. The school is a ministry of Iglesia Bautista Fe Viva, an independent Baptist, Spanish-speaking church in Rogers. De Los Santos said the school provides instruction in English, but with a bilingual emphasis. 
Fe Viva joined the EFA program last year and is educating nearly 50 students in kindergarten through 12th grade this fall. The school’s funding was much smaller previously, and although money was “tight for a lot of parents,” De Los Santos said they educated students regardless. The EFA funding will enable the school to do more this year, such as providing students meals and additional resources, the principal said. 
“It’s life-changing. It’s life-changing for them, for the school,” De Los Santos said.

Tuition at Fe Viva is $6,000 for kindergarten through 7th grade and $6,500 for 8th through 12th grade. In deciding tuition, De Los Santos said they consider the cost of education and tuition prices in Northwest Arkansas.
“We are probably by far one of the cheapest here in the area just because we are working mostly with bilingual families,” he said. “We reach a lot of Hispanic families that would like to give their kids a little bit of Christian and better education, and so we reach out to families that wouldn’t be able to afford any other type of private school otherwise.”
While he’s grateful for state funding, De Los Santos said that, in the back of his mind, there’s always a concern about how the EFA program could shift in the future, such as new rules infringing on the school’s “religious liberty” or if funding runs out. De Los Santos said 80% to 90% of Fe Viva’s budget relies on EFA funding, and he’s not sure parents could afford tuition if the program goes away. 
Likewise, Greer said she’s mindful of how the program might shift once a new governor comes into office. 
“That has been a thought, but I’m not concerned,” she said. “The way I see it is we’ve been able to function before, and so this is not a determining factor whether we’ll be successful or not. This is just something that comes along and it’s a great help to us right now.”
Covering all applicants
The state has approved $277 million for the program’s third year; however, there are plans to fund every approved application, Mundell said. The deadline for schools and students to apply was Aug. 1 and Aug. 15, respectively. Mundell said it is yet to be determined if more students will be allowed to apply later in the year. 
As of Thursday afternoon, ADE had received 50,630 total applications — 29,836 private school students, 20,782 homeschool students, 12 incomplete. Of those, 44,599 had been approved, including 27,779 private school students and 16,820 homeschool students. 
By this same time in 2023 and 2024, ADE had approved participation for roughly 5,000 and 12,000 students, respectively. 
Of the currently approved students, 456 are former recipients of the Succeed Scholarship. The program, which was absorbed into the EFA program, provided private school tuition for students with disabilities, foster children and military families. 
Students who participated in the Succeed Scholarship during the 2022-2023 school year have continued to receive the scholarship amount awarded to them. Their funding has increased from $7,413 to $7,618 to $7,771 since the 2023-2024 school year.
The EFA program is only open to Arkansas schools, with the exception of the Madonna Learning Center in Tennessee, which has been allowed to participate in order to continue serving a former Succeed Scholarship recipient. The school will not be allowed to continue in the EFA program once the student graduates, Mundell said. 
ADE did not have data on when the last of the former Succeed Scholarship students are expected to graduate, but Mundell said graduation data will be presented in the annual EFA report. The program’s rules require that a legislative report be submitted no later than Sept. 30 each year. 



How we did it: 
Data was collected from Educational Freedom Account program applications provided by the Arkansas Department of Education through a state Freedom of Information Act request. Annual tuition rates for schools that provided weekly or monthly rates were calculated based on a 10-month school year.
Schools generally provided tuition rates for the 2025-2026 and 2024-2025 academic years. Some schools only provided one document for tuition rates. Although that may be because the tuition rate is the same for the current and previous year, only the tuition rate for the specific year listed on the document was included in the analysis.
Some schools included all fees in their listed tuition price, but the majority listed separate fees to be paid in addition to the tuition rate. The tuition rates in this analysis do not reflect discounts for things like being a church member or enrolling more than one child.

(Photo courtesy of Getty Images)With friction growing between the public and school leaders over policy decisions, Fairfax County Public Schools is in the process of hiring security for its superintendent due to the need for additional protection over safety concerns.
The move has left legislative leaders curious if similar proposals could occur at other school divisions around the region and beyond, as school leaders continue to be challenged by the public and face investigations for their decisions.
“I think that our superintendents do not want to have to spend their very scarce resources on something like this,” said Del. Laura Jane Cohen, D-Fairfax, a former Fairfax County school board member. “And I honestly believe, if you see this in Fairfax County, it is highly likely that these threats are happening all over the country.” 
The Mercury confirmed that school divisions in Falls Church City, and the counties of Loudoun, Prince William, Rapphannock and Frederick have not appropriated funds specifically for their superintendent’s security. 
Fairfax County Public Schools, the largest school division in the commonwealth, is likely the first to take such action. In a statement, FCPS told reporters that the “highly publicized tragic events around the country over the last several months illustrate the need to intensify and enhance security protocols at all organizations.”
Fairfax’s policy decisions have made targets of Superintendent Michelle Reid, the school board, and even staff, dating back as far as the pandemic. Chief among its critics have been parents, lawmakers and Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration.
Some of the board’s decisions include overhauling school admissions at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology to promote greater diversity and resisting statewide transgender policies that would have forced schools to out transgender students or restrict pronoun use.
Fairfax, along with four other school divisions — Alexandria City, Arlington, Loudoun and Prince William — was also the subject of a federal investigation that determined their gender policies violated Title IX. The U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights proposed that the divisions rescind their policies and adopt biology-based definitions of the words “male” and “female” in all practices and policies relating to Title IX.
The division is also facing a criminal investigation after school staff were alleged to have helped minors get abortions without parental consent. Reid has denied the allegations.
The division did not immediately respond to questioning.
 The decision

Cohen said threats against school board members have stretched back to her time on the board between 2020 and 2023. During those years, she said someone would be assigned to follow her to her car or from other buildings.
Cohen said she feels confident in the office’s decision, given their assistance with her own security while she was on the board. She faced threats and successfully had a petition against her removal dismissed.
“If there are credible threats on her life, not only do you want to make sure that she’s protected, but you want to make sure that every time she goes into a school or is meeting with anybody that she is not a liability,” Cohen said.
In July, FCPS posted the job opening for an “executive protection agent” to work on a 260-day contract. The job would pay between $84,000-$144,000 per year. 
The job posting reads that the agent is responsible for “ensuring the personal safety, security, and operational continuity of the division superintendent across school campuses, public events, official travel, and private residences. This role requires discretion, professionalism, proactive risk management, and continuous coordination with internal stakeholders and external partners, including law enforcement.”  
During the same month, the school board met to discuss “public safety matters” and to “dispense with the attendance of the superintendent” during a portion of the closed session on July 17.
Following the job posting’s publication, WJLA reported that the security detail could consist of up to four positions. 
The Virginia School Board Association (VSBA) and School Board Member Alliance (SBMA) did not directly answer if they have concerns that Fairfax’s decision will set a precedent for hiring superintendents.
Instead, Gina Patterson, VSBA executive director, said in a statement that the decision made by the Fairfax County School Board is an example of their local control. 
“If the board and superintendent determined that this course of action was appropriate, it reflects their judgment on what they believe to be in the best interest of both their superintendent and their school division,” Patterson said.
In contrast, Shelly Norden, SBMA executive director, said the alliance believes the school board should instead prioritize more security officers at Fairfax’s elementary schools before the superintendent, costing the division at least $424,000 annually. She pointed out that the security detail could be an added expense considering there is already security at public events like board meetings and at the central administrative office.
“Adding a dedicated private security detail to these benefits would represent a further significant expense to taxpayers,” Norden said in a statement. “The school board holds the authority to approve or deny such requests. With declining enrollment and constrained budgets, this decision appears to prioritize administrative convenience over student safety.”

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)Virginia-based abortion funds are citing an increased uptick in calls to their intake lines, as more people rely on their assistance to help cover the cost and sometimes travel expenses to get abortions. 
Since federal protections were overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court three summers ago, various states have enacted restrictions or near-total bans on the procedure. With Virginia the least-restrictive southern state, several funds here told the Virginia Mercury in interviews they’re seeing a spike in assistance requests. 
But it’s not just from out-of-state patients, they said, as higher costs of living mean Virginians seeking abortions have also needed a boost from organizations like the Blue Ridge Abortion Fund (BRAF), Richmond Reproductive Freedom Project (RRFP) or Hampton Roads Reproductive Justice League (HRRJL). 
Over the past year, BRAF said it supported over 2,300 callers and saw a 54% increase in funding provided for callers. Before 2023, about 15% of people BRAF supported came from out of state, but that number now accounts for 25% of people the fund has served as of this year. 
“We’re seeing a ripple effect,” executive director April Greene shared in a recent call.
Other Virginian abortion funding groups echo that they’re seeing requests for assistance from North Carolinians, Georgians and Floridians in particular. 
Florida and Georgia ban the procedure after 6 weeks (a time when some people are just learning they are pregnant), while North Carolina blocks the procedure after 12 weeks. The longer it takes to afford, schedule and travel for an abortion and the further into pregnancy a person becomes, the higher the need to come to a state like Virginia, which caps most abortions around 26 weeks, rises.
Abortion providers challenge FDA’s remaining mifepristone restrictions in federal court

A spokesperson from RRFP noted that out-of-state patients can strain the resources for Virginia patients too. But this is also why Greene, from BRAF, said several funds in various states remain in communication with each other. 
Greene explained that abortion funds are more than a fund for patients to tap into; they are also a source of moral support and information. 
This is particularly the case, she said, for patients who need to travel further for care, or ones who reach out with questions and are counseled or comforted by intake staff while they navigate delays in locking down appointments. Sometimes funds help patients book hotel rooms or flights as needed, or even talk someone through their pre-flight jitters if it’s their first time on a plane. 
“We’re sort of walking alongside people so much longer than people would think,” Greene said. “It’s not just ‘here’s 500 dollars for your abortion.’ It’s so much more than that.” 
Sara Blachman, a volunteer with the Hampton Roads Reproductive Justice League, said that the largest increase in out-of-state callers her organization has seen are people coming from Georgia or Florida. 
“Being located in Hampton Roads we have always had callers from North Carolina, and callers from our neighboring state seem to be increasing too,” she said in an email. 
Blachman added that the fund usually gets between 50 and 70 calls a week, despite only having the funding to make three to five pledges a week. RRFP relayed that their funding line was typically open from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. prior to the overturn of Roe, but now, they are routinely flooded with calls and have had to close their line earlier in the day. 
“While some of this is due to more people and clinics knowing about us, more importantly it’s a reflection of the higher need we are seeing,” the spokesperson said. 
New River Abortion Access Fund, which is rooted in Southwest Virginia but like its counterparts connects patients around the state, has suspended its hotline for the time being. 
Its director, Val Washington, connected with The Mercury but was unable to follow through on an interview to glean more details by the time of this publication.
Meanwhile, the costs associated with getting an abortion in the first place has also been rising amid national inflation. As out-of-state patients seek to tap into Virginia funds, the RRFP spokesperson also noted cost burdens on Virginians. 
“People in Virginia need more support than before because the cost of living (which affects the cost of food, hotels, rideshare rides, gas, etc. around appointment dates) has increased without their wages increasing,” the spokesperson said. “Even a meal after an abortion is much more expensive now than it was five years ago, and that has nothing to do with overturning Roe.”
Newer to the abortion assistance landscape is State Line Abortion Access Partners (SLAAP), which has its “Last Mile Fund.” Anchored in Bristol along the Virginia and Tennessee border, the hyper-local fund “bridges the gap” for people who have secured money for abortion care but still need some help. The organization coordinates with other abortion funds to help transport patients to a reproductive health clinic in Bristol by reimbursing volunteer drivers for gas. 
With a rise in demand, sometimes the fundraising keeps pace, and sometimes it doesn’t.
Greene from BRAF shared that the fund noted a surge in donations around the time that Roe was overturned and supporting abortion access was top of mind for people feeling philanthropic. Those numbers eventually dropped, but Greene said that funds like BRAF began to strategize how to meet the needs of the people it serves and sustain itself. 
“We were incredibly lucky over the past few years to get some infrastructure,” Greene said. 
This came in the form of support through the National Network of Abortion Funds and tapping into other organizations. 
And while abortion funds aren’t directly affected by federal funding freezes, Greene still said funding organizations are watching with caution. 
For instance, three Virginia-based Planned Parenthood clinics have been waiting for federal funding tethered to family planning and cancer screening services for low-income people amid a federal funding freeze announced this spring. Though the funding is not connected to abortions specifically, the fact that Planned Parenthood clinics do provide the procedure has drawn ire from abortion opponents. Legal battles are also underway regarding other federal funding that clinics have historically received. 
Still, Greene said that BRAF missed out on some non-federal grant funding this year — necessitating a small budget reduction for the time being. 
“I think everyone’s a little tentative, a little bit unsure about what’s happening in the philanthropic landscape,” she said.

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)Chesterfield native Deborah Ragsdale spent the summer stressed out by  trying to find a new place to live. Her previous residence failed health and safety inspections, which are mandatory for landlords who rent to housing voucher recipients like Ragsdale, who is also disabled. 
Then, Housing Opportunities Made Equal, or HOME of Virginia, stepped in. The organization helped Ragsdale navigate her journey to a new home in Henrico County, a service they and similar housing organizations perform for thousands of Virginians each year.
‘A smack in the face:’ Vouchers holders fear federal housing cuts

“If I didn’t have her, if I didn’t have her voice, I don’t know where I would be today,” Ragsdale said of Teneika Jones, a housing specialist with HOME.
Vouchers help Ragsdale live independently and keep close to her grandchildren; she’s envisioning them playing at a park near her new home. The stress of finding a place to liveis finally melting away for her, but for nonprofit workers and others who aid in building housing safety nets, troubling new challenges are on the horizon as the federal funding landscape experiences seismic shifts. 
White House budget proposals earlier this summer sugget deep cuts for housing programs that Virginia has long relied on to help struggling renters, first-time homebuyers and those who are unhoused and in need of shelter. The federal funds at risk also support organizations that fight housing discrimination and generally assist people with locking down a place to live.
President Donald Trump’s budget requests would eliminate or reduce funding streams from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), including Community Development Block Grants, the Fair Housing Initiative Program and the vouchers that people like Ragsdale depend on. 
Nearly 200,000 homes in Virginia receive some form of support from HUD, according to an analysis from the Virginia Housing Alliance. About 50,000 of those residents use vouchers.
While recent movement in Congress shows the changes may not come to fruition in the next year, some funding changes are already unfolding for localities. For instance, Richmond’s public housing authority has stopped issuing new housing vouchers amid federal funding reductions. Those particular reductions stem from Richmond’s inability to utilize all of the vouchers it was funded for, essentially due to landlords not accepting them. 
“We are putting vouchers on the street,” Richmond Redevelopment and Housing Authority CEO Steven Nesmith told The Richmonder earlier this summer.  “But “landlords are saying — I’m just being real with you — ‘I’m not accepting those people.’” 
That’s where organizations like HOME come in to help. Spokesman Lance Warren said the “obstacles are all too familiar.” 
Though state law makes it illegal to refuse an applicant based on the source of funds used to pay rent, like vouchers, he said it’s not uncommon for his organization or the local housing authority to encounter landlords that refuse to comply. 
For now, voucher access and other federal housing funding aren’t “further hurt by Congress,” but they also aren’t “further helped,” Warren said. 
Existing voucher users are still facing their own hurdles, despite the assistance on paper.
Kimyade Richardson-Keys said he and his wife were rejected multiple times in the process of searching for apartments and homes this spring and summer before landing a place in Southside Richmond. He works at Chippenham Hospital and his wife is a caretaker. While they hope to eventually move to Chester, for now they are grateful for their place in Richmond. 
“We finally found the place we’re at now with a landlord who was extremely nice and pleasant and helpful getting us in there,” he said. 
It wasn’t easy though, Richardson-Keys said. He believes their status as housing voucher recipients made some places turn them away or string them along until they would walk away. 
“A couple of them were discriminating against us,” he said. “I think that was the basis of it because we have a good credit score, good rental history, so everything down the board was checked off.”
At above 650, his credit score is considered fair. Eligibility for housing voucher assistance is typically determined by income levels, not credit scores. Richardson-Keys’ credit score, which indicates he prioritizes paying bills on time and avoiding incurring too much debt, is part of why landlords review would-be tenants’ credit when approving or rejecting applications.
He attributed his family’s ultimate success to the “magic that Mrs. Jones was working.”
Jones, who used to work for RRHA, said she’s seen a variety of renters over the years that rely on organizations like HOME of Virginia and the housing authority to afford a place to live. Her experience helps her understand the concerns some landlords might possess around housing voucher clients, but she noted that the stigma is mostly inaccurate. 
“Do you have families that definitely don’t pay their portion or have damages to the house?  Absolutely, but it is a very small drop in the pond,” Jones said. “Most people work, they pay their bills — they just need a little help.”
More often than not, she said,  housing voucher recipients are misunderstood and judged. It’s a personal lived experience for her as well, having been a recipient at one point in her life. 
“I remember how people used to treat me,” she said, reflecting on the tough time she had as a single mother after her children’s father died. She brings that perspective to the table when helping her clients complete housing applications or relocate.
Jones said she feels like there are incidents where Virginia landlords have been able to discriminate against would-be renters without technically violating any laws. 
“We have great landlords that we work with, and property managers, but some of them have found ways to exclude people legally,”she said.
For instance, landlords can choose to not renew leases, or sometimes there are abatement issues like Ragsdale experienced when her property failed safety inspections and she had to move. Warren warns that it’s these cracks in the system that organizations like HOME watch out for and help people overcome.

If you buy your own health insurance in Arkansas, expect to start paying more in a few months — a lot more — thanks to Republicans in Congress and President Donald Trump.
Rates for individual plans are set to rise by an average of 36% next year, according to proposed 2026 rate filings by BlueCross and Centene, the two companies that sell policies on the Arkansas Health Insurance Marketplace.
Most Americans who buy a marketplace plan get financial help from the federal government through tax subsidies created by the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, the 2010 health reform legislation often called “Obamacare.” But those ACA subsidies are set to shrink next year, and congressional Republicans refuse to extend them.




Some 166,000 Arkansans get their insurance on the marketplace as of now. Most of them will face a major rate hike — or simply be priced out of coverage — if the changes take effect.




Last week, Gov. Sarah Sanders said the companies’ proposed rate hikes are “unacceptable” and called on the commissioner of the Arkansas Insurance Department to reject them.







It’s tough talk, but talk is cheap. Health care is not. As governor, Sanders aims to cut health spending at the state level and supports Republican cuts at the federal level. If she truly cared about preventing rate increases for Arkansans, she’d call on Congress to keep the current ACA subsidies in place, or she’d find money elsewhere. Instead, she’s trying to distract us with fake populism by attacking a corporate villain everyone loves to hate — insurance companies.



The state Insurance Department isn’t answering questions about any of it, including basic questions about the agency’s timeline to make a decision about rates. But here’s what we know.




 Rates in real life


Rate increases are a fact of life in the perennially broken American health system. As the cost of doctors and hospitals and prescription drugs rises, so does the cost of insurance. Insurers file their rate adjustments for the upcoming year with the Insurance Department annually, which hires independent actuaries to determine whether the proposed changes are reasonable.
The rate hikes for individual plans in the past five years have been between 2% and 6%, as outlined here by the Arkansas Center for Health Improvement. That adds up, but it’s in the same ballpark as recent annual hikes for employer-sponsored insurance. A single-year increase of 36% is a different story.



And that’s an average increase. Costs vary from carrier to carrier, and the premiums on some Centene plans are projected to increase by more than 50%. Remember also that costs vary from person to person, depending on factors like age and family size.



So what’s happening here? It’s helpful to first back up for a quick refresher on how the Affordable Care Act works.
The ACA made insurance available to more Americans in two main ways. First, it expanded Medicaid, the country’s patchy safety net insurance program, to cover low-income households. “Medicaid expansion” is available to those making under 138% of the federal poverty line, a measure of income that depends on family size. In 2025, 138% of the poverty line was about $21,600 annually for a single person; for a three-person household it was about $36,800.
In Arkansas, the Medicaid expansion program is called ARHOME, and it gives essentially free coverage to some 230,000 people who are below the 138% threshold. The federal government pays for most of the cost of that coverage (90%) and the state pays the rest. (Medicaid expansion still hasn’t happened in some red states, like Texas.)
ARHOME could be affected by the proposed insurance rate increases too, thanks to some complicated quirks of how the expansion program is set up in Arkansas. But for now, the focus is on the second piece of the ACA — federal subsidies for individual plans sold by private companies on the health insurance marketplace.
For most people with incomes above 138% of the poverty line who can’t get insurance through a job or a spouse, buying an individual plan is the only option. To make the premiums on those plans more affordable, the ACA created a sliding scale of “premium tax credits” that depend on income. If you’re a single person in Arkansas making $25,000 annually, you make slightly too much to qualify for Medicaid expansion, but you can get a tax credit — a subsidy — that covers most of the cost of buying a private plan on the marketplace.
From the beginning, though, there was a problem with the ACA marketplace: The subsidies were too stingy. Some people signed up, but many others still found individual plans to be prohibitively expensive even with the subsidy. So while Medicaid expansion was very successful in getting more Americans covered, the marketplace was less so — until the COVID pandemic created an opportunity.
President Joe Biden’s American Rescue Plan made the ACA subsidies larger for everyone and also removed a cap on the upper end of the income sliding scale. Under the original ACA, people making four times the federal poverty level (400%) simply didn’t get any help at all and had to pay the full cost of insurance out of pocket. The Biden policy — which was later extended under the Inflation Reduction Act — gave modest subsidies to those above 400% as well.
The result was dramatic. In 2020, there were just 64,000 Arkansans insured through an individual marketplace plan. This year, with “enhanced” ACA subsidies now making insurance affordable, there are 166,000, according to the health policy nonprofit KFF.
The enhanced ACA subsidies are set to expire at the end of 2025, though, and Republicans have shown no interest in extending them. Insurance companies expect tons of people, especially those young and healthy enough to feel like they can risk it, to drop their coverage in 2026 as a result. And crucially, the people left behind in the risk pool will be sicker and more expensive to insure on the whole, thus driving up per-person costs.
To see this dynamic at play, it’s helpful to look at a specific example. The inimitable DIY health policy analyst Charles Gaba has run the numbers on Arkansas’ proposed rate hikes with and without the enhanced ACA subsidies. Right now, a 30-year-old single mom in Arkansas who makes a $40,000 salary can buy a solid, mid-tier insurance plan for herself for about $61 a month — a pretty good deal. (Her child will almost certainly be covered by ARKids, the Medicaid-funded program for children.) Without the enhanced subsidy, though, she will pay a $214 monthly premium.
That’s an increase of $153, or 250%. Will the average 30-year-old single mom with a $40K income pay $1,832 more annually to keep her health insurance? Or will she opt to pay for groceries, bills, child care, a vehicle and a roof over her family’s heads? There’s no question — unless she’s already sick. The only scenario where she’d prioritize buying health coverage is if she absolutely has to have it, due to a chronic illness, high-cost prescriptions or other health needs. And if she uses her insurance frequently, that will cost the insurance company more money — even as it has less money coming in the door due to other people dropping coverage.
Multiply this dynamic by tens of thousands of individuals, and the proposed Arkansas rate hikes make more sense.
Gaba runs through various other examples in his charts, including a four-person family with mom and dad both age 40. If they make $70,000 annually, they now pay about $138 monthly in premiums. When the enhanced ACA subsidies go away, that will more than triple, to $436 monthly.
Or imagine an older couple who are both 64 (just one year shy of Medicare eligibility) and make $90,000, placing them above that 400% poverty line mark. Right now, with the enhanced ACA subsidies in place, they pay a hefty $638 monthly in premium. That will become a back-breaking $2,915 monthly payment in 2026.
The enhanced ACA subsidies aren’t the only thing behind the rate hikes. General inflation plays a role, as do various other policy changes at the state level. But the insurers themselves say the main driver is that the subsidies are shrinking.
A filing from Centene with the Arkansas Insurance Department puts it this way: “Most notably, as [enhanced ACA subsidies] expire and enrollees face increased out-of-pocket premiums, we assume healthier individuals who tend to be more price sensitive will exit the market, worsening the average morbidity of the individual risk pool.”
(All the filings from the carriers can be found here on the Insurance Department’s website. Though there are six companies listed, note that they’re all some form of either Arkansas Blue Cross & Blue Shield or Centene. Centene is the parent company of Celtic Insurance Company (Ambetter), QCA Health Plan, Inc., and QualChoice Life and Health Insurance Company, Inc. Health Advantage, USAble HMO, Inc. (Octave) and USAble Mutual Insurance Co. are all affiliated with Blue Cross.)
A cynical ploy
The end of the enhanced ACA subsidies isn’t a direct result of Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill, though it’s fair to conflate the two. The point of the bill was to prevent Trump’s first-term tax cuts from expiring. Republicans could have stopped the enhanced subsidies from expiring as well. But that would have meant less money for tax cuts.
Instead of preserving the subsidies, the Trump bill reduced federal health care spending by hundreds of billions of dollars in the years to come, mostly via Medicaid cuts that won’t kick in until after next year’s midterm elections. Republicans hope voters have short memories and aren’t planning ahead. But the surge in health insurance premiums is coming now, and not just in Arkansas. A KFF analysis found a median proposed premium increase of 18% nationwide.
Maybe that’s why Sanders is trying to get out ahead of this issue. Shouting and pointing fingers at the insurance companies might distract from the truth that her party set these price increases in motion by chopping health spending to pay for tax cuts.
Sanders wholeheartedly supported the Big, Beautiful Bill as written and cheered when it passed. She was even engaged in the legislative process, penning a Washington Post op-ed that urged Congress to strip out a policy on state-level AI regulation that she and other red-state governors objected to. She didn’t utter a word about the need to extend the enhanced ACA subsidies and still hasn’t, as far as we know.
But here she is, roleplaying as an economic populist about a rate hike created by her own party’s regressive policies. Note that there’s no trace of a solution in Sanders’ statement on the issue, and no mention of what might be causing it, other than BlueCross and Centene putting “corporate profits over Arkansas’s people.”
Strange words to hear from a governor who signed three rounds of corporate income tax cuts during her first 18 months in office, reducing state revenue collection from businesses by 28% last year, or $212 million. That’s money that could be used to help people afford health care. Instead, Sanders is looking for ways to cut health spending to make budgetary room for more tax cuts and school vouchers.
She’s looking to implement a Medicaid work requirement expected to kick thousands of poor and working Arkansans off their insurance in advance of the nationwide changes in the federal Trump bill. She’s made Arkansas one of two states in the country that yank Medicaid coverage away from new mothers just two months after birth (the 48 other states extend coverage to 12 months postpartum). And the bill that just passed Congress is going to cut Medicaid further over the next few years.
Americans are understandably furious at the insurance industry. Polls have shown a substantial minority of people are sympathetic to Luigi Mangione, the man who allegedly killed UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson on the street in Manhattan in December. But the rot of the health care system goes far beyond greedy insurance companies. It’s just as much about doctors incentivized to perform unnecessary tests, hospitals that bill at wildly inflated rates for routine procedures, nursing homes seeking new ways to squeeze profit from residents and overworked CNAs, drugmakers and medical supply companies that game the system, and on and on.
Now, Republican policies are driving health insurance prices upward even further. With her acutely tuned PR antennae, Sanders knows the public anger is there. With her bluster and misdirection, she’s working hard to make sure none of that anger is pointed her way.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_4531-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-18 05:57:12.008052

As a child, I had a great deal of anxiety. If you’ve ever seen me speak in public, that might surprise you. But anxiety among children is extremely common and affects almost all children, to varying degrees.
During pre-pandemic times, researchers noted that as many as 7% of children had a diagnosable anxiety disorder that disrupted their everyday functioning. In addition, 20% had a tendency to feel anxious that didn’t rise to the level of a clinical disorder. And all children feel anxious at some time or another.
Most researchers have found that anxiety in children increased during and after the pandemic. Lockdowns that isolated children from their peers and interruptions to their routines may have accounted for the findings in these studies.
As a researcher who’s studied children’s mental health for decades, I know that predictability helps prevent anxiety in children. Predictability means things going along as they’ve always gone: sleep at night, up in the morning, cornflakes for breakfast, off to school, activities in the afternoon, dinner with the family. In Louise Fitzhugh’s children’s novel “Harriet the Spy,” Harriet’s mother can’t believe that her daughter always takes a tomato sandwich to school. Always. Harriet has no interest in variety. She’s perfectly happy with the same sandwich, year after year.
Anxiety will crop up for many children again this fall, and it can be intertwined with other feelings, such as excitement and shyness. Here are steps parents can take to help reduce their kids’ back-to-school anxiety and encourage a better start to the fall term.
1. Look for general symptoms of anxiety

	
Ask your kids how they’re feeling about going back to school, and keep an eye out for headaches, stomachaches, sleeping troubles, persistent “what if” questions, crankiness, excessive concern about very distant events, problems focusing on schoolwork and concerns that aren’t alleviated by logical explanations. An example might be your children worrying that they won’t have friends in school, even though they do have friends from their class last year; or concerns that while they’re at school, something extremely unlikely will happen, such as the house being hit by lightning.
What’s tricky, of course, is that any of these behaviors can be an indication of many different problems, so probe further. Talking to your kids about their thoughts may help you unravel whether they’re feeling anxious.
 2. Encourage activities that reduce anxiety

Playing outside, playing with friends or even just “hanging out” can be powerful ways to reduce negative feelings. Outdoors, people often feel more relaxed. Playing in an unstructured way – that is, without someone else telling them what or how to play – allows kids to work through their feelings and reduce anxiety.
 3. Limit kids’ screen time

Researchers have found that, post-pandemic, more children are using different types of digital devices, along with more social media apps. The significant body of evidence finding a link between excessive digital device use and anxiety suggests that these increases in device use may contribute to increased anxiety rates in children.
 4. Focus on family activities

The emotional connection that children have with their families is their psychological anchor during difficult times. At a time of increased stress and uncertainty, spending time with family can be an antidote. Take a walk or a hike together, eat dinner together, or play board games.
 5. Embrace distraction

Distraction isn’t a cure for anxiety, but it can diminish its intensity and help sufferers think more clearly about the source of their worries. When children are feeling very anxious, it’s fine to talk to them about how watching TV or reading a funny book can help them feel calmer.
 6. Get professional help when needed

If your child’s anxiety is interfering with sleep, eating, socializing or school attendance, and it persists beyond a few days, it’s a good idea to call your pediatrician or family doctor and report what’s going on. Medical professionals who work with children have seen anxiety skyrocket among kids, and they know how to get your child the necessary help.
As with any back-to-school season, you may find yourself shopping for binders and backpacks. However, children and their anxiety may also need your attention. Practicing simple prevention and intervening when necessary can get your kids off to a great school year.

(Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)“What are the consequences?” 
This is the question Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows kept asking during discussions of President Donald Trump’s efforts to change the voting process at the conference of the National Association of Secretaries of State, the oldest nonpartisan professional organization for public officials, in Biloxi, Mississippi earlier this month. 
The day after it ended, Aug. 8, Bellows officially responded to the U.S. Department of Justice’s request for sweeping voter data, questioning the federal agency’s intentions and asking that the request be withdrawn. She has yet to receive a response. 
“What we’re seeing right now is a dramatic expansion in federal power, coming from the Trump administration, over the states and the people that upends the very concept of our democratic republic,” Bellows said in a sit-down with Maine Morning Star after the conference. “Anyone who cares about states’ rights and individual freedom should be concerned about federal agencies engaged in an unprecedented power grab.”
Bellows, a Democrat who is running for governor in 2026, said she was reassured to hear from secretaries on both sides of the aisle who are concerned about federal intrusion into elections, which are administered by the states, not the federal government, under the U.S. Constitution.  
But she returned from the conference with more questions than answers regarding the Trump administration’s intentions and the repercussions of some secretaries embracing the federal requests.
Proof of citizenship
Trump wants Congress to pass a national proof of citizenship voter registration requirement and in March tried to unilaterally impose one for federal elections through executive order, but the legislation stalled and the order was halted by the courts. 
Some states have individually passed laws to require documented proof of citizenship to vote, including New Hampshire and Wyoming, whose secretaries of state presented at the conference. A federal judge dismissed a lawsuit against Wyoming’s law in July. Two lawsuits filed against New Hampshire’s law are still pending in federal district court. 
“All of us agree that only citizens should vote in federal elections. That’s in the Constitution. That’s not the debate,” Bellows said. 
Rather, Bellows’ concern is how added requirements would work in practice and, she expects, could create barriers for legitimate voters, particularly in a state like Maine with sizable rural, low-income and senior populations. 
Already, people registering to vote must sign a statement affirming they are citizens under penalty of perjury. Noncitizens who register to vote or cast a ballot face criminal penalties and deportation. 
One study of the 2016 election estimated the prevalence of noncitizen voting at 0.0001% of votes cast. However, conservatives in Maine and elsewhere have shared unsubstantiated claims of noncitizen voting.
“Then the concern becomes, from a very practical place, what is the impact on actual citizens and their constitutional right to vote?” Bellows said. 
In New Hampshire, some legitimate voters have been turned away due to the new requirements. Bellows, who oversees Maine’s Bureau of Motors Vehicles, says insight into potential impact in Maine can be gleaned from the rollout of Real ID requirements, which she says have tripped up long-time Mainers while being easier for new citizens who have their documents readily available.  
For example, she said, some people who grew up in Aroostook or Washington counties were born in Canada because the nearest hospital was across the border, so birth certificates aren’t a document they can use for citizenship proof. 
“We have heard from dozens of customers who have complained that it has sometimes taken them many months or almost a year to get certified birth certificates from other states if they were born out of state,” Bellows said, “or marriage information from other states. Particularly people who’ve experienced both marriage and divorce, those documents may not be documents that they have kept.”   
Seniors are the least likely to have that documented proof, partly because of higher likelihood of misplacement or damage over time, Bellows said, plus the added barrier of having to pay to get new copies. 
“Ironically, some of these policies are most likely to disproportionately impact senior citizens living in rural areas, which predominantly voted for Trump in the last election,” she said. 
With federal legislation and the executive order stalled, the Trump administration is attempting a backdoor way to accomplish its goal of requiring documented proof of citizenship for voting, Maine Morning Star’s partner outlet reports.  
The Trump administration is urging states to use an existing federal immigration database, called the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) program, that it has refashioned into a platform to verify voters’ citizenship. 
Originally intended to help state and local officials verify the immigration status of people seeking government benefits, searching one name at a time, SAVE can now do bulk searches, allowing for the scanning of full voter rolls. These changes also come as the U.S. Department of Justice is asking Maine and other states for copies of their voter rolls. 
Bellows told Stateline she had a recent phone call with officials at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security who said the agency planned to retain SAVE data for 10 years for “audit purposes only.”
“Just like the [Justice Department] is asking us to hand over an electronic file of all the voters in our state, it seems like the Department of Homeland Security is through this backdoor system also asking us to share voter information about every voter in our state,” Bellows told Stateline. 
Voting equipment
Another possible change to elections discussed at the conference was also part of Trump’s executive order but hasn’t drawn as much attention: directing the independent Election Assistance Commission to amend a set of security benchmarks for voting machines.
Donald Palmer, commissioner of the Election Assistance Commission who was nominated to the role by Trump in 2019, gave a presentation on how the commission is trying to implement the order by amending the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines to require paper ballots and remove bar codes and QR codes, which could lead to the decertification of certain voting systems.  
“The concern about that is that seems to be a path to decertifying the election or challenging legitimate election results held by the states,” Bellows said. 
Bellows sees the move as a way the Trump administration is setting the stage for more federal intervention in future elections. 
As a member of the elections committee of National Association of Secretaries of State, Bellows said she and other secretaries continue to meet every other week, sometimes more frequently as issues emerge, to press state and federal officials on the reasoning behind voting and election changes. 
When asked about other proactive measures she is taking, Bellows said she hopes to keep the state on its current path.
“Our greatest defense against what the federal government seems to be trying to do to undermine voter confidence and take over aspects of our elections is to continue to run really great elections,” she said.

(VCU Capital News Service)The Virginia Department of Energy has officially gotten word that funding for the Solar for All program — which aimed to help lower- and moderate-income households build solar panels on their roofs — has been rescinded by the federal government.
Virginia had been awarded $156 million that would have aided an estimated 15,000 households install rooftop solar or buy into community solar projects. The state had not started rolling out the program or taken applications yet.
The program that started under the Biden administration would have provided $7 billion to states to implement it. The funding was clawed back under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, as part of government efficiency and the rollback of renewable energy programs enforced by President Donald Trump’s administration. 
“The bottom line again is this: EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a video posted to X. “With clear language and intent from Congress in the One Big Beautiful Bill, EPA is taking action to end this program for good. We are committed to the rule of law and being a good steward of taxpayer dollars.”
Virginia had chosen to use the first year of funding to establish an avenue for implementing the program, meeting with stakeholders and formulating rules but had yet to select an administrator. Applications for the grants were going to open to the public in January. Now advocates for solar are frustrated over the loss.
“You know, having grown up in a low-income community, it’s just that same vicious cycle, right? Where folks say ‘we got this money, we’re gonna help you, we want to do this.’ And then at the 11th hour, it’s, you know, we ain’t got that no more,” said Branden Praileau, the Virginia Program Director at Solar United Neighbors.  ”It’s another sad commentary of the most marginalized and the most energy burdened, continuing to be left behind.”
Praileau explained that disadvantaged families would have benefitted from solar panels on their roofs by offsetting their energy bills with the production of energy from the panels. However much energy the panels produced would be subtracted from their energy bills each month.
“The ability to reduce that energy burden by offsetting what they produce versus what they consume, literally puts money back in people’s pockets,” Praileau said. ”I can speak from a life experience there. Since we’ve been solar at my church, we’ve been able to take the 25-30% that we’ve been saving yearly in energy, and roll it into outreach ministry.”
Richard Borean, a spokesperson for the Virginia Department of Energy, said that approximately $730,000 had been spent so far during the planning period and will still be covered by the funding previously awarded. The federal government will take back the rest of the unspent award. The department is in the process of creating a webpage called “Virginia Energy Connect,”  a one-stop-shop that will allow homeowners to find energy programs they qualify for cohesively. The site is expected to launch in the coming months.
Borean also highlighted efforts by the state to invest in an “all of the above” energy profile through renewable energy, nuclear, grid reliability, etc.
The reconciliation bill that was signed into law on July 4 also does away with the 30% tax credit for the installation of solar panels on homes starting at the end of this year. Praileau said this will create even more barriers for homeowners who are interested in solar for their homes but don’t have the means to pursue it without grants and tax credits.
Praileau said the rooftop solar projects would have helped cash-strapped households get repairs to their roofs for installation. He also pointed out that many of the homes that would have qualified for this funding have not been updated in decades and don’t have ways to become more energy efficient to lower their power bills.
Clean energy advocates have said they plan to appeal the decision to end the program since the money had already been allocated to the 60 recipients.

Mike Braun to have a direct impact on utility issues in the state.
Fine has led the Office of Utility Consumer Counselor (OUCC) since 2017. The agency represents all Indiana consumers to “ensure quality, reliable utility services at the most reasonable prices possible through dedicated advocacy, consumer education and creative problem solving,” its website said.
Fine was appointed the 24th Utility Consumer Counselor for the state by then-Gov. Eric Holcomb and was reappointed in December 2020.
He led a staff of more than 50 professionals including attorneys, analysts, engineers, and additional employees who represent Indiana’s residential, commercial, and industrial ratepayer interests in state and federal utility regulatory proceedings.
Fine is retiring after 45 years of practicing law. Before joining the OUCC, he served in the Indiana House of Representatives and was a member of the Lake County Election and Voter Registration Board, the Indiana Public Defender Commission and the Board of Managers for the Lake County Bar Association.
His bio on the OUCC site said he is a former vice president and treasurer of the National Association of State Utility Consumer Advocates and currently serves on its executive committee.  Fine was a member of Indiana’s 21st Century Energy Policy Development Task Force and was on the Critical Consumer Issues Forum Advisory Committee.
A Lake County native, Fine holds degrees from the Maurer School of Law, Purdue University and Indiana University.
Gov. Mike Braun will appoint his successor.

States and clinicians are working on getting correct information on vaccines to vulnerable groups amid shifting federal guidance. (Photo illustration by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Heading into the respiratory illness season, states and clinicians are working to encourage pregnant patients to get COVID-19 vaccinations, even though the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services no longer recommends that they should.
Along with being older and having an underlying health condition, pregnancy itself is a risk factor. Pregnant women are more vulnerable to developing severe illness from COVID-19. They’re also at high risk for complications, including preterm labor and stillbirth. The vast majority of medical experts say getting the shot is safe and effective — much safer than having the illness.
But HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced in May that the agency would no longer recommend that pregnant women get the vaccine. Before testifying before Congress in June, Kennedy circulated a document on Capitol Hill claiming higher rates of fetal loss after vaccination. But the authors of those studies told Politico that their work had been misinterpreted.
Experts say the federal shift puts the onus on state health agencies to ramp up vaccine guidance and outreach. Clinicians and public health organizations are trying to dispel misinformation and make sure information reaches low-income people and people of color, who had higher maternal death rates during the pandemic. During the first two years of the pandemic, the virus contributed to a quarter of maternal deaths, according to federal data.
“We are severely disappointed,” said Dr. Neil Silverman, a professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California, Los Angeles David Geffen School of Medicine. He has studied vaccines and pregnancy for the past 15 years and specializes in high-risk pregnancies.
Silverman called the federal shift a “public health tragedy on a grand scale.”

Vaccinations against COVID-19 help prevent severe illness in pregnant people as well as their newborns, who are too young to get vaccinated, Silverman said. In what’s called passive immunity, vaccinated mothers pass on antibodies to their babies through the placenta and through breast milk.
“State public health agencies are probably going to have to implement vaccine guidance that differs from the federal recommendations. And that’s going to be an interesting can of worms,” said OB-GYN Dr. Mark Turrentine, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas.
Turrentine serves on a board of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists that focuses on immunization and infectious diseases. He said his recent pregnant patients who had COVID-19 hadn’t gotten the vaccine.
“The change in guidance on the federal level just really makes a lot of confusion, and it makes it very challenging to try to explain to individuals why all of a sudden the difference,” Turrentine said.
A slew of public health organizations have been making a concerted effort to dispel vaccine myths. They include the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit organization of maternal-fetal experts. At a news briefing the society held this month, clinicians stressed the safety and long-standing science behind COVID-19 vaccines, as well as the shots for RSV and the flu. Cases of RSV and the flu tend to peak in the winter months, while in recent years COVID-19 cases have spiked in the summer and the winter.
Dr. Brenna Hughes, an OB-GYN who chairs the organization’s infectious diseases and emerging threats committee, pointed to survey data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing that less than a third of eligible pregnant patients received COVID-19 shots, and only 38% received RSV shots for the 2023 to 2024 season. Less than half — 47% — received flu shots, and 59% received TDAP (whooping cough) vaccines.
CDC data shows that for last year’s and this year’s season, only between 12% and 14% of pregnant patients got the COVID-19 vaccine.
“The complications from the infection are so much greater than the complications and the very few and typically minor adverse events that might occur from the vaccine,” said microbiologist Sabra Klein, a professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
In June, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and 30 other professional health organizations signed a letter urging insurers to continue covering the COVID-19 shot for pregnant women, and have continued to urge coverage since then.
CVS Caremark, one of the nation’s three major pharmacy benefit managers, told Stateline it will continue covering the vaccine for pregnant women. The Arizona, California and North Carolina state Medicaid agencies also told Stateline they are still currently covering COVID-19 vaccines for pregnant women.
Black maternal health advocates, researchers press on amid federal funding cuts

Dr. Kimberly Fortner, president-elect of the Infectious Diseases Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology, said during the maternal-fetal medicine briefing that she hopes medical groups’ joint messaging will bolster insurers.
“Hopefully by us linking arms, that can then help develop consistency so that insurers will continue to pay for the vaccine,” she said.
Exacerbating disparities
Dr. Ayanna Bennett, director of the District of Columbia Department of Health, said the federal government’s new stance has upended “a system that’s been stable for a very long time.”
Bennett said her agency used federal pandemic aid to shore up vaccine outreach efforts to communities of color. Now that flow of money is ending.
The changes in federal guidance and funding will “almost certainly exacerbate” maternal health disparities, said Marie Thoma, a perinatal epidemiologist and an associate professor in the University of Maryland Department of Family Science who researches pregnancy and COVID-19.
Black and Indigenous women died at higher rates. The virus exacerbated existing racial disparities in maternal health — and created new ones: Latina mothers, who generally see low rates of maternal mortality, saw deaths surge to 28 per 100,000 in 2021. Their rate was about 12 per 100,000 in 2018, according to federal data.
“We are going in with some exposure already that we didn’t have during the start of the pandemic. So, there will be some protection, but now that will erode,” said Thoma. “If we’re not getting vaccines, or if people are hesitant to take them, we could see some increase.”
Silverman said the administration’s efforts to strip mentions of race from government policies makes it difficult for institutions to reach populations at greatest risk. He called the dismissal of decades of data “saddening and infuriating.”
“The politicization of the vaccine process, or access to it, is what concerns me the most,” said Dr. Yvette Martas, a Connecticut OB-GYN who chairs the board of directors of the Hispanic Health Council.
Many women “are trying to navigate an economic system that’s not always in their favor in terms of also providing access to the kind of educational material that they need,” she said.
Not just COVID-19
In June, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee, replacing them with some members who are vaccine skeptics.
The change is creating chaos. Some states have vaccine laws, such as mandates for kids and coverage statutes, that are specifically tied to the committee’s decisions.











The politicization of the vaccine process, or access to it, is what concerns me the most.


– Dr. Yvette Martas, a Connecticut OB-GYN who chairs the board of directors of the Hispanic Health Council



The Vaccine Integrity Project at the University of Minnesota called on frontline health workers, health officials and professional societies to “counter the spread of inaccurate and confusing vaccine information.”
At a news briefing this month held by the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, representatives from Alabama, Connecticut and Washington, D.C., said they will continue to recommend vaccines.
Alabama’s state health officer, Dr. Scott Harris, said clinicians will be instrumental in getting correct vaccination information to patients.
“We don’t think that we necessarily have the same authoritative voice that we might have had a decade ago in trying to guide people in what to do, but we do believe that people trust their health care providers in most cases and are certainly willing to listen to them,” he said at the briefing.
Bennett said she is hopeful that strong, consistent messaging from respected medical organizations will help combat confusion.
“Having established groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics or the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology make very firm recommendations that keep us essentially not changed from where we have been, I think, should reassure families,” she said.

Amber Roldan/Georgia RecorderCanceled pride graduation celebrations. Eliminated resource centers for LGBTQ students. Tighter rules for using a preferred name on class rosters and student IDs. These are some of the casualties on Georgia college campuses as a national push to erase DEI initiatives and programs takes hold.
University System of Georgia schools across the state have adopted a variety of changes in response to a flurry of federal orders from the Trump administration. Republican state lawmakers have also pursued a ban on DEI programs and policies in Georgia’s public schools and universities. 
Georgia Southern was one of the first universities in the state to roll back DEI initiatives according to Chanel Haley, deputy director with Georgia Equality, which advocates on behalf of LGBTQ Georgians. Concerned students reached out to Haley after the school cancelled graduation ceremonies that previously celebrated the achievements of LGBTQ+ students.
“I think that people need to realize it’s harm for everybody, not just LGBTQ students,” Haley said about DEI rollbacks.
In Atlanta, Georgia Tech dissolved their LGBTQIA+ Resource Center, Women’s Resource Center and Black Culture, Innovation and Technology team and moved them under the university’s Arts, Belonging and Community Department.
“Every university had a DEI office, and now we don’t, that’s a 180 degree turn,” said Matthew Boedy, who is president of the Georgia chapter of the American Association of University Professors. 
‘A place they can go’ 
With a student population over 45,000, Kennesaw State University is one of the larger public universities in the metro Atlanta area. Located towards the north end of Cobb County, KSU’s wider community has earned a progressive reputation in recent years. New policies at KSU have inspired a wave of opposition on and off campus as the community continues to express disappointment. 
Some of the changes have affected programs and policies that once benefited LGBTQ+ students. 
Ames West, a KSU senior, grew up in an evangelical household where being a part of the LGBTQ+ community was considered a “grave sin.” At KSU, West became a familiar face at the LGBTQ+ resource center and befriended numerous peers who shared similar stories. 
Last spring, KSU internally announced that the center would no longer cater specifically to LGBTQ+ students and would be rebranded as a part of a new Department of Student Engagement and Support. 
“This shift includes reorganizing various student programs into targeted support hubs focused on key areas like career readiness, academic success, mentorship, and well-being. KSU remains committed to student success, transparency throughout the transition, and full compliance with federal, state, and University System of Georgia guidelines,” KSU’s assistant vice president of communications, Tammy DeMel, said.
As someone who visited the resource center up to three times a week, West worried about friends and students who would no longer have a place to be themselves. Fueled by fear, West helped mobilize the Kennesaw Pride Alliance, a support network for LGBTQ+ KSU students, to look for solutions.
“I just couldn’t sit back and do nothing,” West said.
“We don’t care how much it costs, we don’t care how much it takes, we’re going to make sure our community on campus has a place they can go that has the support they need so that they do not feel left alone or like no one’s there to help them,” West added.
After spending the better part of their summer searching for a LGBTQ+ friendly space on campus, the alliance opened the doors to their new Kennesaw Pride Center in late July.
The new location is on the top floor of Kennesaw’s First United Lutheran Church, and the alliance hopes the student-run community hub and pride center becomes an inclusive spot for KSU’s LGBTQ+ community. 
Decorated with colorful flags, posters and an assortment of thrifted furniture, the center is ready to welcome students back to campus this fall. While the center will serve as a refuge to visitors in between classes, the alliance also plans to use the space to host social events including their annual pride gala.
Preferred name changes
Evelyn Priddy, a transgender sophomore studying computer engineering, expects to be directly affected by a new preferred name policy at KSU.
The change stems from a University System of Georgia policy. According to the USG Business Procedures Manual, the policy aims “to respect individuals’ preferred names while providing consistent identity management standards and reducing the risk of fraud by impersonation.”
USG notified institution presidents of the change last November and policy enforcement began July 1. Critics worry that the change has the potential of outing transgender students who no longer use their government-recognized names. 
Some transgender people refer to the names they were assigned at birth as “dead names.” For many, being referred to by a dead name can be hurtful or bring back painful memories. 
In previous years, KSU students hoping to go by a different name could submit a request to use a preferred name. Once approved, this name replaced the legal name associated with student registration. While official transcripts and degrees would still use the legal name, the policy allowed preferred names to display on student IDs and class rosters. 
Policy enforcement will now require a student’s preferred name to be placed in parentheses next to their legal name on all identifying documents.
“My legal name is going to be on every roster because I can’t file the forms to change it fast,” Priddy said. “I mean at this point I’m just gonna have to explain it. I hope I’ll be okay, but also, you could see how that could be a bit of a safety risk.”
For transgender students like Priddy who were given a name at birth that they no longer identify with, pursuing a legal name change is one of the only options. 
A legal name change process in Georgia is often a time-consuming ordeal. From paperwork to notary requirements and legal publishing policies, a name change can take weeks and become a costly feat. In Cobb County, notices must be published in the county’s local newspaper to notify community members that a petition to change a legal name has been filed. These notices must be published once every four weeks to meet the legal requirement.
In an effort to assist students directly affected by the new policy, The Southern Legal Center for Youth partnered with student organizations to host a virtual name change clinic to help students seeking a legal name change start the process.
Liz Harding Chao, the center’s founder and president created the organization after noticing a lack of local legal representation for youth in the South. As a LGBTQ+-led organization, the group noticed an increased need for legal assistance with name changes and offered support to KSU students. 
“For a lot of trans and gender-expansive folks, their dead name has a lot of baggage associated with it. It’s from a time that they often rather not remember or think about it,” Harding Chao said. 
Clinic clients represent themselves but law students and attorneys from the center help clients fill out the appropriate paperwork. The center also helps interested applicants fill out a poverty affidavit to combat any financial barriers.
Last week, KSU’s virtual clinic served seven students and accumulated a wait list with an additional 10. While the clinic helped students start the process of officially registering their preferred name, the legal change will not be completed before the first day of classes.

Chris Sununu, about 50 police departments are engaged in the accreditation process, according to John Scippa, the PSTC’s director. (Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)For decades, the Derry Police Department operated without accreditation. Officers followed policies  — some codified, others unwritten — intended to align with national standards. But no external organization audited and validated what was done.
Derry was not alone; despite the existence of a national accreditation organization since 1979, most New Hampshire law enforcement agencies have not sought or received accreditation.
But in January, that changed, when Derry obtained accreditation through a new program run by the state’s Police Standards and Training Council. It was the first New Hampshire law enforcement agency to do so.
Now, the department has a certification indicating it has implemented policies on areas ranging from reporting police misconduct, to arrest procedures, to social media use. And it must continually update those policies to address any changes from the state agency.
“They’re a living, breathing document. The standards change all the time,” said Derry Police Chief George Feole in an interview. “So that’s something that we need to be cognizant of.”
Derry’s embrace of the new program comes as part of a shift in policing in the state. Three years after the state accreditation process was created by executive order by Gov. Chris Sununu, about 50 police departments are engaged in the accreditation process, according to John Scippa, the PSTC’s director.
That 50 represents just a quarter of the more than 220 departments Scippa says exist in New Hampshire. But it is a jump up from the 15 departments that had begun accreditation in June 2024.
Today, four police departments have fully obtained the credential, Scippa says: Derry, Bow, Stratham, and Gilford. 
The PSTC is using word of mouth among police chiefs to try to drum up all interest. Enticing all agencies is still a challenge, Scippa said.
“Accreditation is important,” Scippa said in an interview. “We think it speaks to professionalizing (policing) across our state. But you know, we’re also very cognizant of the fact that there’s some agencies that are still, you know, down significantly with regard to just basic staffing.”
Born out of a recommendation by the Commission on Law Enforcement Accountability, Community, and Transparency (LEACT), the state accreditation committee came as part of a broader interest in police accountability. LEACT itself was created by Sununu in the wake of the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020. 
The wave of protests calling for police reform inspired many New Hampshire departments to implement new policies, officials say — for instance, prohibitions of the type of chokehold that caused Floyd’s death. And the movement spurred departments’ interest in accreditation as a way to validate those changes.
“CALEA looked at policies on neck restraints, vascular neck restraints, chokeholds, all those kinds of things,” said Capt. John Lavoie of the Durham Police Department, speaking on the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies. 
“They rolled out an update and said, basically, all organizations need to have these changes. You need to prohibit this. We were already doing that here at Durham PD, so we’re proud of that, that we had already had prohibitions on that.”
But some saw the national accreditation process run by CALEA as expensive and onerous. CALEA certifications require four years of audits and compliance, which in turn can necessitate an increase in police bureaucracy and travel to conferences and trainings. For smaller departments, that can be prohibitive.
To address that burden, the LEACT recommended the creation of a state accreditation process that could be a cheaper, shorter, and less demanding alternative. Sununu’s executive order made New Hampshire one of 36 states to create police accreditation commissions, and pushed the Police Standards and Training Council to develop its own accreditation requirements for departments, separate from the CALEA ones.
“When we designed the accreditation program here, we made sure that the ability to become state-level accredited would not be prohibitive for smaller agencies that may not have, like physical infrastructure,” Scippa said.
Today, the PSTC has a 99-page document outlining a number of required policies for department certification. Some touch on how departments must report police officers who have been investigated for misconduct to the exculpatory evidence schedule known as the “Laurie List.” Others dictate how strip and body cavity searches, no-knock warrants, and arrests should be used and handled. 
In order to receive accreditation, departments must develop those policies and put them in writing. Then, they must pass an audit run by state volunteers in which the policies are examined and department staff are interviewed.
For Derry, that process meant some policies that were not in writing needed to be codified, and others that were already written down needed to be amended, Feole said.
“We’ve always conducted ourselves in the professional fashion and done things according to what we call the national standard, the best practices,” Feole said. “What we did is codified everything and sought accreditation review from the state, and the state said, ‘Yes, in fact, you do meet all these standards.’”
Feole, who became police chief in 2022, said he is unaware of why Derry did not seek CALEA certification in the years earlier. But he said since obtaining the state certification, the department is planning to begin the process to be CALEA-accredited by next year, and that he has set aside funds to do so in the department’s budget.
Some New Hampshire police departments are choosing the national accreditation over the state option. Durham, which has been CALEA-certified since 1996, and has been awarded a “Certificate of Meritorious Accreditation” by CALEA for holding its accreditation for at least 15 years, is one of them. 
Lavoie said the department has determined that applying for the state accreditation would be an unnecessary cost. Following the CALEA standards has allowed Durham to stay up to date on policing, and has helped the department’s standing in the community, Lavoie said.
For instance Durham police officers are trained to not engage in high-speed pursuits except in extreme circumstances, Lavoie said, a direct result of CALEA certification. 
In early August, Todd Selig, Durham town administrator, accompanied some members of the Durham Police Department to a CALEA convention in Little Rock, Arkansas, where the department formally received its four-year re-accreditation.
“What makes me most proud, though, is not just the paperwork, the reports, or our compliance with CALEA’s high standards, although all those things matter,” Selig said in a speech at that convention. “It’s the authentic way our officers and staff connect to the people we serve, such that the department is deeply woven into the daily fabric of Durham.” 
There are legal benefits to certification, too, Lavoie and Feole say. Having updated policies can help officers avoid misconduct, can lower insurance costs, and can help departments if they are sued, he said.
“If we were to ever be sued for anything, these policies would be reviewed,” Feole said. Showing that we meet national and best practices in state best practices is going to be beneficial to us.”
Both accreditation processes require that police departments conduct anti-bias training for officers.  New Hampshire lawmakers have recently passed legislation in House Bill 2, the budget trailer bill, banning “diversity, equity, and inclusion” programs in state and local governments. The new law states that “no state funds shall be expended for DEI-related activities, including but not limited to implicit bias training” and other programs.
But Scippa argued the anti-bias trainings required in the state accreditation process would not be affected by that law and would be allowed to continue.
“We have to make sure that the police are not acting in a biased manner, whatever bias that might be,” he said. 
The New Hampshire Speaker’s Office did not reply to a request for comment Friday about the intended effect of the anti-DEI law. 
Scippa and other law enforcement officials say they hope interest in accreditation will spread to the other 150 departments over time. But they acknowledged the process is voluntary, and that some agencies may not have the resources.
“Every department, in my opinion, should seek accreditation and improve accountability to the public,” said Feole. “That’s something that’s kind of on the forefront of everybody’s mind nowadays. It improves community relations. It builds trust in the community. It makes for a better relationship between the agency and the public.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/standardssign-1024x723.jpg,,,2025-08-18 05:57:12.008052

(Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)Test wells at the Franklin County prison site yielded far less water than a typical home needs, much less a 3,000-bed prison, records show — and at least one state legislator took notice.
Well construction reports obtained from the Arkansas Department of Agriculture’s Well Water Commission show the two wells drilled at the site on Aug. 1 yielded two gallons of water per minute and ten gallons of water per hour, respectively.
According to the New York State Department of Health, well yield “is a sustainable rate of water flow, usually expressed in gallons per minute (gpm), that a well can draw continuously over an extended period.”
The typical home needs six to 12 gallons of water per minute.
According to Arkansas Department of Health records, each of the four water wells supplying water to the DOC’s Tucker Unit uses 51.9 gpm on average, or 207.63 gpm across all four. The Tucker Unit is a 2,000-bed facility.
The well reports contradict what representatives from Vanir, the firm contracted to manage the prison construction, told the Board of Corrections about the test well flow rates at the beginning of the month. In their report to the board, Vanir said the test wells were yielding 15-16 gallons a minute and 5 gallons a minute, also noting that those numbers were preliminary.
The board authorized spending $50,000 to drill the wells in June, part of preliminary site work to determine whether the land can support the prison, which was not done prior to the state’s purchase of the Franklin County property.
Arkansas corrections board orders wells to be drilled at Franklin County prison site

Critics of the prison plan have questioned whether local infrastructure is capable of supporting the site’s water and wastewater needs since Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced the land purchase last Halloween.
The site is roughly 26 miles from Fort Smith and 19 miles from Ozark. Fort Smith said earlier this summer that it could not support the prison’s water or wastewater needs. Ozark passed a resolution in February saying the town of 3,601 people couldn’t either, noting the prison would put substantial strain on its budget and infrastructure if the project moved forward.
Corrections board Chairman Benny Magness seemed to acknowledge the dwindling options for utilities for the project when the drilling was approved in June, saying that if the test wells proved unsatisfactory, the board would likely need to begin exploring other site options for the prison.
Magness did not respond to a request for comment for this story.
Department of Corrections spokesperson Rand Champion did not answer specific questions about the discrepancy or why it arose other than to say that all numbers are preliminary.
“At this time, all the reports and numbers we have are preliminary,” Champion said in an email. “Once those reports are finalized, it will give the Board and the Department a better idea of what we’re dealing with and next steps.”
Once the reports are finalized, Champion said, the results will be analyzed to determine “next steps.” However, much will depend on the architectural and engineering contract, he added. That contract still hasn’t been approved by the Arkansas Legislative Council.
During an ALC meeting Friday, Sen. Gary Stubblefield, R-Branch, referenced the discrepancy in the yield amounts when questioning DOC Chief Financial Officer Chad Brown as the council considered approval of a routine on-call engineering contract.
“We’re getting so much misinformation, that I would like to know why, why you guys can’t get your facts straight,” said Stubblefield, who has been a vocal opponent of the Franklin County site.
DOC Chief of Staff Wade Hodge told Stubblefield he got his information about the test wells from Vanir and didn’t know about the other flow numbers.
Arkansas officials ‘kept in the dark’ over state’s land purchase for new prison

Adam Watson, another prison opponent who recently sent legislators a request for an investigation into the prison site selection process, said that regardless of what the correct yield number is, it won’t be enough to supply the prison.
“There’s no, no reality where those wells are capable of fulfilling the needs,” Watson said in an interview last week. “So the last ditch effort will be going to Ozark to see if they can pull water from there, which Ozark City Council has passed a resolution stating that the city is against this project and the way that it’s been handled.”
Watson said that if the state had done its “due diligence” before committing to the Franklin County property, everyone would have been better off.
“If they would have done their due diligence to start with … we wouldn’t be sitting here a year later with the most basic question about building a new prison still unanswered: Where the hell is the water going to come from?”

President Donald Trump’s administration has ordered some retiring coal plants to stay online, even as they have struggled to remain economically viable. (Photo by Liam Niemeyer/Kentucky Lantern) Mandates from President Donald Trump’s administration to retain aging coal plants could cause a massive spike in energy costs, according to an independent analysis commissioned by several environmental groups.
Orders from the U.S. Department of Energy to save coal plants from retirement could cost ratepayers more than $3 billion per year, according to a report from Grid Strategies, a power sector consulting firm. It was carried out on behalf of Earthjustice, Environmental Defense Fund, Natural Resources Defense Council and Sierra Club.
Under Trump, the agency has issued emergency orders to maintain operations at coal plants that were scheduled for retirement. While federal officials say the coal plants need to stay online to avoid blackouts, power plant owners and state regulators planned their closures because they were no longer economically viable or needed for reliability.
“DOE mandates override those well-informed decisions, inflating electric bills for homeowners and businesses and undermining the competitiveness of U.S. factories and data centers,” the Grid Strategies analysis found.
Across the country, coal plants have phased out as they’ve struggled to compete with cheaper renewables and natural gas. A 2023 analysis by Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan think tank, found that 99% of existing U.S. coal plants “are more expensive to run than replacement by local wind, solar, and energy storage resources.”
But Trump, who has pushed to unleash more fossil fuel development and to stymie wind and solar, has ordered a retiring coal plant in Michigan to stay online, along with an oil and gas plant in Pennsylvania.
“Based on the trend to date and indications that DOE has approached the owners of many retiring fossil power plants about potentially mandating their retention, DOE may attempt to mandate the retention of nearly all large fossil power plants slated for retirement between now and the end of 2028,” reads the Grid Strategies report.
The cost of keeping those plants online would be immense. By 2028, if Trump were to mandate the retention of all fossil fuel plants slated for retirement, the annual cost to ratepayers would be more than $3.1 billion, the analysis found.
The report also considers a number of aging plants that are not yet scheduled for retirement. It finds Trump’s actions could create a “perverse incentive,” causing plant owners to claim they’re planning to shut down, inducing the feds to step in and keep them open, with the cost borne by ratepayers.
Accounting for that possibility, the report found that ratepayer costs could reach $5.9 billion per year to keep the entire aging fossil fuel fleet online. California, Texas and Colorado would see the highest increases in electricity bills.

However, Ohio U.S. Sens. Jon Husted and Bernie Moreno, both Republicans, won’t say whether they’ll act to renew the program.
The subsidy is known as the “enhanced premium tax credit.” It was created during the coronavirus pandemic to make insurance purchased on the marketplace created by the Affordable Care Act more affordable. 
It’s available to people making between 100% and 400% of federal poverty guidelines. For a family of three, that’s between $26,650 and $106,600 a year. Nearly 20 million Americans and 530,000 Ohioans receive it.
More than 90% of those who get insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace receive the subsidies, and they’re set to expire at the end of the year. 
The average recipient saves about $700 a year because of them, the Center for American Progress reported. But some save much more, meaning they have a lot more to lose.
“A typical 60-year-old couple making $82,000 … would see monthly marketplace premiums more than triple, from $581 to $2,111 — an annual increase of roughly $18,400,” the group reported late last year.
The subsidies are credited with helping to push the percentage of uninsured Americans to an all-time low. That might be why, after initially being skeptical of the Affordable Care Act, 66% of Americans had favorable views of the law by June 2025.
After attempting to repeal the Affordable Care Act in his first term, President Donald Trump has undertaken several other measures that some experts say will push the number of uninsured Americans up — a lot.
One is by cutting nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid spending over 10 years as part of his One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The law gives roughly the same amount in tax cuts to the richest 1% of Americans, and it adds $3.4 trillion to the deficit.
The Medicaid cuts are expected to add greatly to the ranks of the uninsured. KFF, an independent nonprofit, in June estimated that 11 million Americans would lose insurance because of them. In Ohio, 310,000 would lose insurance, increasing the rate of uninsured Ohioans by 3%, the organization estimated.
Emergency physicians have warned that creating huge numbers of newly uninsured people will strain hospital services for all patients — especially in rural areas where hospitals are already struggling.
ERs have to treat people regardless of their ability to pay. To cover those costs, hospitals will have to cut staff, leading to longer wait times, fewer services and negative health outcomes, the doctors say.
Expiration of the marketplace subsidies would make the numbers even more dire, experts warn. KFF estimates that between the loss of subsidies and the Trump Medicaid cuts, 16 million Americans will lose insurance, including 440,000 Ohioans.
If Congress allows the subsidies to expire at the end of 2025, those who receive them will feel the pain before those facing Medicaid cuts do. Medicaid work requirements — the biggest single way cuts to that program will be financed — don’t kick in until after next year’s midterm elections.
Americans for Healthy Communities, a nonprofit advocacy group, urged Congress to renew the insurance subsidies.
“By failing to renew the ACA’s premium tax credits, Republicans in Congress are jeopardizing the health of more than 500,000 Ohioans who rely on these credits to receive the care they need,” it said in a written statement. “We urge Congress, especially Ohio’s delegation, to quickly come to the table and work together on passing an extension of these tax credits before it’s too late. Congress still has a chance to renew the tax credits when they return in September — however, if they once again refuse to, millions will lose their coverage and millions more will face unaffordable, high premiums. The time to act is now.”
The offices of Husted and Moreno didn’t respond when asked whether they believed the insurance subsidies should be allowed to expire.

“I’m sure that part of the reason for us to continue to trail the country is because of the numerous service deserts, these are geographic areas where people do not have ready access to the necessities of life,” OACAA Executive Director Philip E. Cole said during a recent press conference.
This is the 32nd year the association, which represents 48 agencies across the state, has issued a State of Poverty report. 
A Delaware County resident is likely to live about 12 years longer than a Vinton County resident, according to the report. 
“These counties are separated by about 100 miles and 12 years,” Cole said. “12 years is a lot of life. This number reminds us that in too many cases, the life you live is determined at birth.” 
Poverty has many causes, he said.
“People like to say that poverty is about personal choices,” Cole said. “In most cases, that’s just wrong. It has nothing to do with the choices of those who live in poverty, as no one can choose their parents or their place of birth. It has to do with unequal access to the important resources people need to thrive in their life.” 
Service deserts 
There are 421 Census tracts across 72 of Ohio’s 88 counties that qualify as food deserts, according to the United States Department of Agriculture Access Research Atlas. 
Slightly more than 90% of those are in tracts where the poverty rate is above the state average and 41% are in tracts where the poverty rate is more than double the state average. 
Food deserts are geographic areas where residents have limited access to fresh produce, typically due to the lack of grocery stores or supermarkets. 
“Ohio’s service deserts disproportionately impact high-poverty communities in both urban and rural areas,” Cole said. “When families and whole communities have a difficult time accessing basic needs like food and medicine, that is normally a demonstration of lack of access to employment and other economic opportunities as well.” 
Cole slammed federal policy from the 1980s that no longer enforced anti-trust laws like the Robinson-Patman Act. 
“It kept small grocers, for example, and other small retailers in business by outlawing price discrimination, which could favor large retail businesses, especially chain stores, at the expense of the small retailers,” Cole said. “When this act ceased to be enforced, price discrimination was allowed to benefit the large corporate grocers and other retailers at the expense of small businesses.”
This wiped out small grocers and impacted low income areas the most, Cole said. 
“Food deserts are creations out of public policy,” Cole said. 
It’s not just food deserts, it’s also pharmacies. 
Ohio saw a 16% drop in retail pharmacies across the state from 2015 to 2024, according to the report. 
“Unregulated pharmacy benefit managers are simply allowed to put small pharmacies out of business with their payment structures,” Cole said. “People have less access to prescriptions and less access to those who understand the interaction of drugs.” 
There are also legal assistance deserts — 82 Ohio counties have less than one attorney per 700 residents, according to the report. 
Ohio has 13 maternity care deserts where there is limited or no access to maternity health care services, the report added.
Data from the report 
Athens County had the highest overall poverty rate with 25.3% and Scioto County had the highest family poverty rate with 17.6%. 
In highest overall poverty rate, Meigs County followed Athens with 20.8% and Mahoning and Pike counties were tied with 19.5%. 
Black Ohioans have the highest poverty rate at 26.9%, followed by Hispanic/Latinos at 21.7%.
Recommendations 
The OACAA had three possible solutions involving lawmakers at the state and federal level. 

Suggesting the Trump Administration enforce anti-trust laws like the Robinson-Patman Act to help bring small retailers back in business. 
Asking Ohio lawmakers to get rid of taxes on small business startups and offer them refundable tax credits for jobs they create with businesses they open in desert areas. 
Increasing the funding for Ohio food banks. 

“We need to make food available,” Cole said.

New Hampshire’s health care system is facing unprecedented challenges that could have major economic and personal consequences in the coming years. Changes in federal and state policy, combined with broader market pressures, are projected to result in significant coverage losses, higher costs, and reduced access to care — particularly in rural areas.
Nationally, that more than 15 million Americans could lose their health coverage in the coming year, including thousands of Granite Staters. Without insurance, individuals and families are more vulnerable to overwhelming medical bills when illness or injury strikes. Rising costs may also push more households into medical debt, strain family budgets, and limit access to lifesaving care. With nearly 184,000 Granite Staters — about 13.4% of the state’s population — relying on Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), cuts to Medicaid and ACA programs could cause thousands to lose access to essential care, destabilizing rural hospitals and escalating costs for everyone.
Coverage losses and rising costs
Proposed funding reductions to Medicaid — estimated at $1 trillion nationally over the next decade — could lead to increased out-of-pocket expenses for enrollees, including copays of up to $35 for doctor visits. This change would be particularly difficult for low-income families, people with disabilities, and rural residents who already face limited health care options.
Older adults may also face higher costs for prescription drugs and premiums. Without continued support for Medicare drug price negotiations, taxpayers could shoulder billions in additional costs, while low-income seniors may pay thousands more each year for necessary medications and services.
For individuals and families purchasing insurance on the open market, industry estimates suggest that premiums could rise by an average of 18 percent in the coming year. Without offsets such as tax credits, some households could see their coverage costs increase by more than 70%.
Economic ripple effects
When people lose coverage or face higher costs, they often delay or skip care. A survey of more than 1,300 New Hampshire adults, conducted in 2024, found that over two-thirds (69%) said they delayed or went without health care due to cost. This can lead to more severe health issues and greater long-term expenses.
Half of New Hampshire’s acute care hospitals — or 13 of 26 — serve rural communities and survive largely on Medicaid support. Those hospitals and clinics — especially in rural parts of New Hampshire — may be forced to close or reduce services, driving patients to more distant facilities. As demand concentrates in fewer locations, wait times and costs can increase for everyone.
Emergency rooms, often the provider of last resort, could become overcrowded with uninsured patients, adding financial pressure on hospitals and contributing to rising premiums for insured patients. Employers may also face higher health benefit costs, which could limit wage growth or lead to reduced hiring.
Impact on credit and financial stability
Medical debt remains a leading cause of personal financial hardship in the United States. Recent changes at the federal level have reduced protections for consumers, meaning unpaid medical bills may continue to appear on credit reports. A lower credit score can make it more expensive — or impossible — to secure a loan, rent a home, or start a small business. For families already living paycheck to paycheck, a single medical emergency can create a cycle of debt that is difficult to escape.
A New Hampshire challenge
New Hampshire’s aging population, rural geography, and reliance on a mix of small and regional health care providers make the state particularly vulnerable to these pressures. Many communities have only one hospital or primary care clinic within reasonable distance, and staffing shortages in areas such as maternity care and behavioral health already strain the system. Since 2000, nine hospitals have ceased labor and delivery services, doubling travel time for women in many New Hampshire rural areas.
If coverage declines and costs rise sharply, the impact will not be confined to the health care sector. Small businesses could face steeper health insurance bills, employees may delay necessary care, and towns could see reduced economic activity as household budgets tighten. The state’s ability to attract and retain a healthy workforce could also be affected, with long-term implications for growth.
Looking ahead
The future of health care in New Hampshire will depend on how policymakers, health care providers, insurers, and communities respond to these challenges. Transparency in health care pricing, support for rural providers, and collaborative problem-solving among stakeholders will be critical to ensuring that residents continue to have access to affordable, quality care.
The choices made in the next year will shape the health — and economic well-being — of Granite Staters for decades to come. Without real solutions and collaboration, these pressures will dismantle access — especially in rural communities. Protecting coverage, preserving rural hospitals, and ensuring equity in access are crucial steps toward securing health and economic stability for all Granite Staters.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/healthcostsnhg-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-18 04:57:41.429772

Here’s what you can do to get your money back.
For the first two weeks of August, Ohio’s 5.75% tax rate — and any local sales taxes — were paused.
“That doesn’t mean that all online or even in-person shopping experiences here in Ohio are incorporating it,” financial expert and Case Western Reserve University professor Michael Goldberg said. “Consumers really need to look.”
Viewers and readers reported that some stores weren’t honoring the state sales tax break, and they were still being charged tax. Ohio Senate Finance Chair Jerry Cirino (R-Kirtland) explained that the holiday is mandatory.
“It’s their obligation to follow the law, of course, and I guess businesses who decide not to pass it along will run afoul of regulators in the state of Ohio,” Cirino said.
Most products were eligible as long as they were under $500. This includes dining in at restaurants and internet purchases from chain companies.
There were some exceptions, which included items already separately taxed, like alcohol, marijuana or vehicles.
If you bought an eligible item between Aug. 1 and 14, but you had tax on your receipt, here is what you can do:
The Ohio Department of Taxation said that consumers should take their receipt, or show a digital copy, to the retailer for a refund.
If that isn’t possible, ODT’s Adam Schwiebert said there is another option.
“You can submit an application for a refund for that erroneously collected sales tax,” Schwiebert said. “You can submit that application electronically or via mail, so you have options to get your money back.”
CLICK HERE to go to the refund form.
If you can’t access the webpage from this link, here are the instructions:
CLICK HERE to get to the department’s website. Then click the “Forms” section in the upper right-hand corner. From there, type “STAR” into the “Form Title or Number” box. There should be a search result that says, “Application for Sales/Use Tax Refund.” Click “View PDF Fill-In.”
Consumers have four years to file for a return, but Schwiebert urges Ohioans to apply as soon as they see the error.
“The department is very passionate about getting people their money back quickly because that really is the purpose of the holidays and for Ohioans to save those taxpayer dollars, keep them within their pockets,” Schwiebert said. “The department works very quickly to try to get their money back as fast as we possibly can.”
The expected time frame to receive your money back from the state varies.

(Photo by Morgan Trau, WEWS)Ohio’s property tax working group met last week, where superintendents fought against county officials who were pushing to take money away from school districts in order to provide property tax relief.
With property taxes continuing to climb, Ohioans like Brian Massie have been begging lawmakers for some relief.
“The legislators are doing nothing to address the injustice of taxing people out of their homes,” Massie said.
And the clock is ticking for solutions.
The state’s new property tax reform group met again to discuss initial thoughts, evaluating each of the Republican legislators’ proposals to decrease taxes — all of which could impact schools.
“We don’t think that people realize what’s on the line,” said Stephanie Starcher, the superintendent of Fort Frye Local Schools.


The members discussed a myriad of options, which include:

Idea 1: Take away some of the schools’ savings, capping the carryover revenue at a certain percentage and refunding to taxpayers anything above that.
Idea 2: Put restrictions on the ability to put emergency levies on the ballot or request an increase to a current levy. This would eliminate levy replacements on property taxes for all political subdivisions. For schools, it would have prohibited them from imposing a fixed-sum emergency levy, a substitute emergency levy and a combined school district income tax and fixed-sum property tax levy.
Idea 3: Require that emergency and substitute tax levies, incremental growth levies, conversion levies, and the property tax portion of combined income tax and property tax levies be included in the 20-mill floor calculation for school funding purposes.
Idea 4: Allow a three-person county budget commission to unilaterally take money away from a school’s already passed levy if they find it “reasonably necessary.”
Idea 5: Similar to House Bill 186, this would limit property tax increases via an inflation cap. It authorizes a tax credit for owners of property in a school district on the 20 mill floor.

In the two-year state operating budget, Gov. Mike DeWine vetoed the levy restrictions. In July, the House narrowly passed an override to it. This one is detrimental, both Starcher and Dublin City Schools Superintendent Dr. John Marschhausen said.
“Either Ohio kids are going to lose a ton of money, or taxpayers are going to be paying more for the same support,” Starcher said, noting that eliminating types of levies will cause schools to go to the ballot more frequently.
But group chair Bill Seitz, a former Republican lawmaker from Cincinnati, said limiting these levies would prevent unclear ballot questions that raise taxes.
“Substitute for what? The voters really have no way of knowing.” Seitz said. “What the hell are we substituting for?”
Warren County Auditor Matt Nolan said schools need to be held accountable, since some are just “sitting on taxpayer money.”
Lake County Auditor Chris Galloway said that this option would hurt local governments.
“If there was someone that thought that doing this was going to change the property tax situation for Ohioans, they’re out of their mind,” Galloway said. “This is not going to change the dollars and cents of average Ohioan voters on property taxes.”
Starcher and Marschhausen tried to explain several times how schools could be hurt by several of the provisions. But Galloway and Nolan were fans of budget commissions to take money away from schools.
“Having that hammer behind us to say, ‘Please lower your levies. If you don’t, we will do it for you’ — that has worked extremely well,” Nolan said.
Hamilton County Commissioner Denise Driehaus said that this was “undemocratic.”
“If three elected officials in Hamilton County decided to overturn the will of the people, I’m going to have an issue with that,” Driehaus said.
Pike County Commissioner Jeff Chattin echoed Driehaus’ thoughts, reminding the working group that voters and their choices must be taken seriously.
Massie said that he wants voters to have a choice and knows the taxpayers have to pay for municipalities, but not at his expense.
“To vote for property tax levies, you’re funding your own demise,” Massie said.
The group will continue working and discussing policy until their deadline of the end of September.

(Getty Images)Over the past month, both of Kansas’ U.S. senators and one of its representatives have been eager for Kansas Reflector to relay their thoughts to you, our readers.
What they haven’t been willing to do is answer real, in-depth questions.
In the aftermath of the Senate and House passing President Donald Trump’s “One Big, Beautiful Bill” into law, Republicans across the country want to persuade voters that they have delivered. Unfortunately for them, the bill polls terribly and constituents have been eager to confront their elected officials.
You can’t have that, not when control of both chambers will be up for a vote next year. Instead, these politicians have been trying to funnel propaganda directly to you, our audience, without pesky journalists asking a bunch of questions.
Sorry guys, but that’s not the way we do things around here.
This first came up with Sen. Jerry Moran. I’ve written a couple of columns about him this year, and others have also addressed him in this space. Back in 2022, he sat down with Kansas Reflector senior reporter Tim Carpenter for our podcast. Moran can hold himself perfectly well in an interview with a professional journalist. He’s been doing this for a long time.
So when his office reached out last month expressing unhappiness about a column, I thought it was a fantastic opportunity to request an interview with the senator. He did it before, right?
His staff didn’t see it that way.
Communications director Angela Lingg both emailed and tried to talk to me on the phone. I told her that we would be perfectly willing to correct any factual errors if the office wanted to point them out. That goes for any piece published by Kansas Reflector. The op-ed, which dealt with the effects of Medicaid cuts on state mental health services was indeed corrected with extra information. I was happy to do so.
However, if I don’t have a previous relationship with a public relations staffer, I’m not going to have an informal phone conversation with them about an article they don’t like. Let me tell you sometime about being harassed by a Hillary Clinton staffer one morning as the Concord Monitor worked on a story about her foreign policy.
It’s a waste of time and doesn’t do anyone any good.
As I told Lingg, I would be delighted to talk further about Moran’s vote and his role in the process — during an on-the-record conversation with Moran. If he didn’t want to talk to me, he could talk to anyone else on the Kansas Reflector staff.
She then asked if we would post an op-ed from Moran. I explained that as a matter of policy (which you can read here and which has been in place since I started four years ago), we don’t run pieces from elected officials or candidates for office. Again, I offered an on-the-record interview.
I haven’t heard back.
For two other Kansas lawmakers in Washington, D.C., our interactions were brief but similarly telling.
U.S. Rep. Tracey Mann’s staff sent along an unsolicited op-ed praising border security provisions in the law. I gave Mann’s communications director, Taylor Bradley Stanley, the same response that I gave Lingg. We can’t run the piece but would love to speak directly with the congressman. Again, no response.
Sen. Roger Marshall actually showed his face to local reporters as part of an photo op. He took a 10-minute air ambulance helicopter ride and answered a handful of questions. He didn’t sit down for the kind of in-depth, penetrating interview that one might expect from a serious legislator after passing a mammoth piece of legislation.
Let’s talk turkey.
We want to hear from your elected representatives. We want to know what they think and why they make the choices they do.
I would be especially interested in knowing why Moran — who has voiced his support for rural hospitals repeatedly — and Marshall — who has made his background as a physician core to his political identity — chose to vote for a spending package that will leave Kansans poorer and less healthy.
I would like to know why Mann — who represents Lawrence, thanks to some opportunistic redistricting — voted for a bill that so clearly contradicts the electoral preferences of this 95,000-person strong city. In case you didn’t know, Douglas County as a whole went 67%-30% for Kamala Harris over Trump last year.
Now, if you’re not accustomed to the concept of an adversarial press, you might think these questions impolite. You might think they’re uncouth or hostile.
Nothing could be further from the truth. Such questions are meant to put elected officials on the record. We want to hear what they have to say, directly from their own mouths in a context that they don’t control. We welcome these kinds of exchanges. We want our readers to hear what their representatives say.
Other elected officials have been willing to do so. U.S. Rep. Derek Schmidt sat down with Carpenter back in December. Miracle of miracles, he survived the experience no worse for wear. Likewise, U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids frequently makes public appearances in Kansas and answers questions from journalists.
So what makes Moran, Marshall and Mann different?
I think all men are perfectly brave, accomplished and intelligent. I think all three could hold their own perfectly well during an interview or press conference. They are professional politicians. It’s what they do.
No, I think this reticence comes from the fact that these men can read polls. The reconciliation bill-turned-law remains unpopular and Trump himself has turned off massive numbers of Americans. What might be good for any one of these men to do politically — break with the White House or its priorities publicly — also puts them at risk of provoking the president and creating headaches they don’t need.
The simplest fix? Work the refs. Try to control the narrative. Don’t subject yourself to questions that would force you to take an unpopular stand. Don’t acknowledge the real trade-off behind the reconciliation bill and the grievous harms it will inflict on Kansans.
Honest dialogue would force these politicians to admit they have both compromised and been compromised.
Feel free to reach out and prove me wrong.

Santiago/Getty Images)BILOXI, Miss. — The Trump administration is developing a powerful data tool it claims will let states identify noncitizens registered to vote. But Democratic critics and data experts warn it could allow the federal government to vacuum up vast quantities of information on Americans for unclear purposes.
Some Democratic election officials and opponents of the effort fear President Donald Trump wants to build a federal database of voters to target political opponents or cherry-pick rare examples of noncitizen voters to fuel a sense of crisis. Republican election officials allied with the president counter that he’s helping states to maintain accurate voter rolls.
The Trump administration has rolled out changes to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, tool at the same time the U.S. Department of Justice is asking states for copies of their voter rolls. The timing, combined with questions about what happens to voter data uploaded to the program, has alarmed critics.
Trump wants Congress to pass a national proof of citizenship voter registration requirement and in March tried to unilaterally impose one for federal elections through executive order. But with the legislation stalled and the order halted by the courts, the citizenship data tool may offer a backdoor way to accomplish the same goal.
SAVE was originally intended to help state and local officials verify the immigration status of individual noncitizens seeking government benefits. But U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, this spring refashioned it into a platform that can scan states’ voter rolls if election officials upload the data.
The changes to SAVE, rolled out over just a few months and with little public debate, are “tinkering with sort of the bones of democracy,” said John Davisson, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington, D.C.-based research and advocacy group that argues privacy is a fundamental right.
“You’re talking about the voting process and who will be eligible to vote,” Davisson said. “And to take a system that is not designed for use in that process and repurpose it, really on the fly, without a formal comment process, without formal rulemaking, without congressional intervention — that’s pretty anomalous and pretty alarming.”
Previously, SAVE could only search one name at a time. Now it can conduct bulk searches, allowing state officials to potentially feed into it information on millions of registered voters. SAVE checks that information against a series of federal databases and reports back whether it can verify someone’s immigration status.
Since May, it also can draw upon Social Security data, transforming the program into a tool that can confirm citizenship because Social Security records for many, but not all, Americans include the information. NPR reported earlier on changes to SAVE.
“It is incredible what has been done, really since March,” Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray, a Republican who supports proof of citizenship requirements and the SAVE tool, told a gathering of state secretaries of state in Biloxi, Mississippi, last week.
Individuals registering to vote in federal elections must already sign a statement affirming they are citizens under penalty of perjury, and those who cast a ballot face criminal penalties and deportation. One study of the 2016 election placed the prevalence of noncitizen voting at 0.0001% of votes cast.
But as Trump has spread falsehoods about elections, Republicans have made purging noncitizens from voter rolls a central focus.
Democratic concerns were on display last week at the National Association of Secretaries of State conference, held at the Beau Rivage casino-resort in Biloxi. In interviews on the sidelines of the conference, Democratic secretaries of state voiced deep reservations — or outright opposition — about plugging their voter data into SAVE.
Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said Aug. 6 that the federal government appeared to be trying to take over election administration. She formally rejected the Justice Department’s voter roll request two days later.
Bellows said the Department of Homeland Security told her in a recent phone call that it planned to retain SAVE data for 10 years for “audit purposes only.”
“Just like the [Justice Department] is asking us to hand over an electronic file of all the voters in our state, it seems like the Department of Homeland Security is through this backdoor system also asking us to share voter information about every voter in our state,” Bellows said.
At least one state appears to have granted the federal government sweeping authority over any voter data it provides to SAVE.
Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales announced in July he had reached an agreement with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to access the newly expanded system for voter list maintenance. Indiana’s agreement allows the federal agency to use information the state provides for any purpose permitted by law, including criminal prosecutions.
Morales, a Republican, said in a news release that SAVE represented “another step in safeguarding the rights” of eligible voters. His office didn’t respond to Stateline’s questions.
The Trump administration has ramped up efforts to encourage state election officials to use the expanded program. The White House hosted a bipartisan “fly in” event for state secretaries of state on July 29. Multiple secretaries of state told Stateline that USCIS Director Joseph Edlow, who was confirmed on July 15, spoke at the event.
“The president is very much keyed in on voter list maintenance,” Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, a Republican, said in an interview — echoing other GOP secretaries of state who released statements praising the Trump administration after the meeting.













When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances.


– Minnesota Democratic Secretary of State Steve Simon





Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, a Democrat who attended the meeting, said he questioned how the federal government would handle voter information provided to SAVE. He added that the Justice Department’s request for his state’s voter rolls raised his level of concern about how data would be used.
“When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances,” Simon told Stateline.
The White House referred questions about SAVE and the event to the Department of Homeland Security and USCIS.
In response to questions from Stateline, USCIS didn’t directly answer whether the agency would share voter roll data with other parts of the federal government but confirmed it disposes of records after 10 years.
“The SAVE application is a critical tool for state and local governments to access information to safeguard the integrity of elections across the country. It’s no wonder many states have quickly adopted it, and we continue to promote the tool to other states and counties not using SAVE,” USCIS spokesperson Matthew Tragesser said in a statement.
“We look forward to continued optimization efforts and implementing more updates to SAVE.”
 GOP pressure

Some Republican election officials and Trump allies have long wanted the federal government to take an expanded role in searching state voter rolls for noncitizens.
Last summer the Trump-aligned litigation group America First Legal, co-founded by Trump adviser Stephen Miller, encouraged states to submit to the Department of Homeland Security the names of individuals for citizenship or immigration status verification.
Some states did just that. Texas, for example, asked USCIS to verify the citizenship of some voters in September, and Indiana asked the agency to verify 585,774 voters in October. The same month, 16 Republican state attorneys general signed a letter criticizing Homeland Security, then under the Biden administration, for failing to work with states on verification.
After Trump took office, GOP state officials kept up the pressure. Twenty-one Republican secretaries of state urged Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in February to prioritize SAVE improvements.
On April 16, Indiana sued the department in federal court for not responding to its verification request last fall. USCIS announced an overhaul of SAVE less than a week later.
As the agency continues to remake SAVE, the tool will soon allow searches using the last four digits of a Social Security number, multiple state secretaries of state told Stateline. The agency confirmed the feature is under development and will be available soon but didn’t provide an exact date.
The change would mark another significant expansion of the program because most states collect the last four digits when individuals without a driver’s license register to vote.
Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican, said SAVE represents a better way to verify citizenship than a state law requiring voters to produce documents. “I think there’s a real opportunity for us to do a lot of this through just sharing of information and I think that’s what we’re seeing happen,” McGrane said in an interview.
 Unreliable data?

But some voting rights advocates and experts on government data caution against an overreliance on Social Security data.
The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, a progressive policy nonprofit, has noted that Social Security only began tracking the citizenship status of all applicants in 1978 — meaning the database doesn’t include comprehensive citizenship information for older Americans. Additionally, Social Security may not always have up-to-date information on the status of naturalized U.S. citizens.
The nonpartisan Institute for Responsive Government also warned in May that since SAVE hasn’t used Social Security numbers to verify citizenship in the past, its accuracy and effectiveness are unknown. The success of the expanded SAVE program may also partially depend on whether it has adequate staff and resources, it said.
A 2017 Government Accountability Office report found that between fiscal years 2012 and 2016, about 16% of the nearly 90 million SAVE searches required additional verification, which the institute says often translates into federal workers manually checking files. Now that SAVE allows bulk searches, the need for manual checking could rise dramatically.
Nick Doctor, director of implementation at the Institute for Responsive Government, said in an interview that a tool confirming the eligibility of registered voters in a way that doesn’t burden individuals can be a good thing. But he emphasized that it depends in large measure on SAVE’s implementation.
“The changes that have been made to SAVE happened very quickly and, to my knowledge, we haven’t seen releases on the level of accuracy of that information,” Doctor said.
During interviews, Republican secretaries of state stressed that voters aren’t kicked off the rolls because SAVE can’t verify their citizenship. Instead, an inability to verify would likely trigger a follow-up process with the voter.
“Just because we get something back from the SAVE database, it’s not a cut and dry, especially on those they’re not sure about,” Hoskins, the Missouri secretary of state, said.
Still, Arizona illustrates why some Democrats worry about any large-scale effort to ask voters — especially longtime, older residents — to prove their citizenship. After the state discovered errors in how it tracked voter citizenship dating back years, election officials are contacting some 200,000 voters seeking proof of citizenship documentation.
Some have been casting ballots for decades without incident and many feel targeted, Arizona Democratic Secretary of State Adrian Fontes said during a presentation at the state secretaries of state conference. “They feel insulted when they get that letter,” Fontes said.













There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside.


– Charles Stewart III, professor of political science at MIT who studies elections





Charles Stewart III, a professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies elections, said Arizona may actually point to the potential usefulness of SAVE. If Arizona runs its voter roll through the program, a list of 200,000 voters needing citizenship verification would perhaps drop into the hundreds, he suggested.
“There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside,” Stewart said.
Connecticut Democratic Secretary of State Stephanie Thomas told Stateline that every secretary wants tools to keep voter lists as clean as possible. But the details are important.
When she hears of something new, Thomas said she asks whether it’s the best option available and whether “the i’s are dotted, the t’s crossed.” She said she’s asked USCIS a series of questions about SAVE and is waiting on some responses.
“When it comes to voter lists,” Thomas said, “I don’t want Connecticut voters to be a guinea pig.”

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)There’s historical precedent for Texas House Democrats vamoosing to deny Republicans the quorum they need to carry out President Trump’s order and redraw the Lone Star State’s congressional map to flip five seats from blue to red before next year’s midterm elections.
Some of the Texans fled to Illinois, where in December, 1840, a 31-year-old Kentucky-born Whig state representative jumped out a window to thwart a quorum House Democrats needed to pass a bill undermining the Bank of Illinois, a Whig pet.
The solon’s name was Abraham Lincoln.
His unorthodox exit went for naught because he had been marked present. The majority Democrats corralled enough members for a quorum, and the anti-bank bill passed 46-15.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXUnderstandably, it’s been claimed that Lincoln leapt from the Illinois statehouse, which is preserved as the Old State Capitol Historic Site. He didn’t. He bailed from a church window.
Springfield is the capital of Illinois. But in late 1840, the legislature was meeting in the old First Methodist Church while work crews were putting the finishing touches on the Capitol a block away. (The building was replaced by the current Capitol in 1876.)
The church was too small and ill equipped to adequately accommodate the lawmakers, which “added to the confusion Lincoln encountered as leader of the minority Whig party,” explains a plaque on a downtown building now on the church site.
The blue-framed “Looking for Lincoln” tablet is titled “Leaping Lincoln.” 
On Dec. 5, 1840, the Democratic majority was set to approve the bank-busting bill. The Whigs decided to make themselves scarce, thus preventing a quorum. “Only Lincoln and a few lieutenants remained to observe,” according to the plaque.
When Lincoln and other Whig bigwigs discovered the Democrats had a quorum after all, they ran for the door, which was barred. In desperation, Lincoln leapt, followed by Joseph Gillespie and Asahel Gridley.
The State Register, a devoutly Democratic newspaper in Springfield, gleefully reported the incident: “A laughable circumstance took place while the yeas and nays were being called on the passage of the resolution. Mr Lincoln of Sangamon (Lincoln lived in Springfield, the Sangamon County seat), who was present during the whole scene, and who appeared to enjoy the embarrassment of the House, suddenly looked very grave after the Speaker announced that a quorum was present. The conspiracy having failed, Mr Lincoln came under great excitement, and having attempted and failed to get out of the door, very unceremoniously raised the window and jumped out, followed by one or two other members.”
It was a first floor window, said to be only 4 or 5 feet from the ground.
According to the paper, “This gymnastic performance of Mr Lincoln and his flying brethren, did not occur until after they had voted! and consequently the House did not interfere with their extraordinary feat.”
The State Register confessed, “We have not learned whether these flying members got hurt in their adventure, and we think it probable that one of them came off without damage, as it was noticed that his legs reached nearly from the window to the ground!”
The paper further lampooned the 6-foot-4 Lincoln, declaring it had heard “that a resolution will probably be introduced into the House this week to inquire into the expediency of raising the State House one story higher, in order to have the House set in the third story! so as to prevent members from jumping out of the window! If such a resolution passes, Mr Lincoln will in the future have to climb down the spout!”
The plaque also says that “an embarrassed Lincoln ever after resented references to what he called that ‘jumping scape.’ ” But he had the last laugh 20 years later when Free State voters sent him to the White House. (He polled just 1,366 votes in slave state Kentucky.)
Historians rank “The Great Emancipator” as one of our greatest presidents because he led the Union to victory in the Civil War and put slavery on the road to extinction. (Illinois towns were named for Gillespie and Gridley.)

(Photo by Liam Niemeyer/Kentucky Lantern)Mandates from President Donald Trump’s administration to retain aging coal plants could cause a massive spike in energy costs, according to an independent analysis commissioned by several environmental groups.
Orders from the U.S. Department of Energy to save coal plants from retirement could cost ratepayers more than $3 billion per year, according to a report from Grid Strategies, a power sector consulting firm. It was carried out on behalf of Earthjustice, Environmental Defense Fund, Natural Resources Defense Council and Sierra Club.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXUnder Trump, the agency has issued emergency orders to maintain operations at coal plants that were scheduled for retirement. While federal officials say the coal plants need to stay online to avoid blackouts, power plant owners and state regulators planned their closures because they were no longer economically viable or needed for reliability.
“DOE mandates override those well-informed decisions, inflating electric bills for homeowners and businesses and undermining the competitiveness of U.S. factories and data centers,” the Grid Strategies analysis found.
Across the country, coal plants have phased out as they’ve struggled to compete with cheaper renewables and natural gas. A 2023 analysis by Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan think tank, found that 99% of existing U.S. coal plants “are more expensive to run than replacement by local wind, solar, and energy storage resources.”
But Trump, who has pushed to unleash more fossil fuel development and to stymie wind and solar, has ordered a retiring coal plant in Michigan to stay online, along with an oil and gas plant in Pennsylvania.
“Based on the trend to date and indications that DOE has approached the owners of many retiring fossil power plants about potentially mandating their retention, DOE may attempt to mandate the retention of nearly all large fossil power plants slated for retirement between now and the end of 2028,” reads the Grid Strategies report.
The cost of keeping those plants online would be immense. By 2028, if Trump were to mandate the retention of all fossil fuel plants slated for retirement, the annual cost to ratepayers would be more than $3.1 billion, the analysis found.
The report also considers a number of aging plants that are not yet scheduled for retirement. It finds Trump’s actions could create a “perverse incentive,” causing plant owners to claim they’re planning to shut down, inducing the feds to step in and keep them open, with the cost borne by ratepayers.
Accounting for that possibility, the report found that ratepayer costs could reach $5.9 billion per year to keep the entire aging fossil fuel fleet online. California, Texas and Colorado would see the highest increases in electricity bills.

Aug. 12, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)Three thoughts … 
Auschwitz. Treblinka. Bergen-Belson. Russian gulags. Manzanar. Heart Mountain. Lincoln.
Wait, what? Lincoln?
Go ahead. Insist I’m overreacting. Being a drama queen. Hyperventilating on the hype. Getting my NIMBY on. Maybe I am. But the idea that a federal migrant detention camp would be built where I live — already reported as a possibility — comes with a stigma. 
Nor would a camp in Omaha, Grand Island, North Platte or any place in Nebraska mitigate the mood. If Floridians want to embrace “Alligator Alcatraz,” the camp in the state’s swamps with the childishly cruel name, let them. But as the U.S. Department of Homeland Security searches for other detention camp sites, let’s hope Nebraska political leaders understand the long-term message such a place sends and the reputation that will follow.
Immigration is in dire need of serious reform. So some may welcome a camp here for migrants as part of the solution to the immigration problem. Indeed the president said on the campaign trail that a mass deportation will take place to rid the country of violent criminals, human traffickers and fentanyl pushers. 
To date, however, the data shows that a clear majority in detention camps or already deported fits none of that trifecta. Of interest, too, is that according to 8 U.S.C. § 1325, being in the country without documentation, with a few exceptions, remains a civil and not criminal offense.
Placing a migrant detention camp in the backyard may not last forever, but its memory would. Lincoln and Nebraska can do without.
School finance
With the dog days behind us and their namesake rightly in its heavenly place, most Nebraska’s schools are up and running. (We pause here to give thanks for air conditioning.)
Also at their desks starting last week were members of the governor’s newly-minted School Financing Review Commission, charged with building a better school financing mousetrap. 
Even a cursory look at school financing in Nebraska requires a trip down the rabbit hole when considering formulas and fairness. While the commission holds out hope it can solve some seriously hairy dilemmas involving property taxes and paying for a quality education, its initial conversations — as they should be — seemingly kept an aggregate eye on the prize: Nebraska’s public school students.
The old saw about showing me a budget and I’ll show what you value applies here. Nebraska schools have historically performed well in comparison to its border neighbors and the nation as a whole. In the constant push to lower property taxes, however, previous attempts not simply here but in other states have too often centered on painting school districts as spendthrifts or wholly inefficient stewards of money. The result has been a patchwork of policies that have satisfied neither those who pay property taxes nor those on the front lines of educating children.
Ergo, the School Financing Review Commission … and the balancing act which lies before it. 
History lesson
Speaking of schools, Nebraska’s history teachers should take note of a worrisome development at the Smithsonian Institution, the nation’s flagship museum of all things American.
The White House has sent a letter to the Institution’s director, giving him a heads up that the administration will be “reviewing” the museum’s exhibitions and research so they march to the same drummer as “the president’s directive to celebrate American exceptionalism, remove divisive or partisan narratives, and restore confidence in our shared cultural institutions.” The review would apply to eight Smithsonian museums.
Oh, boy. Democracies are, by their very nature, divisive. When the people make the rules, differences of opinion are not only evident and expected, they create a process of deliberation and debate that has made us the best last hope for freedom on the planet. Probably best not to mess with that.
Moreover, like book banners, if rewriters of history reveal only the good parts of the past, it’s not really history. Slavery, Japanese internment camps (two of which are listed above), the Tulsa Race Massacre, the mistreatment of Mexican Braceros and Jan. 6, 2021 — when for the first time in our nation’s history, a violent mob tried to undo a free and fair election — all happened, whether we like it or not. Not our finest hours. We must acknowledge them, study them and learn from them. Otherwise, the axiom is true: we’ll repeat them. 
Maybe we already are.
When we own all of our history, when we count all our wins and losses, when we let all of our true narrative be our teacher and not something to edit or erase, then we are unquestionably an exceptional nation.

Fired up! Psyched! Stoked!
We’re proud to be bringing these precious boys and girls (note the statutorily mandated unambiguous sex designations) the finest curriculum in these United States, handcrafted with love by Gov. Ron DeSantis (J.D. Harvard), Commissioner of Education Anastasios “Stasi” Kamoutsas (J.D. Regent), and your Florida Legislature, all of whom graduated from high school, probably.
Here’s a taste of what we have in store for your student!
Communism: The Kindergarten Mix
It’s never too early to teach kids how to recognize Reds and reject their sick ideology.
Teachers will illustrate the evils Karl Marx wrought by bringing in teddy bears (NB: Teacher will need to pay for these herself) which she will distribute as follows: half to traditional American (white) little boys; one-third to traditional American (white) little girls, and any left-overs to other kids.
Some will get no bears.
Then she’ll take the bears from the traditional Americans and distribute one bear to each kid, illustrating how totally unfair Communism is.
UnWoke Math (Grades 2-5)
The libs have tried to indoctrinate our children through addition and subtraction.
To combat this and make sure they don’t take against trickle-down economics in the future, the state has chosen textbooks especially crafted for Florida’s unique needs.
No sneaking in Critical Race Theory disguised as basic fractions, no social-emotional learning concealed in subtraction, no “If Bobby has three apples and he gives Maria one, how many does he have left?”
The correct answer is, obviously, Bobby still has three apples because Maria is now in ICE detention.
Civics (Grade 3):
America is great because America is good.
Like, Bible-good.
Despite the nonsense spouted by “historians,” children will learn early American colonists were Christians doing Christian things like making friends with primitive tribes, except when they got in the way of Manifest Destiny.
Sure, there were a few random Jews, and some of those African guest-workers helping pick cotton and tobacco were Muslims and idol-worshipers, but we won’t worry about them.
Language Arts (Grade 4): Reading is Fun-Da-Mental
Teachers will foster a continued love of reading with wholesome books such as “Rush Revere and the Brave Pilgrims,” the “Little House on the Prairie” series, and “Uncle Remus Stories.”
While some states encourage using “Reading Rainbow” in the classroom, we will not go that route.
Florida does not do PBS. It’s socialist.
Florida does not do rainbows.
That guy who hosts the program should stick to “Star Trek.”
American History (Grade 5): All the Best Wars
This course instills admiration for our nation and its armed forces through study of how we won almost every single war, from King Philip’s War (kicked Wampanoag butt!) to the Revolution to the Mexican War (we got California and Nevada!) to World Wars I and II (thanks to us, nobody’s speaking German!) to Iraq and Afghanistan.
Discussions of the War Between the States will emphasize there were fine people on both sides, acknowledging the South had a point.
We will not dwell on the Vietnam War; America would have won it if not for those darn hippies.
Health (S-E-X) Education: Bodies are Dirty
The state of Florida would prefer this topic be avoided. However, if a school chooses to offer this class, parents can opt to take their children to church or a gun show instead.
In any case, the state offers these important guidelines.
First and foremost, it’s all about abstinence. No touching. Not until you’re married.
No condoms on bananas. Boys should be told that girls transmit nasty diseases.
Instructors will be allowed to explain the basic biology of the business, including dire warnings to girls about the consequences of having sex.
No discussion of contraception. If you get pregnant, don’t even think about an abortion.
You ain’t getting one, Missy. Not here in Florida.
Science (Grades 7-8): Physics and Chemistry are Your Friends
Students will gain a thorough grounding in the best science, including the Laws of Gravity, illustrated by dropping footballs off second-story balconies, inelastic collisions as demonstrated when a defensive back tackles a ball-carrier at the line of scrimmage, and elastic collisions which happens when the quarterback throws a ball that bounces off the receiver’s helmet and lands in the hands of a running back who takes it 50 yards for a TD.
The chemistry unit will focus on how the Periodic Table of Elements lines up with the account of creation in Genesis: hydrogen and helium make the stars, then hydrogen and oxygen make water, then nitrogen, hydrogen, argon, and carbon dioxide make the air so that when Adam and Eve were created they had something to breathe.
Speaking of carbon dioxide, it’s a good thing, not a bad thing, no matter what the global warming alarmists say.
(Don’t worry, parents: The state has forced textbook publishers to remove references to climate change).
Civics II (Grade 9): America was Founded By God
There’s no question our Founders were divinely directed to create the greatest nation in history, and the teacher will make sure the kids never question this fact.
We explore the incredible awesomeness of George Washington, who overcame hardships such as smallpox, contracted when he visited the Caribbean in 1751, the difficulties of turning the crappy little cottage of Mount Vernon into a 11,000 square foot mansion, and terrible dental challenges.
Contrary to what you may have heard, Washington did not have wooden teeth. They were actually made of metal springs and levers, elephant and walrus ivory, and a few actual human teeth he bought from his slaves.
Our course will knock down other perfidious myths, such as the one perpetrated by Broadway that Alexander Hamilton was Hispanic and insidious rumors about Ben Franklin and French women.
Also, Thomas Jefferson was a devout Christian, no matter how many “historians” claim he had sex with a teenager and made his own cut-and-paste “Jefferson Bible” with all references to Jesus’ divine powers removed.
Shop (Grade 11): Learn a Trade! 
For too long education has emphasized academics, which is dumb, given how much money a good roofer makes.
No more. Young people will become expert in deploying a nail gun, putting up drywall, and laying bricks.
It’s now legal for kids over 16 to work 30 hours a week, school or no school, six days a week, and eight hours a day on holidays and weekends.
Schools could use this as a revenue-enhancing opportunity.
For the first 90 days, employers only have to pay the kids $4.25 an hour (bargain!).
That’s, like, $127.50 per kid per week! You get, say, 50 kids on somebody else’s payroll, skim off a 50% “Apprenticeship Fee,” and pretty soon the school is making enough to afford those new band uniforms.
Beats selling chocolate bars.

Western Civilization (Grades 11-12): Our Way of Life
Sure, China and India are old and have built some pretty impressive walls and temples and whatever, but they fall short when compared to the brilliance of our European ancestors.
This course exposes young people to — as the great and not at all weird American author Edgar Allan Poe said — “the glory that was Greece, the grandeur that was Rome.” Socrates, Aristotle, Cicero, Seneca, colonization, aqueducts, togas.
The state Department of Education is following Florida’s own Marco Rubio, who has ditched the State Department’s whole “human rights” thing and created an office dedicated to “Western Values.”
Our kids will study those values — which include empire-building, unfettered capitalism, and freedom of expression unless it’s about sex or race — to learn how the West is the best.
Language Arts (Grade 12): Prep for College English
Students who insist on going into “higher ed” instead of getting perfectly good jobs at Chick-Fil-A or Disney will develop skills in reading complicated literature such as the plays of William Shakespeare and some of the few books not yet challenged by Moms for Liberty.
No Black books. No gay books.
Texts to be studied include “The Scarlet Letter” (see sex ed above), “The Iliad” (lots of good, clean war), and “Romeo and Juliet.”
(Teachers: Take out your Sharpies and redact the parts where Juliet starts talking about “amorous rites” and wishing “love-performing night” would hurry up so she can go to bed with Romeo. Disgusting.)
Sex stuff aside, the play teaches that if you disobey your parents, you’ll die.
College will challenge young people’s morals and values as professors try to indoctrinate them, forcing them to read novels by Toni Morrison, look at naked people in Art History, and acknowledge slavery was terrible, despite the slaves learning all those valuable skills.
But don’t worry: Kids educated in Florida have been trained to resist inappropriate thought.
And they can always report professors pushing DEI or CRT or BLM.
After all, Florida’s education commissioner is named Stasi.

Maldonado Mendez,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/18/upcoming-closure-of-st-francis-outpatient-behavioral-health-unit-threatens-mental-health-parity/,"For some, the impending closure of the Saint Francis Behavioral Health Department in Hartford is the loss of a lifeline.","On September 30, the outpatient behavioral health department at St. Francis Hospital is scheduled to close its doors. For many, this may seem like a routine administrative shift. But for those of us living with medical complexities, disabilities, and limited access through Medicare and Medicaid, it marks the end of a lifeline.

Doris Maldonado Mendez
My therapist at St. Francis is not just a provider —she is a witness to my life. She celebrates milestones with me, like the development of my children beyond their medical complexities, and the quiet triumphs of my own healing. She holds space for the unimaginable: the disappearance of my autistic son, the electric shock treatment to my heart after the devastating loss of my mother and three matriarchs during the COVID-19 pandemic and much more. She doesn’t flinch. She listens. She remembers. She reminds me that I am still here.
That relationship is built over time, through trust and consistency. And now, I am being told that even that sacred space is being taken away —with no clear or equitable alternative.
Disrupting therapeutic relationships is not just inconvenient —it’s destabilizing. Especially for those of us whose default prescription is “seek counseling,” when specialists routinely admit they cannot address our “unique” patient-centered needs. Counseling becomes the one place where I am not asked to explain or justify my complexity. It is simply honored.
This closure comes just weeks after Connecticut passes one of the strongest mental health parity laws in the country, mandating equal coverage for mental health and physical health services, imposing fines up to $625,000 for noncompliance, and requiring annual public reporting from insurers. Gov. Ned Lamont calls it a shift from “hoping insurers do the right thing to holding them accountable when they don’t.” And yet, what good is parity on paper if the infrastructure to deliver care is being dismantled?
And still, I rise.
As a former gubernatorial appointee and Chair of the Council on Developmental Disabilities, NAMI CT President and the Keep the Promise Coalition Chair, I’ve spent years creating opportunities for others —building statewide and national allyship, advancing communication access, and pushing for person-centered systems change. I lead panels, author strategies, and stand in rooms where decisions are made. But I also stand in waiting rooms, advocating for my own care, knowing that leadership doesn’t exempt me from systemic indifference.
I learn to breathe through the chaos, to pause when the weight becomes unbearable, and to return to what makes me thrive: my family, my faith, and my fierce belief that equity is not optional. Even when the system fails me, I refuse to let it fail others.
We are living through a national mental health crisis, compounded by economic instability, housing insecurity, and systemic inequities. The most vulnerable —those who are homeless, disabled, or medically complex— are being left to fend for themselves or fall through the cracks. We are being rendered invisible. Again.
It feels like 1999 all over again, when institutional closures and policy gaps leave thousands without support. We say “never again.” Yet here we are.
If Connecticut truly believes in equity, inclusion, and mental health parity, then the September 30 closure must be a call to action. We need legislation that not only holds insurers accountable but also protects access to care, funds community-based behavioral health, and ensures continuity —especially for those of us who cannot afford to be forgotten.
Mental health care is not optional. It is essential. And we deserve better. “¡Gracias!” to my therapist who ensured that there was Nothing about us Without us. Your humanity will be sorely missed!

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)A group seeking to decriminalize Alaskans’ use of certain medicinal mushrooms and other psychedelics can start collecting signatures to try to put the question before voters.
Lt. Gov. Nancy Dahlstrom, who oversees the Alaska Division of Elections, said Thursday she has certified a statewide initiative application that proposes legal but regulated use of certain natural medicines for therapeutic and traditional purposes. The sponsors may now start gathering the petition signatures they need to place their initiative on a statewide ballot.
The proposed initiative, titled the Alaska Natural Medicine Act, is modeled after an initiative in Colorado that voters in that state passed in 2022.
Sponsors of the initiative are with Natural Alaska Medicine Inc., a nonprofit organization “dedicated to fostering charitable, educational, and social welfare initiatives that promote the safe and responsible use of natural medicines,” according to its website.
  A psilocybe mushroom is seen in this undated photo. The mushrooms are sources of psilocybin, which is metabolized in the body to the active drug psilocyn, also present in many of the same mushrooms. . (Photo provided by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration)
The president of Natural Alaska Medicine Inc. and other team members are Indigenous Alaskans. The proposed ballot initiative includes provisions for Alaska Native traditional healers.
While the initiative would decriminalize adults’ personal use or home cultivation of psychedelic mushrooms and other psychedelics, it also proposes a regulatory system. It would establish a Natural Medicine Control Board in the state Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development. And it would establish an advisory Traditional Use Council.
Certain psychedelics are excluded and their use would not be allowed, under the initiative’s wording.
To qualify the initiative for the ballot, the petition sponsors must gather signatures equal in number to 10% of the voters in the state’s last general election, according to the Alaska Constitution. Additionally, signatures must come from at least 30 of the state’s 40 legislative House districts. Sponsors have a year in which to gather those signatures.
In her announcement Thursday, Dahlstrom did not indicate a position on the proposed initiative.
“This certification reflects the constitutional and statutory requirements for citizen-led initiatives in Alaska,” she said in a statement. “While voters will ultimately decide the merits of the proposal, the application meets all legal criteria for form and content.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Mandates from President Donald Trump’s administration to retain aging coal plants could cause a massive spike in energy costs, according to an independent analysis commissioned by several environmental groups.
Orders from the U.S. Department of Energy to save coal plants from retirement could cost ratepayers more than $3 billion per year, according to a report from Grid Strategies, a power sector consulting firm. It was carried out on behalf of Earthjustice, Environmental Defense Fund, Natural Resources Defense Council and Sierra Club.
Under Trump, the agency has issued emergency orders to maintain operations at coal plants that were scheduled for retirement. While federal officials say the coal plants need to stay online to avoid blackouts, power plant owners and state regulators planned their closures because they were no longer economically viable or needed for reliability.
“DOE mandates override those well-informed decisions, inflating electric bills for homeowners and businesses and undermining the competitiveness of U.S. factories and data centers,” the Grid Strategies analysis found.
States scramble to complete renewable energy projects before tax credits expire

Across the country, coal plants have phased out as they’ve struggled to compete with cheaper renewables and natural gas. A 2023 analysis by Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan think tank, found that 99% of existing U.S. coal plants “are more expensive to run than replacement by local wind, solar, and energy storage resources.”
But Trump, who has pushed to unleash more fossil fuel development and to stymie wind and solar, has ordered a retiring coal plant in Michigan to stay online, along with an oil and gas plant in Pennsylvania.
“Based on the trend to date and indications that DOE has approached the owners of many retiring fossil power plants about potentially mandating their retention, DOE may attempt to mandate the retention of nearly all large fossil power plants slated for retirement between now and the end of 2028,” reads the Grid Strategies report.
The cost of keeping those plants online would be immense. By 2028, if Trump were to mandate the retention of all fossil fuel plants slated for retirement, the annual cost to ratepayers would be more than $3.1 billion, the analysis found.
The report also considers a number of aging plants that are not yet scheduled for retirement. It finds Trump’s actions could create a “perverse incentive,” causing plant owners to claim they’re planning to shut down, inducing the feds to step in and keep them open, with the cost borne by ratepayers.
Accounting for that possibility, the report found that ratepayer costs could reach $5.9 billion per year to keep the entire aging fossil fuel fleet online. California, Texas and Colorado would see the highest increases in electricity bills.

Ivan Hodes, a U.S. Army veteran, was among a group protesting Friday morning at the Government Hill gate to JBER. It was important to be at the base gate, “in front of the place where it’s happening,” he said.
“We object to the summit. We object to Putin being on American soil. We object to him being on a military base, specifically a military base that has been at the forefront of defense against Russian and Soviet aggression for 60, 70 years. We want to object to (Ukraine President Volodymyr) Zelenskyy not being invited. Without the victim of Russian aggression, it’s an exercise in carving up somebody else’s territory.”
For Hodes, there is also a personal aspect to his opposition. A West Point classmate, Andrew Webber, died in July 2023 in combat defending Ukraine, he said. “Everything I’m doing here is to honor his memory,” Hodes said.
The biggest event was likely the afternoon rally on the Delaney Park Strip in downtown Anchorage. There, Ukraine supporters unfurled a 136-foot-long Ukrainian flag that had been flown to the city earlier in the day from New Jersey. Owned by a nonprofit organization, it is the second-largest Ukrainian flag in existence, rally organizers said.

Supporters gripped the edges of the flag and held it aloft above the park’s grass, while photos were snapped by a drone buzzing above.
Art Davidson, an Alaska author and co-founder of a U.S.-based organization that provides humanitarian aid to Ukraine, was a featured speaker at the downtown event.
He said the large gathering was gratifying to Dr. Olga Shpak, the executive director of the organization, Assist Ukraine, and others in Ukraine, Davidson said.
“It means so much to them to see support from everybody,” he told the crowd. “A big, big, big hug from Olga, Dr. Olga Shpak …. And a big hug from the people on the front lines.”
Davidson and veteran war correspondent Anne Garrels founded Assist Ukraine in the early days of the war. The organization has been sending donations to Ukraine from around the world and has opened an orphanage in the country, Davidson said.

Former Lt. Gov. Loren Leman, a Republican who also served in the state Senate, was among those who attended the pro-Trump rally.
He said he hoped the Trump-Putin summit would help end the war in Ukraine.
“What’s happening there, it’s a tragedy,” he said. “I’m hoping that the discussions will result in peace.”
Asked who he believed was at fault for the war, Leman paused before answering.
“Ukraine was invaded. That shouldn’t have happened,” he said. But there may be fault on both sides of the conflict, he said. “There’s probably some fault in everybody. We all have faults.”

BILOXI, Miss. — The Trump administration is developing a powerful data tool it claims will let states identify noncitizens registered to vote. But Democratic critics and data experts warn it could allow the federal government to vacuum up vast quantities of information on Americans for unclear purposes.
Some Democratic election officials and opponents of the effort fear President Donald Trump wants to build a federal database of voters to target political opponents or cherry-pick rare examples of noncitizen voters to fuel a sense of crisis. Republican election officials allied with the president counter that he’s helping states to maintain accurate voter rolls.
The Trump administration has rolled out changes to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, tool at the same time the U.S. Department of Justice is asking states for copies of their voter rolls. The timing, combined with questions about what happens to voter data uploaded to the program, has alarmed critics.
Trump wants Congress to pass a national proof of citizenship voter registration requirement and in March tried to unilaterally impose one for federal elections through executive order. But with the legislation stalled and the order halted by the courts, the citizenship data tool may offer a backdoor way to accomplish the same goal.
SAVE was originally intended to help state and local officials verify the immigration status of individual noncitizens seeking government benefits. But U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, this spring refashioned it into a platform that can scan states’ voter rolls if election officials upload the data.

The changes to SAVE, rolled out over just a few months and with little public debate, are “tinkering with sort of the bones of democracy,” said John Davisson, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington, D.C.-based research and advocacy group that argues privacy is a fundamental right.
“You’re talking about the voting process and who will be eligible to vote,” Davisson said. “And to take a system that is not designed for use in that process and repurpose it, really on the fly, without a formal comment process, without formal rulemaking, without congressional intervention — that’s pretty anomalous and pretty alarming.”
Previously, SAVE could only search one name at a time. Now it can conduct bulk searches, allowing state officials to potentially feed into it information on millions of registered voters. SAVE checks that information against a series of federal databases and reports back whether it can verify someone’s immigration status.
Since May, it also can draw upon Social Security data, transforming the program into a tool that can confirm citizenship because Social Security records for many, but not all, Americans include the information. NPR reported earlier on changes to SAVE.
“It is incredible what has been done, really since March,” Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray, a Republican who supports proof of citizenship requirements and the SAVE tool, told a gathering of state secretaries of state in Biloxi, Mississippi, last week.
Individuals registering to vote in federal elections must already sign a statement affirming they are citizens under penalty of perjury, and those who cast a ballot face criminal penalties and deportation. One study of the 2016 election placed the prevalence of noncitizen voting at 0.0001% of votes cast.
But as Trump has spread falsehoods about elections, Republicans have made purging noncitizens from voter rolls a central focus.

Democratic concerns were on display last week at the National Association of Secretaries of State conference, held at the Beau Rivage casino-resort in Biloxi. In interviews on the sidelines of the conference, Democratic secretaries of state voiced deep reservations — or outright opposition — about plugging their voter data into SAVE.
Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said Aug. 6 that the federal government appeared to be trying to take over election administration. She formally rejected the Justice Department’s voter roll request two days later.
Bellows said the Department of Homeland Security told her in a recent phone call that it planned to retain SAVE data for 10 years for “audit purposes only.”
“Just like the [Justice Department] is asking us to hand over an electronic file of all the voters in our state, it seems like the Department of Homeland Security is through this backdoor system also asking us to share voter information about every voter in our state,” Bellows said.
At least one state appears to have granted the federal government sweeping authority over any voter data it provides to SAVE.
Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales announced in July he had reached an agreement with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to access the newly expanded system for voter list maintenance. Indiana’s agreement allows the federal agency to use information the state provides for any purpose permitted by law, including criminal prosecutions.
Morales, a Republican, said in a news release that SAVE represented “another step in safeguarding the rights” of eligible voters. His office didn’t respond to Stateline’s questions.
The Trump administration has ramped up efforts to encourage state election officials to use the expanded program. The White House hosted a bipartisan “fly in” event for state secretaries of state on July 29. Multiple secretaries of state told Stateline that USCIS Director Joseph Edlow, who was confirmed on July 15, spoke at the event.
“The president is very much keyed in on voter list maintenance,” Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, a Republican, said in an interview — echoing other GOP secretaries of state who released statements praising the Trump administration after the meeting.












 When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances. 


–  Minnesota Democratic Secretary of State Steve Simon




Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, a Democrat who attended the meeting, said he questioned how the federal government would handle voter information provided to SAVE. He added that the Justice Department’s request for his state’s voter rolls raised his level of concern about how data would be used.
“When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances,” Simon told Stateline.
The White House referred questions about SAVE and the event to the Department of Homeland Security and USCIS.
In response to questions from Stateline, USCIS didn’t directly answer whether the agency would share voter roll data with other parts of the federal government but confirmed it disposes of records after 10 years.
“The SAVE application is a critical tool for state and local governments to access information to safeguard the integrity of elections across the country. It’s no wonder many states have quickly adopted it, and we continue to promote the tool to other states and counties not using SAVE,” USCIS spokesperson Matthew Tragesser said in a statement.
“We look forward to continued optimization efforts and implementing more updates to SAVE.”
GOP pressure
Some Republican election officials and Trump allies have long wanted the federal government to take an expanded role in searching state voter rolls for noncitizens.
Last summer the Trump-aligned litigation group America First Legal, co-founded by Trump adviser Stephen Miller, encouraged states to submit to the Department of Homeland Security the names of individuals for citizenship or immigration status verification.
Some states did just that. Texas, for example, asked USCIS to verify the citizenship of some voters in September, and Indiana asked the agency to verify 585,774 voters in October. The same month, 16 Republican state attorneys general signed a letter criticizing Homeland Security, then under the Biden administration, for failing to work with states on verification.

After Trump took office, GOP state officials kept up the pressure. Twenty-one Republican secretaries of state urged Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in February to prioritize SAVE improvements.
On April 16, Indiana sued the department in federal court for not responding to its verification request last fall. USCIS announced an overhaul of SAVE less than a week later.
As the agency continues to remake SAVE, the tool will soon allow searches using the last four digits of a Social Security number, multiple state secretaries of state told Stateline. The agency confirmed the feature is under development and will be available soon but didn’t provide an exact date.
The change would mark another significant expansion of the program because most states collect the last four digits when individuals without a driver’s license register to vote.
Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican, said SAVE represents a better way to verify citizenship than a state law requiring voters to produce documents. “I think there’s a real opportunity for us to do a lot of this through just sharing of information and I think that’s what we’re seeing happen,” McGrane said in an interview.
Unreliable data?
But some voting rights advocates and experts on government data caution against an overreliance on Social Security data.
The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, a progressive policy nonprofit, has noted that Social Security only began tracking the citizenship status of all applicants in 1978 — meaning the database doesn’t include comprehensive citizenship information for older Americans. Additionally, Social Security may not always have up-to-date information on the status of naturalized U.S. citizens.
The nonpartisan Institute for Responsive Government also warned in May that since SAVE hasn’t used Social Security numbers to verify citizenship in the past, its accuracy and effectiveness are unknown. The success of the expanded SAVE program may also partially depend on whether it has adequate staff and resources, it said.

A 2017 Government Accountability Office report found that between fiscal years 2012 and 2016, about 16% of the nearly 90 million SAVE searches required additional verification, which the institute says often translates into federal workers manually checking files. Now that SAVE allows bulk searches, the need for manual checking could rise dramatically.
Nick Doctor, director of implementation at the Institute for Responsive Government, said in an interview that a tool confirming the eligibility of registered voters in a way that doesn’t burden individuals can be a good thing. But he emphasized that it depends in large measure on SAVE’s implementation.
“The changes that have been made to SAVE happened very quickly and, to my knowledge, we haven’t seen releases on the level of accuracy of that information,” Doctor said.
During interviews, Republican secretaries of state stressed that voters aren’t kicked off the rolls because SAVE can’t verify their citizenship. Instead, an inability to verify would likely trigger a follow-up process with the voter.
“Just because we get something back from the SAVE database, it’s not a cut and dry, especially on those they’re not sure about,” Hoskins, the Missouri secretary of state, said.
Still, Arizona illustrates why some Democrats worry about any large-scale effort to ask voters — especially longtime, older residents — to prove their citizenship. After the state discovered errors in how it tracked voter citizenship dating back years, election officials are contacting some 200,000 voters seeking proof of citizenship documentation.
Some have been casting ballots for decades without incident and many feel targeted, Arizona Democratic Secretary of State Adrian Fontes said during a presentation at the state secretaries of state conference. “They feel insulted when they get that letter,” Fontes said.











 There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside. 


– Charles Stewart III, professor of political science at MIT who studies elections



	Charles Stewart III, a professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies elections, said Arizona may actually point to the potential usefulness of SAVE. If Arizona runs its voter roll through the program, a list of 200,000 voters needing citizenship verification would perhaps drop into the hundreds, he suggested.
“There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside,” Stewart said.
Connecticut Democratic Secretary of State Stephanie Thomas told Stateline that every secretary wants tools to keep voter lists as clean as possible. But the details are important.
When she hears of something new, Thomas said she asks whether it’s the best option available and whether “the i’s are dotted, the t’s crossed.” She said she’s asked USCIS a series of questions about SAVE and is waiting on some responses.
“When it comes to voter lists,” Thomas said, “I don’t want Connecticut voters to be a guinea pig.”

President Donald Trump’s administration has ordered some retiring coal plants to stay online, even as they have struggled to remain economically viable. (Liam Niemeyer/Kentucky Lantern)Mandates from President Donald Trump’s administration to retain aging coal plants could cause a massive spike in energy costs, according to an independent analysis commissioned by several environmental groups.
Orders from the U.S. Department of Energy to save coal plants from retirement could cost ratepayers more than $3 billion per year, according to a report from Grid Strategies, a power sector consulting firm. It was carried out on behalf of Earthjustice, Environmental Defense Fund, Natural Resources Defense Council and Sierra Club.
Under Trump, the agency has issued emergency orders to maintain operations at coal plants that were scheduled for retirement. While federal officials say the coal plants need to stay online to avoid blackouts, power plant owners and state regulators planned their closures because they were no longer economically viable or needed for reliability.
“DOE mandates override those well-informed decisions, inflating electric bills for homeowners and businesses and undermining the competitiveness of U.S. factories and data centers,” the Grid Strategies analysis found.

Across the country, coal plants have phased out as they’ve struggled to compete with cheaper renewables and natural gas. A 2023 analysis by Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan think tank, found that 99% of existing U.S. coal plants “are more expensive to run than replacement by local wind, solar, and energy storage resources.”
But Trump, who has pushed to unleash more fossil fuel development and to stymie wind and solar, has ordered a retiring coal plant in Michigan to stay online, along with an oil and gas plant in Pennsylvania.
“Based on the trend to date and indications that DOE has approached the owners of many retiring fossil power plants about potentially mandating their retention, DOE may attempt to mandate the retention of nearly all large fossil power plants slated for retirement between now and the end of 2028,” reads the Grid Strategies report.
The cost of keeping those plants online would be immense. By 2028, if Trump were to mandate the retention of all fossil fuel plants slated for retirement, the annual cost to ratepayers would be more than $3.1 billion, the analysis found.
The report also considers a number of aging plants that are not yet scheduled for retirement. It finds Trump’s actions could create a “perverse incentive,” causing plant owners to claim they’re planning to shut down, inducing the feds to step in and keep them open, with the cost borne by ratepayers.
Accounting for that possibility, the report found that ratepayer costs could reach $5.9 billion per year to keep the entire aging fossil fuel fleet online. California, Texas and Colorado would see the highest increases in electricity bills.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Across the country, farmers and small entrepreneurs are adding drones to their fleet of tools for tasks like spraying agricultural chemicals or spreading seeds for a cover crop.
Today, the majority of the ag-drone market is made up of Chinese manufactured machinery, which some federal laws seek to outlaw, largely due to national security fears.
Those in the industry, however, wonder if the budding American ag-drone market is ready to fill the gaps in the event of a U.S. ban on Chinese drones — which could begin at the end of the year.
 How and why drones?

Drones have slowly integrated into the agricultural sector. The price tags and ability to go out and spray right after a rain make them attractive options for farmers who would otherwise risk getting a spray rig stuck in the mud, or wait on the local aerial sprayer to fit them in their schedules.
Cory Maassen attended a spray drone workshop Tuesday in Clear Lake, Iowa, with his father, who farms corn and soybeans near Avoca, Iowa. The younger Maassen, who plans to take over the farm when his dad is ready, said he has been looking into drones as an option to add a supplementary revenue stream to the farm operation.
The Maassen property is under 1,000 acres, so Maassen figured adding a custom sprayer business could help build some longevity in the farm operation.
“To have a different income stream would be nice as well,” Corey Maassen said. “It’s cheaper than buying new land, it’s cheaper than buying a new sprayer.”
Maassen’s plan is in line with a lot of spray drone operators. Some farmers will buy a couple of drones for their property and make some cash spraying a neighbor’s field too. Others have built custom spraying businesses with a fleet of drones.
A traditional ag sprayer, one driven in the field, could cost upward of half a million dollars. A new spray drone costs between $25,000 and $60,000, depending on size. Granted, there is a tradeoff in time as a drone can spray a 20- to 30-foot swath at a time, compared to 120-foot booms that could come on a traditional sprayer.
“This is a fraction of the cost,” Maassen said. “And if it holds up as well as what they’re saying it can, it pays for itself within a year or two.”
Doug Dodd, a drone specialist at Titan Pro in Clear Lake, where the workshop was hosted, said the biggest reason a farmer should think about a drone is it gives them control over when they spray.
Dodd said farmers also have the ability to tackle uneven terrains, seed a cover crop and perform multiple applications. To him, drone technology in ag is akin to his grandfather’s generation adding tractors on their farms.
“You know any farmers who … farm without a tractor?” Dodd said. “I really feel like if guys are apprehensive, they’re falling farther behind.”
 Disruption to the Chinese drone market could be imminent

Eric Ringer is the president of the American Spray Drone Coalition and vice president of partnerships for an Iowa City based spray drone retailer and software company.
Ringer said the nature of the spray drone industry is that the majority of the technology comes from China.
The American Spray Drone Coalition represents nearly 80% of the ag spray drone market in the country and has opposed some legislation that would restrict the sale of Chinese drones in the U.S.
Last year Congress considered, and ultimately passed, the National Defense Authorization Act, which among many things, stipulated the Chinese-owned drone company DJI join the Federal Communication Commission’s “covered list” unless a federal agency reviewed the company and determined it did not pose a threat to national security.
No agency has taken up the process to review the company and if none steps up by Dec. 23 of this year, DJI will join a slew of other Chinese companies on the covered list, and in essence be banned in the U.S.
According to the American Spray Drone Coalition, Chinese-made drones account for about 90% of the market in the U.S. Ringer said it was estimated that around 80% of spray drone flights in the U.S. were done with DJI equipment as of 2024.
“The reality is that the best drones on the market right now are from China,” Ringer said. “We need to do better, as a nation, in building up good domestic alternatives — but that doesn’t happen magically by banning all drones from a certain country.”
Ringer said the coalition advocates for consumer choice in the spray drone space and he said the coalition is supportive of legislation that can “curb dependency” on Chinese options without limiting options in the market.
“We advocate for basic farmer choice,” Ringer said. “We want there to be lots of options on the market so that our farmers benefit from all the good things about competition in technology suppliers.”
Ringer said more competition means downward pressure on price and upward pressure on quality.
According to data from the American Spray Drone Coalition, more than 10.3 million acres were treated via spray drones in 2024, which represented $215 million in rural revenue – not from purchasing drones but from operators offering custom applications and other such services with the drones.
U.S. Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-New York, penned a letter with other lawmakers urging the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to expedite a review of DJI and Autel to prevent the companies from defaulting to the covered list in December. No further action on this effort has been announced.
A DJI spokesperson wrote in an email the company has been “urging” the relevant agencies to conduct the audit required by Congress, and said the removal of DJI from the American market would have “devastating ramifications” on the U.S. economy.
“We made clear then – as we do now – that we welcome the opportunity to participate in a rigorous, transparent, and fair audit,” the spokesperson said. “We believe our products can stand up to scrutiny because our security protections and data privacy controls are real and robust.”
The spokesperson also said DJI has also received certifications and security audits from “industry experts and federal agencies.”
According to the spokesperson, DJI products, which stretch beyond the agricultural sector, generate “more than $116 billion in economic activity” in the U.S.
“America’s drone community deserves due process,” the statement said. “Today, thousands of farmers, first responders, small businesses, and others would be cut off from essential tools that enable them to operate safely, efficiently, and cost-effectively.”
Opponents of the Chinese drones fear the surveillance- and data-gathering capabilities of the drones pose a national security threat.
Ringer said if cybersecurity is a concern, then the focus should be on creating the same types of firewalls and security protections that are on foreign-made consumer electronics.
Ringer said U.S. options make up around 5% of all manufactured drones, not just ag drones, on the market. With such limited current capacity, he said legislation should urge U.S. drone manufacturers to focus on the “high sensitivity use cases” such as military drones and surveillance.
The National Defense Authorization Act is not the only threat to Chinese made drones.
Certain shipments of DJI drones have been stopped by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, due to concerns of forced labor under the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act. In a company blog post, DJI said the claims were “entirely unfounded and categorically false.”
In June, the U.S. House Appropriations Committee approved the Homeland Security budget for fiscal year 2026, which had a provision that would stop U.S. Customs and Border Protections from admitting “aerosol-dispensing unmanned aircraft system(s) produced or manufactured in a foreign adversary country.”
Ringer said this legislation, if approved by the House and Senate as is, would mean “our farmers are left hanging.”
Another federal bill, which Ringer said was a “good way” to go about the issue, has a longer timeline for a Chinese drone ban and it offers grants to domestic manufacturers as they ramp up production.
“The thing that we risk if we cut off our supply of drones today, is that the U.S. options are going to get rushed to market, because there’s a huge vacuum there, and we’re going to deal with quality issues,” Ringer said.
Ringer said the market has enough options right now that cutting off DJI won’t break it. But, he worries about the impacts to the market if all Chinese drones and components are banned.
 Texas-based ag drone company ready to step in

Hylio is a Texas-based drone and software company that was born out of a group of college engineering students who saw the potential of ag spray drones.
Currently, Hylio represents between 10%-15% of the U.S. spray drone market, and is the sole drone brand sold at Titan Pro in Clear Lake.
Hylio’s CEO Arthur Erickson said if DJI were banned in December, his company wouldn’t fill the gap immediately, “but it really wouldn’t take us long to catch up.” 
Part of that is because there are only a few thousand operators in the U.S. that use ag spray drones. Right now, Erickson said, Hylio can make about 2,000 drones a year, but will be up to 5,000-6,000 annually once they reach full capacity in three or four years.
Erickson said he and his cofounders were not thinking about the geopolitical divide when they founded the company, but as they realized the dominance Chinese brands had on the market, the American-made promise became more of the company’s “ethos.”
“It’s not that we’re against China or even DJI,” Erickson said. “It shouldn’t be the only monopolistic option on the market. There should be a lot of different choices.”
Erickson said the strategy to ban all Chinese drones could be a “rip the Band-aid off” method to force American drone companies to accelerate. This would increase demand for Hylio, but also encourage some of the younger U.S. manufacturers to become more competitive.
“It’s not going to be existential if there’s a somewhat limited supply of these spray drones over the next two or three years as these American companies scale up,” Erickson said. “(Farmers) are not going to go out of business just because they didn’t have spray drones for two or three years.”
But, he said, some of the risks might come to other sectors of the drone market, like firefighters and police officers who have used drones to locate missing people, as some agencies did following the recent flooding events in Texas.
Erickson said there are certain elements about Chinese owned drones that worry him, including reported funding ties to the Chinese Communist Party and what he called anticompetitive business practices.
“China’s doing what’s best for them, but we can’t just sit back and let them completely dominate this industry,” Erickson said. “… It would be an existential threat to let any single entity, Chinese or not, have that amount of control.”
Erickson said the bottom line is that “China is on the chopping block” and that it’s a “serious factor” for those purchasing drones to know that some Chinese models could be banned in a couple of months.
Maassen, the prospective buyer, said he was considering purchasing a Hylio drone for that very reason.
“DJI, XAG (another Chinese drone company) are going to be cheaper in the buy out – that’s the reality of it,” Maassen said. “Why would I want to buy that drone if I’m not going to be able to service it … it’s not exactly a smart plan on my part.”

(Leah Romero for Source NM)New Mexico’s congressional delegation, along with other members representing states eligible for compensation under the Radiation and Exposure Compensation Act, have asked U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi for a meeting to discuss implementation of the program.
The Aug. 14 letter acknowledges that the U.S. Department of Justice released new applications for RECA compensation following its inclusion and expansion in the July tax-and-spend bill signed by President Donald Trump, but asks U.S. DOJ to also release updated regulations.
‘The beginning of justice’

“For years we introduced legislation to expand RECA to cover all the communities harmed by our government’s nuclear testing program,” the letter reads. “We are glad that eight decades after the United States detonated the first atomic bomb in New Mexico and began to process uranium that poisoned many in St. Louis and elsewhere, the many diverse communities harmed by the nuclear testing program can finally apply for the compensation they deserve.”
The letter urges the agency to expedite updated RECA regulations, noting that “many survivors are already very ill, and with each passing week, more may die or be diagnosed.” The lawmakers also write that the agency should make payments available during the release of the interim rule, rather than wait for the final rule. The letter also specifies several actions the Department of Justice should take, including: hiring navigators to work directly with claimants; making information easily available to all claimants; holding informational sessions; remaining “flexible” about claimants’ documentation; and warning claimants about potential scams. New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez and RECA activists at the end of July issued a warning about such scams targeting claimants.
The new letter follows one sent by U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Luján and U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) sent in July to Bondi and Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer also urging them to issue guidance quickly for RECA given the short two-year timeline for compensation.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/vigil2-1024x683.png,,,2025-08-17 09:56:25.390398

(Photo by Preston Keres, USDA via Flickr)A pig’s head arrives in front of Christopher Lopez.
He knows the drill: cut into the area behind the ears, find two small lymph nodes and incise them three or four times each. Check the nose and mouth for signs of disease — six to nine seconds to finish the inspection. Wash the gloves and sanitize the knives. One to two seconds to breathe.
Another head is already coming.
For a year and seven months, Lopez performed procedures like this for 10 hours a day, five to six days a week. It’s what he was trained for as a consumer safety inspector at the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS).
“I would have my fingers start to lock up because I was gripping my knives too hard,” Lopez said. “Even though we kept ourselves at a high standard of being clean, I felt dirty, so I didn’t like to eat. It’s hard to stay hydrated, because if I had to take a drink, I had to take off my gloves, and I don’t have a lot of time to do that.”
At larger processing facilities, Lopez — who left his position in April — would help inspect thousands of animals a day for issues ranging from fecal matter to pathogens. The fast operation rates posed a challenge but were manageable, he said.
“I would say I had enough time,” Lopez said. “Did I have as much time as I wanted? No, absolutely not.”
Many swine and poultry plants across the U.S. are now increasing rates of processing and inspecting animals — or line speeds. The change is part of what government officials call a “modernized” inspection system, which also shifts carcass sorting duties from federal inspectors to company employees.

In March, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced plans to extend modernization waivers and to make faster line speeds a federal standard under President Trump’s second administration.
The move could permanently change the level of oversight FSIS inspectors have on the lines.
The USDA has said increasing line speeds will help companies meet growing demand without “excessive government interference,” according to a March release. Pork and poultry industry groups backed the announcement almost immediately, and one company official told Investigate Midwest that privatizing certain responsibilities allows for more in-house accountability during inspections.

However, critics of the change argue that federal inspectors play an essential role as independent watchdogs in privately run plants, and increasing line speeds with less federal oversight poses a significant risk to consumers, workers and animals.
“To put it simply, the plant will control every aspect of it with minimal oversight,” said Paula Soldner, national joint council chairperson of a FSIS inspectors’ union.
Shifts to modernization began in 1997 as FSIS permitted faster line speeds and fewer federal inspectors at a handful of swine and poultry slaughterhouses nationwide. In 2014, a new program began permitting poultry plants to modernize voluntarily, and an opt-in system for swine plants followed in 2019.
As of August, 168 poultry plants and 18 swine establishments have converted to modernized models. Waivers for two poultry facilities and four pork plants are currently pending.



At modernized poultry plants, line speed caps have risen from 140 to 175 birds per minute, and their swine counterparts face no line speed limits. All these establishments rely on their own employees to sort carcasses — the process of analyzing meat and trimming off defects — while government inspectors remain hands-off at the ends of the lines.
Though FSIS insists the modernized system keeps federal inspectors in charge, just with fewer physical responsibilities, The Washington Post reported in 2019 that inspection duties are shifting to private companies under modernization — if not on paper, then in practice.


At Wayne-Sanderson Farms, the nation’s third-largest poultry producer with over 26,000 employees, modernization efforts have led to a handoff of inspection responsibilities, according to Juanfra DeVillena, senior vice president of quality assurance and food safety. He confirmed company personnel have taken over initial inspection tasks and are now in charge of ensuring quality, while federal inspectors continue to oversee food safety.
“FSIS is food safety inspection, and they were getting into areas that did not belong to them,” DeVillena said. “What FSIS did is they just switched their focus to what they should have always done, which is food safety, and put the quality oversight back into our operations.”
In a statement to Investigate Midwest, a USDA spokesperson maintained that modernization is backed by “science and common sense.”
“These reforms allow for greater efficiency while strengthening U.S. food production, reducing costs for producers and consumers, and supporting a more resilient supply chain,” the government spokesperson wrote.
‘Some of them can be sneaky’: Inspectors warn of food safety risks

From August 2023 to last April, Lopez worked as an inspector on and off the processing lines at 16 pork, poultry, beef or bison plants in three states. Multiple were modernized facilities, he said, including Pitman Farms, a Utah turkey establishment.
  Christopher Lopez, former FSIS consumer safety inspector. (Photo provided by Lopez)
There, company personnel sorted the carcasses, and as a federal inspector, Lopez observed their actions and screened every bird at the end of the line.
There were benefits to this hands-off role, he said, like being able to “sit there and actually look at product and not have to focus on sharpening our knives.” That’s part of how FSIS framed the change in its modernization policy: by removing inspectors from hands-on duties, the agency said they could devote more time to evaluating carcasses online and completing offline verification tasks “that are more effective in ensuring food safety.”
“Extensive research has confirmed that modernized systems uphold the highest food safety standards,” the USDA spokesperson wrote to Investigate Midwest.
But under the poultry modernization program, only one federal inspector is stationed on each processing line, responsible for reviewing all carcasses sorted by plant employees. And problems arose for Lopez when the workers he oversaw consistently outnumbered him five to one.
“Yes, we’re there, and we have the potential to see everything that’s going on, but in reality, it doesn’t always work out that way,” Lopez said. “You can’t look at five people and watch everything that they’re doing as well as pay attention to what you’re inspecting.”
To Lopez, the success of a plant’s modernization depends on staffing levels. If line speeds increase, so should the number of plant workers and federal inspectors to maintain food safety standards, he said.
A USDA spokesperson did not address questions from Investigate Midwest about how the agency enforces federal staffing standards at traditional plants, and how these regulations differ at modernized plants.
Soldner, of the FSIS inspectors’ union, has visited several modernized slaughterhouses over the past few years. She said she noticed no glaring food safety concerns because all the facilities were “adequately staffed.”
But even sufficient staffing may not be enough. According to Lopez, FSIS requires its inspectors to undergo “intensive” training prior to certification, where food safety is highlighted as the top priority. At the modernized plants where Lopez worked, he said private employees tasked with carcass sorting went through similar training, though he believes it was not nearly as rigorous.
FSIS does not mandate any standardized training for company sorters. The agency instead encourages companies to conduct independent training based on federal guidelines for both pork and poultry, which are derived from FSIS inspector training protocols.
At Wayne-Sanderson Farms, DeVillena said privately-hired sorters undergo annual recertifications using an internal training manual developed from federal guidelines. The training includes classroom lectures, on-the-job training, follow-up sessions and continuous monitoring.
“I honestly don’t know the frequency in which the FSIS inspectors get trained, but I can tell you that for our group, it’s more strict because we own that process,” DeVillena said. “We gotta be able to defend it and validate it.”
But Wayne-Sanderson’s approach is not industry standard — or federally mandated. Critics say that flexibility is the problem. Without enforceable, uniform training requirements, each company can decide how thoroughly its workers are prepared to identify contamination and disease.
In public comments on the 2019 swine modernization policy, several advocacy groups urged FSIS to establish official training for company sorters. Even industry members requested that the agency improve existing training guidelines.
FSIS responded that its current guide was sufficient, and it would not be “prescribing specific sorter training or certification.” When Investigate Midwest asked why, the agency did not respond.
Adequate training only goes so far, Lopez said. In his experience, even if carcass sorters were well-trained, their priorities as private personnel may have leaned toward keeping the lines moving.
“Some of them can be sneaky about what they do,” Lopez said. In instances where he flagged a carcass for contamination but didn’t immediately take control of it, he said employees would sometimes make the contamination “mysteriously disappear” or mix the carcass in with others. “They might do it in the name of efficiency, but not necessarily in the name of food safety,” he added.
In response to Lopez’s experiences at modernized plants, DeVillena said the structure of modernized inspection systems at Wayne-Sanderson Farms makes it “impossible” to hide defects.
“Even if we wanted to do that, which we don’t want to, there’s no way for us to do that,” DeVillena said.

DeVillena described two levels of FSIS oversight at his company: a carcass inspector stationed at the end of the line to catch external contamination like fecal matter, and a verification inspector who examines 10 carcasses in detail each hour, including internal checks, to make sure company employees do their jobs effectively. He emphasized that the latter inspector can open the carcasses, examine every surface and is not directly supervising the sorters’ work — but still has full access to verify product safety.
However, other inspectors have described experiences similar to those of Lopez. In April 2020, Jill Mauer, a federal consumer safety inspector, filed a declaration as part of a 2019 lawsuit against the USDA over its swine modernization policy. In it, Mauer said she’d been working at a modernized pork plant in Austin, Minnesota, for 23 years prior.
“I have witnessed slaughterhouse employees attempt to sneak defective carcasses past me,” her declaration stated. Diseased animals and defects like “toenails, hair, and abscesses are routinely allowed for human consumption” at the facility, Mauer wrote.
Part of the problem, she said, was the short inspection time. At the modernized plant in Minnesota, “inspectors have about two seconds per pig to identify pathology and fecal contamination,” Mauer stated. Investigate Midwest reached out to her for comment, but she declined to speak on the record.
Soldner, who worked as a FSIS inspector for 32 years prior to her full-time role at the inspectors’ union, said this window wasn’t nearly enough time for federal inspectors to spot hazards — even if private employees had already reviewed the carcasses.
The shrinking role of inspectors on pork and poultry lines reflect a fundamental shift in oversight, she said.
“When I came in in 1987, we regulated the industry,” Soldner told Investigate Midwest. “Now, industry regulates what FSIS inspectors have the ability to do.”
Industry groups defend modernization 
Pork and poultry industries claim faster line speeds do not make food any less safe.
When the USDA announced its plans to formally increase line speeds in March, the National Chicken Council, a trade association representing U.S. chicken companies, voiced its support. In a March 17 release, the Council cited a 2021 study concluding that faster line speeds do not predict higher salmonella contamination risk in young chicken processing plants.
In a statement to Investigate Midwest, Tom Super, the Council’s senior vice president of public affairs, emphasized that modernization in poultry processing applies only to the speed of evisceration lines — the “highly automated” areas that involve organ removal, carcass cleaning and inspection.
“Food safety outcomes are not determined by the speed of the evisceration line,” Super wrote. Instead, he said, they depend on maintaining strict protocols, using science-backed safety measures and ensuring consistent oversight.
Investigate Midwest reached out to several other modernized swine and poultry companies for comment about faster line speeds and the reorganization of federal inspectors. None responded to multiple requests for comment.
For years, industry groups have lobbied for faster line speeds, records show.
In 2017, the National Chicken Council petitioned the government to permit faster line speeds in young chicken slaughterhouses. Shortly after, multiple trade associations and corporations shared nearly identical letters of support.
In the letters, industry groups — including the Ohio Poultry Association, the Indiana State Poultry Association, Wayne-Sanderson Farms (then Wayne Farms) and House of Raeford Farms — celebrated the petition as a step forward in “promoting and enhancing FSIS inspection procedures” and “increasing industry efficiency.”
Industry members wrote that they believe modernization would maintain food safety, citing a 2017 federal report that found no increase in salmonella contamination at modernized poultry plants.
“The data also demonstrated that inspectors are performing four times more off-line food safety verification tasks” in modernized plants than in their traditional counterparts, the letters stated.
In one letter, House of Raeford Farms — one of the top poultry producers nationwide — highlighted the “competitive disadvantage” of line speed caps. Plants in other countries like Canada operate at higher line speeds, the company wrote, so eliminating domestic line speed limits would “put U.S. producers on more equal footing.”



FSIS ultimately denied the National Chicken Council’s petition in January 2018, but said it intended to allow faster line speeds at young chicken plants that follow certain criteria “in the near future.” A month later, the agency published that criteria, permitting certain facilities to increase line speeds.
Now, under Trump’s second administration, faster line speeds are on track to become the new federal standard for both pork and poultry.
For plants with high daily outputs, Lopez, the former FSIS inspector, said that faster lines and shifting federal oversight could lead to food safety risks. But he sees potential in modernized systems, he said, especially at facilities that maintain sufficient staff and don’t overwhelm them with thousands of animals a day.


“I think that some of the medium-sized establishments really could benefit from it,” Lopez said. “The large establishments just kind of take advantage of it.”
Is speed or staffing to blame for increased worker injury? 
Data shows that meatpacking and poultry companies are among the most dangerous industries in America.
Two government-commissioned studies published in January found that 81% of workers at evaluated poultry facilities and 46% of workers at evaluated swine plants were at high risk of musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) like carpal tunnel syndrome.
PULSE_PoultryStudy_250109_Final
Many workers and advocates say faster line speeds increase risk of injury. Jose Oliva — campaigns director at HEAL Food Alliance, a coalition of food and farm system workers — called the change a “total travesty” for plant employees. Prior to HEAL, Oliva served as director of the Food Chain Workers Alliance, which represents hundreds of thousands of workers in the food system.
“Even though you are wearing protective equipment, that does not give you 100% protection,” Oliva said. “If (workers are) injured or cut themselves, if the injury is not too deep, they just continue to work. The line just keeps moving.”
A policy brief from Johns Hopkins University supports this conclusion, according to Patti Truant Anderson, the brief’s author.
“What we found in our review of literature was that there’s strong evidence that line speeds are associated with higher worker perceptions of injury risk, so they feel like it’s more unsafe when they’re made to work at these higher line speeds,” said Anderson, who is policy director at the Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future. Her analysis also found that line speeds are associated with “lower worker well-being and higher injury risk from repetitive tasks,” she said.
Several reports by the U.S. Government Accountability Office, a federal watchdog agency, highlight these concerns. The assessments, published between 2005 and 2017, repeatedly note stakeholder concerns about worker safety with faster line speeds. When asked if GAO is investigating modernization in light of Rollins’ recent announcement, public affairs specialist Jasmine Berry Franklin told Investigate Midwest the agency has “nothing currently in the works.”

The National Chicken Council, however, points to results from the January study on poultry workers, which suggest no associations between evisceration line speeds and MSD risk. The identical study on swine workers found conflicting evidence: faster evisceration lines were linked to an increase in MSD risk at one facility, and a decrease at another.
In the statement to Investigate Midwest, the USDA spokesperson cited the same studies, concluding “no direct link between line speeds and workplace injuries.” The agency’s March 17 announcement to formalize faster line speeds also halted any further collection of worker safety data from modernized plants, calling the information “redundant.”
According to Carisa Harris — principal investigator of both studies and director of the Northern California Center of Occupational and Environmental Health — evisceration line speeds aren’t the main determinant of worker safety.
Instead, she said, the critical metric is piece rate: the number of animal parts handled per minute by each individual worker. While evisceration line speeds measure the speed at which the lines move in one stage of processing, piece rate takes into account both line speeds and staffing levels to determine the individual workload of each employee throughout the entire process.
Both studies found a correlation between MSD risk and piece rate.
swine processing line speed study
“There’s been so much attention on evisceration line speed, and our hope is that the conversation changes because that’s not the variable that’s going to help protect workers,” Harris said. “If we can talk about piece rate by area or by job, that would be a much more productive conversation to have.”
The two studies weren’t without limitations. One, as Harris called it, was “healthy worker survivor bias” — the tendency for results to reflect only workers healthy enough to continue on.
“Those who left employment due to work-related pain or the inability to keep up with the high pace of work were underrepresented,” the poultry report stated. The swine study echoed this limitation.
Debbie Berkowitz, who served as chief of staff at the Occupational Safety and Health Administration from 2009 to 2014, said she believes evaluated plants may have also added staff during the study period to reduce individual workloads while under observation.
“Because (the plants) knew they were being studied, they added workers to jobs, which meant that nobody was working harder and faster in the key jobs that they studied,” Berkowitz told Investigate Midwest.

The USDA spokesperson did not respond to a question about this phenomenon, but Harris acknowledged it was a concern — that plants may have temporarily improved working conditions during the study. However, she said her team regularly interviewed workers to assess whether the conditions they experienced during the studies matched their usual work environments. According to Harris, “very few” reported any differences.
Lori Stevermer, a Minnesota pork producer and immediate past president of the National Pork Producers Council, reiterated that “increased line speeds are not a leading factor in worker safety” in a statement to Investigate Midwest.
Super, of the National Chicken Council, said unsafe line speeds would be counterproductive for the industry itself.
“If line speeds are set too fast, then tasks will not be performed properly and the result will be a costly de-valuing of the final poultry products,” Super wrote in the statement. “No benefit exists for plant management to operate production lines at speeds that are unsafe, and will not permit all work to be performed at high levels of skill and competence.”
Where efficiency meets animal welfare 
Slaughterhouse operations are systematic. Animals undergo a step-by-step process that stuns, scalds, removes organs, washes, cuts and chills in a highly efficient fashion.
However, protocol can go awry for a variety of reasons, ranging from worker error to machinery malfunction. And animal welfare advocates allege that it has, especially at modernized swine and poultry plants with increasing line speeds and shifting federal oversight.

Delcianna Winders, director of the Animal Law and Policy Institute at the Vermont Law and Graduate School, said faster line speeds result in more inhumane practices.
“Animals who are not keeping pace with the line are handled violently by workers who are just trying to keep up,” Winders told Investigate Midwest. This involves “increased dragging of animals, hitting of animals and excessive electroshocking” leading up to slaughter, she said.
Concerns like these helped fuel a 2019 lawsuit filed by Winders and a group of animal welfare organizations, challenging the USDA’s swine modernization program. The lawsuit alleged, among other claims, that increasing line speeds and shifting responsibility from federal inspectors to slaughterhouse employees jeopardize humane handling.
“Even downed pigs — animals too sick or injured to walk — were handled in this way, because, according to a supervisor, they ‘don’t have time’ to handle them more humanely,” the lawsuit stated.
As part of the court case, advocates and inspectors submitted a series of declarations about personal experiences with modernization. One testimony came from Mauer, the consumer safety inspector who raised food safety concerns about her modernized pork plant in Austin, Minnesota.
Mauer wrote that on multiple occasions, she noticed pig carcasses with water-filled lungs from the scald tank — a stage in the slaughter process where animals should be dead.
“While there are a few reasons why tank water in the lungs may occur, tank water in hogs’ lungs is an indication that pigs were possibly still breathing at the time they entered the scalding tank,” her declaration stated.
Improper execution at slaughterhouses isn’t a new complaint. In 2013, the Washington Post reported that nearly 1 million birds were boiled alive in U.S. poultry plants every year, based on USDA data. This was in part due to rapid line speeds, which can result in unsuccessful slaughter prior to scald tank immersion, the article found.
But Super, of the National Chicken Council, maintained that modernization only changes the speeds of postmortem evisceration lines. Leading up to and during slaughter, Super said, chicken processors consider animal welfare “the top priority,” and they “strictly adhere” to federal guidelines for humane handling.



Advocates remain critical. Michael Windsor — senior corporate engagement director at The Humane League, a nonprofit working to end farmed animal abuse — told Investigate Midwest in a statement that faster line speeds in any stage of processing add pressure to the entire system.
“Any increase in line speeds — pre- or post-mortem — create a dangerous ripple effect that increases suffering for animals and hazards for workers,” Windsor stated.
He added that consumers likely have a “limited sense” of what goes on behind closed doors at modernized plants.


“When people think about food safety or animal welfare, they don’t necessarily picture the exhausted workers racing to keep pace with hundreds of birds per minute or the animals being improperly stunned and boiled alive,” Windsor wrote. “This lack of awareness isn’t accidental. The meat industry operates in secrecy, and USDA policies — like allowing company employees to replace federal inspectors — only deepen the opacity.”
Four years after the 2019 lawsuit, the judge dismissed the case and upheld the federal swine modernization program. In a December 2023 ruling, the court found that FSIS had adequately considered humane handling impacts, which was all the law required.
Winders said she believes courts generally defer to the judgment of administration agencies like the USDA.
“It’s very hard to prevail against an agency because everything is going to be interpreted in their favor,” she said.
Winders and her team stand firm on one claim, arguing modernization reduces federal oversight and endangers animal welfare. They’ve appealed the ruling, and an oral argument is approaching in the next few months. With formal laws on the horizon, Winders said issues surrounding modernization are only growing more critical — not just due to risks to animals, but also to workers and consumers.
“It’s hard to disentangle the animal welfare concerns and human safety concerns,” she told Investigate Midwest. “They’re really intertwined.”

(Photo by Kevin Hardy/Stateline)BOSTON — During this year’s budget cycle, Oklahoma state Sen. John Haste said lawmakers had two major things on their minds.
“Number one was tax cuts. Number two, what the hell is going on in Washington?” he told a national gathering of state lawmakers last week in Boston.
While Oklahoma lawmakers secured another round of income tax cuts, they are still wrapping their heads around the fiscal impacts of President Donald Trump’s massive spending and tax law, Haste said. The measure slashes funding for health care and food assistance.
That legislation, and other Trump actions, proved a central theme of discussion during the National Conference of State Legislatures summit, which organizers said was the largest ever gathering of state lawmakers with more than 1,600 in attendance. Aside from cutting funding, the law imposes costly new administrative burdens on states.
States are still sorting through the long-term impacts of the legislation — and what, if any, actions they can take to soften the blow.
Tracking Medicaid patients’ work status may prove difficult for states

Haste, a Republican, said concern is highest in rural areas, where reduced Medicaid funding could threaten hospitals. He said that just one provision of the law will cut $209 million in funds that help Oklahoma cover the cost of Medicaid, and that the state will need to spend an estimated $30 million on the new cost of checking eligibility twice per year.
“All of those things added together come up to a really big number,” he said, but added: “We don’t know exactly what that is.”
Lawmakers from liberal and conservative states said they are still grappling with the implications of Trump’s signature legislation. With most states boasting solid fiscal positions, some expect to cover new up-front administrative costs by tapping into strong reserve funds. But many are considering reducing services.
Nevada state Sen. Fabian Doñate, a Democrat, said state leaders will have to cut Medicaid eligibility or services since Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo has said he will oppose any efforts to raise taxes.
“That becomes a challenge, right?” Doñate said during a panel discussion on Medicaid. “Do you cut the pregnant mom or the person that makes above 180% of the federal poverty level who’s under 50, or do you cut diapers for seniors?”
At the same time, states must gear up for new bureaucratic mandates from Washington.
“Regardless of how you feel about these provisions — whether these are opportunities or challenges, fantastic or awful — regardless, it’s going to be a heavy lift for states,” said Lauren Kallins, NCSL’s senior legislative director for state-federal affairs.
She said states and organizations, including NCSL, are still awaiting detailed federal guidance on all the changes, which are spread out over several years. But states will need to react quickly.

One provision in the law requires the 40 states plus Washington, D.C., that have expanded Medicaid to check paperwork at least twice a year to ensure those enrollees are meeting new work requirements. The legislation provided states $200 million, but experts question whether it will be enough to help states implement the changes by the end of 2026.
To meet that deadline, states will need to increase outreach to Medicaid recipients and make new investments in technology, Kallins said. Similarly, states must cover new administrative costs for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, commonly called food stamps.
Traditionally, the federal government has fully funded SNAP benefits and split administrative costs of the program with states. The new law requires states to fund 75% of administrative costs and requires some states, depending on the accuracy of their eligibility determination, to fund a portion of benefits.
“So that’s another very significant increase for states,” Kallins said.
States in a ‘very, very strong position’
Though revenue growth is slowing, lawmakers and experts pointed out that many states currently enjoy strong budget fundamentals.
Statehouse Democrats want to use Trump’s big bill to drag down Republicans

That’s true in Utah, which touts deep reserve funding and a rapidly growing economy.
Jonathan Ball, Utah’s legislative fiscal analyst, told conference attendees that the state could rely on some of its reserve for one-time administrative and technical costs associated with the federal legislation.
He said lawmakers and budget writers always have to find creative ways to solve their state’s budget puzzles.
“It’s a little bit maybe scarier, but it’s not a new sort of problem,” he said. “I think you all have the tools, we feel like we have the tools to fix it.”
Still, he said the potential for further federal funding cuts has raised many questions.
“The uncertainty about what happens in the future is huge,” Ball said.
At a separate session focusing on state budgets, financial analyst Geoffrey Buswick said most states have enviable credit ratings, meaning investors can be confident in a state’s ability to pay back debts, which affords it lower interest rates.
Buswick, the managing director and sector leader for public finance at S&P Global Ratings, said states likely have the budgetary cushion to adjust to federal policy changes.
“The states are in a very, very strong position — about the strongest we’ve ever seen,” he said.
Maryland Democratic state Sen. Karen Lewis Young didn’t buy that assessment.
She said her state touts strong reserve funds, but that those can only be used for one-time expenses and not to replace eliminated funding on an ongoing basis. Maryland is facing a huge decline in federal jobs, along with federal cuts in transportation, health and education funding.
“What am I missing in your optimism?” she asked the financial analyst.
Medicaid cuts are likely to worsen mental health care in rural America

Afterward, she told Stateline that Maryland may tout a stronger position compared with other states. But she added that even with low unemployment and a high average income, the federal legislation forces difficult decisions for lawmakers, who are constitutionally mandated to balance the state budget.
“You’ve got to cut from someplace else,” she said. “If you’re losing a pretty large share of your federal match, who do you cut?”
A ‘substantial headache’
Across the country, Democratic lawmakers hope to underscore the cuts in Trump’s new law to weigh down Republicans in state races this year and next.
Hawaii Democratic state Sen. Ronald Kouchi said lawmakers need to ensure constituents understand where the spending cuts originated.
“Who’s going to be blamed when people are left out, when people are hungry and they lose out on educational opportunities?” he asked during a panel. “If we as state legislators do not convey that it is a result of the decisionmakers in Washington, D.C., they will be at our doorstep as the place of last resort.”
Kouchi, the president of the state Senate, said Hawaii leaders had socked away more than $1 billion in reserves. But he said the state cannot fill in all the financial gaps, especially during a time when officials are trying to set aside more in disaster funding and grapple with a slowdown in tourism.
“There is no current financial ability for the state to meet the needs of everyone who is currently being impacted,” he said in an interview.
 










We have no idea yet how we’re going to respond.


– West Virginia Republican House Speaker Roger Hanshaw




New Mexico state Rep. Meredith Dixon, a Democrat, said her state should be somewhat insulated after directing surplus oil and gas revenues into a new Medicaid Trust Fund. But she said it’s still unclear how much pressure the federal legislation will put on the state.
“We are not protected by any stretch. So we are going to have to look at how we cover those costs. … We’re still digging into everything.”
West Virginia House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, a Republican, said no one in the federal government or at the state level seemed to have a full understanding of the implications of the legislation.
“I look at this bill as Obamacare 2.0: We have to pass this bill so we can find out what’s in it,” he told Stateline.
Hanshaw said the law has some provisions that will benefit West Virginia and others that will cause a “substantial headache.”
“We have no idea yet how we’re going to respond,” he said. “I don’t want to speak for any other state … but I would speculate that’s true for nearly every other state.”

But Democratic critics and data experts warn it could allow the federal government to vacuum up vast quantities of information on Americans for unclear purposes.
Some Democratic election officials and opponents of the effort fear President Donald Trump wants to build a federal database of voters to target political opponents or cherry-pick rare examples of noncitizen voters to fuel a sense of crisis. Republican election officials allied with the president counter that he’s helping states to maintain accurate voter rolls.
The Trump administration has rolled out changes to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, tool at the same time the U.S. Department of Justice is asking states for copies of their voter rolls. The timing, combined with questions about what happens to voter data uploaded to the program, has alarmed critics.

Trump wants Congress to pass a national proof of citizenship voter registration requirement and in March tried to unilaterally impose one for federal elections through executive order. But with the legislation stalled and the order halted by the courts, the citizenship data tool may offer a backdoor way to accomplish the same goal.
SAVE was originally intended to help state and local officials verify the immigration status of individual noncitizens seeking government benefits. But U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, this spring refashioned it into a platform that can scan states’ voter rolls if election officials upload the data.

The changes to SAVE, rolled out over just a few months and with little public debate, are “tinkering with sort of the bones of democracy,” said John Davisson, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington, D.C.-based research and advocacy group that argues privacy is a fundamental right.
“You’re talking about the voting process and who will be eligible to vote,” Davisson said. “And to take a system that is not designed for use in that process and repurpose it, really on the fly, without a formal comment process, without formal rulemaking, without congressional intervention — that’s pretty anomalous and pretty alarming.”
Previously, SAVE could only search one name at a time. Now it can conduct bulk searches, allowing state officials to potentially feed into it information on millions of registered voters. SAVE checks that information against a series of federal databases and reports back whether it can verify someone’s immigration status.
Since May, it also can draw upon Social Security data, transforming the program into a tool that can confirm citizenship because Social Security records for many, but not all, Americans include the information. NPR reported earlier on changes to SAVE.
“It is incredible what has been done, really since March,” Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray, a Republican who supports proof of citizenship requirements and the SAVE tool, told a gathering of state secretaries of state in Biloxi, Mississippi, last week.
Individuals registering to vote in federal elections must already sign a statement affirming they are citizens under penalty of perjury, and those who cast a ballot face criminal penalties and deportation. One study of the 2016 election placed the prevalence of noncitizen voting at 0.0001% of votes cast.
But as Trump has spread falsehoods about elections, Republicans have made purging noncitizens from voter rolls a central focus.

Democratic concerns were on display last week at the National Association of Secretaries of State conference, held at the Beau Rivage casino-resort in Biloxi. In interviews on the sidelines of the conference, Democratic secretaries of state voiced deep reservations — or outright opposition — about plugging their voter data into SAVE.
Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said Aug. 6 that the federal government appeared to be trying to take over election administration. She formally rejected the Justice Department’s voter roll request two days later.
Bellows said the Department of Homeland Security told her in a recent phone call that it planned to retain SAVE data for 10 years for “audit purposes only.”
“Just like the [Justice Department] is asking us to hand over an electronic file of all the voters in our state, it seems like the Department of Homeland Security is through this backdoor system also asking us to share voter information about every voter in our state,” Bellows said.
At least one state appears to have granted the federal government sweeping authority over any voter data it provides to SAVE.
Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales announced in July he had reached an agreement with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to access the newly expanded system for voter list maintenance. Indiana’s agreement allows the federal agency to use information the state provides for any purpose permitted by law, including criminal prosecutions.
Morales, a Republican, said in a news release that SAVE represented “another step in safeguarding the rights” of eligible voters. His office didn’t respond to Stateline’s questions.
The Trump administration has ramped up efforts to encourage state election officials to use the expanded program. The White House hosted a bipartisan “fly in” event for state secretaries of state on July 29. Multiple secretaries of state told Stateline that USCIS Director Joseph Edlow, who was confirmed on July 15, spoke at the event.
“The president is very much keyed in on voter list maintenance,” Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, a Republican, said in an interview — echoing other GOP secretaries of state who released statements praising the Trump administration after the meeting.

Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, a Democrat who attended the meeting, said he questioned how the federal government would handle voter information provided to SAVE. He added that the Justice Department’s request for his state’s voter rolls raised his level of concern about how data would be used.
“When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances,” Simon told Stateline.
The White House referred questions about SAVE and the event to the Department of Homeland Security and USCIS.
In response to questions from Stateline, USCIS didn’t directly answer whether the agency would share voter roll data with other parts of the federal government but confirmed it disposes of records after 10 years.
“The SAVE application is a critical tool for state and local governments to access information to safeguard the integrity of elections across the country. It’s no wonder many states have quickly adopted it, and we continue to promote the tool to other states and counties not using SAVE,” USCIS spokesperson Matthew Tragesser said in a statement.
“We look forward to continued optimization efforts and implementing more updates to SAVE.”

GOP pressure

Some Republican election officials and Trump allies have long wanted the federal government to take an expanded role in searching state voter rolls for noncitizens.
Last summer the Trump-aligned litigation group America First Legal, co-founded by Trump adviser Stephen Miller, encouraged states to submit to the Department of Homeland Security the names of individuals for citizenship or immigration status verification.
Some states did just that. Texas, for example, asked USCIS to verify the citizenship of some voters in September, and Indiana asked the agency to verify 585,774 voters in October. The same month, 16 Republican state attorneys general signed a letter criticizing Homeland Security, then under the Biden administration, for failing to work with states on verification.

After Trump took office, GOP state officials kept up the pressure. Twenty-one Republican secretaries of state urged Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in February to prioritize SAVE improvements.
On April 16, Indiana sued the department in federal court for not responding to its verification request last fall. USCIS announced an overhaul of SAVE less than a week later.
As the agency continues to remake SAVE, the tool will soon allow searches using the last four digits of a Social Security number, multiple state secretaries of state told Stateline. The agency confirmed the feature is under development and will be available soon but didn’t provide an exact date.
The change would mark another significant expansion of the program because most states collect the last four digits when individuals without a driver’s license register to vote.
Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican, said SAVE represents a better way to verify citizenship than a state law requiring voters to produce documents. “I think there’s a real opportunity for us to do a lot of this through just sharing of information and I think that’s what we’re seeing happen,” McGrane said in an interview.

Unreliable data?

But some voting rights advocates and experts on government data caution against an overreliance on Social Security data.
The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, a progressive policy nonprofit, has noted that Social Security only began tracking the citizenship status of all applicants in 1978 — meaning the database doesn’t include comprehensive citizenship information for older Americans. Additionally, Social Security may not always have up-to-date information on the status of naturalized U.S. citizens.
The nonpartisan Institute for Responsive Government also warned in May that since SAVE hasn’t used Social Security numbers to verify citizenship in the past, its accuracy and effectiveness are unknown. The success of the expanded SAVE program may also partially depend on whether it has adequate staff and resources, it said.

A 2017 Government Accountability Office report found that between fiscal years 2012 and 2016, about 16% of the nearly 90 million SAVE searches required additional verification, which the institute says often translates into federal workers manually checking files. Now that SAVE allows bulk searches, the need for manual checking could rise dramatically.
Nick Doctor, director of implementation at the Institute for Responsive Government, said in an interview that a tool confirming the eligibility of registered voters in a way that doesn’t burden individuals can be a good thing. But he emphasized that it depends in large measure on SAVE’s implementation.
“The changes that have been made to SAVE happened very quickly and, to my knowledge, we haven’t seen releases on the level of accuracy of that information,” Doctor said.
During interviews, Republican secretaries of state stressed that voters aren’t kicked off the rolls because SAVE can’t verify their citizenship. Instead, an inability to verify would likely trigger a follow-up process with the voter.
“Just because we get something back from the SAVE database, it’s not a cut and dry, especially on those they’re not sure about,” Hoskins, the Missouri secretary of state, said.
Still, Arizona illustrates why some Democrats worry about any large-scale effort to ask voters — especially longtime, older residents — to prove their citizenship. After the state discovered errors in how it tracked voter citizenship dating back years, election officials are contacting some 200,000 voters seeking proof of citizenship documentation.
Some have been casting ballots for decades without incident and many feel targeted, Arizona Democratic Secretary of State Adrian Fontes said during a presentation at the state secretaries of state conference. “They feel insulted when they get that letter,” Fontes said.










There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside.


– Charles Stewart III, professor of political science at MIT who studies elections


Charles Stewart III, a professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies elections, said Arizona may actually point to the potential usefulness of SAVE. If Arizona runs its voter roll through the program, a list of 200,000 voters needing citizenship verification would perhaps drop into the hundreds, he suggested.
“There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside,” Stewart said.
Connecticut Democratic Secretary of State Stephanie Thomas told Stateline that every secretary wants tools to keep voter lists as clean as possible. But the details are important.
When she hears of something new, Thomas said she asks whether it’s the best option available and whether “the i’s are dotted, the t’s crossed.” She said she’s asked USCIS a series of questions about SAVE and is waiting on some responses.
“When it comes to voter lists,” Thomas said, “I don’t want Connecticut voters to be a guinea pig.”

As a small, rural state, Vermont is especially vulnerable to any shifts in federal support.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Mike Pieciak and Sue Minter: How Vermonters can prepare for a future with less federal support.","This commentary is by Mike Pieciak and Sue Minter. Pieciak is the Vermont state treasurer and Minter previously served as executive director of Capstone Community Action, secretary of the Vermont Department of Transportation, state representative and state director of recovery after Tropical Storm Irene. The Task Force on the Federal Transition was convened by Pieciak and co-chaired by Minter.


Vermonters have learned a hard lesson from past disasters: Being prepared makes a difference.
The Covid-19 pandemic, Tropical Storm Irene and devastating floods of recent summers have shown that when we plan ahead and protect our state, we keep Vermonters safe, businesses open and costs down. Today, we must use this same approach as the Trump administration threatens the security of workers, families and our communities.
Vermonters are already feeling the impact of the MAGA agenda. Inflation is worsening, tariffs are driving up costs for businesses, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids are tearing families apart, and important programs like Medicaid and food assistance are being slashed. The stock market may be riding high, but this bears little resemblance to the reality of most Vermonters. 
Across our state, there is deep anxiety about how President Donald Trump’s policies are affecting our neighbors, the cost of living and the most vulnerable among us. To better understand the impact of these changes as they unfold — and develop recommendations to protect Vermonters from incoming and future changes — the State Treasurer’s Office convened the Task Force on the Federal Transition.
Meeting regularly since January, the task force included a range of local leaders and heard from local and national experts about how federal changes are impacting Vermonters, our economy and the state’s fiscal health. 
As a small, rural state, Vermont is especially vulnerable to any shifts in federal support. On a per capita basis, Vermont receives about 36% more federal funding than the average U.S. state. Federal funds, meanwhile, account for roughly 35% of our state budget. 
Over the past decade, Vermont has also been the fourth-highest recipient per capita among all U.S. states of disaster-related federal funding. With the role of the Federal Emergency Management Agency now in question, any loss in disaster-related support would shift more costs to states, businesses and taxpayers.
In our communities, ICE raids and changes to immigration policy have stirred needless terror and dislocated neighbors and family members. This has also added pressure to Vermont’s already strained workforce, driving up costs in critical industries like health care, agriculture and housing.
At our northern border, Trump’s rhetoric and tariffs are dramatically impacting Canadian travel to Vermont. In March, April and May, year-over-year private-vehicle crossings from Canada into Vermont were down about 35%. This sudden drop in Canadian visitors is hurting our state’s $4 billion tourism industry, which many of our rural communities rely on. 
When Washington, D.C., changes course or tone, Vermonters feel it here at home.
Recently, the task force published a final report with 11 recommended actions to make Vermont’s economy more resilient to federal policy changes. The recommendations include creating a state natural disaster recovery reserve, convening nonprofit leaders to strengthen services, and establishing a state office of new Americans to coordinate resources for foreign newcomers and help grow our workforce and economy. 
Across all recommendations, the report delivers a clear message: Vermont must prepare now for a future with fewer federal dollars, greater economic uncertainty, and higher costs for workers and families. 
We cannot control what is going to happen in Washington, D.C., and we cannot fully replace the federal support that is being cut away. But we can organize, plan ahead and take proactive steps to provide the best outcomes possible to Vermonters.
This work takes on even greater importance under Trump’s domestic policy bill, which was passed after the work of the task force was completed. In the coming years, cuts and new requirements to programs like Medicaid and SNAP will kick tens of thousands of Vermonters off their health insurance and cause children across the state to go hungry. 
This will trap more families in poverty, strain social services and drive up costs for everyone. It’s a historic betrayal of the working and middle class.
Recognizing these challenges, we must lean into our strengths as Vermonters: strong communities, a deep care for our neighbors and a shared commitment to protecting the place we call home. We must work together and prove once again that when we stand shoulder to shoulder, we can build a better future for everyone. 
That won’t change — no matter what happens in Washington, D.C.

After Immigration and Customs Enforcement sent a Cuban man to a detention facility in Tacoma, Washington, from Miami, he gave up fighting his case.
The Cuban man and others still in immigration custody asked not to be identified because of retaliation concerns.
The man said he had a lawyer in Miami, but a judge hearing his case at Northwest ICE Processing Center told him that the lawyer would have to come to Tacoma. The man and his partner didn’t have the money to pay for the attorney’s travel, so he asked to be deported.
Months later, he is still in ICE custody with no end in sight.
“I can’t stand this anymore,” the Cuban man said in Spanish. “It’s a lot of suffering.”
He is among many who are in custody and have waited months to be deported after agreeing, often under pressure from ICE, to deportation. Capital & Main spoke with people from many countries, including India, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Mexico, in addition to Cuba, who said they had waited months in detention centers for deportation.
ICE did not respond to a request for comment from Capital & Main.
The man and other Cubans at Northwest ICE Processing Center, a facility owned and operated by private prison company GEO Group, told Capital & Main that ICE said they would be detained indefinitely because they can’t be deported. They said both Cuba and Mexico have refused to take them.
“I don’t know what they will do with us,” the Cuban man said. “If they can’t send me to any country, and my country won’t accept me, they have to set me free.”
According to immigration attorney Ginger Jacobs, deportations often take months.
When ICE deports people by plane, the agency either charters a flight to send a group of deportees to a specific country or region, or it sends the person with guards on a commercial flight.
ICE chartered 207 planes to deport people in July, according to a report from Witness at the Border, which monitors both domestic and international ICE flights. About 60% of those flights went to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. Cuba received one flight.
Deportation requires cooperation and negotiation between the U.S. and the receiving country. The receiving country has to confirm the citizenship of the person in question and provide travel documents. Some countries refuse to take back deportees.
In a 2001 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that detaining someone indefinitely in immigration custody is unconstitutional. As a result, people who are waiting for deportation can request to be released from custody six months after judges ordered them deported.
Some detainees at Northwest ICE Processing Center said they’re worried that, based on conversations they had with ICE officers, the agency is transferring people between facilities and restarting the six-month countdown. But since none of those detainees have yet reached the six-month mark, they were unable to verify what ICE officers had told them.
Jacobs, the immigration attorney, said it doesn’t matter which detention center someone is in. The six-month countdown begins when someone in custody receives a deportation order if there is no pending appeal.
But to the detainees interviewed by Capital & Main, the wait feels indefinite.
“When you know that you did something wrong and you’re in jail, that’s something different, but doing time without a release date, that’s like a torture, and that’s what we’re doing here,” said a man from India who has been in custody for over two years.
He said his case was on appeal at the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, but he gave up so that he could leave to get treatment for a tumor behind his ear and because he felt he had already spent too much time away from his young children. His family plans to join him in India after his deportation.
The man said he asked a supervisor about the delay and learned that the officer who was supposed to be working on his deportation documents had been on vacation for weeks. He told Capital & Main that he was still waiting to have his picture taken and start the process for his travel documents. He said ICE told him it would take another six or seven months to deport him.
“There’s a lot of people who want to leave, but I think they want to set an example like this is how we’re going to torture you guys,” he said.
A man from Ecuador detained at Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego asked a judge to deport him about a month ago. He’s still in custody.
“They just say have patience, have patience,” he said in Spanish.
He said the treatment at the facility makes him feel depressed and made him decide to leave. He said the facility is overcrowded and that guards yell often at the people in custody.
Ryan Gustin, spokesperson for CoreCivic, the private prison company that owns and operates Otay Mesa Detention Center, said that detainees have access to a grievance process to express concerns about guards’ behavior. Gustin said ICE monitors the facility to ensure compliance with the agency’s detention standards.
When asked about overcrowding concerns, Gustin said everyone detained there “is offered a bed.”
Some of the men waiting to be deported believed that ICE had bungled their deportations.
One said he’d been waiting about two and a half months for ICE to deport him to his home country of Mexico. Usually, deportations to Mexico happen quickly.
“They don’t come often, and they don’t give answers, just whatever excuse,” the man from Mexico said in Spanish about ICE officers. “Last time they told me I was lost in the system.”
Kulimba Nyembo, who gave Capital & Main permission to use his full name, said he’d already been waiting at the Tacoma facility for about six months for deportation to the Democratic Republic of the Congo when he spoke to Capital & Main in June.
He said he had a deportation order from mid-December, and he had provided his travel documents to the deportation officer.
“Every single document that needs to be brought in has already been brought in,” he said. “Either it’s a money game situation where they’re farming me for more money on my head every month, or they know I have all my documents in order and I become less of a priority because it’s like we’ll get to you when we get to you. Now I’m spending every day here for absolutely nothing.”
Nyembo said he’d grown up in the U.S., and an assault charge landed him in prison. When he finished serving his sentence in early 2024, he rebuilt his life, he said, and didn’t get into any more trouble. But ICE arrested him in December, and Nyembo decided not to fight the case.
He said officers tried to deport him in May, but the guards who were supposed to escort him didn’t have the right visas.
“Everything that has prolonged my stay here has nothing to do with me,” Nyembo said. “It has to do with someone not being efficient enough or proficient enough in their work.”
At the time of publication, Nyembo no longer showed up in an ICE database that tracks people in the agency’s custody.
Meanwhile, the Cuban man’s partner, who is a U.S. citizen, said she hasn’t seen him since last year, when ICE arrested him while he was waiting for her to do laundry.
She said she is struggling to pay rent, send money for him to call her and take care of their son by herself. She sold many of their belongings to try to pay for his attorney. She said she takes as much overtime work as she can get to try to make ends meet.
The partner and mother said she is exhausted.
“Sometimes I only have $1 in my account,” she said in Spanish. “I sit in my bed and cry.”
She said both she and her partner are afraid to go to Cuba because of the political and economic situation there, but that if he gets deported, she will go wherever the U.S. sends him. The most important thing, she said, is for them to be able to be together as a family.
“Why don’t they let him out already?” she said.

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)Election years call for politicians to do some tricky maneuvering. While an elected official will present a new initiative as a way to help constituents, opponents are likely to label it as a cynical attempt to curry favor with voters. 
That’s where Gov. Larry Rhoden finds himself right now after the announcement of Operation Prairie Thunder. It commits the National Guard, Highway Patrol and Corrections Department to support federal immigration enforcement, and commits state troopers to saturation patrols in Sioux Falls. 
National Guard soldiers will help U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement with administrative tasks, Highway Patrol troopers will do immigration enforcement during the regular course of their work, and Corrections Department personnel will coordinate with ICE to deport inmates in state custody who entered the country illegally. 
Race for South Dakota governor could be a race for Trump’s favor

Critics of the program have complained that Rhoden is using state resources to further his own political ambitions, even though the governor has not revealed whether he will seek election to the office he gained when Kristi Noem joined President Donald Trump’s Cabinet.
“While I agree that we need to hold criminals accountable and be tough on crime, this goes too far,” said Sen. Liz Larson, a Democrat from Sioux Falls. 
If Democrats think Prairie Thunder is Rhoden’s first attempt to use his office for political gain, they’re late with their criticism. 
Since mid-March, the governor has been running a shadow reelection campaign through his Open for Opportunity Tour. 
Rhoden introduced that initiative as a continuation of Noem’s Open for Business program. According to a news release from the governor’s office, “The Open for Opportunity Tour will feature Governor Rhoden visiting communities across South Dakota to highlight their economic development efforts, learn their specific needs, and work together to chase down opportunities.”
In effect, Rhoden stepped into office and onto the campaign trail. The Open for Opportunity Tour is introducing business leaders to their new governor. It is also introducing the new governor to an ever-growing group of potential political donors. 
An unscientific search of state news releases found that since March 17 Rhoden has made 17 Open for Opportunity trips to 25 communities. From Sioux Falls to the Standing Rock Reservation, from Mud Butte to Mitchell, from Box Elder to Huron, Rhoden is getting to know the business leaders in each community as well as fattening his Rolodex. 
On one hand, it’s refreshing to have a governor who is more interested in traveling in the state than out-of-state. Of course all of these trips are state funded, your tax dollars at work as Rhoden scores some political points. 
The irony here is that for all Rhoden’s work currying favor with business leaders, Prairie Thunder will likely alienate some of them. Pledging to round up illegal aliens will make it tougher to fill those jobs that only immigrants are willing to tackle. 
While South Dakota is Open for Opportunity, one of those opportunities has been for Rhoden to run a political campaign using state funds. In essence, the governor is using an office he wasn’t elected to as a means to jumpstart a campaign he hasn’t announced yet. Now that’s quite an opportunity.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Self-driving vehicle technology continues to advance, prompting a wave of liability and safety regulations from state lawmakers.
This year, lawmakers in Arizona, Louisiana, Montana, Nevada and the District of Columbia enacted legislation to regulate driverless vehicles, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures.
While much of the legislation aims to update existing law to include new definitions for autonomous vehicles, other measures put rules in place regarding insurance, permitting, licensing and road testing.
In total, lawmakers in 25 states introduced 67 bills related to autonomous vehicles, according to the database. California, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania currently have bills under consideration. Alaska, Delaware and Washington have bills that will be carried over into the next legislative session.
Governors vetoed two measures this year. Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis shot down a measure that would have required a driver to be present in any commercial vehicle being operated by an automated driving system.
Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed a measure that would have put rules in place for “high-risk artificial intelligence systems,” but would have excluded “autonomous vehicle technology” from that category.
As of now, there are no vehicles that have achieved full autonomy, according to the Society of Automotive Engineers’ criteria. But several car companies have introduced automated driving features, allowing drivers to take their hands off the wheel.
Tesla is rolling out its Full Self-Driving feature, a system under which a vehicle can drive itself almost anywhere with minimal intervention from the driver. Tesla Autopilot, which the company made available to the public in late 2024, also helps with basic vehicle maneuvering.
And Waymo, the country’s first autonomous ride-hailing service, is currently operating in Atlanta; Austin, Texas; Los Angeles; Phoenix and San Francisco. The robo-taxi company plans to expand to Miami and Washington, D.C., next.
According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, vehicle safety is the main benefit of driverless cars. With higher levels of automation, there is less room for human error or driver distractions. The new technology also could improve safety for bicyclists and pedestrians, according to the agency.
But driverless cars have been involved in hundreds of accidents over the past few years. Between 2021 and 2024, there were 696 accidents reported that involved a Waymo vehicle, according to an analysis by California-based law firm DiMarco | Araujo | Montevideo.
And last year, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration began investigating Tesla’s Full Self-Driving system after multiple reports of crashes that occurred in low-visibility conditions.

,Mississippi Today,2025-08-17 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,"While redistricting battles could wage across country, there’s no fight left in Mississippi",Bobby Harrison,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/08/17/redistricting-battles-trump-house/,Column: Don’t look for Mississippi to get involved in what appears to be an escalating redistricting war where states redraw their U.S. House districts to aid Republicans or Democrats ahead of a hotly contested 2026 national election.,"Don’t look for Mississippi to get involved in what appears to be an escalating redistricting war where states redraw their U.S. House districts to aid Republicans or Democrats ahead of a hotly contested 2026 national election.
Mississippi most likely will not engage in the redistricting battle because Republicans already have been helped about as much as possible in the Magnolia State. Here, there are three safe Republican U.S. House districts and one safe Democratic district.
In theory, the Mississippi Legislature could draw the congressional districts in such a manner as to make all four districts favor Republicans. But to do so, Black voters, who generally are more prone to vote Democratic, would have to be diluted to such an extent that the redraw would conflict with long-held federal court rulings.
From a legal standpoint and even from an ethical and moral standpoint, it would be difficult to justify no Black-majority districts in Mississippi, where the non-white population is nearing 40%.
Unsurprisingly, Texas fired the first shot in what is shaping up as a nationwide redistricting battle. The Texas Legislature, at the behest of President Donald Trump, who fears his Republican Party will lose the U.S. House in the 2026 midterm election, is trying to redraw the Longhorn State’s 38 congressional districts to give the Republicans five more seats. They currently have 25.
In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom is threatening to retaliate by creating more Democratic districts. California currently has 43 Democratic districts and nine Republican districts.
There have been rumblings of blue New York and red Florida also going back to the redistricting drawing board to create more seats to help their respective party.
Normally, redistricting is conducted every 10 years after the release of the U.S. Census. The last redistricting occurred after the 2020 U.S. Census. But it should be no surprise that Trump, fearing that Republicans will lose the House in 2026, asked Texas to eschew the norms and conduct a mid-decade redistricting.
Both Democrats and Republicans are guilty of gerrymandering or of drawing districts to benefit their political party. The courts, generally, have said that is OK.
But the courts — at least in the past — have also said their minority populations must be given opportunities to elect candidates of their choice.
While the courts have said gerrymandering is allowed, a recent Economist/YouGov poll found an overwhelming 69% oppose the partisan drawing of districts, compared to only 9% who support it and 22% of respondents who are unsure. A plurality of 35% support states retaliating if another state draws districts to support one particular party. The retaliation is opposed by 30%, while 36% of respondents are unsure.
A plurality also opposes Trump’s call for the FBI to hunt down Texas Democratic lawmakers who have fled the state to prevent the Legislature from having the quorum needed to draw new congressional districts.
For what it’s worth, a study by the Princeton Gerrymandering Project found 15 states with failing grades in terms of non-partisan redistricting. Nine of those states failed because of their strong Republican tilt, while five failed because of strong Democratic leanings. Two — Tennessee and Louisiana — failed because of racial unfairness. Through court rulings, a new Black-majority district has been created in Louisiana since the Princeton study was conducted.
Texas and Florida were among the states receiving failing grades. New York and California were not. Another large Democratic stronghold, Illinois, did get a failing grade.
Mississippi is unique because of its racial makeup and voting patterns. Most white Mississippians vote Republican, but the large Black minority — the largest percentage of Black voters in the nation — tends to vote Democratic.
While Republicans have won all statewide elections since 2016, the elections often are relatively close.

This story by Cheryl Casey was first published in the Waterbury Roundabout on Aug. 12, 2025.
Plans for the historic 150-year-old Goodell House at Little River State Park to be used as a trailside rental cabin are moving closer to reality: The project is now officially part of the state forestry plan, with a nonprofit gearing up to take on the work in 2026.
The 1860s structure on Ricker Mountain has been approved for relocation and preservation in the state’s forest management plan, which was amended to include the project this spring. In March, the Vermont Department of Forests, Parks and Recreation revised the Mt. Mansfield State Forest Long Range Management Plan to include the preservation of the last remaining structure from the once-thriving mill and farm community near the Little River. The state has partnered with the nonprofit Vermont Huts & Trails to relocate, restore and maintain the Goodell House as part of its network of rustic, remote trail accommodations for public use. 
“This partnership expands access to state lands while preserving the distinct character of one of the original historic structures in the Ricker Basin,” said Forests, Parks and Recreation Commissioner Danielle Fitzko.
The state collected public input last year about the future of the Goodell House as an important piece of community history and an opportunity to expand recreation at the state park. Agency of Natural Resources Secretary Julie Moore signed off on the update to the forest management plan in March. It now allows for “the relocation and rehabilitation of the Goodell House as a four-season hut” to be enjoyed as “an overnight resource for a diverse group of users.”
Vermont Huts & Trails Executive Director RJ Thompson said the project will give the historic house a new life that connects its history to modern times and visitors. “This is a great opportunity to preserve history and enhance recreation and access to an area of Mt. Mansfield State Forest with a mix of hiking, biking, and Nordic skiing options,” Thompson said. 
Located along the Dalley Loop trail in Little River State Park’s History Hike, the Goodell House will be moved 600 feet downhill to a gravel pit that is better situated to meet accessibility goals and minimize environmental impacts. Project planners from the state and the huts organization have been working closely with the state’s Division of Historic Preservation to ensure the building’s historic character is preserved. 
“This is almost seven-plus years in the making,” said Dani Kehlmann, development director for Vermont Huts & Trails. “It’s a cool way to preserve local history and increase access that folks have to (Little River State) park.”

The two-story 20’ x 25’ colonial home was built of hand-hewn timber beams and cedar shingles by Almeron Goodell after he purchased 14 acres on Ricker Mountain in 1863. Joined by his wife Lutheria and their two children, Goodell finished the house in 1870. A 12’ x 12’ addition was added to the footprint later. For 36 years, the Goodells were subsistence farmers, eking out a hardscrabble life alongside the farmers, loggers and sawmill workers who had settled in the Little River basin. Timber was the primary industry in the area. 
After Lutheria’s death, Goodell sold the house and moved to Hyde Park in 1906. The Ricker Mountain community, which had been there for nearly 130 years, had started to dwindle and deteriorate by that time. The last of the settlement was finally swallowed by the Waterbury Reservoir in the late 1930s after dam construction was completed. 
On higher ground, the house held out long after other structures collapsed and were overtaken by forest, likely helped along by several local families who used the structure as a hunting camp until the 1970s. Today the fragile Goodell House stands as a reminder of the industrious community that shaped a significant part of Waterbury’s early history. It won’t stand for much longer, however, without intervention and the state’s collaboration with Vermont Huts & Trails is intended to avoid this loss.
According to Kehlmann and stewardship forester Brad Greenough, the project to move and rehabilitate the house on its new site is scheduled for spring 2026. The goal is for it to be ready to welcome overnight guests by the end of next year, they said.

The plan for the house that the state and Vermont Huts & Trails agreed to calls for the state to continue to own the house, but it will be maintained and managed by the private nonprofit as a recreation facility. Its operations will be subject to state park policies, such as mud season trail closures. Vermont Huts & Trails maintains a statewide network of hut accommodations along trails and other recreational assets. 
The renovations to the house will include making the building ADA-accessible. Likewise, the trail leading to the building will be modified to accommodate adaptive mountain bikes, Kehlmann said. 
Until work begins, project planners are taking steps to protect the delicate wood structure from the elements — its roof is covered with a tarp, for example. “Our goal is to use as much of the original material as possible,” Kehlmann said.  
Between now and next spring, Kehlmann said Vermont Huts & Trails will be working to raise $137,000 for the project. To date, $400,000 of the project’s estimated $537,000 budget has already been obtained through congressional appropriations. She is leading a new initiative called Friends of the Goodell House to recruit volunteers interested in helping with fundraising. 
“There are a lot of restrictions because the project is on state land. Many grants are not applicable, so we’ll be focusing on private foundations and private donors to raise the remaining funds,” she said.

Members are having to adjust their expectations on what crops they’re receiving as well as alter their grocery store needs.

Kate Kampner is a reporter with the Community News Service, part of the University of Vermont’s Reporting & Documentary Storytelling program.
When Robin Berger became a member of the Intervale Community Farm CSA in 1998, she said that toward the end of the summer pickups, in October, the farm would have a membership survey and invite members for hot cider.
But these days, Berger said, “It is no longer cold in October.” 
As global temperatures continue breaking records, farmers worldwide are seeing disruptions in their farming schedules, including shifting harvesting times and changing crop choices. 
CSAs, an agricultural business model which stands for community supported agriculture, is a program in which members sign up for weekly shares to get a promised set of produce for the year prior to harvesting season. This model provides farms with a secured revenue and an understanding on what they need to grow and what equipment to buy to make themselves profitable.  
While farms try to adjust their CSA formats by making them more flexible or diversifying their crops, they are also trying to keep membership afloat. Berger, along with many other longtime CSA members, has noticed climate disruptions, such as warmer weather and flooding creeping into their produce-filled lives. Members are having to adjust their expectations on what crops they’re receiving as well as alter their grocery store needs. While some choose to stick with it, others don’t put up with the insecurity. 
In 2023 and 2024, the Intervale Community Farm was hit by summer flooding that damaged and destroyed many farms and homes. While the land was able to recover, the farm still lost many of their regular products, including carrots, butternut squash and onions, Berger said.

“There are some things they just couldn’t plant again in time for them to get a harvest,” Berger said. She said she and other CSA members have talked about how they have to remember which produce they now have to get at the grocery store that they normally don’t. 
“I’m just out of practice, all my onions have come from the farm basically since they’ve had a CSA,” Berger said. 
She also saw how members used to get Brussels sprouts at the summer share, but are now only available for the winter share. Berger said this is because “it’s just not going to frost before the end of the summer share,” due to the warmer weather carrying into the fall. Regardless of changes in her produce lifestyle, Berger never considered ending her CSA membership. 
However, some CSA members might have felt differently when they saw changes in their subscription.
Andy Jones, the Intervale’s farm manager, said the team typically saw a 90% membership renewal rate from one year to the next, but after the floods, they saw it drop to 80–85%. This decrease was largely due to a proportion of newer members who didn’t have a CSA track record.

Jones said this wasn’t a shock. He saw the same drop in members in 2011 and 2012 when Hurricane Irene hit. In the long run, the farm has a successful track record of consumer value and quality of produce, he said. 
“People that have been with us for many years can see that,” Jones said. “It’s harder to do that when you’re brand new.” 
The Farm Upstream, a certified organic farm in Jericho, is in its first season doing a CSA and trying to keep their model — which is based on the Intervale farm — as flexible as possible for members. This includes occasional choice in produce and adjusting pick-up times if needed. 
“We’re trying to create models that work for people’s lifestyles,” said Jake Kornfeld, one of the five owners of the farm. 
The team knows what to expect when it comes to preparing for floods and climate adaptation as all five of them have worked with CSAs in the past. One of the farm owners, Tucker Andrews, saw his previous farm get wiped out last summer by floods.
The farm’s land, which was meticulously chosen, steers clear of floodplains for the most part and has well-drained soil. The team also diversifies their crops and practices successive planting, the process of planting a crop on the same field that was just harvested, which allows for seasonal variability. 
“If some catastrophe happens, we can bounce back in a couple of weeks, and that should be okay,” Kornfeld said. 
The owners plan on hosting community events with their members, including farm tours and potlucks. “It’s just a way to make sure people feel like they’re a part of something that’s more than a transaction,” Kornfeld said.

Jeanette Berry, another longtime member of the Intervale CSA, said even though there was crop loss on the farm, it never crossed her mind to quit the farm because of it. “The produce that we got (after the floods) was still overall cheaper than if we bought it at the store,” she said. 
Berry said some Intervale CSA members were offered a partial refund in response to the missing produce. But she didn’t even consider taking it. “It’s a minor contribution to the farm, to not ask for a refund on a few weeks of lost crops,” Berry said. 
The only drawback of the CSA that Berry could think of was that she had too many vegetables in her refrigerator. “We have so much choice in what we can pick up,” she said. 
That’s the goal for Ananda Gardens, a Vermont CSA based in Montpelier that focuses a lot of time and energy on making sure there are options for their members. The farm offers produce delivery and pickups for their CSA and has 60 to 80 different varieties of crops. 
“That’s one of the benefits of having a very diversified CSA,” said Melisa Oliva, one of the owners of the farm, “You don’t have all your eggs in one basket.” 
The farm was minimally impacted by the 2023 flooding when they lost a greenhouse of tomatoes. Oliva said that the potatoes that they get from a partnership with another farm seemed limited at the time of the flooding. 
“It’s on the back burner all the time,” Oliva said  about extreme weather events in the state. “When are we going to be impacted? What is going to happen?” 
Although they haven’t dealt with a lot of rainfall this year, the farm has made adjustments due to summer heat waves, she said. The team placed a cover mesh in their greenhouses because the crops can burn from the heat. They’ve also had to shift their farmwork earlier. “By 3 p.m., it’s just too warm,” Oliva said. 
But this internal preparation doesn’t stop or limit her team. “We’re committing to planting those tomatoes, and we are committed together to strengthen the fabric of the local economy,” Oliva said.

[…]","(Getty Images)The leader of a Louisiana nonprofit that coordinates organ transplants says it has transformed from one of the nation’s lowest ranking organizations of its kind to one of the best in less than two years.
In 2023, the Louisiana Organ Procurement Agency ranked among the bottom 10 in the country for its organ donation rate. It faced scrutiny from the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which oversees organ procurement operations.
LOPA is now on track to rank among the top 10, according to its top executive, Brett Gordon. The agency’s current donation and transplant rates will make it a Tier 1 organization, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Service’s highest rating category, he said.

The motivation for LOPA’s progress is a new federal rating system launched in 2022 that set strict standards for a medical specialty area that had shown little improvement in response to skyrocketing demand for organs over the past 20 years.
There are currently 56 organ procurement organizations in the United States. A 2017 study from the Bridgespan Group, a philanthropy consultancy, referred to them as “government-granted monopolies” with few incentives to improve for a lack of competition. As a result, demand for organ transplants was far outpacing the supply of organs.  
The study noted 6,000 to 8,000 people died each year while on a transplant waiting list, and 28,000 available organs from deceased donors were going unused and wasted annually. 
Before 2022, organ agency evaluations did a poor job of assessing their success at achieving their ultimate goal — providing organs for successful transplants — according to the Bridgespan study. 
One of the old metrics was the number of organs procured per donor. A individual can donate up to eight organs, but that number tends to be less from older donors. As a result, organ agencies were pursuing younger donors while overlooking older, single-organ donors. 
Another measure was the number of organs recovered per “eligible death,” which was self-reported and subject to interpretation, the study found.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services implemented new evaluation standards in 2022 that judged organ agencies based on the number of people donating at least one organ and the number of organs obtained and successfully transplanted. 
The new metrics, referred to as the donation rate and the transplantation rate, led groups to focus on obtaining more organ donations. With the updated rules in place, LOPA’s decided to reform its operations. The organization identified several areas in need of improvement and began expanding their staff, Gordon said. 
The first focus was referrals. LOPA learns about potential organ donors primarily through hospitals and coroners’ offices. These referrals need to come as soon as possible because it’s a race against the clock to transplant a viable organ. 
The nonprofit that coordinates organ transplants in SC could fold under federal change

“It’s really critical because it has to be timely,” Gordon said. “We needed to be present in the hospital.”
LOPA increased its hospital development staff, primarily nurses and other medical professionals who are trained and educated in organ procurement and know about the timelines and protocols. They also communicate with hospitals and doctors on identifying potential donors. 
LOPA also retrained and added staff to its family services team to increase the chances that people would donate the organs of their deceased relatives. This can be the most difficult and sensitive part of the process, and it takes a special kind of person to approach a grieving family member about an organ donation, Gordon said. Family services members need to have high levels of empathy and be trained in grief support, he added.
The agency also added new life support systems to its organ recovery clinic that keep donated organs viable for extended periods. 
With these changes, LOPA was able to increase its referrals, which led to more organ donations and more successful transplants, from 725 to 883 — a 22% increase — in just one year. 
Although the 2022 federal rules have spurred a positive transformation at LOPA, organ agencies in other states have struggled under the changes. 
South Carolina’s We Are Sharing Hope SC was ranked among the bottom agencies alongside LOPA back in 2023 and has continued to struggle since then, according to the South Carolina Daily Gazette. 
Sharing Hope President David DeStefano has voiced concerns that the new rules unfairly fault organ procurement agencies for things that are beyond their control, such as a transplant center rejecting an organ.
A person’s age, health and manner of death — including whether they died in the hospital — all factor into the viability of their organs. Under the new rules, any person under age 75 who dies of heart failure, a loss of blood flow to the brain, drug overdose, suicide or drowning counts as a potential donor.
That puts an aging, unhealthy, rural state such as South Carolina at a disadvantage, DeStefano told the Gazette.
The new rules have prompted organ agencies to procure organs they once passed over because of a donor’s age and other health factors that might cause a recipient’s body to reject it. The Bridgespan study noted those risk-averse concerns did not correlate with better transplant outcomes. Advances in medicine and technology have increased both the number and success of transplants, the research found.
Just last year, doctors in Missouri successfully transplanted a liver from a 98-year-old man to a 72-year-old woman, according to the Associated Press.
In the last federal review, Sharing Hope was listed among 10 organ agencies at risk of losing their certification. The same list included LOPA at the time, but next year’s review will look very different for Louisiana, Gordon said. 
“We had to experiment,” he said. “But we took intelligent risks to improve.”

Were their vehicles living secret lives?","If E-ZPass was to be believed, Dick Benson’s white Chevy Tahoe and Gail Benson’s black Volvo S80 had secret lives. 
Did the Tahoe get to Logan airport in Boston without Dick on April 15, 2024, tracked by E-ZPass on the Mass Pike through the Ted Williams Tunnel? Did the Volvo frequently go to Long Island, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Maryland without Gail? 
The Volvo went on puzzling trips every month, according to the electronic highway tolling system. 
The couple, retirees who live in the Hartford suburb of Berlin, eventually solved the mystery as a case of mistaken identity by E-ZPass photographic toll-by-plate readers: The Bensons were paying tolls incurred by a state legislator, Rep. Corey Paris, D-Stamford.
Identifying the problem was relatively easy. 
Fixing it, not so much.
What followed was a struggle that exposes weaknesses in the automated collection of bridge and highway tolls by E-ZPass, a system that completes 4 billion transactions and collects $13.8 billion annually for dozens of tolling authorities in 17 states using transponders and photographic plate readers. Mistakes are inevitable.
But when it comes to resolving wrongful charges — or providing answers to a reporter for a story about how the company addresses such issues — little is easy about E-ZPass. 
“The DMV will admit clearly that the bureaucracy of that company or that operation is horrible, just horrible,” Dick said.
No one at the Department of Motor Vehicles contradicted him. Neither did Paris, who had his own fight with E-ZPass trying to rectify what he owed once the Bensons flagged they had been unwittingly paying tolls on his behalf, perhaps as much as $800 over 14 months.
“They are the culprit in all of this,” Paris said of E-ZPass. “And it’s also a multimillion-dollar company, yet you can’t get in contact with anyone.”
It started with the license plates
The roots of the Bensons’ conflict with Paris and E-ZPass begins in late 1994, the final months of the administration of Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. It was long before Paris was a driver and two years before E-ZPass was introduced in metro New York.
Dick Benson was an aide and all-purpose troubleshooter for the governor, the same job he performed for most of Weicker’s years in the U.S. Senate.
One of his last chores before the administration handed over the keys in January 1995 to Gov. John G. Rowland — Benson recalled walking out of the Capitol on the last day with Weicker, accompanied by Rowland — was to distribute the remaining store of low-digit license plates to friends and supporters. 
He was told to include himself, and he did.
Dick, an Army sergeant who lost a leg in 1970 when another soldier tripped an explosive booby trap in a dense jungle outside Saigon, has a disabled veterans tag: 3. Gail’s passenger plate is 145, the same three digits on the legislative plate assigned to Paris, a Democrat who represents the 145th District of Stamford.

The Bensons have since learned there is nothing exclusive about low-digit plates — and that legislators do not always heed admonitions about the out-of-state use of legislative plates.
Winners of General Assembly races last year got congratulatory notes from Tony Guerrera, the commissioner of motor vehicles and former legislator. He told them legislative plates with their district numbers were available for $14, a cost in addition to registration fees every motorist pays. Lawmakers must keep their permanent registrations current.
“Legislative plates should be used on vehicles traveling within Connecticut only,” Guerrera warned, in bold. “Electronic tolling systems in neighboring states may not distinguish between legislative plates and similarly numbered vehicle plates otherwise issued by the CT DMV.”
Guerrera was uncertain if the warning had been issued in previous years. He only smiled when asked to speculate if any Connecticut lawmakers bothered to remove  their legislative plates before venturing north to the Mass Pike or south to New York.

Many states, Connecticut included, utilize the same numbers in different classifications of motor-vehicle plates. The DMV says there are four in Connecticut with 145: Gail Benson’s Volvo, Paris’ Kia Telluride, a motorcycle and a bus.
There are 10 vehicles other than Dick’s Tahoe bearing a Connecticut license plate with the number 3. They include a “classic” vehicle, a trailer and a fire apparatus, and a legislative plate assigned to Rep. Minnie Gonzalez, a Democrat who represents the 3rd House District of Hartford. Sen. Saud Anwar, D-South Windsor, who represents the 3rd Senate District, no longer uses a legislative plate.
(Incorrect E-ZPass charges on the Tahoe were minimal, and the Bensons did not pursue what kind of vehicle was charged for the tolls on the trip to Logan. Gonzalez said it wasn’t her.)
Each of those plate types is distinctive to the human eye but not always to the photographic readers of E-ZPass. Gonzalez said her legislative plate has been correctly recognized by Mass Pike toll-by-plate readers, but Guerrera and Millie Torres Ferguson, a deputy DMV commissioner, say the system appears to default at times to an assumption a plate is on a passenger vehicle.
And that’s how Dick and Gail Benson started getting billed for the travels of Paris, a young Democrat who was elected in 2020 and got his first blue-striped legislative tag bearing his district number upon taking office in January 2021.
The Bensons did not immediately notice the mystery trips. They had an E-ZPass account that was automatically paid by a credit card, and they did not check the monthly on-line statement of E-ZPass charges.
The first sign of trouble came at the end of 2023, when West Hartford mailed Gail a delinquent violation notice demanding $45.40 for an unpaid parking ticket issued on Farmington Avenue at 12:45 p.m. on Nov. 9.
“I hadn’t been to West Hartford in a year,” she said.
When she objected, West Hartford informed her that the vehicle ticketed at a parking meter was a Kia, not her Volvo. The town excused the ticket after the DMV confirmed there was a Kia with a 145 tag — a legislative plate.
It was then the Bensons reviewed their E-ZPass statement and found the discrepancies. They were easy to spot. Trips taken by the Bensons were listed on the statement by the serial numbers on their E-ZPass transponders. Tolls incurred by photographic plate readers listed the plate, 145.
One quirk of the system: If the Bensons did not have an account, they would have been billed by mail with an invoice accompanied by a photograph of the car for which they were being charged. They would have instantly realized that the tag was a legislative plate, not Gail’s.
But so long as the E-ZPass account had sufficient funds, a charge involving a plate associated with their account would be deducted.
The Bensons began disputing charges, though they say they were told E-ZPass would only go back for a year. Beginning on Dec. 12, 2023, they began getting credits in monthly statements, $99.27 the first time. But the incorrect charges on the 145 plate continued.
They wrote to the E-ZPass customer service center in Albany on Jan. 4, 2024, informing the organization of the mix-up with Gail’s 145 plate and the one on Paris’ car. “We have been overcharged hundreds of dollars for this past year, and most likely for several years,” they wrote.
Theresa C. Bates of the CT DMV’s compliance unit followed with a letter to E-ZPass confirming Paris was the owner of the Kia with the legislative plate 145.

Based on statements reviewed by Connecticut Mirror, they eventually got credits for $451.89. They continued to push for what they felt was a full accounting from E-ZPass and from Paris.
Paris, meanwhile, had his own issues with E-ZPass. Once Paris was deemed responsible for many of the charges originally levied on the Bensons, E-ZPass tried to collect substantial late fees. Paris said he should not be assessed for late fees on charges he never got.
The Bensons appreciate his frustration with E-ZPass but do not see him as blameless. One question: Did Paris ever wonder who was paying his $8.25 toll on the Henry Hudson Parkway into the city? Or the $14.75 to cross the Hudson on the George Washington Bridge or through the Lincoln or Holland tunnels?
Paris said he had an E-ZPass account and assumed he was being billed. His transponder, he said, clearly had gone inactive, and his E-ZPass was attached to the plate on a previous car, not his recent permanent registration or legislative plate. He said he pays his bills.
“If anything is coming to my house, it is getting paid,” he said.
Based on statements shared with The Connecticut Mirror, he once again had an active E-ZPass transponder and account as of last spring. When the Bensons contacted him again in March, he referred them to Torres Ferguson, the deputy DMV commissioner whose previous duties included being the department’s legislative liaison.
“I am current with E-ZPass,” he said. 
The Bensons, meanwhile, recently got another refund check from the MTA Bridge and Tunnel Authority, which had issued their E-ZPass more than a decade ago. It came as the CT Mirror was pressing the authority to answer questions about the process.
“Our MTA team was able to get a total of $242.98 refunded to the couple for tolls they did not incur at MTA B&T, PANYNJ, and NYSTA E-ZPass crossings as well as E-ZPass agencies in the states of Florida, Maryland, Delaware, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island,” Laura Cala-Rauch, a media liaison for the MTA, said in an email to CT Mirror.
In a phone call, Cala-Rauch said the resolution negated the need for a story.
She eventually answered several questions posed by email, stating that photographic images can be retained for up to eight years.
Is there a process for reviewing the photographic evidence when there is a dispute over a charge by mail? Is there a written policy regarding dates by which a charge must be challenged that you can provide?
“The sooner a toll is disputed, the more options we have in resolving a customer inquiry,” she replied.
If there is a policy, it was not provided.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_7561-2-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-08-17 05:56:11.703134

(Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)Paint rollers and used brushes and wooden stir sticks crusted with a cheerful shade called “morning blossom” are in a pile on the wooden porch, waiting for the job to resume come daylight.
Every so often I peer out the narrow panes of the front door to catch a glimpse of the tools, anxious for the work to resume. My painter friend and his family of helpers have been doing all the labor, standing on ladders or bending low to the ground. They have chipped and scraped and wire-brushed the cracked and peeling walls, making them ready for a new coat.
This simple but labor-intensive task of maintaining a century-old house has made me think of changes to another historic structure, much older and farther away in nearly every sense. The transformation of the White House into a gilded temple to power is increasingly alarming. It has become an American Versailles, fit for a king and not a president, a monument to a dictatorial ambition.
I am reminded of Abraham Lincoln’s 1858 musing on democracy, a note apparently written to himself: “As I would not be a slave, I would not be a master. This expresses my idea of democracy. Whatever differs from this, to the extent of the difference, is no democracy.”
I’m thinking about democracy as I return to my own work.
It’s the first Wednesday night in August, and I’m at my desk in the center of our house on Constitution Street, fingers hesitant over the plastic keys of a computer keyboard. Sweat runs down my ribs. I type a phrase and delete it, then repeat. There seems to be no way to start the damned column.
We’ve been without air conditioning for a week.
The heat seems to have gathered behind my eyes in a thermal prose-killing cloud. The haze is irritatingly coffee resistant. I can find nothing, not even an ice pack wrapped in a towel and held to the back of my neck, to relieve my discomfort.
The repairman we rely on to keep the air warm or cool, according to the season, came out and took a look. He always brings his dog with him, a naturally curious collie that roams at will and often has be called from ranging too far afield. After calling for the dog to come back from across the street, our repairman said the compressor was shot. He delivered the bad news in a tone meant to remind me of all the times during the past few summers he’d managed to keep the unit running, despite it being 25 years old. He’s also hard of hearing, so his conversation is a notch or two louder than what could be considered normal. Now the old unit had finally defeated him, he fairly shouted, and we needed a brand-new, three-ton unit. Then he bellowed for the dog to get out of the neighbor’s yard.
He could have a new unit delivered and ready to install the next day. OK, I said. But there was some mix-up with the shipping and our unit was misdirected to some town far away — seems like it was Death Valley, but I’m probably imagining that. Because it was the time of year when AC units were in high demand, he couldn’t promise when it would arrive. It might be a week, or perhaps more.
So we waited.
The first few days weren’t so bad. While not exactly cool, the highs were in the 80s and sometimes at night the lows dipped into the 60s. We opened doors and windows and left them open. I found myself standing near the window in the kitchen, feeling the night air through the screen, and thinking of how much it felt like summer nights when I was a boy in Baxter Springs.
We had no central air on Cleveland Street back then, just a huge machine jammed in a window of the living room attached to a garden hose that dripped water on a big rotating fan. It made things damp, if not cool. But the air that came in through the window in my bedroom was pleasant and carried the scent of grass and river not far away and the promise of dawn.
Back in the present, the days on Constitution Street became warmer. The heat index was well over 100 during the day, and the nights were sweltering.
Late Wednesday night is my usual time to compose my Sunday columns, and when things go well the hours dissolve until I have a passable draft of a couple of thousand words. I’ll print out the pages and leave them on the dining room table, beneath the big map of the United States we use for reference as well as decoration.
Then I’ll sleep.
Before dawn, Kim rises and has her coffee and feeds the cats and eats her homemade bran muffin and does her five-mile walk. Then she’ll go through the pages with a green pen. She will circle words and suspect passages and leave sometimes hard-to-read notes in the margins — rw? tense? awk. — and then we’ll talk about it, and I’ll revise at least once.
When the writing doesn’t go well, the hours become a weight.
That first Wednesday of August seemed like a double burden as I attempted to pull the column together. There was no draft on the dining room table for Kim to read when she got up. I managed to finish it later that day, after another three hours of work, but the rhythm had been broken and I felt oddly unsynchronized.
The next day the AC unit arrived, having been retrieved from Death Valley or Kathmandu or wherever it had been. Following an afternoon of work and calling for the dog to get out of the neighbor’s business, we had cool air blowing out of the vents downstairs again.
There are those who live without air conditioning, by necessity or choice. In Kansas, 93% of homes are air conditioned, according to a report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. But because air conditioning contributes to outside heating and changes human perception of seasonal discomfort, some like Stan Cox avoid the A/C altogether (although he concedes in a New York Times essay that he’ll turn on the central air on the hottest days of the year). The AC also separates us from the outside, so much so that I hadn’t realized how much I missed the evening song of the cicadas.
I am generally heat tolerant and am comfortable at indoor temperatures that have Kim racing for the thermostat. But the older I get, the greater a burden the heat becomes. I also increasingly leave chores that I used to do myself — such as the painting — to others.
My contribution is a little carpentry work here and there, like fixing the treads on the wooden steps. Ladders are not for me. But I’ve experienced an unexpected satisfaction in seeing the progress, in going to the hardware store and buying paint to match the original color, in selecting a new shade for the trim — “nice tan.” It is nice, I suppose, but if asked I would simply describe the colors as yellow and brown.
The satisfaction comes not from doing some badly needed maintenance, after years when I was either too busy or too broke to have it done, but in making a statement. A stand is being made, a commitment to an old house on a working-class street in a town that is experiencing economic distress. The unemployment rate is now 6.5%, according to the Kansas Department of Labor, the highest in the state for cities over 25,000. We are painting the house not to sell, but to live in, although should we get out? was the subject of many heavy discussions over the dinner table.
For the foreseeable future, this historic Kansas neighborhood will remain our home. Kim and I discussed moving to Missouri or some other state, debating the merits of a new location as we studied the map on the dining room wall. But she fears if I moved away from Kansas, I would lose my identity.
She may be right.
The choice of staying or going was not something to take for granted. Too many Americans don’t have a choice of staying or going — and many of them don’t have a house, apartment or other suitable place to live. Our first gratitude, besides loving and being loved, should always be for food and shelter.
Our home will never be a showplace, but it’s lousy with history.
The house is an artefact of a time when this neighborhood, near the heart of Emporia, was rather higher on the social ladder. Inside there is stained glass and oak floors and other reminders of the apparently comfortable life, in the 1920s, of a Latin professor and his family. Bill Holtz taught at the local teacher’s college and he walked the same sidewalks. On the corner, across a brick pavement in desperate need of repair, the name of our street is stamped into the concrete, along with a date: 1916.
The weather has been especially hard on the house during the past couple of years, including roof damage, an upstairs window that was blown in during a storm, and a favorite maple tree in the back yard that fell and landed on the roof of the garage. The yard floods in heavy rains and so will the basement if the sump pump fails. The kitchen pipes freeze in winter. Critters get into the attic. We went through an odd period when yellowjackets infiltrated the upstairs and tried their damnedest to build a nest on the shaft of a ceiling fan. I received a nasty sting on my right hand during that episode, but luckily the hornets haven’t been back.
Now is a time of rebuilding, even in the face of uncertainty.
We are, as a nation, in the most chaotic period of the last 50 years. Anybody who claims to know what will happen next is either a prophet or a fool, and I’m afraid I’ve met damned few prophets in my life. We are at an extraordinary inflection point in history, a time filled with both peril and promise.
The peril is that Lincoln’s government “of the people, by the people, and for the people” may indeed perish from the earth. The promise is that American democracy may yet achieve the dream of Martin Luther King Jr., who glimpsed a day when we all would be free at last.
The turbulence of the events we now live through are not adequately described in any news report, but can only be fully appreciated at the breakfast tables and front porches of homes in Kansas and across the country. The consequences of decisions that have made most Americans feel helpless are realized not in the gilded corridors of power but in the small places in which we live, the tables where we eat, the bedrooms and sometimes the sidewalks where we sleep. Many desperate conversations are being held at this moment over a range of what ifs. What if I can’t find a job? What if we can’t afford groceries? What will we do if federal agents, their faces masked, come to take away our friends and neighbors?
Or us.
There are federal troops on the streets of Washington, D.C., ostensibly for law enforcement, and a protestor was recently arrested for assault on a federal immigration agent — for hurling a sandwich.
It is, as I type, another Wednesday night.
It’s quiet now, but when my painter friend and his helpers come tomorrow there will be scraping and wire brushing and more painting. The cracked and peeling paint of our house on Constitution Street will slowly give way to a fresh coat of “morning blossom.”
With resolve and paint, there are now a couple fewer questions on Constitution Street. We will stay. The trim will be “nice tan.” This will remain our home — as America is our home — and the talk of relocating to another state or even Canada is over. There will be columns written on Wednesday nights and tweaked on Thursday mornings. Cats will be fed and yellowjackets battled.
The gilding of the White House may continue, but no amount of gold leaf will hide the stain of authoritarianism. Our home’s honest yellow and brown paint is an investment in ourselves, a hope for our community, and a dream for America.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-17 08:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Amtrak’s new Acela starts soon. Worth the wait?,Jim Cameron | Columnist,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/17/amtraks-new-acela-starts-soon-worth-the-wait/,Is the NextGen Acela ready for prime time?  We shall see. But beware of the PR hype  proclaiming NextGen Acela as the savior of American passenger rail.,"Amtrak’s oldest new trains are arriving shortly: the NextGen Acela (finally) starts running between Washington and Boston on August 28.
Ordered in 2016 for $1.8 billion, the first trains arrived from the Alstom assembly facility in Hornell N.Y. in 2020.  That meant jobs there for 1,300 workers and business for 180 suppliers across 29 states.  These new trains are 95% “made in the USA.”


Like any new trains, the new Acelas required extensive testing, especially for crash worthiness and compatibility with the aging tracks and wires in the Northeast Corridor.  That’s when the problems started.
Even before field testing, it took Amtrak 14 attempts to finally pass computer simulations.  In road testing, windows shattered, there was water corrosion and leaks in the hydraulic tilting system.  Road testing also found issues with the trains’ wheels’ traction on our old tracks. And the pantographs (drawing electric power from the overhead catenary wires) kept losing contact at high speed.  Some 129 field modifications were ordered. 
That’s why these sleek new trains are about three or four years “late.”  But was it worth the wait?
Twenty-eight train sets are on order, but only five will be in service to start, the rest going into service by 2027.  They’ll replace the first-generation Acelas which have been running for up to 27 years, accumulating millions of miles of travel.
Despite constant maintenance and repairs, the older Acelas have been showing their age.  Reports indicate that some train sets have been stored, cannibalized for spare parts to keep the other aging trains running.    Eventually the old trains will all be scrapped. 
Is the NextGen Acela ready for prime time?  We shall see. But beware of the PR hype coming your way from Amtrak, proclaiming NextGen Acela as the savior of American passenger rail.
Make no mistake… these are nice new trains.  The train sets will be bigger: nine cars vs. six, carrying up to 386 passengers vs 304.  And the new Acela trains can add three more cars if needed while the old Acela sets were permanently coupled.  And with more train sets, there will hopefully be a greater frequency of service. 
The interior of the new cars looks sweet… comfy seats, fold-down tables, power plugs and more wheelchair spots.  There will be a new Café Car and promised (free) 5G Wi-Fi connectivity.  Seating will be two-by-two in Business Class (there is no coach class) and two by one in First Class with meals there brought to your seat. The windows will be larger and the ride is said to be smoother, even at top speed.
But here’s where the hyperbole hits the tracks.
The NextGen Acelas are being described as offering “160 mph” speeds.  But there are only 32 miles of the 457 mile tracks from Washington, D.C. to Boston that can handle those speeds… four miles in New Jersey and 28 miles in Rhode Island and Massachusetts. 
In Connecticut the new Acelas, like the old ones, will go no faster than Metro-North… maybe up to 90 mph in a few stretches.  You can blame our many bridges and curving tracks for the lower speed limits.
There is no word yet on fares, though they will probably match existing Acela fares.  This is already an expensive ride: one-way from Stamford to Boston is about $330 in business class and $573 in first class (compared to $134 and $227 on the slower, 50+ year old Amfleet Northeast Regional trains).  Running time on Acela: about three hours.  On the older trains, three and a half hours.
Are those fares worth the promised speed and comfort?  Maybe –if you’re on an expense account.  But I’ll take it for a spin (on my own dime) and will let you know.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/nextgen-acela-engine-832x1024.jpeg,,,2025-08-17 07:56:29.514089

In her nomination speech to more than 200 state committee members, Cotton said she heard the call for change, “that you needed to feel included.”
“I’m here to be your voice,” she said. “I’m also hear to be the voice of those who feel hopeless so that they can feel hopeful.”

In his acceptance speech Saturday at the Sheraton Four Points hotel in Little Rock, Jones alluded to the campaign between him and Cotton by mentioning a Bible verse “that says that as iron sharpens iron, so a friend sharpens a friend” through debate and dialogue.
“Now’s the time we come back together. Now’s the time we move forward … and carry those Democratic values outside of this room,” he said. “Outside, not everybody shares those same values. And we’ve got to be the people that carry that foward for Arkansas. We’ve got to be the people that do that for our nation.”
He pledged to help grow the number of active county Democratic committees to 70.
“Right now, we’ve got somewhere between 52 and 55, so we’ve all got some work to do,” Jones said.
He also promised to produce a five-year strategic plan within 90 days that will take advantage of the skills and talents of county and auxiliary committees to help recruit and elect more Democrats.
“‘Raise money and elect Democrats,’ isn’t a plan,” he said in a statement of candidacy. “The next Chair must establish a strategic vision for our party and collaborate with every team member to meet a long-term goal.”
Jones demonstrated fundraising prowess in his race for Congress last year against Rep. French Hill, and has continued to raise money on behalf of Democratic candidates since, according to his biography.
In introductory remarks Saturday, state Rep. Andrew Collins of Little Rock praised Tenille’s work rebuilding the party, for helping secure the victory of state Rep. Diana Gonzales Worthen of Springdale – the first Latina in the Legislature –  and the first net gain for her party in the House in nearly two decades.

(Image via Inciweb)At least seven large wildfires were burning in Montana on Saturday after a slow start to the fire season in the Treasure State.
The state reports there have been 1,672 reported wildfires this year, including 78 in the last week. There were seven Montana fires on the National Interagency Fire Center’s daily situation report on Saturday: Bivens Creek, Windy Rock, Cloudrest, Summer Springs, Horn, Mission Butte, and Pony Creek.
There were 273 people assigned to those seven fires on Saturday, according to the report, and the burns are estimated to have cost approximately $2 million to fight so far. No structures have been reported lost in those blazes.
Mission Butte
The largest fire burning in the state is the Mission Butte fire, which is three miles from St. Xavier in Big Horn County.
According to the state’s fire site, it was at 6,149 acres, which would make it the largest fire this year in Montana. It was primarily burning tall grass and brush. The fire was active, with flanking and torching behavior, state reports on the fire noted.
That fire is primarily being managed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and Crow Agency.
Horn
Burning in Madison County, the Horn fire briefly caused evacuation orders this week, though those were lifted on Friday morning.
Evacuation warnings are in effect for residents east of Highway 87 and south of Highway 287. The fire is burning 17 miles northwest of West Yellowstone, between Cliff Lake and Highway 87. The state Department of Natural Resources and Conservation said the fire was estimated at 2,800 acres and was caused by lightning.
Several roads are closed in the area: Horn Creek Road, Cliff Lake Road, and Wade Lake Road. Highway 87 was briefly closed during the fire, and state officials asked residents to be mindful of fire traffic on the road.
The DNRC noted it’s now a Type 3 incident, and resources on the ground include fire crews, 10 engines, a water tender and a bulldozer. Helicopters are also assisting.
The fire was about 50% contained on Saturday. Crews are mostly engaged in mop-up operations, the fire’s report on Inciweb stated. Fuels were primarily grass and brush.
Windy Rock
Burning 12 miles north of Garrison, the Windy Rock fire was at 600 acres and 0% contained on Saturday.
The cause was unknown. A community meeting for the fire will be held at the Avon Community Center at 208 Main St. at 7 p.m. on Sunday, Aug. 17. The fire is currently jointly managed by the Bureau of Land Management and the DNRC.
“There are a lot of structures close to the fire perimeter,” said Carmen Borchelt, the public information officer for the fire.

It was “extremely active” on Friday, the Inciweb report on the fire noted. A heavy air tanker and four helicopters were assigned to the fire. It’s burning dead and downed fuels, and access to the fire has been a challenge for firefighters, the report noted. Fire behavior included spotting, group torching and uphill runs.
The fire is moving to the east, Borchelt said. The BLM has also issued a closure order for all of its public land in Powell County. Containment is at 0%, and there are other factors at play with this fire, too.
“The Windy Rock Fire is located near a Wilderness Study Area and a Backcountry Conservation Area, requiring fire operations to take special considerations for these landscapes,” the Inciweb report said.
Cloudrest
A large fire burning in the Tobacco Root Mountains was at 500 acres and “spread rapidly,” an incident overview for the fire stated.
It was discovered on Aug. 14 and is burning at an elevation of 8,100 feet through subalpine fir timber about 9 miles northeast of Sheridan in the Madison Ranger District. Fuels include dead and downed timber, with a large amount of hazard trees or “snags”.
A helicopter did respond to the fire, which was reported via the Alert West camera system. Ten people are assigned to the fire, though additional resources were ordered.
There have been three straight days of critical fire conditions, and the fire’s origin was unknown.
Bivens Creek
Burning near the Cloudrest fire, the Bivens Creek fire is burning 11 miles northeast of Adler and 10 miles east of Sheridan.
The fire was reported on Aug. 13, which prompted a response that included a helicopter. The fire was listed at 500 acres, and its cause was undetermined. There were 35 people assigned to the fire, which is burning through subalpine fir. Behavior consisted of smoldering, creeping, group tree torching and spotting.
Weather, which like the Cloudrest fire has seen three straight days of critical fire weather, is also a concern.
“Firefighters engaged the fire, cutting sawline on the western edge until gusty winds associated with the RED FLAG WARNING prompted fire leadership to pull the crews back to safer areas,” the Inciweb fire report noted.
Summer Springs
The Summer Springs fire, reported on Aug. 13, was at 2,568 acres and at 55% containment.
It’s burning 13 miles southeast of Custer and was caused by lightning. The DNRC had demobilized its county assist team from the fire, Saturday’s Inciweb report on the fire noted.
“Today, crews will continue mop up operations and rehabilitate the control line. Containment of the fire is expected to rise significantly by this evening,” the report stated.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cloudrest-lake-Inciweb-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-16 19:57:14.860878

Nearly three years after its passage, it’s becoming clear that the millionaires tax has been a total success, and an incredible benefit for our state’s businesses. 
The post The Fair Share Amendment is delivering appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","SINCE 2022, when Massachusetts voters approved the Fair Share Amendment tax on incomes over $1 million, debate has swirled over the impact of the new levy on the state’s business climate. 
There’s universal agreement that investments in transportation and public education, which the new tax funds, are crucial to building a dynamic and prosperous economy. But some speculated that multi-millionaires would flee Massachusetts rather than pay the new tax. Last week’s news that the millionaires tax generated $3 billion over the past year should put those fears to rest. 
Prior to its passage, opponents of the Fair Share ballot question predicted it would backfire — failing to generate meaningful revenue to address the state’s transportation and public education needs, and hurting our economic competitiveness along the way. 
But nearly three years later, it’s becoming clearer and clearer — the Massachusetts millionaires tax has been a total success, and an incredible benefit for our state’s businesses. 
Despite predictions of substantial millionaire flight, the number of millionaires and ultra-wealthy individuals in Massachusetts grew significantly over the first two years the Fair Share Amendment was in place.  
The state has experienced revenue gains — $2.46 billion in the first year and nearly $3 billion in the second — that are more than double the state’s initial expectations, and more than even the proponents of the new tax predicted. That’s strong evidence that that multi-millionaires are staying in Massachusetts and paying more in taxes, not fleeing for other states. 
And that revenue is making a real difference. Over the past two and a half years, the state Legislature has approved more than $6 billion in Fair Share investments that are helping to deliver two of the most important resources for Massachusetts businesses: a well-educated workforce and a reliable transportation system.  
From the cradle to career, investments from the millionaires tax are key to growing and supporting the workforce our businesses depend on. 
Thanks to Fair Share funding to expand the number of public pre-K classrooms in cities and towns across the state, thousands of parents can now afford to stay in the workforce after their children are born. 
Kids can’t learn if they’re hungry. So Fair Share is funding in-school breakfast and lunch for every child in the state, helping them succeed in school and start off on a path to long-term success. The millionaires tax is supporting school building improvements across the state, enabling more vocational programs to train the next generation of workers in high-demand careers. And it’s delivered significant funding to every school district in the state, ensuring that schools have more of the resources they need to educate our future workforce. 
Once students graduate, Fair Share is funding free community college and expanded financial aid for low- and middle-income students at UMass and our other state universities. As a result, public college enrollment has increased for the first time in a decade. That means thousands of additional students who are preparing for good jobs with local employers. 
And when our graduates enter the workforce, Fair Share funding is delivering a transportation system they can count on to get to and from work. It’s the key funding mechanism in Gov. Healey’s plan to repair the MBTA after decades of disinvestment, which has resulted in the elimination of subway slow zones, trains that are moving faster, and the hiring of more bus drivers to expand service. 
In other parts of the state, the state’s regional transit authorities are using Fair Share funding to expand their service hours, add weekend service, create new bus routes, and make buses free. And hundreds of millions of dollars have gone into repairing roads and bridges across the state, ensuring that drivers can get to work on time. 
Now, it’s true that Massachusetts faces a migration problem. But it’s not multi-millionaires who are hiring U-Hauls and leaving the state; it’s low- and middle-income workers who can’t afford the high cost of living in Massachusetts.  
By putting more money directly in the pockets of working families with programs like free school meals, college financial aid, and free buses, the Fair Share Amendment is making Massachusetts more affordable for the workers our businesses depend on. 
And these investments are having an impact. Between July 2023 and July 2024, Massachusetts saw its largest population increase in 60 years, and the rate of domestic outmigration has significantly slowed. And this year, Massachusetts was ranked the strongest state economy in the US. 
Now, Massachusetts faces a new threat: billions of dollars in federal budget cuts that are being made to partially offset the cost of a $4.5 trillion federal tax cut that will overwhelmingly benefit the very rich and large corporations.  
As businesses begin to grapple with the effect of these changes on the Massachusetts economy, we’re left with one thought: Thank goodness Massachusetts had the foresight to pass the Fair Share Amendment when we did.

Wes Moore (D) told county leaders gathered in Ocean City that he will unveil efforts to spur affordable housing in the state. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Maryland Gov. Wes Moore told a gathering of county leaders Saturday that he is preparing to take action on initiatives he said will ease the cost of housing by spurring new projects.
“We must go faster on affordable housing,” Moore told an audience of county leaders and state Cabinet officials as he delivered the traditional speech to close out the Maryland Association of Counties summer conference in Ocean City.
Housing has been a priority for the governor, but a bill that was part of his legislative priorities was derailed in the 2025 legislative session in part because of opposition from MACo, the association that represents governments in the state’s 24 major political subdivisions.
Moore, speaking at what will be his last summer conference before the 2026 primary, issued a call to action. Half of all Maryland renters pay more than 30% of their income toward housing, he said. The state is ranked 43rd in housing affordability and permitting for new housing units is down almost 40% compared to the period before the 2008 Great Recession, Moore said.
“And it’s not just our people who are hurting,” Moore said. “It’s Maryland’s housing market and economy. If we want to build new bridges to wealth, bring down costs, and supercharge growth, we need to prioritize housing that’s affordable and located near jobs and transportation.”
Moore provided few details on what actions he would take.
He said his effort would focus on streamlining state permitting, leveraging public land for new housing and setting statewide housing goals and tracking progress toward those goals.
Moore also hinted at a potential carrot for counties who work with him.
“This is the moment to reward those jurisdictions that are stepping up to be pro-housing … because everyone must participate for us to succeed,” he said.

Earlier in the week, some county leaders complained Moore and his Department of Housing and Community Development iced them out of a housing policy meeting.
State officials met with county leaders at a hotel away from the convention center. And while state officials said the list of attendees was not exclusive, association officials were adamant that they were explicitly not invited.
Moore’s focus on housing was the largest kernel of policy in a more than 30-minute speech.
Unlike his previous two summer keynote addresses, in which he delivered tough state budget news, Moore this year mentioned the budget only long enough to note that he and lawmakers had to erase a projected $3.3 billion structural deficit as they crafted a compromise balanced budget.
During his remarks, the governor rattled off a list of accomplishments during his time in office.
He also used the platform to criticize — though not by name — Republican President Donald Trump.
The remarks drew mixed reactions.
Maryland is a state where Democratic voters outnumber Republicans 2-1. But most of those blue votes are clustered in central Maryland and outside the District of Columbia. Most of the counties on the Eastern Shore and in Western Maryland are majority Republican jurisdictions.
And as Moore began to bullet-point federal actions that would hurt the state, he took on the cadence of a man leading a big tent revival.
“Look, I understand that some people view Maryland as a ‘deep-blue state,'” Moore said. “But these policies from D.C. are hurting Democrats and Republicans.”
And as Moore drew attention to counties that would be affected — Montgomery and Prince George’s and Allegany and Wicomico — he punctuated each point with: ” Let’s get really specific.”
Much of the crowd remained polite but silent. Small pockets of others called out in agreement, a response to Moore’s call at a time he said was “steeped in danger and laced with uncertainty.”
“The truth is we are going to lead through this moment, knowing that history has taught us that there is only two things that can get us through difficult moments: God’s grace and steady leadership,” he said.
Moore charged county leaders to join him in a fast-paced effort to deliver results to residents
“We must move with the speed that shows them we understand how fast things are breaking in their lives,” Moore said.

(Kevin Hardy/Stateline)BOSTON — During this year’s budget cycle, Oklahoma state Sen. John Haste said lawmakers had two major things on their minds.
“Number one was tax cuts. Number two, what the hell is going on in Washington?” he told a national gathering of state lawmakers last week in Boston.
While Oklahoma lawmakers secured another round of income tax cuts, they are still wrapping their heads around the fiscal impacts of President Donald Trump’s massive spending and tax law, Haste said. The measure slashes funding for health care and food assistance.
That legislation, and other Trump actions, proved a central theme of discussion during the National Conference of State Legislatures summit, which organizers said was the largest ever gathering of state lawmakers with more than 1,600 in attendance. Aside from cutting funding, the law imposes costly new administrative burdens on states.
States are still sorting through the long-term impacts of the legislation — and what, if any, actions they can take to soften the blow.

Haste, a Republican, said concern is highest in rural areas, where reduced Medicaid funding could threaten hospitals. He said that just one provision of the law will cut $209 million in funds that help Oklahoma cover the cost of Medicaid, and that the state will need to spend an estimated $30 million on the new cost of checking eligibility twice per year.
“All of those things added together come up to a really big number,” he said, but added: “We don’t know exactly what that is.”
Lawmakers from liberal and conservative states said they are still grappling with the implications of Trump’s signature legislation. With most states boasting solid fiscal positions, some expect to cover new up-front administrative costs by tapping into strong reserve funds. But many are considering reducing services.
Nevada state Sen. Fabian Doñate, a Democrat, said state leaders will have to cut Medicaid eligibility or services since Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo has said he will oppose any efforts to raise taxes.
“That becomes a challenge, right?” Doñate said during a panel discussion on Medicaid. “Do you cut the pregnant mom or the person that makes above 180% of the federal poverty level who’s under 50, or do you cut diapers for seniors?”
At the same time, states must gear up for new bureaucratic mandates from Washington.
“Regardless of how you feel about these provisions — whether these are opportunities or challenges, fantastic or awful — regardless, it’s going to be a heavy lift for states,” said Lauren Kallins, NCSL’s senior legislative director for state-federal affairs.
She said states and organizations, including NCSL, are still awaiting detailed federal guidance on all the changes, which are spread out over several years. But states will need to react quickly.

One provision in the law requires the 40 states plus Washington, D.C., that have expanded Medicaid to check paperwork at least twice a year to ensure those enrollees are meeting new work requirements. The legislation provided states $200 million, but experts question whether it will be enough to help states implement the changes by the end of 2026.
To meet that deadline, states will need to increase outreach to Medicaid recipients and make new investments in technology, Kallins said. Similarly, states must cover new administrative costs for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, commonly called food stamps.
Traditionally, the federal government has fully funded SNAP benefits and split administrative costs of the program with states. The new law requires states to fund 75% of administrative costs and requires some states, depending on the accuracy of their eligibility determination, to fund a portion of benefits.
“So that’s another very significant increase for states,” Kallins said.
States in a ‘very, very strong position’
Though revenue growth is slowing, lawmakers and experts pointed out that many states currently enjoy strong budget fundamentals.

That’s true in Utah, which touts deep reserve funding and a rapidly growing economy.
Jonathan Ball, Utah’s legislative fiscal analyst, told conference attendees that the state could rely on some of its reserve for one-time administrative and technical costs associated with the federal legislation.
He said lawmakers and budget writers always have to find creative ways to solve their state’s budget puzzles.
“It’s a little bit maybe scarier, but it’s not a new sort of problem,” he said. “I think you all have the tools, we feel like we have the tools to fix it.”
Still, he said the potential for further federal funding cuts has raised many questions.
“The uncertainty about what happens in the future is huge,” Ball said.
At a separate session focusing on state budgets, financial analyst Geoffrey Buswick said most states have enviable credit ratings, meaning investors can be confident in a state’s ability to pay back debts, which affords it lower interest rates.
Buswick, the managing director and sector leader for public finance at S&P Global Ratings, said states likely have the budgetary cushion to adjust to federal policy changes.
“The states are in a very, very strong position — about the strongest we’ve ever seen,” he said.
Maryland Democratic state Sen. Karen Lewis Young didn’t buy that assessment.
She said her state touts strong reserve funds, but that those can only be used for one-time expenses and not to replace eliminated funding on an ongoing basis. Maryland is facing a huge decline in federal jobs, along with federal cuts in transportation, health and education funding.
“What am I missing in your optimism?” she asked the financial analyst.

Afterward, she told Stateline that Maryland may tout a stronger position compared with other states. But she added that even with low unemployment and a high average income, the federal legislation forces difficult decisions for lawmakers, who are constitutionally mandated to balance the state budget.
“You’ve got to cut from someplace else,” she said. “If you’re losing a pretty large share of your federal match, who do you cut?”
A ‘substantial headache’
Across the country, Democratic lawmakers hope to underscore the cuts in Trump’s new law to weigh down Republicans in state races this year and next.
Hawaii Democratic state Sen. Ronald Kouchi said lawmakers need to ensure constituents understand where the spending cuts originated.
“Who’s going to be blamed when people are left out, when people are hungry and they lose out on educational opportunities?” he asked during a panel. “If we as state legislators do not convey that it is a result of the decisionmakers in Washington, D.C., they will be at our doorstep as the place of last resort.”
Kouchi, the president of the state Senate, said Hawaii leaders had socked away more than $1 billion in reserves. But he said the state cannot fill in all the financial gaps, especially during a time when officials are trying to set aside more in disaster funding and grapple with a slowdown in tourism.
“There is no current financial ability for the state to meet the needs of everyone who is currently being impacted,” he said in an interview.










We have no idea yet how we’re going to respond.


– West Virginia House Speaker Roger Hanshaw (R)


New Mexico state Rep. Meredith Dixon, a Democrat, said her state should be somewhat insulated after directing surplus oil and gas revenues into a new Medicaid Trust Fund. But she said it’s still unclear how much pressure the federal legislation will put on the state.
“We are not protected by any stretch. So we are going to have to look at how we cover those costs. … We’re still digging into everything.”
West Virginia House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, a Republican, said no one in the federal government or at the state level seemed to have a full understanding of the implications of the legislation.
“I look at this bill as Obamacare 2.0: We have to pass this bill so we can find out what’s in it,” he told Stateline.
Hanshaw said the law has some provisions that will benefit West Virginia and others that will cause a “substantial headache.”
“We have no idea yet how we’re going to respond,” he said. “I don’t want to speak for any other state … but I would speculate that’s true for nearly every other state.”

(Stock photo by Daniel de la Hoz/Getty Images)Utah’s top law enforcement officer and his counterparts from a majority of states this week called on the social media giant Meta to add guardrails to a newly launched Instagram feature allowing the company and anyone who follows a user on the app to see their location.
Instagram on Aug. 6 launched the new feature for all users in the U.S. called Map, which displays the user’s profile picture and location in real-time on a map visible to any mutual followers. It quickly faced backlash from privacy advocates who warn against sharing highly personal data with an intermediary like Meta.
Utah Attorney General Derek Brown and attorneys general from 36 other states sent a letter Wednesday to Instagram executive Adam Mosseri saying that without careful controls, the new feature raises public safety and data privacy concerns, especially for vulnerable users like children and domestic violence survivors.
“Unrestricted location-sharing features pose a particular risk for minors as they can be readily used by sexual predators to identify and geographically target children in the real world,” they wrote. “We know that dangerous individuals are already present on Instagram, and we have serious concerns that this feature will increase the likelihood of hands-on abuse and exploitation.”
Previously redacted details in Utah’s Snapchat lawsuit are now public

The attorneys general are calling on the social media company to prohibit minors from enabling location-sharing; provide clear alerts to adult users about the feature, its risks and how their location data will be used; and allow adult users who opt in to easily disable the feature at any time.
Implementing those measures would demonstrate Meta’s “commitment to protecting the privacy and security of your users while still allowing those who wish to share their location to do so knowingly and with informed consent,” they wrote.
Utah is pursuing several lawsuits looking to challenge the legality of how social media companies interact with minors, including claims against major social media companies Meta, TikTok and Snap Inc.
The New Mexico Department of Justice is also pursuing litigation against Meta and Snap Inc, which owns Snapchat, alleging the companies’ policies fail to protect children.
“Instagram is once again prioritizing engagement over safety and has enabled a potentially dangerous feature without first ensuring the safety of their users, especially kids,” New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez said in a statement. “It is absolutely stunning that the company would allow children on the platform to enable a feature which would provide predators with even more information to target and abuse them.”
“Real-time location features should of course be intentionally built and give users control, which is why Instagram Map’s design already addresses the issues the attorneys general raise: it is off by default, everyone receives a notification explaining what the feature entails and can turn it off whenever they want, and with parental supervision, parents get a notification if their teen starts using it and can block their access to location sharing at any time,” a Meta spokesperson said in an emailed statement.
Instagram has accounts designed for teens that are automatically equipped with built-in protections, the company says on its website. That includes limiting who can contact them and what content they can see.
Other attorneys general joining New Mexico in the letter are Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Maine, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Nevada, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia and Wyoming.

Santiago/Getty Images)BILOXI, Miss. — The Trump administration is developing a powerful data tool it claims will let states identify noncitizens registered to vote. But Democratic critics and data experts warn it could allow the federal government to vacuum up vast quantities of information on Americans for unclear purposes.
Some Democratic election officials and opponents of the effort fear President Donald Trump wants to build a federal database of voters to target political opponents or cherry-pick rare examples of noncitizen voters to fuel a sense of crisis. Republican election officials allied with the president counter that he’s helping states to maintain accurate voter rolls.
The Trump administration has rolled out changes to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, tool at the same time the U.S. Department of Justice is asking states for copies of their voter rolls. The timing, combined with questions about what happens to voter data uploaded to the program, has alarmed critics.
Trump wants Congress to pass a national proof of citizenship voter registration requirement and in March tried to unilaterally impose one for federal elections through executive order. But with the legislation stalled and the order halted by the courts, the citizenship data tool may offer a backdoor way to accomplish the same goal.
SAVE was originally intended to help state and local officials verify the immigration status of individual noncitizens seeking government benefits. But U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, this spring refashioned it into a platform that can scan states’ voter rolls if election officials upload the data.
Justice Department demand for state voter lists underscores their importance

The changes to SAVE, rolled out over just a few months and with little public debate, are “tinkering with sort of the bones of democracy,” said John Davisson, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington, D.C.-based research and advocacy group that argues privacy is a fundamental right.
“You’re talking about the voting process and who will be eligible to vote,” Davisson said. “And to take a system that is not designed for use in that process and repurpose it, really on the fly, without a formal comment process, without formal rulemaking, without congressional intervention — that’s pretty anomalous and pretty alarming.”
Previously, SAVE could only search one name at a time. Now it can conduct bulk searches, allowing state officials to potentially feed into it information on millions of registered voters. SAVE checks that information against a series of federal databases and reports back whether it can verify someone’s immigration status.
Since May, it also can draw upon Social Security data, transforming the program into a tool that can confirm citizenship because Social Security records for many, but not all, Americans include the information. NPR reported earlier on changes to SAVE.
“It is incredible what has been done, really since March,” Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray, a Republican who supports proof of citizenship requirements and the SAVE tool, told a gathering of state secretaries of state in Biloxi, Mississippi, last week.
Individuals registering to vote in federal elections must already sign a statement affirming they are citizens under penalty of perjury, and those who cast a ballot face criminal penalties and deportation. One study of the 2016 election placed the prevalence of noncitizen voting at 0.0001% of votes cast.
But as Trump has spread falsehoods about elections, Republicans have made purging noncitizens from voter rolls a central focus.

Democratic concerns were on display last week at the National Association of Secretaries of State conference, held at the Beau Rivage casino-resort in Biloxi. In interviews on the sidelines of the conference, Democratic secretaries of state voiced deep reservations — or outright opposition — about plugging their voter data into SAVE.
Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said Aug. 6 that the federal government appeared to be trying to take over election administration. She formally rejected the Justice Department’s voter roll request two days later.
Bellows said the Department of Homeland Security told her in a recent phone call that it planned to retain SAVE data for 10 years for “audit purposes only.”
“Just like the [Justice Department] is asking us to hand over an electronic file of all the voters in our state, it seems like the Department of Homeland Security is through this backdoor system also asking us to share voter information about every voter in our state,” Bellows said.
At least one state appears to have granted the federal government sweeping authority over any voter data it provides to SAVE.
Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales announced in July he had reached an agreement with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to access the newly expanded system for voter list maintenance. Indiana’s agreement allows the federal agency to use information the state provides for any purpose permitted by law, including criminal prosecutions.
Morales, a Republican, said in a news release that SAVE represented “another step in safeguarding the rights” of eligible voters. His office didn’t respond to Stateline’s questions.
The Trump administration has ramped up efforts to encourage state election officials to use the expanded program. The White House hosted a bipartisan “fly in” event for state secretaries of state on July 29. Multiple secretaries of state told Stateline that USCIS Director Joseph Edlow, who was confirmed on July 15, spoke at the event.
“The president is very much keyed in on voter list maintenance,” Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, a Republican, said in an interview — echoing other GOP secretaries of state who released statements praising the Trump administration after the meeting.










When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances.


– Minnesota Democratic Secretary of State Steve Simon


Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, a Democrat who attended the meeting, said he questioned how the federal government would handle voter information provided to SAVE. He added that the Justice Department’s request for his state’s voter rolls raised his level of concern about how data would be used.
“When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances,” Simon told Stateline.
The White House referred questions about SAVE and the event to the Department of Homeland Security and USCIS.
In response to questions from Stateline, USCIS didn’t directly answer whether the agency would share voter roll data with other parts of the federal government but confirmed it disposes of records after 10 years.
“The SAVE application is a critical tool for state and local governments to access information to safeguard the integrity of elections across the country. It’s no wonder many states have quickly adopted it, and we continue to promote the tool to other states and counties not using SAVE,” USCIS spokesperson Matthew Tragesser said in a statement.
“We look forward to continued optimization efforts and implementing more updates to SAVE.”
GOP pressure
Some Republican election officials and Trump allies have long wanted the federal government to take an expanded role in searching state voter rolls for noncitizens.
Last summer the Trump-aligned litigation group America First Legal, co-founded by Trump adviser Stephen Miller, encouraged states to submit to the Department of Homeland Security the names of individuals for citizenship or immigration status verification.
Some states did just that. Texas, for example, asked USCIS to verify the citizenship of some voters in September, and Indiana asked the agency to verify 585,774 voters in October. The same month, 16 Republican state attorneys general signed a letter criticizing Homeland Security, then under the Biden administration, for failing to work with states on verification.
Trump’s DOJ wants states to turn over voter lists, election info

After Trump took office, GOP state officials kept up the pressure. Twenty-one Republican secretaries of state urged Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in February to prioritize SAVE improvements.
On April 16, Indiana sued the department in federal court for not responding to its verification request last fall. USCIS announced an overhaul of SAVE less than a week later.
As the agency continues to remake SAVE, the tool will soon allow searches using the last four digits of a Social Security number, multiple state secretaries of state told Stateline. The agency confirmed the feature is under development and will be available soon but didn’t provide an exact date.
The change would mark another significant expansion of the program because most states collect the last four digits when individuals without a driver’s license register to vote.
Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican, said SAVE represents a better way to verify citizenship than a state law requiring voters to produce documents. “I think there’s a real opportunity for us to do a lot of this through just sharing of information and I think that’s what we’re seeing happen,” McGrane said in an interview.
Unreliable data?
But some voting rights advocates and experts on government data caution against an overreliance on Social Security data.
The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, a progressive policy nonprofit, has noted that Social Security only began tracking the citizenship status of all applicants in 1978 — meaning the database doesn’t include comprehensive citizenship information for older Americans. Additionally, Social Security may not always have up-to-date information on the status of naturalized U.S. citizens.
The nonpartisan Institute for Responsive Government also warned in May that since SAVE hasn’t used Social Security numbers to verify citizenship in the past, its accuracy and effectiveness are unknown. The success of the expanded SAVE program may also partially depend on whether it has adequate staff and resources, it said.
U.S. House passes bill targeting voting by noncitizens, which is already against the law

A 2017 Government Accountability Office report found that between fiscal years 2012 and 2016, about 16% of the nearly 90 million SAVE searches required additional verification, which the institute says often translates into federal workers manually checking files. Now that SAVE allows bulk searches, the need for manual checking could rise dramatically.
Nick Doctor, director of implementation at the Institute for Responsive Government, said in an interview that a tool confirming the eligibility of registered voters in a way that doesn’t burden individuals can be a good thing. But he emphasized that it depends in large measure on SAVE’s implementation.
“The changes that have been made to SAVE happened very quickly and, to my knowledge, we haven’t seen releases on the level of accuracy of that information,” Doctor said.
During interviews, Republican secretaries of state stressed that voters aren’t kicked off the rolls because SAVE can’t verify their citizenship. Instead, an inability to verify would likely trigger a follow-up process with the voter.
“Just because we get something back from the SAVE database, it’s not a cut and dry, especially on those they’re not sure about,” Hoskins, the Missouri secretary of state, said.
Still, Arizona illustrates why some Democrats worry about any large-scale effort to ask voters — especially longtime, older residents — to prove their citizenship. After the state discovered errors in how it tracked voter citizenship dating back years, election officials are contacting some 200,000 voters seeking proof of citizenship documentation.
Some have been casting ballots for decades without incident and many feel targeted, Arizona Democratic Secretary of State Adrian Fontes said during a presentation at the state secretaries of state conference. “They feel insulted when they get that letter,” Fontes said.










There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside.


– Charles Stewart III, professor of political science at MIT who studies elections


Charles Stewart III, a professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies elections, said Arizona may actually point to the potential usefulness of SAVE. If Arizona runs its voter roll through the program, a list of 200,000 voters needing citizenship verification would perhaps drop into the hundreds, he suggested.
“There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside,” Stewart said.
Connecticut Democratic Secretary of State Stephanie Thomas told Stateline that every secretary wants tools to keep voter lists as clean as possible. But the details are important.
When she hears of something new, Thomas said she asks whether it’s the best option available and whether “the i’s are dotted, the t’s crossed.” She said she’s asked USCIS a series of questions about SAVE and is waiting on some responses.
“When it comes to voter lists,” Thomas said, “I don’t want Connecticut voters to be a guinea pig.”

Campbell plant was expected to save Michigan ratepayers $600 million by 2040. (Photo/Sarah Leach)Mandates from President Donald Trump’s administration to retain aging coal plants could cause a massive spike in energy costs, according to an independent analysis commissioned by several environmental groups.
Orders from the U.S. Department of Energy to save coal plants from retirement could cost ratepayers more than $3 billion per year, according to a report from Grid Strategies, a power sector consulting firm. It was carried out on behalf of Earthjustice, Environmental Defense Fund, Natural Resources Defense Council and Sierra Club.
Under Trump, the agency has issued emergency orders to maintain operations at coal plants that were scheduled for retirement. While federal officials say the coal plants need to stay online to avoid blackouts, power plant owners and state regulators planned their closures because they were no longer economically viable or needed for reliability.
“DOE mandates override those well-informed decisions, inflating electric bills for homeowners and businesses and undermining the competitiveness of U.S. factories and data centers,” the Grid Strategies analysis found.
Across the country, coal plants have phased out as they’ve struggled to compete with cheaper renewables and natural gas. A 2023 analysis by Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan think tank, found that 99% of existing U.S. coal plants “are more expensive to run than replacement by local wind, solar, and energy storage resources.”
But Trump, who has pushed to unleash more fossil fuel development and to stymie wind and solar, has ordered a retiring coal plant in Michigan to stay online, along with an oil and gas plant in Pennsylvania.
“Based on the trend to date and indications that DOE has approached the owners of many retiring fossil power plants about potentially mandating their retention, DOE may attempt to mandate the retention of nearly all large fossil power plants slated for retirement between now and the end of 2028,” reads the Grid Strategies report.
The cost of keeping those plants online would be immense. By 2028, if Trump were to mandate the retention of all fossil fuel plants slated for retirement, the annual cost to ratepayers would be more than $3.1 billion, the analysis found.
The report also considers a number of aging plants that are not yet scheduled for retirement. It finds Trump’s actions could create a “perverse incentive,” causing plant owners to claim they’re planning to shut down, inducing the feds to step in and keep them open, with the cost borne by ratepayers.
Accounting for that possibility, the report found that ratepayer costs could reach $5.9 billion per year to keep the entire aging fossil fuel fleet online. California, Texas and Colorado would see the highest increases in electricity bills.

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)Voting rights activists continue to be divided over gerrymandering. Here in Wisconsin, members of the Fair Maps Coalition, who just recently succeeded in getting representative voting maps for our state, are understandably alarmed by escalating threats to gerrymander the whole country, as Wisconsin Public Radio reports.
“I just hate it at its core,” Wisconsin League of Women Voters Executive Director Debra Cronmiller told WPR of the gerrymandering duel between Texas and California, as each state seeks to carve out more seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.
“We can’t save democracy by suppressing voters, and this has to be an opportunity to think about a new process and standards, especially in Wisconsin,” iuscely Flores, Wisconsin Fair Maps organizing director, told WPR.
But the president and CEO of Common Cause, the national organization dedicated to voting rights and fair elections, told members last week that the group “won’t call for unilateral political disarmament in the face of authoritarianism.”
The Common Cause position is tricky. On the one hand the group reaffirms its commitment to nonpartisan redistricting commissions. On the other hand it gives its blessing to California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s plan to suspend exactly the sort of nonpartisan commission the group endorses — and which Wisconsin fair maps advocates have long been fighting for. Supposedly, suspending the commission is a temporary measure while Democrats in the legislature draw up gerrymandered districts in time for the midterms. After they do that, Common Cause, Newsom and various Democrats claim California can undo the gerrymander later and restart the fight for fair maps. Really?
“Independent redistricting commissions are one way — and by far the best way — to draw fair maps and achieve fair representation for every single American,” Virginia Kase Solomón, Common Cause president and CEO wrote in a letter to the group’s members. But, a follow-up email from Common Cause reiterated the group’s non-opposition to Newsom’s plan in California, saying, “As the nation’s leading anti-gerrymandering advocacy group, we understand that Trump and Republican leaders’ attempt to lock in unaccountable power poses a generational threat to our ability to decide our own futures.”
Maggie Daun brought up those same dire threats on her Civic Media radio show when she grilled me about my last column arguing that we can’t gerrymander our way back to democracy. What if this is the existential moment and Trump is about to send troops into cities across the U.S. and destroy democracy, Daun asked. I agree with her that we’re in an existential moment. But just because we want Democrats to do something to stop Trump, as so many people so passionately do, that doesn’t mean that gerrymandering to get a narrow Democratic majority in the House is the right thing to do. For one thing, a new House majority won’t be seated until 2027 and won’t fix the immediate crisis.
Trump is already sending troops into Democratic cities. And his plan to try more federal takeovers will likely unfold before the midterms. What we need right now is a massive popular movement to resist authoritarian overreach, local leaders who stand up to Trump, and courts that continue to hold the line on his administration’s assault on the rule of law.
The courts have played the biggest role in restraining Trump so far, issuing injunctions and blocking his orders Their power has been badly limited by the U.S. Supreme Court, which curtailed judges’ power to issue nationwide injunctions and greenlighted some egregious administrative actions. The current Supreme Court majority has also helped Trump’s larger project of dismantling democracy by gutting the Voting Rights Act and by allowing partisan gerrymandering — which delayed but ultimately did not derail Wisconsin’s efforts to get fair maps.
Common Cause has led the fight against both partisan gerrymandering and the destruction of voting rights. On Saturday, the group declared a National Day of Action, with rallies in communities across the country, including in Wisconsin, to resist Trump’s Texas gerrymandering scheme and his unprecedented deployment of federal troops to run roughshod over local communities. But the group’s message is somewhat muddled, mixing strong language about fairness and voting rights with tolerance for the prospect of blue-state counter-gerrymandering.
One good thing about the gerrymandering brushfire spreading across the nation is that it has provoked a bipartisan backlash. Republicans in New York and California, facing the prospect of being drawn out of their seats, have begun speaking out against the gerrymandering plan for Texas, Politico reports.
Some quick math suggests that Republicans are likely to win a nationwide redistricting war that pulls in Missouri, Indiana, Florida and other red states. But Republicans who are in a minority in California and New York are still worried about losing their seats. “Redistricting is not really an ideological exercise as much as a self-interest exercise,” California-based GOP strategist Rob Stutzman told Politico. Hence blue state Republican House members are calling for their colleagues to stand down in Texas and other red states, lest they lose their seats in the blue state counter-gerrymander. 
Instead of looking to gerrymandering, which is unfair, diminishes democracy and escalates hyper partisanship, opponents of the Trump administration need to keep building a big, pro-democracy movement that unites a majority of the country against Trump’s authoritarian overreach.
Wisconsin could lead the way. 
U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, who has been holding town halls in Republican districts, reports being deluged with worried questions from both his own and his GOP colleagues’ constituents who don’t like the cuts to Medicaid, food assistance, and Social Security staffing in the unpopular “Big Beautiful Bill Act.” Most Americans don’t want to give away their health care, security and well-being so Elon Musk can get a tax cut.
Unfortunately, right-wing activists have played a long game, stacking the Supreme Court, blocking Democratic nominees, destroying the Voting Rights Act and putting the whole Heritage Foundation Project 2025 plan for authoritarianism in place. That won’t be undone in a single midterm election. But it is possible to leverage a broad-based populist movement of people who recognize it’s in their own interest to fight back.",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2928-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-16 11:59:16.483110

(James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)ANCHORAGE, Alaska —President Donald Trump’s high-profile meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin adjourned their brief summit Friday without announcing a breakthrough in negotiations to end Russia’s three-year-old invasion of Ukraine.
“We didn’t get there, but we have a very good chance of getting there,” Trump said after several hours of closed-door negotiations with Putin in Anchorage.
The talks ended sooner than previously expected, indicating that the two leaders may be far apart.
In a pair of brief speeches, the leaders said they were optimistic about improvements in relations between the United States and Russia. Putin said they had reached “an agreement,” according to a provided translation, but neither Putin nor Trump provided any details about what that agreement entails.
Before the meeting, Trump had indicated that he might favor a land exchange between Russia and Ukraine as part of a peace deal. European leaders, including Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said they did not support any deal that would require Ukraine to surrender territory.
“We had an extremely productive meeting, and many points were agreed to,” Trump said Friday without explaining what those points were. “There are just a very few that are left. Some are not that significant. One is probably the most significant, but we have a very good chance of getting there. We didn’t get there, but we have a very good chance of getting there.”
During a planned news conference, Putin spoke for only eight minutes, and Trump, who normally delivers lengthy and meandering remarks, spoke for only four and appeared tired.
Both men then left without taking any questions from a room full of international journalists, an action that stunned and confused attendees.
Many of those journalists, as well as Putin, Trump and officials from both Russia and the United States, traveled thousands of miles to meet at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, a base operated by the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Army in Anchorage, Alaska’s largest city.
Because of the summit’s short notice — Trump announced it on social media just one week ago — the city’s hotel rooms were all but sold out, and rental cars were almost impossible to find.
At the University of Alaska Anchorage, members of the Russian delegation, including journalists, were given cots in curtained-off spaces within Alaska Airlines Arena.
En route to Alaska, Trump told reporters traveling aboard Air Force One that he was “not going to be happy” if there was no ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine by the end of the day, according to news reports.
He said he didn’t know what would make the summit a success and said there was “nothing set in stone.”
As originally announced, Trump and Putin were supposed to meet in a one-on-one meeting Friday morning. That changed to a three-on-three, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump’s Russia envoy, Steve Witkoff, joining Trump.
The change didn’t appear to result in even a temporary ceasefire in Ukraine, whose leaders were not invited to Alaska.
Ahead of the Trump-Putin meeting, disgruntled Alaskans held protests across the state, waving Ukrainian flags and urging the United States to support Ukraine’s fight against Russia.
A smaller counterprotest in support of the president, hosted by Alaska Republicans, took place just as Air Force One landed in Alaska about 11 a.m. Friday morning.
A poll conducted by Alaska Survey Research in advance of the meeting indicated that 86% of Alaskans hold negative views of Vladimir Putin and that Trump’s approval rating has dipped below 50% in Alaska, where voters have chosen Trump in the past three presidential elections.
About 30 minutes after Trump’s arrival, Putin’s plane landed at the Anchorage military base after a stop in Magadan, in the Russian Far East.
Trump disembarked first and greeted Putin with applause and a firm handshake before inviting the Russian leader into the presidential limousine.
Putin’s arrival in the United States represented a kind of diplomatic victory for the Russian leader, who has been indicted by the International Criminal Court and faces arrest if he visits many countries, including most in Europe. The Trump administration opposes the ICC and does not typically enforce its arrest warrants.
Additionally, Trump has declined to impose additional financial and economic sanctions on Russia and Russian officials, something he had pledged to do if Russia did not agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine.

Eric Croft, chair of the Alaska Democratic Party, said in a written statement, “Just as we expected, Trump failed to accomplish anything meaningful by inviting a war criminal to a meeting on American soil without Ukrainian representation at the table. … To be frank, we are disappointed, but not surprised, and we will not back down from applying pressure to Trump to achieve lasting peace in Ukraine.”
On Friday, Putin and Trump, accompanied by aides, talked for at least 2 ½ hours. The content of those discussions was not revealed.
Putin boarded his plane for a return flight about 4 p.m. Trump was scheduled to depart before 6 p.m.
Their original schedule had called for more lengthy discussions, but reporters were called to a news conference sooner than expected.
That appeared to be in line with remarks Trump gave the day before, in the Oval Office.
“I would say that (on Friday), all I want to do is set the table for the next meeting, which should happen shortly,” Trump said on Thursday. “I’d like to see it happen very quickly, very shortly after this meeting. I’d like to see it actually happen in Alaska … because it’s so much easier.”
On Friday, Putin delivered his remarks mostly in Russian but joked in English that maybe next time, they could meet in Moscow.
Trump said he would “get a little heat” if he agreed to that, “but I could see it possibly happening.”
Even without a breakthrough peace deal, Friday’s meeting between the two presidents was a historic one. It was the first time since Ronald Reagan met Pope John Paul II in Fairbanks that an American president had hosted a foreign leader in Alaska.
Before Friday, no Russian leader had ever visited Alaska — a place whose territory nominally belonged to Russia from the 1700s until 1867.

(Photo by Kevin Hardy/Stateline)BOSTON — During this year’s budget cycle, Oklahoma state Sen. John Haste said lawmakers had two major things on their minds.
“Number one was tax cuts. Number two, what the hell is going on in Washington?” he told a national gathering of state lawmakers last week in Boston.
While Oklahoma lawmakers secured another round of income tax cuts, they are still wrapping their heads around the fiscal impacts of President Donald Trump’s massive spending and tax law, Haste said. The measure slashes funding for health care and food assistance.
That legislation, and other Trump actions, proved a central theme of discussion during the National Conference of State Legislatures summit, which organizers said was the largest ever gathering of state lawmakers with more than 1,600 in attendance. Aside from cutting funding, the law imposes costly new administrative burdens on states.
States are still sorting through the long-term impacts of the legislation — and what, if any, actions they can take to soften the blow.
Tracking Medicaid patients’ work status may prove difficult for states
Haste, a Republican, said concern is highest in rural areas, where reduced Medicaid funding could threaten hospitals. He said that just one provision of the law will cut $209 million in funds that help Oklahoma cover the cost of Medicaid, and that the state will need to spend an estimated $30 million on the new cost of checking eligibility twice per year.
“All of those things added together come up to a really big number,” he said, but added: “We don’t know exactly what that is.”
Lawmakers from liberal and conservative states said they are still grappling with the implications of Trump’s signature legislation. With most states boasting solid fiscal positions, some expect to cover new up-front administrative costs by tapping into strong reserve funds. But many are considering reducing services.
Nevada state Sen. Fabian Doñate, a Democrat, said state leaders will have to cut Medicaid eligibility or services since Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo has said he will oppose any efforts to raise taxes.
“That becomes a challenge, right?” Doñate said during a panel discussion on Medicaid. “Do you cut the pregnant mom or the person that makes above 180% of the federal poverty level who’s under 50, or do you cut diapers for seniors?”
At the same time, states must gear up for new bureaucratic mandates from Washington.
“Regardless of how you feel about these provisions — whether these are opportunities or challenges, fantastic or awful — regardless, it’s going to be a heavy lift for states,” said Lauren Kallins, NCSL’s senior legislative director for state-federal affairs.
She said states and organizations, including NCSL, are still awaiting detailed federal guidance on all the changes, which are spread out over several years. But states will need to react quickly.
  Tim Storey, the chief executive officer of the National Conference of State Legislatures, leads the organization’s business meeting at the Thomas Michael Menino Convention and Exhibition Center on Aug. 6 in Boston. (Photo by Kevin Hardy/Stateline)
One provision in the law requires the 40 states plus Washington, D.C., that have expanded Medicaid to check paperwork at least twice a year to ensure those enrollees are meeting new work requirements. The legislation provided states $200 million, but experts question whether it will be enough to help states implement the changes by the end of 2026.
To meet that deadline, states will need to increase outreach to Medicaid recipients and make new investments in technology, Kallins said. Similarly, states must cover new administrative costs for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, commonly called food stamps.
Traditionally, the federal government has fully funded SNAP benefits and split administrative costs of the program with states. The new law requires states to fund 75% of administrative costs and requires some states, depending on the accuracy of their eligibility determination, to fund a portion of benefits.
“So that’s another very significant increase for states,” Kallins said.
States in a ‘very, very strong position’
Though revenue growth is slowing, lawmakers and experts pointed out that many states currently enjoy strong budget fundamentals.
That’s true in Utah, which touts deep reserve funding and a rapidly growing economy.
Jonathan Ball, Utah’s legislative fiscal analyst, told conference attendees that the state could rely on some of its reserve for one-time administrative and technical costs associated with the federal legislation.
He said lawmakers and budget writers always have to find creative ways to solve their state’s budget puzzles.
“It’s a little bit maybe scarier, but it’s not a new sort of problem,” he said. “I think you all have the tools, we feel like we have the tools to fix it.”
Still, he said the potential for further federal funding cuts has raised many questions.
“The uncertainty about what happens in the future is huge,” Ball said.
At a separate session focusing on state budgets, financial analyst Geoffrey Buswick said most states have enviable credit ratings, meaning investors can be confident in a state’s ability to pay back debts, which affords it lower interest rates.
Buswick, the managing director and sector leader for public finance at S&P Global Ratings, said states likely have the budgetary cushion to adjust to federal policy changes.
“The states are in a very, very strong position — about the strongest we’ve ever seen,” he said.
Maryland Democratic state Sen. Karen Lewis Young didn’t buy that assessment.
She said her state touts strong reserve funds, but that those can only be used for one-time expenses and not to replace eliminated funding on an ongoing basis. Maryland is facing a huge decline in federal jobs, along with federal cuts in transportation, health and education funding.
“What am I missing in your optimism?” she asked the financial analyst.
Afterward, she told Stateline that Maryland may tout a stronger position compared with other states. But she added that even with low unemployment and a high average income, the federal legislation forces difficult decisions for lawmakers, who are constitutionally mandated to balance the state budget.
“You’ve got to cut from someplace else,” she said. “If you’re losing a pretty large share of your federal match, who do you cut?”
A ‘substantial headache’
Across the country, Democratic lawmakers hope to underscore the cuts in Trump’s new law to weigh down Republicans in state races this year and next.
Hawaii Democratic state Sen. Ronald Kouchi said lawmakers need to ensure constituents understand where the spending cuts originated.
“Who’s going to be blamed when people are left out, when people are hungry and they lose out on educational opportunities?” he asked during a panel. “If we as state legislators do not convey that it is a result of the decisionmakers in Washington, D.C., they will be at our doorstep as the place of last resort.”
Kouchi, the president of the state Senate, said Hawaii leaders had socked away more than $1 billion in reserves. But he said the state cannot fill in all the financial gaps, especially during a time when officials are trying to set aside more in disaster funding and grapple with a slowdown in tourism.
“There is no current financial ability for the state to meet the needs of everyone who is currently being impacted,” he said in an interview.










We have no idea yet how we’re going to respond.


– West Virginia Republican House Speaker Roger Hanshaw


New Mexico state Rep. Meredith Dixon, a Democrat, said her state should be somewhat insulated after directing surplus oil and gas revenues into a new Medicaid Trust Fund. But she said it’s still unclear how much pressure the federal legislation will put on the state.
“We are not protected by any stretch. So we are going to have to look at how we cover those costs. … We’re still digging into everything.”
West Virginia House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, a Republican, said no one in the federal government or at the state level seemed to have a full understanding of the implications of the legislation.
“I look at this bill as Obamacare 2.0: We have to pass this bill so we can find out what’s in it,” he told Stateline.
Hanshaw said the law has some provisions that will benefit West Virginia and others that will cause a “substantial headache.”
“We have no idea yet how we’re going to respond,” he said. “I don’t want to speak for any other state … but I would speculate that’s true for nearly every other state.”

Santiago/Getty Images)BILOXI, Miss. — The Trump administration is developing a powerful data tool it claims will let states identify noncitizens registered to vote. But Democratic critics and data experts warn it could allow the federal government to vacuum up vast quantities of information on Americans for unclear purposes.
Some Democratic election officials and opponents of the effort fear President Donald Trump wants to build a federal database of voters to target political opponents or cherry-pick rare examples of noncitizen voters to fuel a sense of crisis. Republican election officials allied with the president counter that he’s helping states to maintain accurate voter rolls.
The Trump administration has rolled out changes to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, tool at the same time the U.S. Department of Justice is asking states for copies of their voter rolls. The timing, combined with questions about what happens to voter data uploaded to the program, has alarmed critics.
Trump wants Congress to pass a national proof of citizenship voter registration requirement and in March tried to unilaterally impose one for federal elections through executive order. But with the legislation stalled and the order halted by the courts, the citizenship data tool may offer a backdoor way to accomplish the same goal.
SAVE was originally intended to help state and local officials verify the immigration status of individual noncitizens seeking government benefits. But U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, this spring refashioned it into a platform that can scan states’ voter rolls if election officials upload the data.
The changes to SAVE, rolled out over just a few months and with little public debate, are “tinkering with sort of the bones of democracy,” said John Davisson, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington, D.C.-based research and advocacy group that argues privacy is a fundamental right.
“You’re talking about the voting process and who will be eligible to vote,” Davisson said. “And to take a system that is not designed for use in that process and repurpose it, really on the fly, without a formal comment process, without formal rulemaking, without congressional intervention — that’s pretty anomalous and pretty alarming.”
Previously, SAVE could only search one name at a time. Now it can conduct bulk searches, allowing state officials to potentially feed into it information on millions of registered voters. SAVE checks that information against a series of federal databases and reports back whether it can verify someone’s immigration status.
Since May, it also can draw upon Social Security data, transforming the program into a tool that can confirm citizenship because Social Security records for many, but not all, Americans include the information. NPR reported earlier on changes to SAVE.
“It is incredible what has been done, really since March,” Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray, a Republican who supports proof of citizenship requirements and the SAVE tool, told a gathering of state secretaries of state in Biloxi, Mississippi, last week.
Individuals registering to vote in federal elections must already sign a statement affirming they are citizens under penalty of perjury, and those who cast a ballot face criminal penalties and deportation. One study of the 2016 election placed the prevalence of noncitizen voting at 0.0001% of votes cast.
But as Trump has spread falsehoods about elections, Republicans have made purging noncitizens from voter rolls a central focus.

Democratic concerns were on display last week at the National Association of Secretaries of State conference, held at the Beau Rivage casino-resort in Biloxi. In interviews on the sidelines of the conference, Democratic secretaries of state voiced deep reservations — or outright opposition — about plugging their voter data into SAVE.
Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said Aug. 6 that the federal government appeared to be trying to take over election administration. She formally rejected the Justice Department’s voter roll request two days later.
Bellows said the Department of Homeland Security told her in a recent phone call that it planned to retain SAVE data for 10 years for “audit purposes only.”
“Just like the [Justice Department] is asking us to hand over an electronic file of all the voters in our state, it seems like the Department of Homeland Security is through this backdoor system also asking us to share voter information about every voter in our state,” Bellows said.
At least one state appears to have granted the federal government sweeping authority over any voter data it provides to SAVE.
Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales announced in July he had reached an agreement with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to access the newly expanded system for voter list maintenance. Indiana’s agreement allows the federal agency to use information the state provides for any purpose permitted by law, including criminal prosecutions.
Morales, a Republican, said in a news release that SAVE represented “another step in safeguarding the rights” of eligible voters. His office didn’t respond to Stateline’s questions.
The Trump administration has ramped up efforts to encourage state election officials to use the expanded program. The White House hosted a bipartisan “fly in” event for state secretaries of state on July 29. Multiple secretaries of state told Stateline that USCIS Director Joseph Edlow, who was confirmed on July 15, spoke at the event.
“The president is very much keyed in on voter list maintenance,” Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, a Republican, said in an interview — echoing other GOP secretaries of state who released statements praising the Trump administration after the meeting.
Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, a Democrat who attended the meeting, said he questioned how the federal government would handle voter information provided to SAVE. He added that the Justice Department’s request for his state’s voter rolls raised his level of concern about how data would be used.
“When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances,” Simon told Stateline.
The White House referred questions about SAVE and the event to the Department of Homeland Security and USCIS.
In response to questions from Stateline, USCIS didn’t directly answer whether the agency would share voter roll data with other parts of the federal government but confirmed it disposes of records after 10 years.
“The SAVE application is a critical tool for state and local governments to access information to safeguard the integrity of elections across the country. It’s no wonder many states have quickly adopted it, and we continue to promote the tool to other states and counties not using SAVE,” USCIS spokesperson Matthew Tragesser said in a statement.
“We look forward to continued optimization efforts and implementing more updates to SAVE.”
 
GOP pressure
Some Republican election officials and Trump allies have long wanted the federal government to take an expanded role in searching state voter rolls for noncitizens.
Last summer the Trump-aligned litigation group America First Legal, co-founded by Trump adviser Stephen Miller, encouraged states to submit to the Department of Homeland Security the names of individuals for citizenship or immigration status verification.
Some states did just that. Texas, for example, asked USCIS to verify the citizenship of some voters in September, and Indiana asked the agency to verify 585,774 voters in October. The same month, 16 Republican state attorneys general signed a letter criticizing Homeland Security, then under the Biden administration, for failing to work with states on verification.
After Trump took office, GOP state officials kept up the pressure. Twenty-one Republican secretaries of state urged Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in February to prioritize SAVE improvements.
On April 16, Indiana sued the department in federal court for not responding to its verification request last fall. USCIS announced an overhaul of SAVE less than a week later.
As the agency continues to remake SAVE, the tool will soon allow searches using the last four digits of a Social Security number, multiple state secretaries of state told Stateline. The agency confirmed the feature is under development and will be available soon but didn’t provide an exact date.
The change would mark another significant expansion of the program because most states collect the last four digits when individuals without a driver’s license register to vote.
Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican, said SAVE represents a better way to verify citizenship than a state law requiring voters to produce documents. “I think there’s a real opportunity for us to do a lot of this through just sharing of information and I think that’s what we’re seeing happen,” McGrane said in an interview.
 
Unreliable data?
But some voting rights advocates and experts on government data caution against an overreliance on Social Security data.
The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, a progressive policy nonprofit, has noted that Social Security only began tracking the citizenship status of all applicants in 1978 — meaning the database doesn’t include comprehensive citizenship information for older Americans. Additionally, Social Security may not always have up-to-date information on the status of naturalized U.S. citizens.
The nonpartisan Institute for Responsive Government also warned in May that since SAVE hasn’t used Social Security numbers to verify citizenship in the past, its accuracy and effectiveness are unknown. The success of the expanded SAVE program may also partially depend on whether it has adequate staff and resources, it said.
A 2017 Government Accountability Office report found that between fiscal years 2012 and 2016, about 16% of the nearly 90 million SAVE searches required additional verification, which the institute says often translates into federal workers manually checking files. Now that SAVE allows bulk searches, the need for manual checking could rise dramatically.
Nick Doctor, director of implementation at the Institute for Responsive Government, said in an interview that a tool confirming the eligibility of registered voters in a way that doesn’t burden individuals can be a good thing. But he emphasized that it depends in large measure on SAVE’s implementation.
“The changes that have been made to SAVE happened very quickly and, to my knowledge, we haven’t seen releases on the level of accuracy of that information,” Doctor said.
During interviews, Republican secretaries of state stressed that voters aren’t kicked off the rolls because SAVE can’t verify their citizenship. Instead, an inability to verify would likely trigger a follow-up process with the voter.
“Just because we get something back from the SAVE database, it’s not a cut and dry, especially on those they’re not sure about,” Hoskins, the Missouri secretary of state, said.
Still, Arizona illustrates why some Democrats worry about any large-scale effort to ask voters — especially longtime, older residents — to prove their citizenship. After the state discovered errors in how it tracked voter citizenship dating back years, election officials are contacting some 200,000 voters seeking proof of citizenship documentation.
Some have been casting ballots for decades without incident and many feel targeted, Arizona Democratic Secretary of State Adrian Fontes said during a presentation at the state secretaries of state conference. “They feel insulted when they get that letter,” Fontes said.
Charles Stewart III, a professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies elections, said Arizona may actually point to the potential usefulness of SAVE. If Arizona runs its voter roll through the program, a list of 200,000 voters needing citizenship verification would perhaps drop into the hundreds, he suggested.
“There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside,” Stewart said.
Connecticut Democratic Secretary of State Stephanie Thomas told Stateline that every secretary wants tools to keep voter lists as clean as possible. But the details are important.
When she hears of something new, Thomas said she asks whether it’s the best option available and whether “the i’s are dotted, the t’s crossed.” She said she’s asked USCIS a series of questions about SAVE and is waiting on some responses.
“When it comes to voter lists,” Thomas said, “I don’t want Connecticut voters to be a guinea pig.”

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott said Friday that the city has reduced thousands of vacant properties over the last five years, which he said should ultimately help reduce the number of people who experience homelessness by keeping housing costs down by increasing supply.
“Affordability is number one for us in Baltimore,” Scott said at a Friday panel at the Maryland Association of Counties’ summer conference. “Baltimore, as we all know, has a ton of housing stock, but a large portion of that is unlivable, vacant housing throughout our city.”
He reported that since he became mayor in December 2020, the city has reduced the number of vacant properties by about 3,500 units, after a period of more than 20 years when the number of vacant properties had not changed.
“We were at 16,000 vacant properties when I came into office. As of 20 minutes before we started today, we’re now down to 12,510,” he said to applause from MACo attendees.
Improving housing stock and housing access was just one of the many potential solutions offered at a pair of housing events Friday at the conference in Ocean City. Scott was joined by members of state and local government as well as homeless advocates to discuss the challenges and potential solutions to homelessness.
“People always tell you that homelessness is this simple thing to fix, and that you can take these cookie cutter approaches,” Scott said. “No — every single person experiencing homelessness needs a specific, tailored thing for them.”

He said that investing in vacant housing efforts across the city, not just in downtown areas, will especially help underserved areas where people experience higher rates of poverty. He added that a partnership between the city, the Moore administration and private developers called Reframe Baltimore will bring in $3 billion over the next 15 years to eliminate vacant houses in the city.
But Scott assured the audience that there’s still work to be done.
Making progress, but challenges continue
Danielle Meister, assistant secretary of homeless solutions with the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development, said  there has been a 28% decrease in homelessness across the state since 2015.
There’s also been a 42% drop in unsheltered homelessness since 2015, she said. Meister attributes that drop to the state’s adoption of “housing first” policies.
“Rather than requiring people to first go through treatment or first get a job to kind of earn housing,” she said, “we really endorse and fiercely protect the idea that they should be connecting people rapidly to permanent housing with the supports to stay there successfully.
“It’s really hard to get a job, it’s really hard to maintain sobriety if you don’t have a regular consistent place to live,” she added.
But even with that progress, there are a few populations where state data shows “really concerning trends” particularly with people aged 65 years and older and among families with children.
Meister said the number of homeless seniors doubled between fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2024.
“The vast majority of the homeless system resources, they’re set up for people who can work and eventually, maybe, pay their own rent,” Meister said. “Most of our homeless system is not equipped to serve older adults who are on restricted income.”
She added that there’s been a “big increase” in families experiencing homelessness since the pandemic.
“It looks different than single adults, so what we’re going to start to focus on a little bit more is family homelessness,” she said.

Meister said that looking at trends in state data on homelessness can help identify and target new solutions.
“Generally, our state has been really great at accelerating permanent, supportive housing growth, not so much on other housing interventions which is more often navigated to families.”
Nick Rinehart, legislative analyst for the Howard County Council, asked the panel how officials can counter the stigma of homelessness to help push solutions in their jurisdictions.
“We’re elected to do the right thing, not the popular one,” Scott said. “We have to educate folks … but sometimes, they’re still going to be mad – so what?
“We have to be able to do what we know is right,” Scott said. “We just have to do the right thing no matter who gets mad.”

Ben Cardin (D-Md.), who retired last year. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)The message was the same, but the messenger was different.
U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md) held his first town hall as Maryland’s senior senator at the Maryland Association of Counties conference Friday, stepping into a role long held by former Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.), who retired last year. Once on the stage, Van Hollen gave a presentation that could have been delivered by Cardin in any of the past few years, criticizing President Donald Trump’s administration in general and vowing to bring the new FBI headquarters to Greenbelt, the Democratic equivalent of political comfort food.
Prince George’s County Executive Aisha Braveboy kicked off the question-and-answer portion by bringing up the FBI headquarters and asking what county officials can do to “protect Maryland and protect Maryland assets” from sudden decisions at the federal level.
Van Hollen reminded the audience that the original decision to place the FBI headquarters in Greenbelt was made after years of study and competition between Maryland and Virginia. But in March, Trump said he would scrap plans for a new headquarters in Maryland because he wanted to keep the agency in Washington, D.C.
In July, FBI Director Kash Patel announced that the agency would be moving just a few blocks from its current home on Pennsylvania Avenue, to space in the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center, to space that had been occupied by the Agency for International Development before Trump abruptly closed that agency this year.
But Van Hollen, like most of the Maryland Democratic establishment, said Patel’s announcement is not the last word. “This is a fight that is going to go on, and we are going to bring the FBI headquarters to Prince George’s County,” he told the town hall crowd.
“Regardless of party,” Van Hollen said, “I think officials recognize that it’s not helpful when they’ve been able to secure a federal grant or a federal program or federal program supports — only to see it frozen or terminated.”

“Unfortunately, this is going back and forth, seesawing back and forth as we speak,” he said. “Congress has spoken on this on a bipartisan basis. We had hoped more of our Republican colleagues would stand with us.”
Getting Republicans to stand against Trump policies and find bipartisan solutions was Van Hollen’s answer to several concerns raised by elected officials and advocates in the town hall Friday – such as immigration reform, cuts to disaster relief programs and the erosion of trust in federal data and reporting.
“We need our Republican counterparts to meet their constitutional responsibilities,” Van Hollen said after the town hall. “When you have a Republican Party on Capitol Hill that is 100% in league with the president and not willing to challenge the president … this is a problem.”
Getting charged up over energy policy
What is it about energy policy that gets people a little fired up?
At a Maryland Association of Counties session “Powering Maryland: What’s Next for the State’s Energy Future?” on Thursday, Maryland Energy Administration Director Paul Pinsky took aim at PJM Interconnection, the operator of the regional electric grid that supplies power to Maryland and all or parts of about a dozen other states.
Problem is, PJM was sitting right there, in the person of Executive Director Jason Stanek, a former Maryland Public Service Commission chairman.
The exchange began with Stanek’s description of PJM as a “fuel-neutral … nonpartisan” organization.
“We don’t build generation. We don’t build transmission. We don’t own generation, and we don’t own transmission,” Stanek said. “Unlike most utilities, we have no shareholders, we have no share price, and we don’t make a penny in profit.”
Pinsky, who stepped to the microphone after Stanek, saw an opening. He argued that the majority of PJM’s grid is served by fossil fuels and a logjammed queue to join the grid is full of renewable energy projects, including solar farms and battery storage projects.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“You can be fuel-neutral, but if your policies help fossil fuels, you’re not fuel-neutral,” Pinsky said, as Stanek shook his head.
Pinsky said that although PJM was built to help states move electrons from one area to another, the current structure doesn’t provide state governments ample representation.
“On the Board of Governors, there is no one who represents the states. Are there people who represent the generators of the power? Yes. Are there people who are close to the utilities that move the power? You bet,” Pinsky said.
Stanek didn’t get the microphone to respond right away, but then came a question from an attendee who wondered if there was a way to ensure that energy generated in Maryland stays in Maryland for local consumption. Stanek defended the PJM model.
“The advantages of having a large, interconnected grid is that you have the economies of scale,” Stanek said. “You can ship your power throughout the grid to obtain the most efficient, best price. To the extent you want to island the grid and make it smaller, you’ll obviously have less options, less resources.”
Medicaid director makes MACo debut
Vacancies at the Maryland Department of Health are starting to get filled after a series of departures by high-level officials of the agency.
Just Monday, Perrie Briskin began her tenure as the Deputy Secretary for Healthcare Financing and Medicaid Director, filling the place of Ryan Moran, who left the position last week for a state job in Washington.

And Friday, Briskin was a key speaker on a MACo panel talking about how the recent budget reconciliation bill passed by Congress will impact Medicaid coverage in the state.
“When we talk about federal cuts, that is a huge cut to the overall funding Medicaid budget, because of the disproportionately high share we receive from the federal government to run the program,” she told the audience, as part of a 10-minute overview of how Medicaid operates in Maryland.
“One cut to one part of Medicaid is a cut to all of Medicaid, so we are going to do our best to advocate for the program and to make sure we keep everyone covered, but we appreciate your partnership and want to work with all of you to do the same thing,” she said.
While she’s new to the position of deputy secretary, she has been with department since January, serving as the Chief of Staff for Maryland Medicaid. Prior to that, she was the Senior Advisor to the Director of Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program Services at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.
As the Medicaid director, Briskin will be tasked with helping see the state through implementation of work requirements for Medicaid as well as significant cuts to the program in the coming years.

Joni Ernst, right, as well as other Republican lawmakers. (Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)AMES, IOWA — U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said Thursday during a visit to Ames National Laboratory that he supports the development and research of clean energy sources — but also said he believes the ending of some federal supports for industries like solar and wind energy has come at the right time.
Several parts of the budget reconciliation law signed by President Donald Trump change clean energy programs created through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, the flagship legislation of former President Joe Biden. The “big, beautiful” law takes funding out of some of these programs, in addition to ending or phasing out clean energy tax credits, shortening the qualification window for wind and solar projects and terminating rebates this year for purchase of electric vehicles and energy efficient home upgrades.
Nearly 60% of Iowa’s net electricity generation comes from wind energy, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Advocates for clean energy say Iowa, which has a higher share of wind energy production than other states and hosts a growing solar energy industry, could see higher costs and the loss of new projects, jobs and manufacturing facilities as these federal incentives end.
But Wright told reporters he supported the move to end these incentives, saying the industry has grown enough to be able to compete without the government financial support.
“I think it’s the right time to sunset them,” Wright said. “… In an early energy producing industry, the government provides subsidies or incentives or whatever to do it. But they’ve been around for 33 years, and I think you’ve seen a mature industry develop. So like with any energy source, it’s got to achieve maturity and compete in the marketplace.”
Wright was joined by members of Iowa’s federal delegation, Sen. Joni Ernst and Reps. Mariannette Miller-Meeks and Ashley Hinson, as well as other members of the conservative climate caucus in the U.S. House, Reps. Bob Latta of Ohio and Bruce Westerman of Arkansas.
Ernst said discussions are ongoing with the Trump administration and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on wind projects in Iowa “to make sure that they do qualify for those tax credits.”
“It doesn’t mean our wind energy is going away. It just means that those tax credits will be phased out,” Ernst said. “So I can anticipate that states like Iowa, we will continue to see a great pull of electricity coming from those wind turbines, the solar projects that are there, but we will see less subsidies coming from the federal government.”
Wright also spoke in support of other components of the budget reconciliation law, saying the measure included some changes to permitting that “took some shackles off” on building new energy production infrastructure, as well as for natural resource extraction within the country.
The Ames National Laboratory, located on the Iowa State University campus, is one of the 17 national laboratories throughout the country that focus on research related to energy production, national security and environmental impact. The Ames lab focuses on issues related to materials science and minerals — areas of research Wright said are vital, as the nation needs to become less dependent on countries like China.
Currently, he said, the U.S. is over-reliant on foreign countries for certain chemicals and minerals that are needed in many energy, technology and medical fields.
Miller-Meeks said bringing the mining of minerals back to the U.S. — as well as setting up more processing and manufacturing industries for these natural resources in the U.S. — would be more environmentally conscious overall, as there are “better labor practices, better environmental practices” in the U.S. than in other countries.
There are also methods being developed at facilities like the Ames National Laboratory to remine rare earth elements and other materials through recycled electronic waste, Miller-Meeks said.
Wright said while there were cuts made through the budget reconciliation law and other efforts by the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress to cut costs, he said he does not expect cuts to the National Laboratory system.
“Of course, when I got there, the original idea was, ‘Let’s cut everything, let’s shrink everything,’” Wright said. “We need to shrink our spending of the government. But the smallest — and potentially no cuts — will be to the broader national laboratory complex. These are investments in our future. They’re much smaller dollars than giant corporate subsidies, and they have huge payoffs.”

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)President Donald Trump’s high-profile meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin adjourned their brief summit Friday without announcing a breakthrough in negotiations to end Russia’s three-year-old invasion of Ukraine.
“We didn’t get there, but we have a very good chance of getting there,” Trump said after several hours of closed-door negotiations with Putin in Anchorage.
The talks ended sooner than previously expected, indicating that the two leaders may be far apart.
In a pair of brief speeches, the leaders said they were optimistic about improvements in relations between the United States and Russia. Putin said they had reached “an agreement,” according to a provided translation, but neither Putin nor Trump provided any details about what that agreement entails.
Before the meeting, Trump had indicated that he might favor a land exchange between Russia and Ukraine as part of a peace deal. European leaders, including Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said they did not support any deal that would require Ukraine to surrender territory.
“We had an extremely productive meeting, and many points were agreed to,” Trump said Friday without explaining what those points were. “There are just a very few that are left. Some are not that significant. One is probably the most significant, but we have a very good chance of getting there. We didn’t get there, but we have a very good chance of getting there.”
During a planned news conference, Putin spoke for only eight minutes, and Trump, who normally delivers lengthy and meandering remarks, spoke for only four and appeared tired.
Both men then left without taking any questions from a room full of international journalists, an action that stunned and confused attendees.
Many of those journalists, as well as Putin, Trump and officials from both Russia and the United States, traveled thousands of miles to meet at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, a base operated by the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Army in Anchorage, Alaska’s largest city.
Because of the summit’s short notice — Trump announced it on social media just one week ago — the city’s hotel rooms were all but sold out, and rental cars were almost impossible to find.
At the University of Alaska Anchorage, members of the Russian delegation, including journalists, were given cots in curtained-off spaces within Alaska Airlines Arena.
En route to Alaska, Trump told reporters traveling aboard Air Force One that he was “not going to be happy” if there was no ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine by the end of the day, according to news reports.
He said he didn’t know what would make the summit a success and said there was “nothing set in stone.”
As originally announced, Trump and Putin were supposed to meet in a one-on-one meeting Friday morning. That changed to a three-on-three, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump’s Russia envoy, Steve Witkoff, joining Trump.
The change didn’t appear to result in even a temporary ceasefire in Ukraine, whose leaders were not invited to Alaska.
Ahead of the Trump-Putin meeting, disgruntled Alaskans held protests across the state, waving Ukrainian flags and urging the United States to support Ukraine’s fight against Russia.
A smaller counterprotest in support of the president, hosted by Alaska Republicans, took place just as Air Force One landed in Alaska about 11 a.m. Friday morning.
A poll conducted by Alaska Survey Research in advance of the meeting indicated that 86% of Alaskans hold negative views of Vladimir Putin and that Trump’s approval rating has dipped below 50% in Alaska, where voters have chosen Trump in the past three presidential elections.
About 30 minutes after Trump’s arrival, Putin’s plane landed at the Anchorage military base after a stop in Magadan, in the Russian Far East.
Trump disembarked first and greeted Putin with applause and a firm handshake before inviting the Russian leader into the presidential limousine.
Putin’s arrival in the United States represented a kind of diplomatic victory for the Russian leader, who has been indicted by the International Criminal Court and faces arrest if he visits many countries, including most in Europe. The Trump administration opposes the ICC and does not typically enforce its arrest warrants.
Additionally, Trump has declined to impose additional financial and economic sanctions on Russia and Russian officials, something he had pledged to do if Russia did not agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine.
Eric Croft, chair of the Alaska Democratic Party, said in a written statement, “Just as we expected, Trump failed to accomplish anything meaningful by inviting a war criminal to a meeting on American soil without Ukrainian representation at the table. … To be frank, we are disappointed, but not surprised, and we will not back down from applying pressure to Trump to achieve lasting peace in Ukraine.”
On Friday, Putin and Trump, accompanied by aides, talked for at least 2 ½ hours. The content of those discussions was not revealed.
Putin boarded his plane for a return flight about 4 p.m. Trump was scheduled to depart before 6 p.m.
Their original schedule had called for more lengthy discussions, but reporters were called to a news conference sooner than expected.
That appeared to be in line with remarks Trump gave the day before, in the Oval Office.
“I would say that (on Friday), all I want to do is set the table for the next meeting, which should happen shortly,” Trump said on Thursday. “I’d like to see it happen very quickly, very shortly after this meeting. I’d like to see it actually happen in Alaska … because it’s so much easier.”
On Friday, Putin delivered his remarks mostly in Russian but joked in English that maybe next time, they could meet in Moscow.
Trump said he would “get a little heat” if he agreed to that, “but I could see it possibly happening.”
Even without a breakthrough peace deal, Friday’s meeting between the two presidents was a historic one. It was the first time since Ronald Reagan met Pope John Paul II in Fairbanks that an American president had hosted a foreign leader in Alaska.
Before Friday, no Russian leader had ever visited Alaska — a place whose territory nominally belonged to Russia from the 1700s until 1867.

A group of education leaders is working to reshape Washington’s system of funding for K-12 education after years of financial challenges plaguing school districts.
Two Whatcom County superintendents are taking part. Meridian Superintendent James Everett and Ferndale Superintendent Kristi Dominguez are participating with the group, which was formed by Yakima Superintendent Trevor Greene and Bellevue Superintendent Kelly Aramaki last summer.
“We know that there’s a problem, and we can continue to admire it, and talk about it, or we can sit down and say, ‘This isn’t working,’” Dominguez said.
The catalyst for the formation of the group was Aramaki’s experience having to make massive budget cuts over the last several years, according to Seattle Times reporting. Bellevue is now on binding conditions with the state, joining seven other districts (including Mount Baker) receiving financial oversight from the state due to serious budgetary challenges.
That demonstrates the breadth of the problem, the superintendents say. And it doesn’t even include the many more districts that are enduring massive cuts to avoid financial oversight by the state, including Blaine, Bellingham and more. Ferndale eliminated $6 million in expenses from its budget this year. Meridian eliminated $1 million this year and $2 million the year before.
For Dominguez and Everett, it’s clear the current funding model isn’t working.
“There’s something broken in the system,” Dominguez said. “So we’re just asking, what new system do we need to explore?”
The main issue, they say, is that the state doesn’t come close to funding what the schools must pay for. As costs and student needs have increased, funding hasn’t kept up.
The superintendents were initially pulled from the University of Washington alumni network but have since expanded to more than 20 superintendents across the state. They’re working with the University of Washington College of Education, including Dean Mia Tuan, Professor Anthony Craig and Professor David Knight.
Washington funds schools under a system called a “resource funding model,” which bases allocations on a series of student-staff ratios, according to research by Knight.
Many other states, however, follow a student-based approach. Under that system, districts receive a base amount of funding per student, with additional funding designated for students who are low-income, multi-language learners or need specific support services. Then, that is multiplied by district enrollment to determine how much money the district gets from the state.
Dominguez simplified the system as “the money follows the adults” in Washington, while it follows the students in other states.
An example of how that plays out in local districts: The state pays for Ferndale to hire seven paraeducators across the whole district. But in the 4,600-student district, “we need far more than that just to cover lunch duties, before or after school, playgrounds,” Dominguez said. In Meridian School District, the state pays for half a nurse, Everett said.
Despite the funding issues, schools must continue to meet the needs of students, and they are “working their butts off” to do so, Everett said. But it’s with less and less funding.
The way local levies are set up causes issues, too.
“The higher assessed value of property that you have, the better ability you have to secure funding with less impact on your community,” Everett said.
While districts like Seattle can run levies that bring in hundreds of millions of dollars at a modest cost to the individual taxpayer, property-poor districts must have higher tax rates to bring in much less.
It’s created competing agendas between property-rich and property-poor districts. But the intention is to come up with a proposal that works for everyone, Everett said.
Everett said his biggest takeaway from the experience was that no district has it figured out — even areas with high levels of assessed value, such as Bellevue.
By their next meeting in October, the plan is to come up with a specific proposal they want to push forward, Everett said.
“We are now at crisis level in many ways, and it’s our kids who are going to pay the price,” Dominguez said. “… At what point do we just say, enough? We’ve got to get proactive.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)As South Dakota lawmakers consider spending $650 million to build a prison, another major building expense is looming: the first full restoration of the state Capitol in nearly 40 years.
The state official in charge of planning the restoration is Darin Seeley, commissioner of the Bureau of Human Resources and Administration. When he briefed a committee of legislators during a public meeting Tuesday at the Capitol, one of them asked for a ballpark estimate of the cost.
Seeley stressed that he does not have an official number yet. “But,” he said, “we’re talking probably between $150 million and $200 million.”

South Dakota is in a tight budget climate while the Trump administration and Congress reduce support for states. The governor’s budget office says various state departments have already lost a combined $24 million in federal funding since Trump’s second term began.
That’s a reversal from the latter part of Trump’s first term and the Biden years, when South Dakota’s budget benefited from pandemic aid and stimulus funding. Lawmakers set aside enough money during those years that they should be able to build a men’s prison without taking on any debt, if they approve the plan during a Sept. 23 special legislative session. The new prison — which would be built on undeveloped land in northeast Sioux Falls — would replace the oldest parts of the pre-statehood penitentiary.
The lawmaker who asked Seeley for a ballpark estimate on the Capitol project is state Senate President Pro Tempore Chris Karr, a Republican from Sioux Falls. 
“That number itself is a tremendously huge number,” Karr said afterward in an interview with South Dakota Searchlight. “I look forward to getting some more data and facts.”
No savings have been set aside yet for a full Capitol restoration. But lawmakers have provided about $12 million in the last six years to study problems afflicting the Capitol, along with its lake and its grounds, and to make temporary repairs while planning for a larger project. 
Lake studied
So far, that work has included studying the condition of the 115-year-old, 1,300-feet-deep well feeding Capitol Lake. The well formerly produced natural gas in addition to water, and for many years the gas was lit to create a flaming fountain. The gas flow began to diminish about 20 years ago and can no longer sustain a flame.

A study in 2019 determined that the well could be compromised, and that a collapse could cause an uncontrolled flow of water to surface wherever it finds a pathway. A follow-up study that included sending a camera down the well determined it was in better shape than originally feared, and “a new water source for Capitol Lake is not the emergency that we had been led to believe,” Seeley told lawmakers. 
Discussion continues about a replacement water source, but it’s been pushed down the priority list. Meanwhile, the lake has been dredged.
Roof repaired
The Capitol’s roof was repaired recently, although not without problems. Lawmakers learned Tuesday that while the roof was undergoing work, heavy rains in May and June leaked into the technology equipment closets that serve the House of Representatives chamber. 
About $185,000 of damage was done, which will hopefully be covered by insurance. It’s unlikely new equipment will be in place by next month’s special session, meaning some House members’ voting buttons might not work, and the electronic display for voting results might be inoperable. The Legislative Research Council is preparing workarounds.
Plaster repair, rotunda restoration
The next project targets numerous areas of damaged plaster for repair, which Seeley hopes to finish before the start of the annual legislative session in January.
“We’re going to make it look right in the short run, in places where it’s the worst today,” he said.

After that, Seeley plans a rotunda restoration to begin after the 2026 legislative session and be completed by the 2027 session. A company specializing in historic restoration will try to recapture the rotunda’s original beauty, which Seeley said is dimmed by aging paint and plaster, and poor lighting.
While all of that is happening, Seeley hopes to work with the Capitol Complex Restoration and Beautification Commission — a bipartisan group of seven people appointed by the governor — on a full restoration plan. The last full restoration was completed for the 1989 statehood centennial celebration, he said. 
The needs are many. Nearly every communication system that’s ever been installed in the Capitol is still in the building. The steam heating system needs a replacement. Some of the plumbing is more than 100 years old. Roof drains that run inside the walls need attention.
There was no discussion Tuesday about how to pay for it all. Karr said that discussion should start soon.

Lindsey Papasian is a reporter with the Community News Service, part of the University of Vermont’s Reporting & Documentary Storytelling program.
NEW HAVEN — Hyla Howe trudged through the high grass. She scanned the ground and took note: red clover, sedge, canary reed. Each plant said something about whether the field would be a good spot for bobolinks. 
Suddenly came a wave of R2-D2 chirps as 40 or more the birds were flushed from their positions in the grass, swirling through the air singing. 
“This is amazing!” Howe said.
The birds looked like dots dancing overhead. The fledglings were easy to spot in their clumsier flight patterns, and with binoculars, the adult males were clear in their distinctive black and white plumage, the adult females sporting brown feathers with yellow breasts.  
After a few transects of the field, it was time to go back to the landowner to tell them the good news: The birds had successfully nested, and it was safe to mow.
That’s a day in the life of Howe, hired this year as the first outreach coordinator for the Boboblink Project, an effort run by Mass Audubon, Audubon Vermont and New Hampshire Audubon. She works for the Massachusetts outfit specifically.
Grassland birds like the bobolink are declining faster than any other group of birds in New England. In the last 50 years, over 75% of the species have seen population losses. Some of the worst hit are bobolinks and eastern meadowlarks, two of 10 species of grassland birds in Vermont. They build their nests on the ground, which makes them vulnerable to haying and mowing in fields. 
The Bobolink Project pays the owners of these fields, often farmers, to conduct or pay for bird-friendly management practices. The birds get time and habitat to nest while the landowners get some compensation for letting them do so.

The money to pay participating landowners comes from private donations.
“You don’t think of wildlife as an agricultural product until you remove native prairie, then you kind of have to think about wildlife as an agricultural product,” said Howe. “Essentially, the landowners are raising grassland birds.”
On Howe’s early morning visit to New Haven, landowner Steve Shores was thrilled to hear about the successful nests.
“I am glad you are seeing birds in these fields,” Shores said.
After a catch-up about the farm, life and all its changes, Howe and Shores said goodbye until next year, when she’ll come back to check on the field again.
Every current or prospective piece of land in the project needs to be surveyed yearly. 
To be a part of the effort, farmers must alter their haying processes. 
That’s done by either delaying the first cut of the season — no disturbance in the field until after July 15 — or delaying a second cut — no disturbance in the field between May 20 and July 24. The delays allow enough time for grassland birds to nest safely.
The birds need enough space as well as enough cover to protect their hatchlings until they are able to fly. 
To get their population estimates, scientists have been out surveying fields, which includes analyzing vegetation and counting female birds to estimate the number of nests in the area using a formula created by Allan Strong, a University of Vermont professor who directs the school’s wildlife and fisheries biology program. 
The biggest driver of grassland bird declines has been changes in land use.

The first major land-use transformation affecting grassland bird populations in Vermont today was the demise of sheep farming starting in the 19th century. 
Vermont’s sheep boom started in 1811 and lasted until the middle of the century. By 1840 there were over a million sheep in the state, requiring an enormous amount of pasture.
Two hundred years later, the landscape of Vermont is nearly 80% forest: Many of the sheep farms were left to fallow and have reforested since. The dairy farms that came in after the sheep craze required less open land — and themselves have declined since. 
When farms go out of business and no one’s around to maintain the fields, shrubs and tree seedlings start to take over.
As trees reemerged in disused land, there were less and less grasslands where birds such as the bobolink could build their nests.
The second land-use factor causing grassland bird decline is the intensified management of fields. 
“Fields are being cut earlier than they used to, more frequently than they used to,” Strong said.
“Bobolinks and meadowlarks don’t really have a chance,” he said.
More than 95% of eastern meadowlarks have disappeared in New England, according to the Vermont Center for Ecostudies, and it’s now a threatened species. Bobolink populations have dropped 60-75% continent-wide.
“There are fields I’m seeing now with fewer and fewer boblinks,” said Margaret Fowle, senior conservationist at the Vermont Audubon.
The Mass Audubon hired Howe to manage the Bobolink Project, do more targeted outreach to farmers and provide more opportunities for education and assistance.
The landowners engaging in the Bobolink Project are excited to help conserve the birds while also getting some money for their participation.
“They pay me not to mow, and I don’t mow anyway, so why not get a little money and save the birds?” said Shores, the New Haven farmer.
He was contacted by the project to consider entering his field into conservation.
Marilyn Marks, a prospective participant who lives down the road from Shores, said she wishes the state would provide landowners a tax credit for maintaining their fields for conservation — expanding a current credit system that cuts rates for land deemed for agricultural use.

The effort is not without drawbacks. Delayed cutting of fields could allow invasive plant species to seed.
According to Fowle, invasives such as poison parsnip, bedstraw and spotted knackweed have been moving into these grasslands.
“Fields abandoned, left to fallow, will over time become meadows and then forest in Vermont. It’s a common misconception that fields should be left completely alone,” said Howe
Kevin Tolan, staff biologist at Vermont Center for Ecostudies, sees it as a catch-22. “Can’t cut too much because it’ll destroy their nests,” he said. “Otherwise, if you let the invasives seed, they can take over.”
Howe, as the outreach coordinator responsible for surveying the fields, has been spending the season so far meeting with farmers and landowners and checking the viability of their fields for nests.
Viability of the fields is checked by a few different measures. When walking through the fields, Howe takes note of vegetation, management practices and looks out for birds. 
The vegetation is important to pay attention to since it can reveal habitat quality. For example, an overabundance of sedges indicates that the field may be too wet for bobolinks to nest on the ground. 
And if grass is not dense enough, it puts the bird nests at risk for predation.
Howe thinks of grassland systems in a similar way to forests, with canopies, understories and overstories. The arrangement of cover needs to be right for bobolinks and their hatchlings to succeed.
“It’s like an interesting puzzle,” she said.

(Natalie Behring/Getty Images)As conservative lawmakers work to restrict online access to abortion medication, a new report shows how popular it has become for women who live in states that have outlawed abortion.
Researchers from the University of Texas at Austin led a team that analyzed 15 months of prescription data from Aid Access, one of the largest online abortion telemedicine providers.
They found 84% of Aid Access’s more than 118,000 online prescriptions went to patients living in abortion-ban states.
The South and Midwest had the highest rates of patients accessing telemedicine abortion. Rates were also greater in high-poverty areas or where people would have to travel more than 100 miles to reach an abortion clinic, according to the report, which published this month.
Aid Access is able to mail abortion medications to residents in all 50 states — even those in states with abortion bans — thanks to shield laws in Democratic-led states. Shield laws are designed to minimize the legal risks for people who provide or access abortions across state lines.
Currently, 22 states and Washington, D.C., have reproductive care shield laws, either through legislation or by executive order, according to a report from University of California, Los Angeles School of Law.
Eight of those states — California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington — specifically protect telehealth abortion providers regardless of where their patient is located.
Idaho is losing OB-GYNs. Doctors who remain are trying to shoulder the extra burdens.

Shield laws, along with difficulty accessing in-person abortion services in abortion-ban states, have contributed to a rise in medication and telehealth abortions since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the federal right to abortion in 2022, clearing the way for state bans. With telehealth abortion, patients have a virtual appointment with a clinician who can prescribe abortion medication, which is then filled by a licensed pharmacy and mailed to the patient.
Research has shown telehealth medication abortion is effective and safe, and comparable to in-person medication abortion.
Medication abortion accounted for nearly two-thirds of all clinician-provided abortions in states without bans in 2023, the most recent data available from the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization focused on advancing reproductive rights.
But as abortion medication use rises, so have conservative efforts to ban it.
This year, more than a dozen states introduced bills to bar access to medication abortion by criminalizing its sale, purchase or distribution, according to Guttmacher.
One such bill in Texas, which could have been a blueprint for medication abortion restriction in other states, was specifically aimed at groups like Aid Access. It would have allowed private citizens to sue for at least $100,000 anyone who provided abortion pills in Texas. The bill passed the Texas Senate but died in the House in May.
Earlier this year, the state of Louisiana criminally charged a New York physician under its abortion ban law for allegedly providing abortion pills to a Louisiana teen via telehealth. New York, which passed a shield law in 2023, refused Louisiana’s request to extradite the doctor.
Last month marked the first federal test of shield laws, when a Texas man sued a California doctor for allegedly mailing abortion pills to his partner.
This week, a Texas woman filed a federal lawsuit against Aid Access and against a man who she said impregnated her, then spiked her drink with abortion pills. She is also suing the Dutch doctor who founded Aid Access, alleging Aid Access and its founder mailed abortion-inducing drugs in violation of Texas and federal law.

But Democratic critics and data experts warn it could allow the federal government to vacuum up vast quantities of information on Americans for unclear purposes.
Some Democratic election officials and opponents of the effort fear President Donald Trump wants to build a federal database of voters to target political opponents or cherry-pick rare examples of noncitizen voters to fuel a sense of crisis. Republican election officials allied with the president counter that he’s helping states to maintain accurate voter rolls.
The Trump administration has rolled out changes to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, tool at the same time the U.S. Department of Justice is asking states for copies of their voter rolls. The timing, combined with questions about what happens to voter data uploaded to the program, has alarmed critics.
Trump wants Congress to pass a national proof of citizenship voter registration requirement and in March tried to unilaterally impose one for federal elections through executive order. But with the legislation stalled and the order halted by the courts, the citizenship data tool may offer a backdoor way to accomplish the same goal.
SAVE was originally intended to help state and local officials verify the immigration status of individual noncitizens seeking government benefits. But U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, this spring refashioned it into a platform that can scan states’ voter rolls if election officials upload the data.

The changes to SAVE, rolled out over just a few months and with little public debate, are “tinkering with sort of the bones of democracy,” said John Davisson, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington, D.C.-based research and advocacy group that argues privacy is a fundamental right.
“You’re talking about the voting process and who will be eligible to vote,” Davisson said. “And to take a system that is not designed for use in that process and repurpose it, really on the fly, without a formal comment process, without formal rulemaking, without congressional intervention — that’s pretty anomalous and pretty alarming.”
Previously, SAVE could only search one name at a time. Now it can conduct bulk searches, allowing state officials to potentially feed into it information on millions of registered voters. SAVE checks that information against a series of federal databases and reports back whether it can verify someone’s immigration status.
Since May, it also can draw upon Social Security data, transforming the program into a tool that can confirm citizenship because Social Security records for many, but not all, Americans include the information. NPR reported earlier on changes to SAVE.
“It is incredible what has been done, really since March,” Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray, a Republican who supports proof of citizenship requirements and the SAVE tool, told a gathering of state secretaries of state in Biloxi, Mississippi, last week.
Individuals registering to vote in federal elections must already sign a statement affirming they are citizens under penalty of perjury, and those who cast a ballot face criminal penalties and deportation. One study of the 2016 election placed the prevalence of noncitizen voting at 0.0001% of votes cast.
But as Trump has spread falsehoods about elections, Republicans have made purging noncitizens from voter rolls a central focus.

Democratic concerns were on display last week at the National Association of Secretaries of State conference, held at the Beau Rivage casino-resort in Biloxi. In interviews on the sidelines of the conference, Democratic secretaries of state voiced deep reservations — or outright opposition — about plugging their voter data into SAVE.
Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said Aug. 6 that the federal government appeared to be trying to take over election administration. She formally rejected the Justice Department’s voter roll request two days later.
Bellows said the Department of Homeland Security told her in a recent phone call that it planned to retain SAVE data for 10 years for “audit purposes only.”
“Just like the [Justice Department] is asking us to hand over an electronic file of all the voters in our state, it seems like the Department of Homeland Security is through this backdoor system also asking us to share voter information about every voter in our state,” Bellows said.
At least one state appears to have granted the federal government sweeping authority over any voter data it provides to SAVE.
Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales announced in July he had reached an agreement with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to access the newly expanded system for voter list maintenance. Indiana’s agreement allows the federal agency to use information the state provides for any purpose permitted by law, including criminal prosecutions.
Morales, a Republican, said in a news release that SAVE represented “another step in safeguarding the rights” of eligible voters. His office didn’t respond to Stateline’s questions.
The Trump administration has ramped up efforts to encourage state election officials to use the expanded program. The White House hosted a bipartisan “fly in” event for state secretaries of state on July 29. Multiple secretaries of state told Stateline that USCIS Director Joseph Edlow, who was confirmed on July 15, spoke at the event.
“The president is very much keyed in on voter list maintenance,” Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, a Republican, said in an interview — echoing other GOP secretaries of state who released statements praising the Trump administration after the meeting.










When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances.


– Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon


Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, a Democrat who attended the meeting, said he questioned how the federal government would handle voter information provided to SAVE. He added that the Justice Department’s request for his state’s voter rolls raised his level of concern about how data would be used.
“When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances,” Simon told Stateline.
The White House referred questions about SAVE and the event to the Department of Homeland Security and USCIS.
In response to questions from Stateline, USCIS didn’t directly answer whether the agency would share voter roll data with other parts of the federal government but confirmed it disposes of records after 10 years.
“The SAVE application is a critical tool for state and local governments to access information to safeguard the integrity of elections across the country. It’s no wonder many states have quickly adopted it, and we continue to promote the tool to other states and counties not using SAVE,” USCIS spokesperson Matthew Tragesser said in a statement.
“We look forward to continued optimization efforts and implementing more updates to SAVE.”
GOP pressure
Some Republican election officials and Trump allies have long wanted the federal government to take an expanded role in searching state voter rolls for noncitizens.
Last summer the Trump-aligned litigation group America First Legal, co-founded by Trump adviser Stephen Miller, encouraged states to submit to the Department of Homeland Security the names of individuals for citizenship or immigration status verification.
Some states did just that. Texas, for example, asked USCIS to verify the citizenship of some voters in September, and Indiana asked the agency to verify 585,774 voters in October. The same month, 16 Republican state attorneys general signed a letter criticizing Homeland Security, then under the Biden administration, for failing to work with states on verification.

After Trump took office, GOP state officials kept up the pressure. Twenty-one Republican secretaries of state urged Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in February to prioritize SAVE improvements.
On April 16, Indiana sued the department in federal court for not responding to its verification request last fall. USCIS announced an overhaul of SAVE less than a week later.
As the agency continues to remake SAVE, the tool will soon allow searches using the last four digits of a Social Security number, multiple state secretaries of state told Stateline. The agency confirmed the feature is under development and will be available soon but didn’t provide an exact date.
The change would mark another significant expansion of the program because most states collect the last four digits when individuals without a driver’s license register to vote.
Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican, said SAVE represents a better way to verify citizenship than a state law requiring voters to produce documents. “I think there’s a real opportunity for us to do a lot of this through just sharing of information and I think that’s what we’re seeing happen,” McGrane said in an interview.
Unreliable data?
But some voting rights advocates and experts on government data caution against an overreliance on Social Security data.
The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, a progressive policy nonprofit, has noted that Social Security only began tracking the citizenship status of all applicants in 1978 — meaning the database doesn’t include comprehensive citizenship information for older Americans. Additionally, Social Security may not always have up-to-date information on the status of naturalized U.S. citizens.
The nonpartisan Institute for Responsive Government also warned in May that since SAVE hasn’t used Social Security numbers to verify citizenship in the past, its accuracy and effectiveness are unknown. The success of the expanded SAVE program may also partially depend on whether it has adequate staff and resources, it said.
 

A 2017 Government Accountability Office report found that between fiscal years 2012 and 2016, about 16% of the nearly 90 million SAVE searches required additional verification, which the institute says often translates into federal workers manually checking files. Now that SAVE allows bulk searches, the need for manual checking could rise dramatically.
Nick Doctor, director of implementation at the Institute for Responsive Government, said in an interview that a tool confirming the eligibility of registered voters in a way that doesn’t burden individuals can be a good thing. But he emphasized that it depends in large measure on SAVE’s implementation.
“The changes that have been made to SAVE happened very quickly and, to my knowledge, we haven’t seen releases on the level of accuracy of that information,” Doctor said.
During interviews, Republican secretaries of state stressed that voters aren’t kicked off the rolls because SAVE can’t verify their citizenship. Instead, an inability to verify would likely trigger a follow-up process with the voter.
“Just because we get something back from the SAVE database, it’s not a cut and dry, especially on those they’re not sure about,” Hoskins, the Missouri secretary of state, said.
Still, Arizona illustrates why some Democrats worry about any large-scale effort to ask voters — especially longtime, older residents — to prove their citizenship. After the state discovered errors in how it tracked voter citizenship dating back years, election officials are contacting some 200,000 voters seeking proof of citizenship documentation.
Some have been casting ballots for decades without incident and many feel targeted, Arizona Democratic Secretary of State Adrian Fontes said during a presentation at the state secretaries of state conference. “They feel insulted when they get that letter,” Fontes said.










There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside.


– Charles Stewart III, MIT political scientists


Charles Stewart III, a professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies elections, said Arizona may actually point to the potential usefulness of SAVE. If Arizona runs its voter roll through the program, a list of 200,000 voters needing citizenship verification would perhaps drop into the hundreds, he suggested.
“There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside,” Stewart said.
Connecticut Democratic Secretary of State Stephanie Thomas told Stateline that every secretary wants tools to keep voter lists as clean as possible. But the details are important.
When she hears of something new, Thomas said she asks whether it’s the best option available and whether “the i’s are dotted, the t’s crossed.” She said she’s asked USCIS a series of questions about SAVE and is waiting on some responses.
“When it comes to voter lists,” Thomas said, “I don’t want Connecticut voters to be a guinea pig.”

The Trump administration and Harvard University are reportedly close to reaching a settlement that would require Harvard to pay US$500 million in exchange for the government releasing frozen federal funding and ending an investigation into antisemitism on campus.
This follows similar deals the White House struck with Columbia University and Brown University in July 2025. Both of those universities agreed to undertake campus reforms and pay a large sum – more than $200 million in the case of Columbia and $50 million for Brown – in order to receive federal funding that the Trump administration was withholding. The White House originally froze funding after saying that these universities had created unsafe environments for Jewish students during Palestinian rights protests on campus in 2024.
As a scholar of higher education politics, I examined the various deals the Trump administration made with some universities. When Harvard announces its deal, it will be informative to see what is different – or the same.
I believe the Columbia and Brown deals can be used as a blueprint for Trump’s plans for higher education. They show how the government wants to drive cultural reform on campus by giving the government more oversight over universities and imposing punishments for what it sees as previous wrongdoing.
Here are four key things to understand about the deals:
1. Antisemitism isn’t a major feature of the agreements
The Trump White House accused Brown and Columbia of tolerating antisemitism during campus protests. But the administration neither followed federal standards for investigating antisemitism, nor did it dictate specific reforms to protect Jewish students.
Ahead of its deal, Columbia in March 2025 adopted a new, broader definition of antisemitism that was created by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance. The United Nations and most European Union countries also use this definition.
Yet the school’s 22-page deal mentions antisemitism only once, where it says Columbia is required to hire an additional staff member to support Jewish students’ welfare.
Brown’s deal, meanwhile, did not involve the university adopting a particular definition of antisemitism. But Brown did commit to offering “research and education about Israel, and a robust Program in Judaic Studies.” Brown already hosts a Judaic Studies program, and it is unclear from the agreement’s text what additional measures are required.
The deals also extend well beyond antisemitism concerns and into questions of gender and the composition of student bodies.
Columbia agreed to provide “single-sex” housing and sports facilities, for example. The university has an optional Open Housing program that allows mixed-gender roommates and several gender-neutral restrooms.
This places the school in line with Donald Trump’s January executive order that says a person’s gender is based on their sex as assigned at birth.
Brown’s deal also requires single-sex sports and housing facilities. In addition, Brown committed to using definitions of men and women that match Trump’s executive order.
Columbia, which enrolls about 40% of its students from other countries, also agreed to “decrease financial dependence on international student enrollment.”
The Brown deal says nothing about international education.
2. Both deals are expensive but vague about financial details.
Columbia must pay a fine of more than $200 million to the federal government, while Brown will make $50 million in donations to Rhode Island workforce development programs.
In both cases, it is not clear where the money will go or how it will be used.
Congress passed The Clery Act in 1990, creating a legal framework for fining campuses that failed to protect students’ safety.
Since then, the government has reached different settlements with universities.
Liberty University, in Lynchburg, Virginia, was required to pay the federal government $14 million in 2024, for example, for failing to investigate sexual assault allegations.
But Columbia’s payment is far larger than any previous university and government settlement. Columbia will make three payments of about $66 million into the Treasury Department over three years, according to The Chronicle of Higher Education. But it isn’t clear how the money will exactly be spent and what will happen after those three years, The Chronicle of Higher Education reported in August 2025.
Only Congress can legally decide how to spend Treasury Department funds. But Trump has ignored Congress’ appropriation directives on a number of occasions.
Brown, meanwhile, will not pay the government anything. Instead, its deal will go “to state workforce development organizations operating in compliance with anti-discrimination laws, over the ten years.”
The Brown deal doesn’t say what qualifies as qualified workforce development organizations.
3. Trump wants to influence university admissions.
While the Brown and Columbia deals have several differences, the agreements have nearly identical language giving the Trump administration oversight of the way they admit students.
The deals say that the universities must provide the government with detailed information about who applied to the schools and was admitted, broken down by grades and test scores, as well as race and ethnicity. The government could then conduct a “comprehensive audit” of the schools, based on this information.
This information could also be used to determine if universities are showing a preferences for students of color. Without providing evidence, conservative activists have alleged that selective colleges discriminate against white people and that this is a violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
Experts have said that these reporting requirements appear to be intended to increase the number of white students admitted to Ivy League schools.
4. The deals could open more doors to federal intrusion.
Claire Shipman, Columbia’s acting president, said in July that the deal would allow the university’s “research partnership with the federal government to get back on track.”
Christina Paxson, Brown’s president, also defended the agreement in a statement, writing that it “enables us as a community to move forward after a period of considerable uncertainty in a way that ensures Brown will continue to be the Brown that our students, faculty, staff, alumni, parents and friends have known for generations.”
But the deals could invite more scrutiny from the federal government.
Both deals spell out the government’s right to open new investigations against Brown and Columbia, or to reopen old complaints if the administration is not satisfied with how the universities are implementing the agreement.
Trump is now pressuring Harvard, UCLA and other universities to strike deals, also based on similar antisemitism allegations.
The White House announced on Aug. 8 that it could seize the research patents, worth hundreds of millions of dollars, that Harvard holds. Since 1980, universities have been able to legally hold, and profit from, patents resulting from federally funded research.
The federal government has long influenced higher education through funding and regulation. But the government has never tried to dictate what happens on campus before now.
Higher education experts like me believe that political goals now drive the way the government approaches higher education. Some of Trump’s conservative allies are now urging the president to go even further, saying “we have every right to renegotiate the terms of the compact with the universities.”
Given these and other pressure tactics, academics who study the law and government warn that the university deals indicate encroaching authoritarianism.

Brad Little gives a press conference after delivering his annual State of the State address on Jan. 6, 2025, in the Lincoln Auditorium in the Idaho Capitol. (Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)On July 24 at Gov. Brad Little’s “Capital for a Day” event in Orofino, Idaho, about 25-30 participants including myself, mostly from Clearwater County, held a peaceful demonstration at the park in Orofino with signs showing our support for public schools, public lands, affordable health care, rural hospitals and our concerns about several other Idaho issues.
The governor began the event, held at the Best Western Lodge, by stating that he and his staff had come specifically to talk with Orofino residents, and asked those from other counties to refrain from asking questions. The attendees at the conference honored his request, and residents of Orofino, including myself, took the opportunity to express our concerns and questions.
I, and many other participants at the event, are extremely concerned about public education funding. We specifically oppose tax credits for private and religious school tuition and believe this issue is non-partisan in our rural communities where our public schools are so important. 
When I was given the opportunity to ask the governor about this topic, about 20 audience members stood up with me, holding up signs saying “Not a Dollar More” while others clapped. I reminded the governor that he had asked Idahoans to call and tell him whether to sign or veto bill House Bill 93, the tax credit bill, to use $50 million to fund private schools. The vast majority, 86% of the 32,366 callers, asked him to veto it, yet he signed the bill anyway. 
I also stated that “although the amount is capped at $50 million for 2026, in 2027  and beyond the annual cost could increase to nearly $339 million based on legislative action. These funds will go to private schools that can discriminate against students they do not have to accept, can ignore State Board of Education curriculum guidelines and state requirements for educator and administrator qualifications, and have no accountability to the public.”
My question for the governor was, “If the Idaho Legislature passes a bill to increase the amount of this tax credit, will you sign it?”
He started answering by saying, “I stated that I would sign the bill,” and began alluding to various factors that could affect his decision in the future.
Due to the commotion in the room, it was difficult to hear the governor’s response. I asked him again, “If the Legislature votes to increase the tax credit program next year, will you sign the bill?” The governor never did give me a definitive yes or no answer.
During the rest of the session, other participants brought up additional topics of concern in our state such as: lack of women’s health care and mental health professionals; problems with corporations buying privately owned trailer rental developments and doubling rental rates; new caregiver regulations that make it harder for parents and families with special needs loved ones to find caregivers; the poor condition of forest roads; questioning wildfire tactics and strategies; why local firefighters wouldn’t know about federal funding until October and more. 
Gov. Little, at times, came off as lacking compassion and sincerity in his responses to the questioners. He told one woman that the reason that it was hard to find good health care in Idaho, i.e. gynecologists and obstetricians, was because it wasn’t profitable for them to operate their businesses here. He did not appear to acknowledge the true reasons doctors are fleeing the state and new doctors are not coming here, making it more difficult for all women to get quality health care in Idaho.
A study published Thursday, by JAMA Network One, a division of the Journal of American Medical Association, reported that Idaho lost 35% of its doctors that practiced obstetrics. In total Idaho lost 94 of those doctors, out of 268, between August 2022 and December 2024, the study found. 
“These results provide a stark picture of a rapidly declining maternal health workforce in our state,” the study’s lead author, Dr. Edward Mceachern, stated.
The abortion ban in Idaho went into effect in 2022. Some OB-GYNs, including maternal-fetal medicine specialists, said publicly that they were leaving due to the ban. 
This study’s results, and the previous statements by medical experts, soundly contradict the governor’s response regarding women’s health care in Idaho.
Several other county residents stood and complained about the poor road conditions and near-impossible access into northern Clearwater County. The governor replied that the people that lived there knew that they were moving onto a dusty road, which to my ears, and many others, sounded like the timber industries’ operations and desires take priority over the citizens’ needs.
Giving priority to the wants and desires of big businesses, and other significant contributors to the state’s income revenue, appears to be more important to the governor than solving his constituents’ problems.
I am quite sure that Idahoans in Clearwater County share many of the same concerns as Idahoans throughout the state. Remember that all Idaho residents can contact Gov. Little (call 208-334-2100 or go to https://gov.idaho.gov/contact-us/) before the next legislative session begins.

Kennedy Jr., the secretary of Health and Human Services, testifies during his Senate Finance Committee confirmation hearing at the Dirksen Senate Office Building on Jan. 29, 2025, in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)It’s August, and parents and caregivers are frantically preparing their kids for a new school year by buying supplies, filling out forms and meeting teachers. This year, many parents also face a question that’s more complicated than usual: Should my child get an updated COVID-19 vaccine, and will I even have that choice? For some, that decision may have already been made by chaotic federal policy, just as COVID-19 cases are rising nationwide.
As a pediatrician and researcher who studies vaccine delivery and health policy, I am hearing uncertainty from both parents and health care providers. If that describes you, you are not alone. A poll published Aug. 1, 2025, by the health policy organization KFF found half of parents are unsure whether federal health agencies are recommending COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children this fall.
The process that normally provides clear, consistent recommendations and ensures availability for vaccines before respiratory virus season has been upended, and this year’s COVID-19 vaccine guidance for children is a prime example.
 
How the process typically works
For over two decades, there was a predictable, well-coordinated process to ensure recommended seasonal vaccines, such as the flu shot, were available for anyone who wanted them by early fall. In recent years, COVID-19 vaccines have been incorporated into this same annual cycle.
Beginning in February, the Food and Drug Administration, including its independent committee of experts, reviewed data and approved the optimal formulation. After FDA approval, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, an independent panel of experts that advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, reviewed the evidence in public meetings and issued clear recommendations.
Manufacturers then scaled up production; insurers confirmed coverage, which is tied to the advisory committee’s recommendations; and doses were distributed nationwide so vaccines would be available in clinics and pharmacies before the leaves started turning. This usual series of steps ensured that guidance incorporated input from scientists, epidemiologists, public health experts, clinicians, manufacturers, insurers and consumers. It also fostered trust among health care providers and, in turn, provided parents with clarity and confidence when making decisions
 
What’s different this year

	
Since Robert F. Kennedy Jr. took over as secretary of Health and Human Services in February 2025, that usual, tightly choreographed dance has become a chaotic scramble marked by uncertainty and a lack of transparency. Decisions about vaccine guidance have been made through internal channels without the same level of public discussion, review of the evidence or broad stakeholder input.
In May 2025, Kennedy and FDA leadership bypassed the agency’s independent review committee and announced that some COVID-19 vaccines would be approved only for children with high-risk conditions. One formulation has yet to be FDA-approved for children at all. The secretary first announced updated recommendations for children on X, stating COVID-19 vaccines would no longer be recommended for healthy children. Shortly after, the CDC posted guidelines that differed from that announcement and said healthy children “may” receive them. Meanwhile, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices was disbanded by Kennedy and replaced with a smaller, hand-picked panel that operates with less transparency and has yet to weigh in on COVID-19 vaccines for children.
Public messaging has added to the confusion. Statements from newly appointed federal health leaders have questioned the safety of COVID-19 vaccines and the long-standing processes for ensuring their safety. Funding for mRNA technology, which supports several COVID-19 vaccines and is being explored for use against other diseases and even some cancers, has been cut. And many of the claims used to justify these actions have been challenged by experts as inaccurate or misleading.
 
What this means for parents
For parents, the result is uncertainty about whether their children should be vaccinated, when and where the vaccines will be available, whether insurance will cover them, or whether their choice has effectively been made for them by newly appointed health leaders operating outside the guardrails of the normal vetting process. This uncertainty comes at a time when the uptake of COVID-19 vaccines in children is already lower than that of other routine vaccines.

Currently, CDC guidelines say healthy children six months and older “may” receive a COVID-19 vaccine based on shared decision-making with their health care provider. The CDC recommends that children who are moderately or severely immunocompromised receive it. These guidelines differ from FDA approvals and Kennedy’s guidelines announced on X, and they have not been reviewed or voted on in an advisory committee on immunization practices meeting.
Parents can start by talking with their child’s pediatrician about benefits and potential risks, confirming eligibility and checking on insurance coverage. Pediatricians welcome parents’ questions and work tirelessly to provide answers grounded in the best available evidence so families can make truly informed decisions about their child’s health.
In some cases, unfortunately, even if parents want the vaccine and their pediatrician agrees, they may not be able to get it due to any number of factors, including local supply shortages, lack of insurance coverage, policies that prevent administration by pharmacists and other health providers without clear federal guidance, or an unwillingness of providers to give it “off-label,” meaning in a way that differs from the FDA’s official approval. For those parents, their decision has been made for them.
 
Reducing risks in other ways
Whether or not a child receives an updated COVID-19 vaccine, parents can still take steps to reduce illness, including keeping children home when sick, teaching them cough-and-sneeze hygiene and encouraging frequent hand-washing. The CDC provides national and state data on seasonal respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19, while local public health websites often offer community-level information.
Parents should also remember that the COVID-19 vaccine is not the only thing to consider before school starts. Routine immunizations such as those for measles, mumps and rubella, known as the MMR vaccine; diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis, called DTaP; and influenza are essential for keeping kids healthy and in school. These are widely available for now. This is particularly important, as this year the United States has experienced the highest number of measles cases in decades.
Uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 vaccine recommendations, and potentially other vaccines, may worsen in the coming weeks and months. It is possible parents will continue to see shifting guidance, conflicting statements from federal agencies and reduced access to vaccines in their communities.
In this chaotic environment, parents can look to trusted sources such as their pediatrician or organizations such as the American Academy of Pediatrics, which will continue to provide independent, evidence-based vaccine guidance.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-16 04:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Curtailing plastic use can help you and the environment,Judy Benson,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/16/curtailing-plastic-use-you-can-help-yourself-and-the-ct-environment/,"Plastic is being found seemingly everywhere in our environment—even our bodies—as a persistent, accumulating toxin, with carcinogens and other hazards.","Breaking a habit is hard, especially when it involves something as ever-present as plastic.
But as Connecticut Sea Grant, Save the Sound and other partners launch our ninth annual monthlong #DontTrashLISound campaign today with a cleanup at Long Wharf Drive in New Haven, the focus is once again raising awareness about the increasing dangers of plastic. It’s being found seemingly everywhere in our environment—even our bodies—as a persistent, accumulating toxin, with carcinogens and other hazards.
“Some estimate that we ingest something like a credit card’s worth of plastic into our bodies every week,” said Jason White, director of the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station who’s been researching how plastics are getting into the food we eat. “We need to decrease our exposure to plastics and decrease the massive amounts getting into environment.”
Building on the theme for this year’s campaign of “Better than plastic,” we’ll be sharing ideas on social media about everyday alternatives to plastic. By opting for fresh flowers over balloons at celebrations, metal water bottles instead of throwaway plastic ones and reusable mesh bags for produce over fruits and vegetables in plastic packaging, for example, you’ll be acting both in your own and our collective self-interest for a healthier body and planet. Even using plastic cutlery and cups carries the risk of little bits of plastic being consumed, White said, so every time that’s avoided is a step in the right direction.
But as the saying goes, “don’t let the idea of perfection get in the way of the possible.” Plastic, unfortunately, is here to stay, and avoiding it altogether is virtually impossible. Nevertheless, there’s a lot we can do to reduce its presence in our lives.
If you need more convincing about the dangers of plastic, consider White’s recent research project in collaboration with colleagues from Rutgers University and the New Jersey Institute of Technology. Micro- and nano-plastics, he said, are routinely found in agricultural soils and irrigation water. These are the tiny shards that pass through water treatment plants into the public water supply, end up in fertilizers made from treatment plant waste or are shed off sheets of black plastic mulch commonly used on row crops. White and his colleagues wanted to find out whether these toxic particles were getting into the plants we eat, as well as if they were increasing the accumulation of other environmental pollutants.
They grew wheat in plastic-contaminated soil, and lettuce hydroponically in contaminated water. They found that both the wheat and the lettuce not only absorbed the plastic particles but also increased the accumulation of heavy metals such as arsenic, lead and cadmium as well as PFAS and pesticides such as boscalid.
“Whenever plastic is present, you see a significant increase in other contaminants making their way into the food,” he said. “The problem with this is that there are no regulatory standards on plastic particles in food.
“There is an increasing general realization of the need to decrease plastic use,” he continued, “and this is just another strong piece of evidence for that.”
Indeed, massive amounts of plastics are already in the aquatic and terrestrial environment, everywhere from ocean floor sediments to the bodies of seabirds who nest on remote islands. That’s decades worth of plastic that never goes away like a biodegradable paper bag but just keeps breaking up into smaller and smaller pieces.
For the next phase of his research, White and his colleagues plan to focus on remediation strategies.
“We’d like to come up with a way we can keep plastics out of the food supply,” he said.
In the meantime, please do what you can to use less plastic, and join a cleanup in your neighborhood or nearby beach. Sign up here.  
You’ll be doing good for yourself and the environment at the same time.

(Photo by Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)A board that oversees the management of critical forage fish menhaden along the Atlantic coast is looking into further restricting Virginia’s only commercial menhaden reduction fishery.
The Atlantic States Marine Commission’s menhaden management board voted last week to task a workgroup with determining options for spreading out menhaden reduction fishing caps throughout the year to manage the fish populations in the Chesapeake Bay.
Such a move would only affect Ocean Harvesters, which contracts with Omega Protein, based in Reedville, Virginia. It is already under reduction fishing caps of 51,000 metric tons. This fishery reduces the fish into oil and fishmeal.
Smaller fisheries in the bay use the fish for bait. Some sportsfishers and environmentalists believe too many menhaden are being fished from the Chesapeake. One group of anglers recently penned a letter to President Donald Trump urging him to sign an executive order to protect the fish.
The Menhaden Fisheries Coalition, conversely, feels the Virginia reduction fishery has been unfairly blamed for issues in the entire ecosystem that could potentially be attributed to environmental challenges or other causes. But more data is needed to nail down the specific impacts on menhaden in the Chesapeake Bay.
Fewer fish prompts quest for more data
Lynn Fegley of the Maryland Department of Natural Resources introduced the motion to begin exploring further restrictions on Omega Protein. Fegley said a smaller fishery in Maryland is suffering because menhaden are not reaching their shores. She claimed that the population of fish is being accounted for in other parts of the Chesapeake Bay, but they are not seeing enough of them in the upper bay.
“The reduction fisheries’ pressure has been increasing in the middle part of the summer … and potentially leading to a choke point where that biomass of menhaden isn’t making its way into Maryland,” said Will Poston, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation’s forage fish manager. “Maryland’s small-scale commercial fisheries, which are stationary gears, pound nets that have a well-established time series of data.”
Catfish to cat food: A new plan to reduce the Chesapeake Bay’s blue catfish population

Maryland experienced a major fish kill of thousands of mostly juvenile menhaden washing up on shore in the summer of 2024, an incident attributed to low oxygen due to water quality issues.
“We understand that this is a coastwide issue. We understand that things are changing … there is significant effort by a large-scale fishery in the Chesapeake Bay. The fish were there but they were not where we are,” Fegley said.
The Menhaden Fisheries Coalition fired back on allegations their operations are preventing the nutrient-rich fish from reaching farther up the bay to Maryland fisheries, as well as leading to osprey populations decreasing.
“Now, when fishermen report low summer menhaden catch, Maryland frames the pound net fishery as a targeted menhaden fishery under threat from Virginia’s ‘intercept’ fleet — itself an incredible stretch to suggest six menhaden fishing boats ‘blockade’ the lower Chesapeake Bay,” the coalition’s statement read.
Fegley also led an effort last year to look into “precautionary management” methods. A workgroup compiled a list of ideas on how to manage the concerns around the menhaden populations but frequently mentioned the need for more data.
The commission’s stock report of menhaden accepted in 2022 for all of the Atlantic Coast states that menhaden are not overfished. But some environmentalists believe that the Chesapeake Bay populations specifically are in decline and the data is getting lost in the big picture.
“I am not saying this is an intercept fishery. What I am saying is that the conditions are changing in such a way that we are having a real fishery problem in Maryland. This is not just about Maryland, it is about an ecosystem that supports the coast,” Fegley said.
Due to the drop in striped bass and osprey populations that rely on the forage fish to survive, conservationists are eager to find a solution. The U.S. Geological Survey presented to the board last summer about the osprey decline.
“Their findings suggested that while the Chesapeake Bay osprey decline was real, it likely stemmed from a complex array of ecological stressors, not simply the availability of menhaden. In fact, USGS explicitly did not attribute osprey declines to menhaden harvest pressure,” the Menhaden Fisheries Coalition said in a statement.
Commercial fishing yields of menhaden have also reportedly dropped in recent years, according to Fegley and other board members, leading them to look for any insight into why it is happening. There have been state-level efforts to fund research in the Virginia General Assembly into the bay’s menhaden populations, but those efforts have not been successful.
“The Chesapeake’s fisheries and predators can’t wait. Menhaden are key to a thriving Chesapeake Bay, and a healthy, productive Chesapeake is vital to the entire Atlantic coast,” said Chris Moore, Chesapeake Bay Foundation Virginia Executive Director. “We appreciate the efforts of those on the ASMFC menhaden management board who have worked to keep this important issue at the forefront.”

In a response to comments made by Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Ocean Harvest said CBF “omits mention of well-documented water quality issues in Maryland that may also explain the localized fishery observations cited.”
The workgroup will collect data on the possibility of the reduction fishing caps being shifted to different parts of the year, as members of the board shared insight into the menhaden populations showing up in the Chesapeake later in the year. The work group will present its ideas on how to manage the fishery caps at the ASMC winter 2026 board meeting.
The board members said “something is going on” but they aren’t sure why the fish are arriving late and not approaching the shore as much as they used to. Fourteen of the board members voted in favor of the work group, with the representatives from Virginia and New Jersey voting against it.
Some of the members pointed out that there are similar concerns around menhaden yields, striped bass population decline, and osprey decline along the coast outside of the Chesapeake Bay. They want to focus research into the cause and how to protect the fish beyond imposing additional restrictions on the one fishery.
“The only real recourse to ensure the health of the ecosystem is to err on the side of conservation and be more risk averse in how (to) manage this industrial fishery that concentrates so much effort in and around Chesapeake Bay,” Poston said.
The 2024 workgroup made multiple recommendations on how to obtain better data around the menhaden populations, such as seasonal or area closures for menhaden reduction fishing, quota days or periods, restricting some gear usage, or further reducing the menhaden reduction fishing cap.

	“We object to the summit. We object to Putin being on American soil. We object to him being on a military base, specifically a military base that has been at the forefront of defense against Russian and Soviet aggression for 60, 70 years. We want to object to (Ukraine President Volodymyr) Zelenskyy not being invited. Without the victim of Russian aggression, it’s an exercise in carving up somebody else’s territory.”
For Hodes, there is also a personal aspect to his opposition. A West Point classmate, Andrew Webber, died in July 2023 in combat defending Ukraine, he said. “Everything I’m doing here is to honor his memory,” Hodes said.

Justin McGhee, who held a sign that said “Praying for Trump,” said he hoped the summit would be a step toward peace.
“It’s important to support Trump at this time. There’s a lot of stuff going on, a lot of division in the world. And I just think we have to get more united,” he said.
The Anchorage location for the Trump-Putin summit was not that important, McGhee said. “It wouldn’t matter if it was here or in Oklahoma. A good thing might happen,” he said.

The 65-year-old best-selling author, who wrote 17 novels, lost his battle to multiple myeloma, a cancer in which white blood cells begin to grow abnormally in the bone marrow. He had been battling the disease since 1996.
“He gave us great books, and he stayed in Mississippi,” said Lemuria Bookstore owner John Evans. “He wrote about a lot of the wrongs to make people all over the country realize that some people were trying to do right.”
Iles became a supporter of Lemuria long before he ever began writing books, coming first with his father and later on his own, Evans said.
Once on Ernest Hemingway’s birthday, Lemuria had a keg of beer and threw a party.
When Iles arrived, he confessed that he felt “totally at home in this bookstore,” Evans said. “He was just a kid.”
He pursued a career in rock music, but traded it for love and a life of writing novels. His first novel, “Spandau Phoenix,” a 1993 book that involved one of the unsolved mysteries of World War II, became a national success.
Iles soon became a New York Times best-selling author, blending real-life history with his spellbinding tales.
In 2011, he faced his own life-or-death crisis when he was nearly killed in an accident on U.S. 61. His right leg below the knee had to be amputated, but Iles never gave up.
During his convalescence, he began writing a trilogy set in his beloved Natchez based on a Ku Klux Klan group known as the Silver Dollar Group, which was involved in the fatal firebombing of Frank Morris, a Black shoe repairman in Ferriday, Louisiana, in 1964 as well as others.
Iles based one of the characters, Henry Sexton, on real-life investigative reporter Stanley Nelson, who wrote about Morris’ killing and other Klan violence.
Nelson, who died June 5, was flattered that Iles penned such a character, but the journalist confessed that his alter ego “has had a much more adventurous life than me. He is a musician, has a girlfriend and is tech savvy — that’s something I don’t know a damn thing about.”
After he finished the trilogy in 2017, he appeared with Nelson at the Mississippi Book Festival, an event he did his best to champion.
The festival’s executive director, Ellen Rodgers Daniels, greeted Friday’s news with sorrow. “He was such a huge part of the festival,” she said. “I’m heartbroken for [his wife] Caroline and the children.”
Despite his national success, Iles continued to sign books and host events at Lemuria. He held the last of those events at Cathead Distillery in Jackson, where he sat in a wheelchair as he talked about his last novel, “Southern Man,” which author Stephen King called “his latest and best.”

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)President Donald Trump’s high-profile meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin adjourned their brief summit Friday without announcing a breakthrough in negotiations to end Russia’s three-year-old invasion of Ukraine.
“We didn’t get there, but we have a very good chance of getting there,” Trump said after several hours of closed-door negotiations with Putin in Anchorage.
The talks ended sooner than previously expected, indicating that the two leaders may be far apart.
In a pair of brief speeches, the leaders said they were optimistic about improvements in relations between the United States and Russia. Putin said they had reached “an agreement,” according to a provided translation, but neither Putin nor Trump provided any details about what that agreement entails.
Before the meeting, Trump had indicated that he might favor a land exchange between Russia and Ukraine as part of a peace deal. European leaders, including Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said they did not support any deal that would require Ukraine to surrender territory.
“We had an extremely productive meeting, and many points were agreed to,” Trump said Friday without explaining what those points were. “There are just a very few that are left. Some are not that significant. One is probably the most significant, but we have a very good chance of getting there. We didn’t get there, but we have a very good chance of getting there.”
During a planned news conference, Putin spoke for only eight minutes, and Trump, who normally delivers lengthy and meandering remarks, spoke for only four and appeared tired.
Both men then left without taking any questions from a room full of international journalists, an action that stunned and confused attendees.
Many of those journalists, as well as Putin, Trump and officials from both Russia and the United States, traveled thousands of miles to meet at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, a base operated by the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Army in Anchorage, Alaska’s largest city.
Because of the summit’s short notice — Trump announced it on social media just one week ago — the city’s hotel rooms were all but sold out, and rental cars were almost impossible to find.
At the University of Alaska Anchorage, members of the Russian delegation, including journalists, were given cots in curtained-off spaces within Alaska Airlines Arena.
En route to Alaska, Trump told reporters traveling aboard Air Force One that he was “not going to be happy” if there was no ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine by the end of the day, according to news reports.
He said he didn’t know what would make the summit a success and said there was “nothing set in stone.”
As originally announced, Trump and Putin were supposed to meet in a one-on-one meeting Friday morning. That changed to a three-on-three, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump’s Russia envoy, Steve Witkoff, joining Trump.
The change didn’t appear to result in even a temporary ceasefire in Ukraine, whose leaders were not invited to Alaska.
Ahead of the Trump-Putin meeting, disgruntled Alaskans held protests across the state, waving Ukrainian flags and urging the United States to support Ukraine’s fight against Russia.
A smaller counterprotest in support of the president, hosted by Alaska Republicans, took place just as Air Force One landed in Alaska about 11 a.m. Friday morning.
A poll conducted by Alaska Survey Research in advance of the meeting indicated that 86% of Alaskans hold negative views of Vladimir Putin and that Trump’s approval rating has dipped below 50% in Alaska, where voters have chosen Trump in the past three presidential elections.
About 30 minutes after Trump’s arrival, Putin’s plane landed at the Anchorage military base after a stop in Magadan, in the Russian Far East.
Trump disembarked first and greeted Putin with applause and a firm handshake before inviting the Russian leader into the presidential limousine.
Putin’s arrival in the United States represented a kind of diplomatic victory for the Russian leader, who has been indicted by the International Criminal Court and faces arrest if he visits many countries, including most in Europe. The Trump administration opposes the ICC and does not typically enforce its arrest warrants.
Additionally, Trump has declined to impose additional financial and economic sanctions on Russia and Russian officials, something he had pledged to do if Russia did not agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine.
Eric Croft, chair of the Alaska Democratic Party, said in a written statement, “Just as we expected, Trump failed to accomplish anything meaningful by inviting a war criminal to a meeting on American soil without Ukrainian representation at the table. … To be frank, we are disappointed, but not surprised, and we will not back down from applying pressure to Trump to achieve lasting peace in Ukraine.”
On Friday, Putin and Trump, accompanied by aides, talked for at least 2 ½ hours. The content of those discussions was not revealed.
Putin boarded his plane for a return flight about 4 p.m. Trump was scheduled to depart before 6 p.m.
Their original schedule had called for more lengthy discussions, but reporters were called to a news conference sooner than expected.
That appeared to be in line with remarks Trump gave the day before, in the Oval Office.
“I would say that (on Friday), all I want to do is set the table for the next meeting, which should happen shortly,” Trump said on Thursday. “I’d like to see it happen very quickly, very shortly after this meeting. I’d like to see it actually happen in Alaska … because it’s so much easier.”
On Friday, Putin delivered his remarks mostly in Russian but joked in English that maybe next time, they could meet in Moscow.
Trump said he would “get a little heat” if he agreed to that, “but I could see it possibly happening.”
Even without a breakthrough peace deal, Friday’s meeting between the two presidents was a historic one. It was the first time since Ronald Reagan met Pope John Paul II in Fairbanks that an American president had hosted a foreign leader in Alaska.
Before Friday, no Russian leader had ever visited Alaska — a place whose territory nominally belonged to Russia from the 1700s until 1867.

Gov. Mike Dunleavy and the state’s congressional delegation welcomed Trump when he arrived. 
Dunleavy has been a vocal supporter of the Trump administration and called it “a historic day for Alaska,” sharing enthusiasm and praise for the president in interviews ahead of the summit. 
In a video on social media on Friday, Dunleavy said he met briefly with Trump aboard Air Force One, and “talked about a number of things,” he said. “He wants to let Alaska know he loves Alaska. And he’s looking forward to something positive coming out of these talks today.”
Dunleavy said Trump also briefly addressed “rumors that Alaska’s minerals are going to be sold off to the Russians,” or gas or other resources sold off in the negotiations, and “that’s not true,” he said. 
“Again, we’re optimistic that this is the beginning of something good, a just peace,” he said. “But we’re just glad to have him here in Alaska, I think it’s one of his favorite places, to be honest with you.”
While Republican U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan has previously criticized Putin, referring to him as an authoritarian and a dictator, he praised the summit on social media on Friday as a show of strength. 
“Putin is coming to the table because of the threat of serious secondary sanctions,” Sullivan said. “We are in a position of power, bringing him to U.S. soil for peace talks. He sees our military strength, energy dominance, many allies, and a President who knows how to negotiate and make peace.”
Rep. Nick Begich III also expressed general support for Trump on social media Friday, and thanked the president. “In Alaska, we understand well that decisive leadership and bold vision are prerequisites for achieving the great things most would not dare to even attempt. Thank you President Donald J. Trump for pursuing peace, and thank you for choosing Alaska for this historic dialogue. North to the Future.”
Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski strongly condemned Putin and the Russian war on Ukraine, in an interview with Alaska’s News Source on Thursday, calling him a “war criminal.” 
On Friday afternoon, Murkowski said in a post on social media she was “cautiously optimistic” about the summit, and repeated the assertion that nothing can be done without the involvement of Ukraine.
“While the press conference offered few details about their meeting, I’m cautiously optimistic about the signals that some level of progress was made. It was also encouraging to hear both presidents reference future meetings, which I hope will include Ukraine,” Murkowski said. “Ukraine must be part of any negotiated settlement and must freely agree to its terms as we seek an end to the violent, unlawful war being waged against it.”
The Alaska Senate’s Republican-led minority caucus said in a statement Friday they support Trump “in his effort to achieve a fair and lasting peace to the terrible war in Ukraine.”
Senate Minority leader Mike Shower, R-Wasilla – a former service member with the U.S. Air Force – expressed hope for the war to end. 
“As a combat veteran in two conflicts, I understand the costs of war,” he said. “I hope the leaders work in good faith to find a quick end to the senseless bloodshed.”

A panel of the court Friday overturned a key part of Maryland's 2021 tax on digital ads. (Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)A provision in Maryland’s digital ad tax is an unconstitutional restriction on free speech, a federal appeals court ruled Friday.
The 2021 law — the first of its kind in the nation — imposes taxes on large tech companies for the digital ads they sell within the state. But it also prohibits those companies from passing the tax on to consumers as a surcharge, fee or line item on their bills — what a three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals saw as a ban on telling customers about the new added tax.
In a ruling that invoked American protests against the Colonial-era Stamp Act, Circuit Judge Julius Richardson wrote that, as then, “complaining about taxes remains a grand American political tradition.” And the court said Maryland lawmakers went too far by adding language to the tax bill that was intended to shield them from public criticism.
“Perhaps fearing such complaints, Maryland paired its tax with another rule,” Richardson wrote for the court. “Companies that make money advertising on the internet must not only pay the tax, but avoid telling their customers how it affects pricing: No line items, no surcharges, no fees.
“If companies pass on the cost of the tax, they must do so in silence — keeping customers in the dark about why prices have gone up and thereby insulating Maryland from political responsibility,” he wrote.
The ruling reverses a 2024 decision by U.S. District Judge Lydia Kay Griggsby, who agreed with the plaintiffs — a group of tech firms and business associations — that the law created some First Amendment issues. But she let the law stand because the offending provision had “many constitutional applications.”
Friday’s circuit court ruling sent the case back to Griggsby with instructions to determine an appropriate remedy for the plaintiffs.
Comptroller’s Office issues guidance to help businesses brace for 3% ‘tech tax’

The ruling is a blow to officials who looked to the unique tax to help pay for expensive K-12 education reforms contained in the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future. Expenses associated with that law continue to rise and are potentially budget busting — even if the digital ad tax survives the onslaught of legal challenges.
The 2021 law — sponsored by Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) — targets big tech firms including Apple, Meta and Google.
Under the law, companies reporting $100 million of gross global annual revenue are subject to a 2.5% levy. The tax increases in increments of 2.5% to a maximum rate of 10% levied against companies reporting more than $15 billion in gross global revenue.
The state could collect as much as $250 million annually from the digital ad tax, according to a legislative analysis. The funds are earmarked for the education reform program.
Neither Ferguson nor Comptroller Brooke Lierman (D), the defendant in the lawsuit, immediately responded to requests for comment on the ruling Friday.
But plaintiffs welcomed the decision. This case was just one of several challenges brought by NetChoice, a trade group representing large technology and social media companies, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Computer & Communications Industry Association (CCIA).
“The government has no power to silence dissent in America. Maryland tried to prevent criticism of its tax scheme, and the Fourth Circuit recognized that tactic for what it was: censorship,” Paul Taske, co-director of the NetChoice Litigation Center, said in a statement.
“When states enact new policies, they should expect a variety of opinions, and the First Amendment prohibits the government from insulating itself against criticism,” Taske’s statement said. “That does not change when the criticism happens online. The Fourth Circuit was absolutely correct.”
He was echoed by Stephanie Joyce, senior vice president of CCIA and director of its Litigation Center for the Connected Economy. She said in a statement that the court “recognized that this Maryland law strikes at the heart of free speech. States cannot use their taxation authority as a lever to squelch discourse and dissent.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Richardson wrote that the Maryland law allowed tech companies to collect from customers, but not to indicate why or how their bills had gone up. That “pass-through” language “makes plenty of sense if Maryland’s true aim is to prevent companies from identifying who is politically accountable for the tax,” the court wrote.
“Faced with rising prices, consumers will want to know: ‘Why have prices been raised?’ Yet the pass-through ‘prevents [companies] from describing the tax in the one setting where the consumer is guaranteed to look: the invoice,'” the ruling said. “No doubt, Maryland has prudential reasons not to want the question answered. But as all we have said so far should make clear, keeping out of hot water with voters is not among the interests that can justify a speech ban. ”
Meanwhile, big tech firms, including Apple and Meta, took their case to Maryland Tax Court to try to thwart the law. That case remains open.
Last summer, attorneys representing Google and Meta, in an online seminar with the California Tax Foundation, predicted Maryland courts would overturn the law because it violates the federal Internet Tax Freedom Act.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/federalappealscourt-richmond-1024x683-1.jpg,,,2025-08-15 21:56:35.310872

Bob Ferguson has authorized an investigation into the conduct of members of the Washington State Fish and Wildlife Commission after recently revealed public records raised questions about their actions.  Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife Director Kelly Susewind requested the inquiry in a letter to Ferguson earlier this month.  “The governor tak[...],"(National Park Service/Dixon)Gov. Bob Ferguson has authorized an investigation into the conduct of members of the Washington State Fish and Wildlife Commission after recently revealed public records raised questions about their actions. 
Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife Director Kelly Susewind requested the inquiry in a letter to Ferguson earlier this month. 
“The governor takes concerns from an agency director very seriously. The governor has directed Washington State Human Resources to conduct an investigation,” a spokesperson for Ferguson’s office said in an email on Friday. 
In a letter dated Aug. 5 and released by Columbia Insight on Thursday, Susewind said he believed further investigation was warranted due to the content of documents obtained by the Sportsmen’s Alliance in May via public records request. 
Susewind wrote that an independent investigation into the commissioners’ communications, and possibly removing members if they are found to have acted inappropriately, would “demonstrate the standard of accountability necessary to allow WDFW to maintain a level of service that the public expects and deserves.” 
The commission is unable to do its job without the public’s trust, he said, adding, “It is simply not reasonable to expect that level of trust under the cloud of uncertainty created by the current controversy.” 
Sportsmen’s Alliance, an Ohio-based fishing and hunting rights organization, requested emails, texts and other communications of commissioners following their vote in November 2022 to stop recreational hunting of black bears in the spring. The alliance opposed the decision. 
The group filed suit against the commission in January 2025 for allegedly delaying the release of those records for nearly two years. A Thurston County Superior Court judge ruled Friday in favor of the commission, with Sportsmen’s Alliance announcing that same day that it plans to appeal the court’s decision. 
The records were released to Sportsmen’s Alliance in May 2025. After reviewing the records, the group claimed that four commissioners violated state open meeting and public records laws ahead of the vote. Sportsmen’s Alliance soon filed a petition asking for those commissioners — Barbara Baker, John Lehmkuhl, Lorna Smith and Melanie Rowland — to be removed from office. 
The commissioners have reportedly responded to Susewind’s letter by sending separate letters to Ferguson defending their actions ahead of the controversial vote and expressing disappointment in the director for calling for an investigation.
According to Columbia Insight, the commissioners have asked for the governor’s help in leading a broad-based conversation with several state agencies to re-examine the role of the state in natural resource management.
Following Ferguson’s decision to conduct an investigation , several environmentalists and animal rights activists criticized Susewind during public comment at the Fish and Wildlife Commission meeting on Friday in Bellingham.  
In a news release, Dr. Francisco J. Santiago-Ávila, science and advocacy director for Washington Wildlife First, called for Susewind to be removed from office. 
Santiago-Ávila was also among those who spoke at the commission’s meeting. 
In the news release, Santiago-Ávila said he understood why Ferguson believed he needed to pursue an investigation, but said his organization hopes “he will not limit his investigation to the commissioners targeted by the hunting lobby, but will expand it to include the entire commission and, especially, Director Susewind.” 
Others, including hunting advocates, spoke out in favor of an investigation into the commissioners’ conduct and a need for the commission to be more accountable. 
“The recent public disclosure documents leave us with one question above all others: where is the accountability for what is going on here?” said Douglas Boze of the American Bear Foundation. 
The commission has been the subject of much scrutiny in recent years. A report prepared for the state Legislature in December 2024 found the organization’s structure was dysfunctional and needed reform.
The report’s findings sparked legislation in the recent legislative session to change the appointment process and to dissolve the commission altogether. 
Lawmakers did not make a decision regarding the commission’s structure last session, but expressed that they would consider taking action in future sessions. 
In February, Ferguson pulled back two Gov. Jay Inslee administration appointments to the Fish and Wildlife Commission, in response to concerns from “individuals, tribes and other entities expressing a desire for a more extensive process for these appointments.” 
The act was one of Ferguson’s first as governor. 
Meanwhile, the commission’s leadership formally changed Friday, with commissioners unanimously electing outdoor enthusiast Jim Anderson as chair replacing Barbara Baker, who held the post for five years and did not seek to be reelected as chair. 
Anderson acknowledged that the commission is having a difficult time “for external reasons,” and vowed to bring the commission together “as a body.” 
The commission voted 5-4 to install retired U.S. Forest Service wildlife biologist John Lehmkuhl as vice chair, filling a seat that has been vacant since Ferguson rescinded the reappointment of Tim Ragen. 
Lehmkhul narrowly defeated Molly Linville, who was reappointed to the commission by Ferguson this past spring.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Black-Bear-in-Hozemeen-NPS-Deby-Dixon-Copy-Large.jpeg,,,2025-08-15 21:56:35.310872

He said he didn’t know what would make the summit a success and said there was “nothing set in stone.”
As originally announced, Trump and Putin were supposed to meet in a one-on-one meeting Friday morning. That changed to a three-on-three, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump’s Russia envoy, Steve Witkoff, joining Trump.
The change didn’t appear to result in even a temporary ceasefire in Ukraine, whose leaders were not invited to Alaska.
Ahead of the Trump-Putin meeting, disgruntled Alaskans held protests across the state, waving Ukrainian flags and urging the United States to support Ukraine’s fight against Russia.
A smaller counterprotest in support of the president, hosted by Alaska Republicans, took place just as Air Force One landed in Alaska about 11 a.m. Friday morning.
A poll conducted by Alaska Survey Research in advance of the meeting indicated that 86% of Alaskans hold negative views of Vladimir Putin and that Trump’s approval rating has dipped below 50% in Alaska, where voters have chosen Trump in the past three presidential elections.
About 30 minutes after Trump’s arrival, Putin’s plane landed at the Anchorage military base after a stop in Magadan, in the Russian Far East.
Trump disembarked first and greeted Putin with applause and a firm handshake before inviting the Russian leader into the presidential limousine.
Putin’s arrival in the United States represented a kind of diplomatic victory for the Russian leader, who has been indicted by the International Criminal Court and faces arrest if he visits many countries, including most in Europe. The Trump administration opposes the ICC and does not typically enforce its arrest warrants.
Additionally, Trump has declined to impose additional financial and economic sanctions on Russia and Russian officials, something he had pledged to do if Russia did not agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine.
Eric Croft, chair of the Alaska Democratic Party, said in a written statement, “Just as we expected, Trump failed to accomplish anything meaningful by inviting a war criminal to a meeting on American soil without Ukrainian representation at the table. … To be frank, we are disappointed, but not surprised, and we will not back down from applying pressure to Trump to achieve lasting peace in Ukraine.”
On Friday, Putin and Trump, accompanied by aides, talked for at least 2 ½ hours. The content of those discussions was not revealed.
Putin boarded his plane for a return flight about 4 p.m. Trump was scheduled to depart before 6 p.m.
Their original schedule had called for more lengthy discussions, but reporters were called to a news conference sooner than expected.
That appeared to be in line with remarks Trump gave the day before, in the Oval Office.
“I would say that (on Friday), all I want to do is set the table for the next meeting, which should happen shortly,” Trump said on Thursday. “I’d like to see it happen very quickly, very shortly after this meeting. I’d like to see it actually happen in Alaska … because it’s so much easier.”
On Friday, Putin delivered his remarks mostly in Russian but joked in English that maybe next time, they could meet in Moscow.
Trump said he would “get a little heat” if he agreed to that, “but I could see it possibly happening.”
Even without a breakthrough peace deal, Friday’s meeting between the two presidents was a historic one. It was the first time since Ronald Reagan met Pope John Paul II in Fairbanks that an American president had hosted a foreign leader in Alaska.
Before Friday, no Russian leader had ever visited Alaska — a place whose territory nominally belonged to Russia from the 1700s until 1867.

,California,2025-08-16 00:32:15+00:00,CalMatters,Find out if your vote could be affected by Newsom’s redistricting plans,Jeremia Kimelman and Alexei Koseff,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/08/find-out-if-your-vote-could-be-affected-by-newsoms-redistricting-plans/,Gov. Gavin Newsom is proposing new California congressional maps that would dilute Republican votes. Here's how your vote could change in 2026 if his measure passes.,"Gov. Gavin Newsom will ask California voters this November to approve new congressional lines that favor Democrats, part of a national redistricting battle launched by President Donald Trump. Under a draft map proposed by congressional Democrats — which was unveiled Friday and adds five more Democratic-leaning seats — many Californians could see their representative change. Read more about the districts that are the most impacted.


1st Congressional District


This seat in the northeastern corner of California has been comfortably held by Rep. Doug LaMalfa, a Chico Republican, for more than a decade. He won again last November with nearly two-thirds of the vote. But the new map splits his district in half and creates two Democratic seats instead: one cutting from Santa Rosa through Chico to the Nevada border, the other running up the coast from Marin County and across the Oregon border.


3rd Congressional District


Rep. Kevin Kiley, a Rocklin Republican, has represented this sprawling district along the eastern border of California since it was created in 2022. He faces an uphill battle to hold onto the new elephant-shaped seat, which lops off the conservative-leaning Eastern Sierra and pulls in Democratic voters from Sacramento. Kiley, a frequent critic of Newsom, has been particularly outspoken against the redistricting plan, even introducing a bill in Congress that would block states from redrawing their maps mid-cycle.


9th Congressional District


Rep. Josh Harder, a Stockton Democrat, was swept into Congress during the 2018 Democratic wave and he has held onto his Stockton-based seat despite being a perpetual Republican target. But the elections have been getting closer; he won last November by fewer than four percentage points. The new map shores up his Democratic base by adding an arm that juts toward the East Bay.


13th Congressional District


The closest House race in the entire country during the last election took place in this district in the northern Central Valley. Rep. Adam Gray, a Turlock Democrat, defeated the Republican incumbent by only 187 votes. Adding in more Democratic voters from a slice of Stockton will make it much easier for Gray to keep the seat next year.
 


22nd Congressional District


Winning this seat in the southern Central Valley is an elusive longtime goal for Democrats. It already has a Democratic voter registration advantage, but often leans conservative; President Donald Trump won it last November, and Rep. David Valadao, a Hanford Republican, has held on comfortably in recent elections. The new map adds a section from Fresno County, tweaking the voter registration advantage slightly further Democratic in an attempt to finally take Valadao out.


27th Congressional District


Rep. George Whitesides, a Santa Clarita Democrat, was one of three Democratic challengers who defeated Republican incumbents in California House races last year. He represents northern Los Angeles suburbs that have grown gradually more liberal as people move there to find cheaper housing. His new seat brings in more Democratic voters by swapping a swath in the high desert for a chunk of the San Fernando Valley.


41st Congressional District


This seat in western Riverside County, once safely Republican, already got swingier after the last round of redistricting, when it was extended into the liberal Coachella Valley. But Rep. Ken Calvert, a Corona Republican who has been in Congress for more than three decades, squeaked through several serious challenges, winning last November by fewer than four percentage points. His long tenure may finally be over. The new map would break apart Calvert’s district and redistribute the voters, while adding back a historic Democratic seat in southeast Los Angeles County.


45th Congressional District


It took weeks to determine the outcome of the last election in this heavily Asian American district along the border of Los Angeles and Orange counties. Rep. Derek Tran, a Cypress Democrat, ultimately defeated the Republican incumbent by 653 votes. He should have an easier time defending his new seat, which grabs an additional section of Los Angeles County, around Norwalk.


47th Congressional District


Democrats have managed to narrowly hang onto this coastal Orange County seat for several elections in a row. Rep. Dave Min, a Costa Mesa Democrat, won last November by fewer than three percentage points. The new map tilts the district further in his favor by including part of Long Beach.



48th Congressional District


This change is perhaps the biggest reach for Democrats in the new map. By moving voters from the Coachella Valley into the eastern San Diego County district, it goes from safely Republican to a slight Democratic registration advantage. That could allow them to take out the veteran Rep. Darrell Issa, an Escondido Republican.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/081525-REDISTRICTING-MAPS-GH-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-15 20:57:51.301294

Celeste Maloy, R-Utah, talks with Emy Lesofski, director of the Utah Office of Energy Development, after a summit on federal regulations held at the Utah Capitol in Salt Lake City on Aug. 15, 2025. (Katie McKellar/Utah News Dispatch)Mining and energy industry representatives discussed the regulatory hurdles they say are holding back “responsible” industrial growth across Utah with Rep. Celeste Maloy, R-Utah, at a summit she held at the Utah Capitol in Salt Lake City on Friday.
Titled “The Regulatory Pendulum,” Maloy’s forum focused on how federal regulations have swung back and forth depending on what political party controls the White House, and how that’s created uncertainty not only in energy development, but also delays in completing major projects like bridges and pipelines.
She and the panelists argued it’s holding Utah and the U.S. back by bogging major projects down in years of bureaucratic processes. 
The forum’s perspectives focused on regulatory issues, and speakers did not include environmental advocates. The Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, a preservation nonprofit that has been a vocal critic of mining and industrial development in Utah’s redrock wilderness, did not immediately return a request for comment Friday.  
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
During the form, Maloy highlighted proposed legislation she’s sponsoring — the Full Responsibility and Expedited Enforcement Act, or the FREE Act — meant to streamline the federal permitting process. 
Simplifying federal regulations has been discussed for decades, with only incremental statutory changes passed by Congress and temporary changes from presidential executive orders. But Maloy said she’s “hopeful” that Congress can get it done, saying “we have the right alignment right now between all three branches of government.” 
“We have an administration that’s willing to break out of a lot of paradigms and do things differently than they’ve been done before,” Maloy said, though she acknowledged that approach alone is “controversial.” 
But she argued “that’s what it’s going to take to get permit reform done.”
“We have a Congress that has bipartisan agreement that we need to do a permitting reform. That alone is a huge rarity. And we have a judicial branch that, in my opinion, keeps daring Congress to do it better,” she said. 
Maloy said the courts have sent a clear message that Congress needs to write clearer laws that leave federal agencies the power to “fill in the gaps,” which she said has led to an unwieldy federal permitting process. 
“Much like a weed that grows up in (a crack in ) the sidewalk, it doesn’t just fill the gaps. It makes the gap wider, causes problems, and makes everything uneven,” Maloy said 
Even though Republicans currently control the White House and Congress, however, Maloy said it’s going to take bipartisan support to fix the issue.

“It has to be bipartisan, because administrations change,” she said. “Both sides of Congress swing back and forth. And in order to stop this pendulum and not have the pettiness of, ‘We’re going to roll that back just because it came from the other side,’ we’re going to have to have both sides bought in. And I think there’s reason to hope for that too.”
This year’s version of Maloy’s FREE Act advanced out of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform in May, with a 23-19 vote. Though none of the Democrats on that voted in favor of her bill, “they didn’t try to stop it,” she said. 
“Those are the things we’re up against, where nobody actually disagreed with the bill, in fact they’re really excited about it,” Maloy said, “but because of how party politics work” Democrats voted against it, and now she’s having a hard time finding a Democratic co-sponsor because of those no votes in committee.
Still, she said she’s hopeful there will eventually be bipartisan support, since people from both sides are becoming frustrated with how long permitting processes can take, whether it’s for a mining project, a bridge or a solar farm. 
Jeffrey Rosen, currently a nonresident senior fellow at the right-of-center think tank, the American Enterprise Institute, spoke at Maloy’s summit. He previously worked for President Donald Trump’s first administration as acting attorney general and deputy attorney general, as well as deputy U.S. secretary of transportation.
Rosen gave an overview of past attempts at streamlining federal regulations spanning decades, but he said there’s plenty of “unfinished work” for Congress to do. 
“The reality is the problem of permitting delays continues to need more work to be done, even though … we’ve spent 25 years trying to address this,” he said, applauding Maloy for her efforts. “It’s a subject that doesn’t seem glamorous or easy to understand, and yet it plays such a huge role in our country as to what gets built, what gets mined, how power is supplied and delivered, and lots of other crucial components of our economy and quality of life.”

No one was injured.,"An overnight fire outside the Johnson County Republican Party headquarters is being investigated as a possible arson. No one was injured. (Getty Images)TOPEKA — Firefighters responded to an overnight fire outside headquarters of the Johnson County Republican Party in Overland Park that resulted in no injuries.
The incident inspired inflammatory comments by the leader of the Kansas GOP, who placed responsibility on liberals. In a statement, she offered no evidence the fire, which didn’t cause significant damage, was linked to partisan ideology.
“Extreme liberals can’t do anything right, including arson,” said Danedri Herbert, who serves as chair of the Kansas Republican Party and spokesperson for Attorney General Kris Kobach. “Their hateful attempt to intimidate Republicans will also fail.”
Johnson County Republican Party chair Sue Huff said she was grateful no one was hurt in the “vicious attack.”
Overland Park firefighters responded to the county’s GOP headquarters near West 105th and Mastin Street around 12:45 a.m. Friday. KCTV 5 reported the department reported the fire was confined to the doorstep of the building.
Jeanna Repass, chair of the state Democratic Party, said in a statement acts of violence should play no role in resolving political differences. She said it was a relief no one was hurt in the “senseless act.”
“We stand with law enforcement as they pursue justice in this matter,” Repass said. “We will never be able to solve political differences with acts of violence, and we send our thoughts to the Johnson County GOP and the Kansas GOP.”
Repass said she was confident Overland Park investigators would hold to account anyone responsible for the fire.
“Violence anywhere, whether at a local party headquarters or our U.S. Capitol, undermines our democracy and must be condemned in full. Real progress cannot be made through fear, intimidation or destruction,” she said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-truck-lights-1024x685.jpeg,,,2025-08-15 20:57:51.301294

The University of Alaska Fairbanks Upward Bound and Teaching Through Technology Alaska programs have teamed up once again to help high school students from across Alaska prepare for life after graduation. Through a summer session called “Your Future Role in Alaska,” students learned to build a personalized plan to match their career interest to their values.
Over the course of two weeks in June, participating students engaged with faculty and staff in a variety of programs and career paths offered at UAF’s Troth Yeddha’ campus and the UAF Community and Technical College, learned about their personal strengths, navigated the university admissions process and learned from the UB alumni and current UAF students about their experiences.
For many students, this was their first encounter at UAF, life away from home and an in-depth opportunity to explore what postsecondary paths would best suit them. The session gave students an opportunity to define their personal values and goals, thinking beyond “what I want to do” and focusing more on the importance of their role in Alaska and their community.
“It was a great learning opportunity to adapt to dorm life and adjust to a new environment surrounded by new faces,” said Vivien Ongtowasruk-Pootoogooluk, a sophomore from Shishmaref.
Identifying their own personal strengths and potential career matches using a tool called the Alaska Career Information System, coupled with engagement with professionals in specific career paths, expanded potential career options attendees had not considered before.
Robin Oaks, a junior from Haines, joined the session with a radiology technician as her career in mind. But after an introduction to CTC’s health science program and a lesson on research given by Anshul Pandya, assistant professor of bioscience, she had bigger aspirations.
“With more schooling, I could be a radiologist and make way more money!” she said.
The students were introduced to education and character requirements to work in the public safety sector, including emergency medical services and law enforcement. CTC Paramedicine Director Richie Berndt discussed the levels of emergency medical training with students and provided hands-on opportunities for students to practice being EMTs. Students learned to pack wounds, use tourniquets and apply pressure to stop the bleeding, all part of a day’s work in the life of an EMT. Officers Kelly Copeland and Jill Copeland with the UAF Police Department and Deputy Fire Marshal Kyle Carrington with Alaska Department of Public Safety Fairbanks Office also talked about the benefits of careers in law enforcement.
The students also got a taste of welding through the hands-on pipefitting apprenticeship program, given by Rodney Wolcott, training director at Plumbers & Pipefitters Union Local 375 Training Center Fairbanks.
For Robin Oaks, who wants to work in radiology, pipefitting was originally not on her radar but came to light after working with Wolcott.
Regardless of the students’ interest, applying to and paying for college or any postsecondary education can present hurdles. The participants learned how to navigate the admissions process, discovered the support network that the university offers, and met with advisors in financial aid and admissions to discuss the timeline and process.
Additionally, the summer session provided the students with an opportunity to expand their view beyond careers and to learn what they can do to improve the community they live in. They spent a day participating in volunteer work at the Fairbanks Community Food Bank, packaging and distributing food. The experience not only allowed the students to see a bigger role they can play as a community member but also gave older students a chance to build confidence and guide younger students outside of the academic context.
Time was also dedicated to exploring the UAF Makerspace and working with the UAF Alaska Center for Energy and Power’s CyberPod — a group of T3 alumni and UAF students working at ACEP. The participants enjoyed hands-on projects and talking with and learning from the CyberPod members about their educational journeys, career aspirations and work within the university system. The CyberPod members provided an invaluable link between high school and college, making their goals more tangible.
“It was great to learn alongside the students when visiting the different career paths and institutions that contribute to our community,” said Adrian Burke, a CyberPod member.
“We got to support students in growing and adapting to professional and university environments, and it was rewarding to see the moments of ‘Aha!’ and inspiration. I would have loved to participate in this summer program when I was a UB student,” he said.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Former Social Security commissioner Martin O’Malley told Iowans Friday the Trump administration and Elon Musk’s DOGE service have put Social Security at risk — but said the problems facing the program can be easily solved by lawmakers.
O’Malley spoke at the Franklin Avenue Library in Des Moines for an event hosted by Fairness for Iowa that was a part of the larger “Protect Our Checks” movement, advocating for the protection of Social Security, which marked its 90th anniversary Thursday.
But the future of the program, which provides benefits for retired Americans, people with disabilities and survivors, has become an issue due to financial difficulties forecast for the coming decade. A report released in June from the Trustees of the Social Security and Medicare found reserves are likely to be depleted by 2033 for the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) Trust Fund.
Concerns about insolvency existed before the Trump administration. But O’Malley, who served as Social Security commissioner during former President Joe Biden’s administration, said the problems can be fixed by increasing the payroll tax cap for high earners, and reversing some changes made through the Republican budget reconciliation bill.
O’Malley said he believed an “inflection point” was coming that would shift the current conversation on Social Security. While he said he hopes problems would be fixed sooner, he has a feeling “when they actually break Social Security, it’s going to create an earthquake across the country, and people will realize, ‘Wow, I didn’t vote for this. This has gone way too far.'”
Democrats and supporters of Social Security need to be ready to step up to fight for the program, he said, pointing to the midterms in 2026 and future elections.
“There’s no magic ingredient to it, but the party needs to be full-throated in its defense of Social Security,” O’Malley said. “If we can’t fight and be willing to die on this hill … we shouldn’t call ourselves Democrats anymore. And when it does, all of you, by being here and being fully equipped with the truth, can help us turn this ship.”
The event, part of a national “Win Back Our Country” tour, focused on providing information to attendees about Social Security. O’Malley presented statistics on Social Security response times and finances from his time in office and from under the Trump administration, which he urged people to reference as they discuss the program with friends and family. He also pushed back against statements made by Trump and Musk about Social Security that he said were “lies,” like large numbers of deceased individuals or undocumented immigrants receiving benefits through the system.
In Iowa, 687,630 people receive Social Security benefits. O’Malley encouraged Iowans to contact their representatives and senators to speak out in favor of the program — and to highlight why the program was important to them and future generations.
Zach Mecham, an entrepreneur and disability rights activist, said Social Security made it possible for him to attend Drake University, start his business and own a house and car.
“When I think about all of the things that I’ve been able to do with my life, and I think about young Iowans with disabilities … I’m worried for their future,” Mecham said.” I’m worried that they won’t have the same supports that I get — not the Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, the things that I relied on in order to get where I’m at. And I think as Americans that want the American Dream for everyone, we would want these supports for all of the people like me, who just want to make a life better for themselves, or our aging Iowans that have worked their entire life, and now just want to retire in peace. That’s why we’re all here.”
O’Malley has spent significant time in Iowa, having run as a Democratic candidate for president during the 2016 election cycle. Though he has said he is not interested in pursuing another run for president, he said he believes a strong Democratic presidential nominee will be an important figure in the fight to preserve Social Security and take on other policies advanced by Trump and Republicans.
He said that while there are Democrats doing important work — pointing to California Gov. Gavin Newsom and to Beto O’Rourke of Texas — the party is now in an “uncomfortable time” before the 2026 election and the will likely have to wait for clear leaders to emerge.
“The Democratic Party right now is almost like a very agitated, turbulent pool longing to become a flowing river,” O’Malley said. “I think we could really use a midterm to let these national candidates, you know, strut their stuff, articulate their vision and their story. It’ll come. I know we all want it to come last week, but I think it’s very hard right now for any one leader to become the leader of our party.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/omalley.8.15.2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-15 19:57:41.777049

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)President Donald Trump’s high-profile meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin adjourned their brief summit Friday without announcing a breakthrough in negotiations to end Russia’s three-year-old invasion of Ukraine.
“We didn’t get there, but we have a very good chance of getting there,” Trump said after several hours of closed-door negotiations with Putin in Anchorage. 
In a pair of brief speeches, the leaders said they were optimistic about improvements in relations between the United States and Russia. Putin said they had reached “an agreement,” according to a provided translation, but neither Putin nor Trump provided any details about what that agreement entails, and Trump said: “There’s no deal until there’s a deal.”
They left a planned news conference without taking any questions from a room full of international journalists, an action that stunned and confused attendees.
Many of those journalists, as well as Putin, Trump and officials from both Russia and the United States, traveled thousands of miles to meet at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, a base operated by the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Army in Anchorage, Alaska’s largest city.
Because of the summit’s short notice — Trump announced it on social media just one week ago — the city’s hotel rooms were all but sold out, and rental cars were almost impossible to find.
At the University of Alaska Anchorage, members of the Russian delegation, including journalists, were given cots in curtained-off spaces within Alaska Airlines Arena.
En route to Alaska, Trump told reporters traveling aboard Air Force One that he was “not going to be happy” if there was no ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine by the end of the day, according to news reports. 
He said he didn’t know what would make the summit a success and said there was “nothing set in stone.”
As originally announced, Trump and Putin were supposed to meet in a one-on-one meeting Friday morning. That changed to a three-on-three, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump’s Russia envoy, Steve Witkoff, joining Trump.
The change didn’t appear to result in even a temporary ceasefire in Ukraine, whose leaders were not invited to Alaska.
Ahead of the Trump-Putin meeting, disgruntled Alaskans held protests across the state, waving Ukrainian flags and urging the United States to support Ukraine’s fight against Russia.
A smaller counterprotest in support of the president, hosted by Alaska Republicans, took place just as Air Force One landed in Alaska on Friday morning.
About 30 minutes later, Putin’s plane arrived after a stop in Magadan, in the Russian Far East.
Trump disembarked first and greeted Putin with applause and a firm handshake before inviting the Russian leader into the presidential limousine.
The two men, accompanied by aides, talked for several hours. The content of those discussions was not revealed.
Their original schedule had called for more lengthy discussions, but reporters were called to a news conference sooner than expected.
That appeared to be in line with remarks Trump gave the day before, in the Oval Office.
“I would say that (on Friday), all I want to do is set the table for the next meeting, which should happen shortly,” Trump said on Thursday. “I’d like to see it happen very quickly, very shortly after this meeting. I’d like to see it actually happen in Alaska … because it’s so much easier.”
On Friday, Putin delivered his remarks mostly in Russian but joked in English that maybe next time, they could meet in Moscow.
Trump said he would “get a little heat” if he agreed to that, “but I could see it possibly happening.”

Earlier this month, the state released its “Montanans for Hire?” study from the Montana Department of Labor and Industries. The agency said it is using “analytics and survey data” to pursue additional research on the issue.
“Engaging the non-working population in the labor force may be a key component to address the state’s persistent workforce shortage,” the study reads.
About 100,000 Montanans from the ages of 16 to 54 are not working, with the report putting the total number of people aged 16 years or older and not working at 350,000. There are 560,000 Montanans over age 16 who are actively employed, which the study calls a “record high.” Despite that, though, there is still a need for more workers.
“The demand for workers still outstrips the supply — with 1.6 job openings for every one unemployed person,” the study reads. “Tight labor markets have increased competition for workers and driven up wages.”
It goes on to say the state’s labor market is “persistently tight.”
Gov. Greg Gianforte recently signed an executive order looking to address labor shortages in the state. During a press conference for that order, Gianforte said he often speaks with business owners, who tell him their number one impediment to business growth is workforce.
“We have a tight labor market, one of the lowest,” Gianforte said. “Best opportunities we have is this, these people that are in Montana. They’re Montanans, but they’re not participating in the labor force. Today, we want to build bridges for them, for their benefit and the employers.”
The Montana Department of Labor and Industry report found 34% of the 100,000 people in the  age 16 to 54 bracket aren’t working due to school, while an additional 31% can’t work because they are caring for family. Another 19% are sick or disabled, and 10% are retired.
Montana’s population is around 1.1 million people.
Child care is a major barrier, which the study notes. Legislation brought during the 2025 Legislative session sought to address this issue, including House Bill 924. That legislation created a trust that, among other things, puts money toward childcare.
However, a bill from Rep. Jonathan Karlen, D-Missoula, that would have made child care workers eligible for the Best Beginnings Child Care Scholarship for their own kids was vetoed by Gianforte earlier this summer, who argued the bill was costly and not as effective as other tools.
“We have people that want to work in childcare, that can’t afford to work in childcare, and then we have businesses that are trying to recruit employees, but those employees can’t find childcare,” Karlen said Friday.
He also pointed at Medicaid provider rates as a barrier and said he’s seen some nursing homes close doors. 
“If somebody who would be best taken care of in an assisted living in a nursing facility isn’t able to be there, that puts a huge burden on the worker who’s going to have to presumably take fewer hours or not work,” Karlen said.
The study says that in the last 25 years, the Montana Department of Labor and Industries has trained 190 workers through its apprenticeship program.
The study spent some time examining the elder workforce, and it says there are more people aged 55 to 64 years old in the labor force now than five years ago. Montana has the seventh-largest share of the population at retirement age among states, the report noted.
Most Montanans actively seeking work are unemployed for only a short period of time, the study says. There were about 17,000 people in that population last year and 74% were unemployed for 15 weeks or less. 
Only about 1,500 of those actively seeking employment spent over a year looking.

(Pool photo by Bethany Baker/The Salt Lake Tribune) Matt Hunsaker did not mince words when he addressed the man who, nearly 40 years ago, kidnapped his mother, brought her up Big Cottonwood Canyon and murdered her. 
“I will be there and I will watch you get shot. I promise that,” Hunsaker said, speaking remotely on the final day of the commutation hearing for Ralph Menzies, who is scheduled to die by firing squad on Sept. 5. “Ralph, I’ll see your ass in the execution chamber in 21 days.” 
Friday marked an emotional day of testimony for the family of Maurine Hunsaker, with the Utah Board of Pardons and Parole hearing arguments for and against granting Menzies, a 67-year-old death row inmate with dementia, clemency — that means instead of a death sentence, he would serve the rest of his life in prison, without the possibility of parole.

The board has never commuted a death sentence and the Hunsaker family, during several hours of tearful statements, urged them to keep it that way. 
“I loved that woman with every inch of my body, soul, mind, everything. What this man did, he does not deserve two seconds more to live,” said Jim Hunsaker, Maurine’s husband. 
In total, eight of Maurine’s relatives spoke to the board on Friday, all with a similar argument — that 39 years ago, Menzies’ murder upended their family, and that their legal fight for justice and closure has dragged on far too long.  
Menzies’ attorneys say terminal illness and good behavior are reasons to spare him from firing squad

Menzies already had a lengthy criminal history by the time he kidnapped Hunsaker, a 26-year-old mother who was working as a gas station clerk in Kearns. In 1978, while serving a sentence for aggravated robbery, he escaped the Utah State Prison and shot and wounded a taxi driver. He was sentenced again, then paroled in 1984 — in 1985, he was arrested for theft, then released on bail in February of 1986. 
Days after he was released, Menzies robbed the gas station where Hunsaker worked, kidnapping the young mother and taking her up into the Wasatch Mountains. According to testimony Friday, he told Hunsaker he would let her go — she even called her husband, telling him she would be released soon. But days later, a hiker found her body near the Storm Mountain picnic area. She had been tied to a tree and strangled, before Menzies slashed her throat.

Much of that was recounted on Friday by Matt Hunsaker, who was just 10 years old when he learned of his mother’s murder. During his nearly 45-minute testimony, Hunsaker recalled waking up to see police at his house; being escorted to school by officers; hearing his father’s cries when he learned of Maurine’s death; and the years of turmoil that followed. 
“I’m 10 years old and I just found out my mom was murdered. She was killed by that piece of crap sitting in that jumpsuit right in front of you right now. The very guy that’s begging for mercy,” Hunsaker said.  
In the years that followed the murder, Menzies filed numerous appeals that prolonged his sentence — most recently, his attorneys tried to argue that his dementia has progressed so much that he no longer understands why he’s being executed. Per state and federal law, a government should not execute someone who doesn’t understand the reasoning behind their death sentence. 
Despite a judge ruling that Menzies does have dementia, those attempts have all mostly failed, including a recent petition to undergo a second competency exam. Although Menzies still has an appeal pending with the Utah Supreme Court, which his attorneys will argue next week, the commutation hearing marks one of his last attempts to avoid the firing squad. 
Judge denies Ralph Menzies’ request for another competency evaluation

“If you don’t sentence him to death, it will be on all your heads. I’m sorry, that’s my feeling. He has been so brutal, not only to Maurine, but for me, my family, and anybody else that has to put up with him,” Jim Hunsaker said on Friday. 
Heidi Nestel, an attorney for the Hunsaker family, told the board that allowing the execution to move forward would bring closure to a family who, for decades, has lived in legal limbo. 
“The only compassionate, conclusive mercy available now is this. To finally carry out this sentence the jury and judge lawfully and unanimously decided 37 years ago to give her family the one thing they’ve never had — an end, closure, silence,” she said. “Let this long delayed sentence be fulfilled. Not out of vengeance, but out of mercy for those who have suffered quietly.”

Attorneys make closing arguments 
Attorneys for both Menzies and the state made their closing statements on Friday, echoing many of the same arguments made in court hearings this year, and in years past. 
Menzies’ attorneys say that his terminal illness is already killing him, urging the board to simply let it run its course. His life expectancy, said attorney Eric Zuckerman, is only five to six years. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Zuckerman also pointed to problems with the original trial, citing an affidavit from Utah 3rd District Judge Raymond Uno, who in 2010 wrote that there likely wasn’t enough evidence of torture in the murder to actually sentence Menzies to death. Instead, Uno wrote, Menzies should have received a life sentence. 
And, the death sentence relied in part on false testimony from a fellow inmate, who told prosecutors Menzies said killing Hunsaker was “one of the greatest thrills of my life.” The inmate later admitted to making up that statement, in an attempt to strike a deal with federal authorities. 
“This is why this board exists. You have the power to act. You have the power to make sure that Utah does not execute a disabled man with dementia, which it’s never before done. You have the power to make sure that Utah does not execute a man whose sentence was obtained through perjury,” said Zuckerman. “But for perjured testimony relied on in both phases of the trial, we would not be here today. Without it, Mr. Menzies likely would not have been sentenced to death.” 
Thomas Brunker, a longtime prosecutor with the Utah Attorney General’s Office, addressed the board during the state’s final argument, telling them that while he didn’t dispute Menzies’ dementia diagnosis, they dispute the severity of his mental decline.
Brunker also said courts have pushed back on the arguments made in Uno’s affidavit — and that despite a Salt Lake County Conviction Integrity Unit finding issues with Menzies’ sentencing, it would be unprecedented to offer him clemency based on their report (the unit issued a report several years ago that found the death sentence “lacks integrity”). 
“When Menzies was sentenced to death for what he did to Maurine, a promise was made to the people of the state and, more importantly, to Maurine’s family, to vindicate the wrongs Menzies inflicted when he took Maurine’s life. That promise has remained unfulfilled for 37 years,” Brunker said. 
It’s unclear when the board will rule. Matt Hunsaker, who is currently traveling, asked them to wait until at least Tuesday to make their announcement.

Santiago/Getty Images)BILOXI, Miss. — The Trump administration is developing a powerful data tool it claims will let states identify noncitizens registered to vote. But Democratic critics and data experts warn it could allow the federal government to vacuum up vast quantities of information on Americans for unclear purposes.
Some Democratic election officials and opponents of the effort fear President Donald Trump wants to build a federal database of voters to target political opponents or cherry-pick rare examples of noncitizen voters to fuel a sense of crisis. Republican election officials allied with the president counter that he’s helping states to maintain accurate voter rolls.
The Trump administration has rolled out changes to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, tool at the same time the U.S. Department of Justice is asking states for copies of their voter rolls. The timing, combined with questions about what happens to voter data uploaded to the program, has alarmed critics.
Trump wants Congress to pass a national proof of citizenship voter registration requirement and in March tried to unilaterally impose one for federal elections through executive order. But with the legislation stalled and the order halted by the courts, the citizenship data tool may offer a backdoor way to accomplish the same goal.
SAVE was originally intended to help state and local officials verify the immigration status of individual noncitizens seeking government benefits. But U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, this spring refashioned it into a platform that can scan states’ voter rolls if election officials upload the data.

The changes to SAVE, rolled out over just a few months and with little public debate, are “tinkering with sort of the bones of democracy,” said John Davisson, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington, D.C.-based research and advocacy group that argues privacy is a fundamental right.
“You’re talking about the voting process and who will be eligible to vote,” Davisson said. “And to take a system that is not designed for use in that process and repurpose it, really on the fly, without a formal comment process, without formal rulemaking, without congressional intervention — that’s pretty anomalous and pretty alarming.”
Previously, SAVE could only search one name at a time. Now it can conduct bulk searches, allowing state officials to potentially feed into it information on millions of registered voters. SAVE checks that information against a series of federal databases and reports back whether it can verify someone’s immigration status.
Since May, it also can draw upon Social Security data, transforming the program into a tool that can confirm citizenship because Social Security records for many, but not all, Americans include the information. NPR reported earlier on changes to SAVE.
“It is incredible what has been done, really since March,” Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray, a Republican who supports proof of citizenship requirements and the SAVE tool, told a gathering of state secretaries of state in Biloxi, Mississippi, last week.
Individuals registering to vote in federal elections must already sign a statement affirming they are citizens under penalty of perjury, and those who cast a ballot face criminal penalties and deportation. One study of the 2016 election placed the prevalence of noncitizen voting at 0.0001% of votes cast.
But as Trump has spread falsehoods about elections, Republicans have made purging noncitizens from voter rolls a central focus.

Democratic concerns were on display last week at the National Association of Secretaries of State conference, held at the Beau Rivage casino-resort in Biloxi. In interviews on the sidelines of the conference, Democratic secretaries of state voiced deep reservations — or outright opposition — about plugging their voter data into SAVE.
Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said Aug. 6 that the federal government appeared to be trying to take over election administration. She formally rejected the Justice Department’s voter roll request two days later.
Bellows said the Department of Homeland Security told her in a recent phone call that it planned to retain SAVE data for 10 years for “audit purposes only.”
“Just like the [Justice Department] is asking us to hand over an electronic file of all the voters in our state, it seems like the Department of Homeland Security is through this backdoor system also asking us to share voter information about every voter in our state,” Bellows said.
At least one state appears to have granted the federal government sweeping authority over any voter data it provides to SAVE.
Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales announced in July he had reached an agreement with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to access the newly expanded system for voter list maintenance. Indiana’s agreement allows the federal agency to use information the state provides for any purpose permitted by law, including criminal prosecutions.
Morales, a Republican, said in a news release that SAVE represented “another step in safeguarding the rights” of eligible voters. His office didn’t respond to Stateline’s questions.
The Trump administration has ramped up efforts to encourage state election officials to use the expanded program. The White House hosted a bipartisan “fly in” event for state secretaries of state on July 29. Multiple secretaries of state told Stateline that USCIS Director Joseph Edlow, who was confirmed on July 15, spoke at the event.
“The president is very much keyed in on voter list maintenance,” Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, a Republican, said in an interview — echoing other GOP secretaries of state who released statements praising the Trump administration after the meeting.










When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances.


– Minnesota Democratic Secretary of State Steve Simon


Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, a Democrat who attended the meeting, said he questioned how the federal government would handle voter information provided to SAVE. He added that the Justice Department’s request for his state’s voter rolls raised his level of concern about how data would be used.
“When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances,” Simon told Stateline.
The White House referred questions about SAVE and the event to the Department of Homeland Security and USCIS.
In response to questions from Stateline, USCIS didn’t directly answer whether the agency would share voter roll data with other parts of the federal government but confirmed it disposes of records after 10 years.
“The SAVE application is a critical tool for state and local governments to access information to safeguard the integrity of elections across the country. It’s no wonder many states have quickly adopted it, and we continue to promote the tool to other states and counties not using SAVE,” USCIS spokesperson Matthew Tragesser said in a statement.
“We look forward to continued optimization efforts and implementing more updates to SAVE.”
 GOP pressure

Some Republican election officials and Trump allies have long wanted the federal government to take an expanded role in searching state voter rolls for noncitizens.
Last summer the Trump-aligned litigation group America First Legal, co-founded by Trump adviser Stephen Miller, encouraged states to submit to the Department of Homeland Security the names of individuals for citizenship or immigration status verification.
Some states did just that. Texas, for example, asked USCIS to verify the citizenship of some voters in September, and Indiana asked the agency to verify 585,774 voters in October. The same month, 16 Republican state attorneys general signed a letter criticizing Homeland Security, then under the Biden administration, for failing to work with states on verification.

After Trump took office, GOP state officials kept up the pressure. Twenty-one Republican secretaries of state urged Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in February to prioritize SAVE improvements.
On April 16, Indiana sued the department in federal court for not responding to its verification request last fall. USCIS announced an overhaul of SAVE less than a week later.
As the agency continues to remake SAVE, the tool will soon allow searches using the last four digits of a Social Security number, multiple state secretaries of state told Stateline. The agency confirmed the feature is under development and will be available soon but didn’t provide an exact date.
The change would mark another significant expansion of the program because most states collect the last four digits when individuals without a driver’s license register to vote.
Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican, said SAVE represents a better way to verify citizenship than a state law requiring voters to produce documents. “I think there’s a real opportunity for us to do a lot of this through just sharing of information and I think that’s what we’re seeing happen,” McGrane said in an interview.
 Unreliable data?

But some voting rights advocates and experts on government data caution against an overreliance on Social Security data.
The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, a progressive policy nonprofit, has noted that Social Security only began tracking the citizenship status of all applicants in 1978 — meaning the database doesn’t include comprehensive citizenship information for older Americans. Additionally, Social Security may not always have up-to-date information on the status of naturalized U.S. citizens.
The nonpartisan Institute for Responsive Government also warned in May that since SAVE hasn’t used Social Security numbers to verify citizenship in the past, its accuracy and effectiveness are unknown. The success of the expanded SAVE program may also partially depend on whether it has adequate staff and resources, it said.

A 2017 Government Accountability Office report found that between fiscal years 2012 and 2016, about 16% of the nearly 90 million SAVE searches required additional verification, which the institute says often translates into federal workers manually checking files. Now that SAVE allows bulk searches, the need for manual checking could rise dramatically.
Nick Doctor, director of implementation at the Institute for Responsive Government, said in an interview that a tool confirming the eligibility of registered voters in a way that doesn’t burden individuals can be a good thing. But he emphasized that it depends in large measure on SAVE’s implementation.
“The changes that have been made to SAVE happened very quickly and, to my knowledge, we haven’t seen releases on the level of accuracy of that information,” Doctor said.
During interviews, Republican secretaries of state stressed that voters aren’t kicked off the rolls because SAVE can’t verify their citizenship. Instead, an inability to verify would likely trigger a follow-up process with the voter.
“Just because we get something back from the SAVE database, it’s not a cut and dry, especially on those they’re not sure about,” Hoskins, the Missouri secretary of state, said.
Still, Arizona illustrates why some Democrats worry about any large-scale effort to ask voters — especially longtime, older residents — to prove their citizenship. After the state discovered errors in how it tracked voter citizenship dating back years, election officials are contacting some 200,000 voters seeking proof of citizenship documentation.
Some have been casting ballots for decades without incident and many feel targeted, Arizona Democratic Secretary of State Adrian Fontes said during a presentation at the state secretaries of state conference. “They feel insulted when they get that letter,” Fontes said.










There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside.


– Charles Stewart III, professor of political science at MIT who studies elections


Charles Stewart III, a professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies elections, said Arizona may actually point to the potential usefulness of SAVE. If Arizona runs its voter roll through the program, a list of 200,000 voters needing citizenship verification would perhaps drop into the hundreds, he suggested.
“There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside,” Stewart said.
Connecticut Democratic Secretary of State Stephanie Thomas told Stateline that every secretary wants tools to keep voter lists as clean as possible. But the details are important.
When she hears of something new, Thomas said she asks whether it’s the best option available and whether “the i’s are dotted, the t’s crossed.” She said she’s asked USCIS a series of questions about SAVE and is waiting on some responses.
“When it comes to voter lists,” Thomas said, “I don’t want Connecticut voters to be a guinea pig.”

Ben Adams, R-Nampa, introduces a proposed amendment to the Idaho Constitution that prevents the state from selling future public lands it obtains from the federal government. (Clark Corbin/Idaho Capital Sun)PINE, IDAHO – Surrounded by mountains, forests and the South Fork of the Boise River, Idaho state Sen. Ben Adams on Friday unveiled the text of a proposed amendment to the Idaho Constitution he says would prevent the sale of any future public lands the state acquires from the federal government. 
New poll finds 96% Idaho voters say public lands should remain in public hands

“One thing I do know is that public lands have and should always remain under the ownership of the people for their enjoyment and their benefit,” the Nampa Republican said during a kickoff event at the Pine Cafe in Elmore County. “Today I present a very different vision than the vision that’s been coming out of Washington, D.C., related to our public lands.”
Adams announced last week he will introduce the proposed amendment to the Idaho Constitution during the beginning of the 2026 legislative session that starts in January. 
To amend the state Constitution, it takes at least a two-thirds supermajority vote of both the Idaho Senate and the Idaho House of Representatives.  
If that happens, the proposed constitutional amendment would appear on the November 2026 general election ballot in Idaho, where it would take a simple majority of votes to pass. 
The proposal does not apply to the 2.5 million acres of state endowment land the state already controls, which can still be sold. 
Instead, the proposal would apply to new public lands the state of Idaho acquires or buys from the federal government. That land would be placed into a new land trust, and could not be sold, Adams said. 
“Voters in Idaho deserve to have this question on the ballot,” Adams said. “Will Idahoans support a new path forward, conserving our public lands and protecting our Idaho from being sold to the highest bidder? I know my answer. Let’s send a message so loud that they can hear it all the way back in D.C: Our land is not for sale.”
 What does the proposed amendment to the Idaho Constitution say?

During Friday’s event, Adams posted and distributed written copies of the text of the proposed amendment to the Idaho Constitution.

He also shared the question that would appear on voters’ ballots if the proposed amendment clears the Idaho Legislature.
“Shall Section 8, Article IX of the Constitution of the State of Idaho be amended to provide that certain lands granted and acquired from the federal government shall never be sold and shall be placed in a trust to be managed for the benefit of the people of Idaho?”
Adams also shared the specific new language that would be added to the Idaho Constitution if the proposed amendment passes.

“Excluding lands granted pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, lands acquired by the exchanging of lands granted pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, and lands purchased with moneys, and lands purchased with moneys of this section, all other lands granted to or acquired by the state by or from the general government shall be held in a separate trust as public lands of the state. The trust shall remain inviolable and intact for this and future generations. Such lands shall not be sold. Such lands may be exchanged, except with lands granted, exchanged, purchased, or otherwise acquired to subsection (1) of this section, with two-thirds approval of the legislature. The State Board of Land Commissioners may lease such lands under such regulations as may be prescribed by law. The State Board of Land Commissioners shall manage such lands by employing best management practices to achieve a harmonious and coordinated management of the various resources, each with the other, that avoids impairment to the land, ensures the development and utilization of the land and its resources occurs in a manner that conserves existing and future uses of the land, preserves valid, existing rights and is in accordance with state law. The State Board of Land Commissioners shall coordinate management with agencies of the state to promote public recreation, scenic values, watershed quality and wildlife habitat and to further effectuate the purposes of this trust. Revenue derived from such lands shall be placed in a permanent designated fund, the proceeds of which shall be annually appropriated by the legislature to support operating and maintaining such lands, to compensate local governments for payment in lieu of taxes, to reduce the cost of hunting, fishing and other recreational use permits for Idaho residents, and to support primary and secondary public education.”

The proposed amendment does not address how Idaho would pay for any new public lands that are bought. 
At almost the same time Adams unveiled his public lands proposal on Friday, Gov. Brad Little issued an executive order requiring all state agencies except public schools to reduce spending by 3% for the current fiscal year 2026 budget. 
 Adams’ proposal well received in Pine

A crowd of a couple dozen people gathered at the Pine Cafe to listen to Adams’ proposal.
Doug Toomer, who lives in Idaho Falls and is the founder of an organization called Stand Up For Idaho, said he liked what he saw and heard of the proposed amendment on Friday. 
Toomer said public lands are a major reason why people live in and love Idaho.
Idaho legislators celebrate death of proposal to sell off public lands

Toomer was opposed to U.S. Sen. Mike Lee’s unsuccessful effort earlier this year to make millions of acres of public lands, including in Idaho, available to be sold off. 
“It’s time for we the people to get our stuff together because we don’t want to lose everything that we have so only a few can enjoy it,” Toomer said.
Braxton McCoy, an east Idaho veteran who is president and chairman of the conservative Sagebrush Institute, introduced Adams in Pine and said he is supporting the proposed amendment.
In an interview with the Idaho Capital Sun, McCoy said protecting public lands is an important way to protect Western culture. 
“My general philosophy is America just isn’t America without access to public lands,” McCoy said.
“Without freedom to roam, our culture – the culture I grew up in, Western cowboy culture – just would not exist,” McCoy added. “We’d be relegated to broken arenas in Texas.”

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)A stairway without a safety gate. Rodent droppings on one floor, dog feces on another. A fridge that opened up to insulin and cough syrup, and a shelf of red wines, both easily accessible by kids. Missing or incomplete background checks for child care providers and staff.
These are a few of the more graphic examples of rules broken by Rhode Island child care providers, outlined in a new report by the Rhode Island Office of the Auditor General.
In fact, none of the 50 providers surveyed in the report were without at least one violation. 
Auditor General David Bergantino said via email Friday that it’s basically “expected” for providers to have at least one violation, given “the number of regulations they are subject to.”
More meaningful is the percentage of significant noncompliance, Bergantino said. 
The audit found that 60% of the 50 child care providers reviewed had the distinction of “significant noncompliance,” meaning they failed to meet at least 10% of the applicable health and safety requirements. Seven providers — 14% of the sample — were out of compliance with more than a quarter of the regulations reviewed.
From July 2022 through February 2025, Bergantino and his office reviewed 50 state-licensed child care facilities. Part of that period was spent on reviewing documentation, while on-site provider visits were conducted from November 2024 through February 2025. 
The complete lineup of violations included:

232 violations of facility health and safety requirements
920 cases of noncompliance for documentation for providers and staff. The Auditor General noted 320 deficiencies for staff, out of 464 staff overall.
Background check noncompliance was found at 26 of 50 facilities. Documents were lacking for 72 of the 464 child care staff in the survey.
Out of 50 providers, 43 lacked complete documentation for children, with 174 children missing required documentation overall. 

The state agencies responsible for ensuring compliance are the Office of Child Care, which licenses providers and conducts inspections, and its parent agency, the Department of Human Services (DHS). 
But there are only six licensing agents, plus an aide, who work with the department, the report states. There are far more providers: 812 in all, including 416 center-based providers, which are inspected at least twice yearly, plus 396 family child care providers inspected at least once annually. Family care providers are smaller, home-based programs which serve fewer children.
Across both types of facilities, the average caseload for an inspector is 135 providers.
Per state guidelines, the audited agencies are allowed a response to the findings within the report. A four-page appendix includes a response from Nicole Chiello, the associate director at the Office of Child Care.
“It is important to note that the level and frequency of on-site provider monitoring is at a maximum for the number of staff who are available to the unit,” Chiello wrote. “The licensors work hard to ensure their caseloads are met and their providers are monitored. More staff for the licensing unit would bring the caseloads down and allow the possibility of more monitoring visits.”
Jim Beardsworth, a DHS spokesperson, said via email Friday that the department “takes all findings seriously and is committed to the highest standards in the state’s child care facilities.”
“All findings from the Auditor General were addressed immediately; as part of its due diligence, DHS also conducted follow-up visits to ensure compliance,” Beardsworth wrote, and added that the department expects providers to adhere to its standards. 
The full report and a summary are on the auditor general’s website.

‘Not surprising,’ but also ‘really embarrassing’
Data from the Rhode Island KIDS COUNT 2025 factbook shows that, in December 2024, there were 6,600 child care subsidies provided through the state’s Child Care Assistance Program, which helps low-income working families afford child care.  
But, the Factbook also notes, the people who run centers out of homes are working class themselves: “Child care educators, almost all of whom are women and who are disproportionately Women of Color, are responsible for the safety, health, learning, and development of our youngest children yet make very low wages, and many are not able to meet their basic needs.”
Rep. Julie Casimiro, a North Kingstown Democrat, is not unsympathetic to the providers. She said in a phone interview Friday that the report is “alarming,” but also, “not surprising.”
“I think that while the report kind of slants toward the providers, I hold the Department [of Human Services] accountable,” Casimiro said.
A member of the Rhode Island House’s Committee on Oversight, Casimiro is well-acquainted with efforts to reform the department, especially when it comes to staffing. 
“[Inspectors] can go in and find all these deficiencies, but they don’t have the time to go back and follow up because their caseload is so high.”
In the past two legislative sessions, 2024 and 2025, Casimiro led a bill that would have lowered the number of child care providers for which a single state licensing inspector is responsible. The bill would accomplish this by increasing the overall number of inspectors to the nationally recommended average of 50 to 60 providers per one inspector. The bill made it to a committee hearing in 2024, but in 2025 it was introduced and failed to move any further. Nevertheless, Casimiro said she intends to re-introduce the bill again in the 2026 legislative session.
Casimiro said she’s not convinced the recurring problems with child care inspections are a funding issue for DHS, but rather an issue of how money is being spent. She added that she’d like to see an efficiency study for DHS like the one recently completed for the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA) amid its $10 million budget deficit.
“This was a perfect example where we could be giving great care to kids and getting them off on a really good start, but we’re failing them when you read this report,” she said. “We say we care about kids in this state, but our actions don’t say that.” 
Asked what she would say to parents who need child care and read the report, Casimiro replied, “I don’t know what to say to parents. I mean, this is embarrassing for the state. It’s really embarrassing.”

To get the Palmetto State to agree, the utility company wants to shuffle money around between customer groups to prevent potential sticker shock to its electric customers in the Upstate. (File photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)Duke Energy is asking state and federal regulators to approve to a merger of its two utility companies providing power to the Palmetto and Tar Heel states.
To get South Carolina to agree, the utility company wants to shuffle money around between customer groups to prevent potential sticker shock to its electric customers in the Upstate.
Duke’s customers in the Pee Dee and eastern North Carolina pay more per megawatt than customers in the Upstate, Charlotte area and western North Carolina. If the two come together, the company risks a major jump in monthly bills sent to customers in South Carolina’s northwest corner as they’re asked to pay more for a portion of the East’s more expensive power costs.
So, rather than possibly seeing their bills go down, Duke’s wholesale customers — which include South Carolina’s electric cooperatives — will forgo $55 million annually over five years to keep Upstate bills steady. Meanwhile, North Carolina customers would give up $25 million worth of savings annually over six years, according to filings made with the two states’ utility regulators.
That means the merger itself won’t make rates go up or down, according to the company.
Duke Energy has provided power in the Pee Dee for more than a decade, after buying out Progress Energy. Still, Duke operated the Progress territory as a separate entity, with the company saying in 2012 it would merge the two at a later date.
With the Carolinas continuing to rank among the fastest growing states in the nation, according to U.S. Census data, Duke Energy tells regulators now is the time to bring the two service areas under one umbrella.
The merger would cost about $143 million, according to company filings, which doesn’t detail what that includes. But the company says it could produce about $3.2 billion in cost savings by 2038 by negating the need for additional power generation.
That projection does not mean power bills will go down.
Nearly all of that savings would come from the two territories acting as one, instead of performing legal and regulatory gymnastics to get each area’s customers the power they demand, according to the filings.
Since the Progress buyout, Duke claims to have saved customers across both areas upwards of $1 billion by buying fuel in bulk and sharing power generated at plants across both territories.
“But regulations limit further coordination between the two utilities; only a full combination can unlock additional savings,” according to a company statement.
The 2012 agreement lets the two companies share power back and forth to meet spikes in demand as needed. But they each still have to own and operate their own power sources, enough to keep the lights on in the two territories separately.
Furthermore, when power companies begin the multi-year process of constructing a new power plant, they tend to overbuild in anticipation of future growth. Under its current arrangement, if Duke ends up with extra power in the Pee Dee, it can’t simply put that excess — from a power plant paid for by Pee Dee customers — toward meeting demand in the Upstate, and vice versa.
Merging the two areas into one big territory would change that and make Duke’s overall balance sheet look better to investors by not leaving underutilized power sources on the books, according to Duke Energy.
Federal regulations also require the company to have access to reserve power for emergencies and a strategy for what to do if either area’s largest respective power source goes down. If they joined together, they would need backup plans for just one plant — McGuire Nuclear Station near Charlotte — if the reactor couldn’t operate for whatever reason.
Duke’s target date for the merger is Jan. 1, 2027.
The merger is separate from Duke’s earlier requests to increase power rates for all of its 857,000 South Carolina customers.
Duke Energy again seeking to raise SC power bills

Power bills for Duke Energy residential customers in the Upstate could go up, on average, by $10.38 a month in March 2026. In the Pee Dee, residential customers could see a $21.66 monthly hike starting February 2026.
That would bring the bill for a so-called average household in the Upstate to about $154 a month.
Electricity would continue to be more expensive in the Pee Dee. The average bill for households there would rise to roughly $167 in March if the request is approved.
Then, if the merger is approved in 2027, Duke said it would gradually shift the two sets of rates until they are evenly matched.
Rates would still be handled differently across state lines, with North Carolina and South Carolina setting those separately under the authority of each state’s regulators.
The merger and rate hikes come on the heels of a massive new energy law signed by Gov. Henry McMaster in May.
Within that legislation is a provision making it easier for power companies to raise rates on an annual basis. Duke has not invoked the new process and has “not yet created a plan as to how and when to use this new tool,” a company spokesman previously told the SC Daily Gazette.
Still, the company highlighted the change as a positive when speaking with investors during its most recent earnings call last week.
At least one group — the South Carolina Policy Council, a think tank that advocates for limited government and free markets — remains skeptical that South Carolinians will benefit.
“They have their own reasons for the merger that are beneficial to them,” said Neil Wolin, a member of the Policy Council’s research team.
But it’s disingenuous to pitch the merger as a benefit and cost savings to customers when they won’t see any of that supposed savings in their utility bills, Wolin said.
“I don’t think South Carolinians are interested in deciphering” the benefits of rate relief amid rate hikes, Wolin continued. “They are getting their electricity bills, and they’re going up. No matter how many times (companies) say rates are going down, they are not. And that is the main issue.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/nj-powerlines-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-08-15 18:57:30.951016

Mississippi Action for Progress Inc., an administrator of Head Start pre-kindergarten centers, has lost funding to run its northern district centers – of which there are 28 listed on the group’s website – after the federal Administration for Children and Families found multiple deficiencies in MAP’s operations, including the group’s failure to report sexual abuse at one of its centers. MAP’s tax disclosures in 2024 showed that its revenue of $78,850,872 came entirely from government grants. 
Head Start is a federal program that, for 60 years, has provided early education and child care to low-income families with children younger than 5. Mississippi is one of a few states where Head Start is available in every county.
While the contract to administer those centers has recently been given to other nonprofits, parents of Head Start children and employees of MAP say they never received any formal communication from the organizations, leading to mass confusion and uncertainty, with questions from parents and teachers flooding Facebook. 
“In the coming weeks, the Office of Head Start will implement a plan to transition Early Head Start and Head Start operations to the leadership of these new grant awardees. This plan includes ensuring Head Start services for families who are expected to return in the fall,” the federal Office of Head Start told Mississippi Today. 
A letter reviewed by Mississippi Today that was sent by MAP Executive Director Bobby Brown to some employees on Friday said the Office of Head Start had asked MAP to provide “temporary, limited services” until “all locations have been transitioned to their new agencies.” While Brown said the temporary services would come with “some limitations and lower enrollment,” the letter did not provide clarity on the number of students who could be enrolled this year, or the number of teachers and staff MAP would retain, besides saying that “identified staff” would return on Tuesday for training and to prepare the centers.  
Despite repeated requests from Mississippi Today, representatives of MAP did not provide the number of students or workers they would retain. 
Mississippi Action for Progress was founded in 1966 with a biracial group of board members including civil rights activist Aaron Henry, who served as president of the Mississippi state conference of the NAACP, and Hodding Carter III, a Pulitzer Prize-winning newspaper publisher and journalist in Greenville. It was one of the earliest organizations in the state to have local Black leadership shape how federal dollars were spent. 
In the early years of the organization, Mississippi’s local government vetoed the spending of federal money and state officials threatened workers. Brown, who most recently drew a salary of $203,167 from the organization, has served as chief executive officer of MAP since at least 2001. He did not respond to repeated requests for comment. 
Scrambling to find child care
For parents and grandparents in north Mississippi, the loss of Head Start came at the worst time: the beginning of the school year. For caregivers, it sometimes has meant calling up day cares in neighboring towns.
“It was sort of a shock for everybody,” said Sheila Summerford, whose granddaughter was set to attend Head Start this month in Fulton.
She had to scramble to find a new day care. Even though Head Start is the best value option, Summerford says she was able to find room at a new day care near the flower store she owns off Main Street. Many centers were already full.
“Everybody’s kids that go there was pretty much just waiting on a start date. And then, I found out through Facebook that they’re not opening yet,” said Sabrina Celeste, mother of a 5-year-old who was also set to attend Head Start this year. 
“And then it was going around that they wasn’t even going to open. And then now somebody got on there and updated everybody, saying that some more companies had took over, but it’s not MAP anymore,” she said. Celeste and her husband have since been taking their daughter to work with them. “Gotta do what you gotta do.”
It’s not clear when the federal Office of Head Start notified MAP that it had not been awarded funding for the northern district. When Mississippi Today reporters visited MAP’s Jackson office Thursday, Ashley Nichols, MAP’s director of community development, said she could not remember the date of notification. 
No one else from MAP’s Jackson office could be reached in person or by phone or email. 
A federal monitoring review of MAP Head Start centers conducted in June 2023 found multiple deficiencies, including negative behaviors demonstrated by MAP staff “causing children to be afraid to attend the center and regress developmentally,” not following appropriate strategies to support children’s independence and individual needs around toileting, and the organization’s failure to report allegations of sexual assault to the Office of Head Start in a timely manner.
Because of the deficiencies, the Office of Head Start notified MAP in 2024 that it would need to re-compete for funding for the 2025 school year. 
Mississippi Today on Friday filed a public records request for all reports regarding MAP Head Starts in the northern district. 
“They should at least send out a text message or something, instead of people finding out through Facebook,” Celeste said. 
“I don’t know what’s going on.”
Kala Holt worked for 16 years for Head Start in Fulton. For the last week, she has called MAP’s Human Resources department, and has been sent to voicemail each time. She was hoping to secure her retirement money.
“I feel like my 16 years are gone. I’m not even sure I want to teach anymore,” she said. “My babies are my babies. I loved what I did. I loved the smile on their faces and the joy that came over them when they learned something new.”
This month, her husband had to ask his aunt for help paying their electricity bill. She said her health insurance is set to expire this month, and that she was focused on securing her retirement money, but when she called the firm, she said it redirected her to MAP’s HR department that ghosted her for a week.
“The unknown of not having a job is very, very stressful,” she said.
Ten employees of MAP Head Start centers told Mississippi Today they found out about the closures through social media and are struggling to find alternative employment, all the while dealing with a lack of communication from their superiors and MAP management. 
“I called down there, left voicemails, they haven’t returned my calls,” said a teacher who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation. 
Holt was expecting to come back to classes in mid August after three days of training in Jackson, like every other year. But no announcement came by the end of July about when class would resume. To this day, Holt hasn’t received any official word from MAP.
“A lot of us want to reapply for the job,” Holt said. “When can we reapply?”
Teachers who spent years at local Head Start centers were disappointed about the change. 
“It’s a messed up situation. I don’t know what’s going on. I put my heart in what I’m doing. The truth is, it’s tough when children don’t know, too,” said Jerry Smith, who was a Head Start teacher for 19 years in Tupelo.
Lately, he’s been helping out after school part time in Lee County. He’s still waiting to hear back on a start date for Head Start.
Longtime employees said they could not get in touch with the same MAP supervisors they would call monthly for check-ups. Some were unsure if they were still MAP employees.
For one pregnant employee who wished to remain anonymous while she navigated the job search process, optimism has turned to dread. She feels her pregnancy has hurt her employment chances. As a single mother, she needs the work.
Another former employee already took another job with a public school.
An employee and mother of two who recently got her associate’s degree in early childhood education found out through Facebook that the Head Start center where she worked for two years shut down and has not been able to find a new job. 
“I picked teaching, and I’m thinking I went to the wrong career,” she said.
“Any other place that I’ve ever worked, there’s an exit method set up for a smooth transition. But it was just like we went to the edge and they just pushed us over,” said another teacher who worked at her MAP Head Start center for six years.  
What’s next?
Federal funds have been allocated to four organizations to run the MAP centers that are closing, according to the Administration for Children and Families, which houses the Office of Head Start. 
Those organizations – Delta Health Alliance, Five County Child Development, Mississippi State University and Pearl River Valley Opportunity – have also been kept in the dark. 
Delta Health Alliance received its award letter Thursday, the day after the federal Office of Head Start told Mississippi Today that the group was a grantee. 
“The notification was back dated to Aug. 1,” said Rickey Lawson, communications coordinator for Delta Health Alliance. 
The organization is working quickly to offer Head Start and Early Head Start programs in Lee, Itawamba, Pontotoc and Union counties – where 465 children were previously enrolled in MAP Head Start Centers, Lawson said. 
The other three grantees did not respond to multiple requests for comment from Mississippi Today. 
U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson, a Democrat, told Mississippi Today he is monitoring the situation and wants to make sure the transition is seamless for families. 
“Normally, when an agency has trouble, they will contact my office for assistance, but for whatever reason once I was made aware of MAP’s situation, the decision had already been reached to put it out for competition,” Thompson said. “So my effort now is to make sure that those families and employees formerly affiliated with MAP would be given the same consideration for the new agency.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/15172940/IMG_2021.jpg,,,2025-08-15 18:57:30.951016

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — Two of the workers jailed after a high-profile June 10 immigration raid in Omaha were reunited on Friday with their families following a federal judge’s order that the government was unlawfully detaining the women.
The two workers, both women from Mexico, were released on a $15,000 bond that had been set more than a month ago by an immigration judge.

Thursday, U.S. District Court Senior Judge Joseph Bataillon ordered that Garcia Jimenez and Mayo Anicasion be released “immediately.” 
“We’re just ecstatic that our clients have been reunited with their families; that is the most important thing,” said Sydney Hayes of Gutman Law Group, who is part of the legal team representing the women. She said the two returned to Omaha Friday.
Lawyers for the U.S. Department of Justice and the Lincoln County Sheriff did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Among those listed as defendants were Lincoln County Sheriff Jerome Kramer, President Donald Trump, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, the U.S. Attorney General and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 
Bataillon’s Thursday order said the government was violating the women’s due process rights by unlawfully detaining them under an “automatic stay” of the bond he noted had been determined appropriate by “a duly appointed immigration judge.”
The government’s appeal came within days of a key July 8 memo by Trump’s administration that essentially stopped bond hearings for most undocumented immigrants as they fight deportation. Removal proceedings take months or years. Some immigration lawyers view the new Trump policy as a tactic to push undocumented workers to self-deport. 
In the situations of Garcia Jimenez and Mayo Anicasio, their legal battles are far from over. Their attorneys will continue to try and build cases as to why they should remain in the United States. Upon their release Friday, that can happen while they are with their families in Omaha versus a North Platte jail where many of those detained from the Glenn Valley Foods worksite raid remain.
The Mexican women’s cases are similar to that of another Glenn Valley Foods worker represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska. A hearing for Maria Reynosa Jacinto, a native of Guatemala, is to be held next week in Batallion’s courtroom.
ACLU files challenge to prolonged jailing of immigrant snagged in Omaha ICE raid

The ACLU challenged Reynosa Jacinto’s prolonged detention in a federal civil rights lawsuit that argues the automatic stay unlawfully violated the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment and goes beyond the federal government’s authority by overriding an immigration judge’s decision on bond.
Reynosa Jacinto remains in the North Platte jail despite an Omaha immigration judge’s July 15 ruling that she could be released on a $9,000 bond that had been posted.
“There is no due process when the government, who lost the argument in court, gets to do what they want anyway,” the ACLU wrote in its challenge.
Federal ICE officials have said repeatedly that the focus after the raid — which led to the apprehension of about 75 allegedly undocumented workers — should be on U.S. citizen “victims” whose identities were allegedly stolen by undocumented immigrants to work at the Glenn Valley plant.
The new no-bond practice urged in the Trump administration’s memo is the subject of a national class action lawsuit filed by immigrant rights advocates, including the national ACLU.
Bataillon did not make a determination on the validity of the Trump administration’s new policy, though his opinion said he tended to agree with the plaintiff’s lawyers. 
“The Court is concerned only with the lawfulness of the automatic stay, the present basis for petitioner’s detention,” he said, and agreed that continued detention of the women violated due process rights.

(Photo illustration of Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch) In the hope of prompting further study, research from Iowa State University is revealing nuance present in an answer to an increasingly asked question: Why are marriage rates falling, and is more education making an impact?
ISU economics professor John Winters and Kunwon Ahn, an ISU alum currently working as an associate research fellow at the Korea Labor Institute, published a study comparing marriage rates of groups at different ages to the level of education they’re likely to have. While they found going to college makes someone less likely to get married at a younger age, in older age groups the answers get more complicated.
Winters said the relationship between marriage and higher education is a tricky one, as historical data says one thing while cross-sectional data, or data of a population at one point in time, says another.
“We really wanted to get into this and try to get an estimate of the causal impact,” Winters said.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Education has been an area of study for Winters for nearly his entire career, he said, but marriage is something new for him. He took an interest in marriage after looking at how rates of people having children have changed over time, and he and Ahn decided to see if there was any relationship to be found.
Trend data has shown that when education rates rise, marriage rates fall, Winters said, but cross-sectional data indicates people with more education are more likely to be married than those with less.
An initial look at education and marriage trends would lead some people to believe rising education is causing fewer marriages, but Winters said it isn’t nearly that simple.
Using data from the American Community Survey, which includes information from as many as eight million people, and information from previous decennial censuses, Winters and Ahn built cohorts of groups across the years to assess maternal education levels from the 1980s and compare it to adults surveyed between 2006 and 2019.
Rather than looking at individual data lines to see how much education someone has received, Winters said they took average education levels across the cohort, as it helped in predicting education rates of the next generations. This helped the researchers look at potential causal relationships by eliminating other factors that could determine someone’s decisions about marriage or school.
What the researchers found is that there is evidence that education lowers the marriage rate for people ages 25-34, but that doesn’t mean they won’t ever get married. For those ages 45-54, however, education isn’t having an impact on marriage rates. Winters said receiving more education definitely delays marriage, but many people “catch up” later on.
“We find clear evidence that additional education, additional schooling, is lowering their marriage rates,” Winters said. “But once we move past that, we don’t see as much of an adverse effect. So by the time we get to ages 45 to 54 which is kind of our oldest cohort that we can examine here, there’s really no difference.”
Even within those findings, Winters said there is still nuance to be found in the relationship between education and matrimony. While education slightly increases the chances of someone never getting married, he said it also lowers rates of divorce and separation.
This study helps in calming any fears about the possibility of too much education driving marriage rates to zero, Winters said, but it still leaves open another question — if education isn’t driving marriage rate fluctuations, what is?
Further study of other factors impacting marriage could help chip away at this query, Winters said, and maybe answer others. Looking at marriage rates as well as fertility rates, and researching the economic drivers and resources that both provide and take, is another area with economic consequences Winter believes should be studied.
“We didn’t necessarily have really strong beliefs in terms of what we would find,” Winters said. “So finding these results, really, we do think was informative. We think it’s helpful to understand that your education does interact with marriage and kind of these interesting ways.”

(Photo: Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)Federal officials announced Friday they would continue water allocation cuts on the Colorado River for the fifth consecutive year following a persistent drought that’s shrunken the river’s largest reservoir.
The Bureau of Reclamation announced that Tier 1 water cuts — the least severe shortage condition — would continue next year to preserve water levels at Lake Mead, which supplies about 90% of  Las Vegas’ water. 
Federal water managers decide shortage levels each year in August, based on projected water levels at Lake Mead and Lake Powell for the start of the following year.
Lake Mead’s elevation is currently at about 1,054 feet above sea level – 175 feet below what’s considered full. Based on water storage, the reservoir is at 31% of capacity. Friday BuRec projected that by the end of this year water elevation will be only a foot higher.
The water cuts are aimed at Arizona and Nevada, which will lose 18% and 7% of their annual allotment of Colorado River water once again. Mexico, which also receives water from the river, will see its annual allotment reduced by 5%, federal officials said. 
The continued cuts underscore “the importance of immediate action to secure the future of the Colorado River,” said David Palumbo, the Bureau of Reclamation’s acting commissioner in a statement, adding that “we must develop new, sustainable operating guidelines that are robust enough to withstand ongoing drought and poor runoff conditions.”
Nevada’s cut amounts to a loss of 21,000 acre-feet of water for another year. However, the cuts are not expected to affect Nevada water users. 
Southern Nevada is allowed 300,000 acre-feet from the Colorado River, but has not used its full allocation in years thanks to conservation efforts. Last year, Nevada only used about 212,000 acre-feet of water, a reduction of nearly 6% compared to the previous year.
Nevada also returned about 244,000 acre-feet back to Lake Mead in 2024 through a community-wide water recycling program, which allowed the state to take more water from the lake. 
“As the smallest user of the Colorado River, Nevada has reduced its consumption of Colorado River water by 36 percent over the past two decades,” said Bronson Mack, SNWA spokesperson in a statement. “The Bureau of Reclamation’s recent study underscores the impact that climate change is having on the river system and the critical importance of broad conservation strategies throughout the Colorado River Basin.”
The cuts announced Friday are in the same Tier 1 category declared last year and in 2021, when the first federal cutback on the Colorado River water took effect. A “Tier 2” water shortage for 2023 resulted in even steeper cuts.
Based on Reclamation’s most recent hydraulic models, Lake Mead water level will likely fall below 1,050 feet by July 2026, triggering another Tier 2 shortage that would reduce annual available water for Nevada by another 4,000 acre-feet.
The lackluster reservoir forecast follows a winter of below-average snowpack across the Upper Colorado River Basin, a major source of snowmelt for Lake Mead and Lake Powell. 
Hydraulic studies by the federal government show the river’s flow will likely decrease by 3 million acre-feet of water in the next decade, making conservation efforts more urgent. 
The Colorado River Basin supplies drinking water to 40 million people across the lower basin — Arizona, California, Nevada and Mexico — and the upper basin — Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming.
The water cuts come as the seven states that share the Colorado River’s water are in deadlocked negotiations over how the river and its reservoirs should be managed after current guidelines expire at the end of 2026.
Negotiations have continued behind closed doors for months as water officials try to reach an agreement. Upper and Lower Basin states have remained split on which half of the river should decrease their water use, and by how much. 
The federal government has given the states until mid-November to come up with a draft for a new plan. If they can’t reach a deal ahead of a 2026 deadline, the federal government can step in and make those decisions itself.
“As the basin prepares for the transition to post-2026 operating guidelines, the urgency for the seven Colorado River Basin states to reach a consensus agreement has never been clearer. We cannot afford to delay,” said Department of the Interior’s Acting Assistant Secretary for Water and Science Scott Cameron. “The health of the Colorado River system and the livelihoods that depend on it are relying on our ability to collaborate effectively and craft forward-thinking solutions that prioritize conservation, efficiency, and resilience.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/DSC00097-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-15 18:57:30.951016

(Photo by Greg Kramos / U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)TOPEKA — The lesser prairie chicken, a dancing grouse that has long teetered between threatened and endangered classifications, lost its federal protections in court in a victory for Great Plains petroleum and cattle industries.
In a Tuesday decision from a Texas federal court, the lesser prairie chicken was stripped of any endangered or threatened species protections, which were established through a Biden-era ruling.
The Trump administration challenged that ruling, arguing it contained mistakes, and the lesser prairie chicken would be adequately protected without endangered or threatened classifications.
U.S. District Judge David Counts, a Trump appointee, agreed, denying a slate of motions in a 15-page omnibus order that reversed the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s 2022 classifications.
The lesser prairie chicken forages on what’s widely considered to be prime ranching and drilling land in the grasslands and brush of southwestern Kansas, southeastern Colorado, eastern New Mexico, western Oklahoma and the panhandle and south plains of Texas. The bird was first protected in 2014, a decision that was overturned a year later.
In the 2022 classifications, the bird’s populations were divided into a southern range in New Mexico and the southwest Texas Panhandle, where it was listed as endangered, and a northern range in Kansas, Oklahoma and the northeast Texas Panhandle, where it was listed as threatened.
More than 70% of the estimated lesser prairie chicken population resides in Kansas.
Fish and Wildlife Service admitted in the case that it erred in creating two distinct populations of lesser prairie chickens, and it failed to justify the classification of the two distinct population segments — northern and southern, Counts said.
He added that “the later endangered and threatened findings have no leg to stand on.”
“Fish and Wildlife is unable to correct this square one error without engaging in an entirely new analysis,” he said.
Counts reasoned that any “disruptive consequences” of removing protections “are short-lived and minimized by the sixteen existing voluntary conservation programs and efforts in place across the range of the lesser prairie-chicken.”
Many of those programs, which are administered by federal, state and private groups, existed before the 2022 listing decision and were designed to mitigate threats to the lesser prairie chicken and its habitat, Counts said.
“These efforts are not thought to be inadequate over the short term,” he said. “Rather, even the current listing decision couched their inadequacies in the long term — a span of 25 years.”
The decision is a win for Kansas agricultural and energy producers, said U.S. Rep. Tracey Mann, who has publicly opposed listing the lesser prairie chicken since 2021. He added it is “a huge loss for radical climate activists and bureaucrats who have abused the Endangered Species Act for over a decade to hurt American agriculture and energy production.”
“Kansas farmers, ranchers and agricultural producers have always been and always will be the original conservationists of the land,” he said.
Mann was behind a bill this year that delisted the lesser prairie chicken and prevented any future efforts to relist it. However, the legislation did not progress.
Matt Teagarden, CEO of the Kansas Livestock Association, said in an emailed statement that the 2022 ruling contained “significant flaws” that “disproportionately affected livestock operations.” He said the association, which was part of the lawsuit, is pleased the Trump administration is reexamining the listing.
“Over the coming months,” he said, “we hope the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will take into account the voluntary conservation efforts already taking place, most of which are being done by ranchers.”
Texas agencies initially sued the Fish and Wildlife Service in March 2023. Among them was the state’s railroad commission, which regulates oil and natural gas production in the state. Attorneys general in Kansas and Oklahoma and the petroleum and cattle industries later joined the suit.
Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach and Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond celebrated the decision.
“The listing of the species as threatened or endangered would have crippled oil and wind energy production and would have limited where and when Kansas ranchers could graze cattle on their own property,” Kobach said in a Friday news release.
Drummond said in a Wednesday news release that he had called the Biden administration’s ruling “outrageous and illegal federal overreach.”
“This court decision affirms we were right,” Drummond said. “Oklahoma’s cattle grazing, energy production and rural economy are no longer under siege by this unlawful regulation.”
In Kobach’s initial argument in federal court, he worried Kansas would lose revenues from cattle ranching, farming, oil and gas production, wind energy production and tourism if the lesser prairie chicken’s threatened status stood. He worried the status would lead to job losses in the state, which would “further adversely impact state tax revenues, in addition to causing social instability among Kansans who lose their jobs.”
Under the Endangered Species Act, the habitat and species protections that accompany a threatened or endangered status determination curtail certain land uses such as cattle ranching, oil drilling and energy production in protected habitats.
Jason Rylander, legal director of the Center for Biological Diversity’s Climate Law Institute, which was an intervenor in the case, said the Trump administration’s rationale for removing the lesser prairie chicken’s protections was in bad faith.
“This ruling has nothing to do with science or the law and everything to do with kowtowing to the oil and gas industry,” he said. “We won’t be silent witnesses while the Trump administration and fossil fuel companies try to carve up what’s left of these dancing birds’ habitat and doom them to extinction.”
But the fight for the lesser prairie chicken is not over, Rylander said.
The institute is considering its legal options, including a possible appeal of Counts’ decision and a new petition with the USFWS to relist the lesser prairie chicken.

Gov. Phil Scott has turned down a second request from President Donald Trump’s administration in as many months to use members of the Vermont National Guard to carry out elements of the White House’s controversial domestic policy agenda. 
The Department of Defense last week asked Scott for “a few dozen” troops it could deploy to Washington, D.C., as part of the president’s sweeping push to crack down on crime in the city, Vermont Public reported Friday. But the governor said no, telling the Pentagon he didn’t think the request was an appropriate use of the guard’s resources, according to the news outlet.
Dustin Degree, a spokesperson for Scott’s office, referred VTDigger to the Vermont Public story in response to a request for comment Friday afternoon. He declined to be interviewed or answer questions about the governor’s decision.

Trump has ordered hundreds of troops onto the streets of the nation’s capital in recent days and moved to assert federal control over the city’s police department. At a press conference Monday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said states could be called on to reinforce the city’s national guard, if needed. On Friday, Washington, D.C., Attorney General Brian Schwalb sued the Trump administration over its efforts to take control of the local police force.
In late July, Scott rejected a separate request from the Trump administration to allow a dozen Vermont guard troops to do clerical work for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement at the federal agency’s field office in St. Albans.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — University of Nebraska President Jeffrey Gold will not keep a performance-based 15% salary bonus and will instead donate the funds to support campus programs.
Gold announced the decision Friday, a day after the NU Board of Regents voted 6-2 to award him the $159,386 bonus on top of his base salary of $1.06 million. Multiple regents said the question wasn’t whether Gold had earned the bonus. The metrics the regents baked into Gold’s employment contract after each year in office said he had. Instead, some regents said it was a question of how to pay for it.
NU faces a systemwide budget deficit of $20 million, which Gold cited for declining his bonus.
“I am grateful for the strong support of the Board of Regents and inspired every day by our students, faculty and staff,” Gold said in a Friday statement. “It is an honor to be able to make this decision to support our university and the communities we serve during this critical time for higher education.”

Regent Paul Kenney of Amherst, chair of the NU Board of Regents, praised Gold’s decision and for a tenure that “has consistently put students at the center of his leadership.”
“We are grateful for his generosity and for the example he continues to set for our university community,” Kenney said in a Friday statement.
‘A financial bind’
Regents Kathy Wilmot of Beaver City and Jim Scheer of Norfolk opposed paying the bonus, both suggesting that finding an alternative funding source would be better.
Scheer, a former speaker of the Nebraska Legislature, which decides how much the state funds NU, said his opposing vote was “not one of disrespect” for Gold, a sentiment Wilmot echoed.
“We are in a financial bind,” Scheer said. “We are continuing to have to reduce services and other things across all the campuses to rectify our budget problems.”

Wilmot said she has seen how much Nebraskans appreciate Gold when he’s out in the community, and she said she knows he has “definitely” met the requirements for merit pay. However, she said, families and students will be impacted by budget cuts and tuition hikes.
Part of NU’s budget shortfall comes with the slowing of year-to-year increases in state funding under Gov. Jim Pillen, a former regent for 10 years before becoming governor in 2023. NU will offer a buyout program this fall for tenured NU faculty who are at least 62 years old and have 10 years of service to NU.
Other NU campus leaders will need to find specific ways to save funds, such as the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, which is planning to cut $27.5 million by the end of the year to help close the systemwide budget hole and also close a campus-specific shortfall.
‘Baked into the contract’
Regent Rob Schafer of Beatrice joined Wilmot in June to oppose NU’s 2025-26 operating budget of $1.1 billion, which is composed of tuition and state dollars. He did so in part because it included a 5% tuition increase, which he said was a policy choice. 
However, with the board’s contract with Gold, Schafer said regents had agreed “to pay him X, and if he performs Y, then he also gets Z.”
“It’s baked into the contract. It’s not a discretionary bonus or anything,” Schafer said Thursday.

Regents Elizabeth O’Connor and Jack Stark, both of Omaha, said the board’s hesitation to pay Gold’s bonus could set a bad precedent. They worried about what message it might send.
“The university cannot enter into contracts, refuse to honor them and look for private entities to bail us out,” O’Connor said. “That’s a non-starter.”
Faculty and staff concerns
Sarah Zuckerman, an associate professor of educational administration at UNL and president of the campus chapter of the American Association of University Professors, was among those calling for Gold to donate his awarded bonus. 
She noted NU presidential salaries have ballooned 281% since 2012, standing as a “stark contrast” to faculty and staff salaries.
“Tenure-line faculty are increasingly replaced with contingent faculty who are paid less and have fewer academic freedom protections,” Zuckerman told the Nebraska Examiner.

Upon learning of Gold’s decision not to keep his bonus and to donate it, Zuckerman said the AAUP UNL chapter is appreciative of his action but still concerned, as UNL faculty and staff have been “demoralized” after significant annual budget cuts while being asked to do more with less as executive compensation continues to rise.
NU’s operating budget for this fiscal year also included no across-the-board merit pay pool for campus staff, meaning most non-professorial employees at NU will not receive a raise.
‘Worth every dollar’
Schafer, who has served as a regent since 2013, said he has served with multiple NU presidents, but he said none had brought “as much talent to the table” or “accomplished more to move Nebraska ahead” than Gold.
Regent Tim Clare of Lincoln, who has served as a regent since 2009, said he was honored to vote for the bonus as Gold has “done absolutely everything we’ve asked.”
University of Nebraska Medical Center Student Regent Brock Calamari said Gold had shown he would exceed board expectations while also fulfilling a pledge to listen to and seriously consider student opinions. Gold previously served as UNMC chancellor for 10 years.
Said Calamari: “I think he’s worth every dollar that we give him.”

(Photo via Google Earth) For the second time in eight months, the state-run Woodward Resource Center for disabled individuals has been fined for failing to check on, and provide CPR for, residents who subsequently died.
The Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing alleges that in May 2025 the residential care facility, which is run by the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services, placed residents of the home in immediate jeopardy by failing to ensure the third-shift staff followed procedures in checking on residents overnight and in responding to emergency situations.
That failure, DIAL alleges, resulted in the death of a 49-year-old male resident with a profound intellectual disorder and several other diagnoses.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
According to DIAL, the staff was to check on the man every 15 minutes from 10 p.m. to 11 p.m., and every 30 minutes from 11 p.m. to 5:30 a.m. The inspectors’ report states that video footage shows that from 10:32 p.m. on May 1, 2025, through 5:13 a.m. the next day, a state-employed residential treatment worker “sat in the living room loveseat on his cell phone,” and failed to perform 14 scheduled checks on the resident.
The video allegedly shows the worker entering the resident’s room for the first time at 5:13 a.m. on May 2. The worker “pulled, pushed, and lifted” the resident from the foot of the bed for four minutes, according to inspectors. At 5:17 a.m., the worker walked out of the man’s room and stood in the hall. A minute later, he alerted a colleague who called a “code blue,” indicating an emergency.
Another worker checked on the man and, according to inspectors, later described the resident as lying “on his stomach in bed, covered in feces.” At 5:22 a.m., the staff lowered the man to the floor and two workers “stood at the end of the room and talked,” according to inspectors.
One employee later told inspectors that he recalled arriving on the scene and saying to his colleagues, “We’re not doing CPR?” That employee said that before beginning CPR, he left the room to find a set of gloves since the resident “had feces all over him.”
By the time he returned, someone else had begun CPR. A paramedic who arrived on the scene a short time later called the time of death at 6:03 a.m., according to inspectors.
The resident’s death certificate indicated the man died from sepsis caused by an infection related to a perforation of the small intestine.
When interviewed by state inspectors, the worker who had been tasked with checking on the man during the night allegedly stated that he had opted to watch the resident’s bedroom from the living room loveseat rather than check on the resident in the bedroom. The worker also is alleged to have said he “disagreed” with Woodward’s policy of requiring workers to lay eyes on residents when performing overnight bed checks.
Another employee of the home told inspectors the worker tasked with checking on the man had a “very relaxed work style” and would complete a sleep check on residents at the beginning of his shift and not complete another check until the morning, just before the first shift reported for work.
The assistant superintendent of the Woodward Resource Center later confirmed for inspectors that the staff failed to check on the resident as required and failed to immediately initiate CPR in accordance with the facility’s emergency-response procedures.
DIAL fined the home $10,000 but then tripled that penalty to $30,000 due to the repeat nature of the violation.
Bed checks and CPR were an issue in previous death 
The incident marks the fifth time in the past nine months that the Woodward Resource Center has been fined for regulatory violations. The other 2025 incidents include:
— December 2024: DIAL fined the resource center $500 for resident abuse. Inspectors reported that a worker at the home approached a resident who was seated in a recliner and “gave the back of the recliner a hard shove to the ground (and the resident) somersaulted out backwards.” Two workers witnessed the incident but allegedly failed to report it.
— January 2025: DIAL fined the home $10,000 for failing to provide adequate supervision of residents and failing to provide an adequate emergency medical response to a situation. In that case, a 22-year-old resident of the home was found unresponsive at 5 a.m. on Sept 9, 2024, and was later declared dead a short time later. Video surveillance indicated the staff failed to perform the required checks on the man during the night and then failed to immediately administer CPR when the man was found unresponsive.
— February 2025: DIAL fined the home $4,250 after the staff at Woodward allegedly failed to provide clients with their prescribed diets.
— May 2025: DIAL fined the home $2,750 for failing to consistently provide behavioral supports, including client supervision, after a resident of the home swallowed a plastic spoon and had to undergo an emergency endoscopy. An additional fine of $3,500 was imposed for failing to provide appropriate nursing care for a different resident.

Ellison's term at chief prosecutor in New Mexico was extended for another 210 days, following a move by the Department of Justice(courtesy U.S. Attorney's Office)“Interim” U.S. Attorney for New Mexico Ryan Ellison is now “acting” US attorney, following a Justice Department move that extends the state’s chief federal prosecutor’s term until next year without Senate or federal court approval.
Ellison’s office announced the extension Friday, coinciding with the legal end of his 120-day interim status that began when U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi appointed him in April. The extension means he can continue as before leading an office of about 200 employees, including lawyers and contractors.
“I look forward to working with public servants of all political stripes to combat crime in New Mexico,” Ellison said in a news release Friday. “In the interim, I will continue to lead the United States Attorney’s Office in the same way that I have over the last four months—without fear, without favor, and with public safety as my top priority.”
Gang prosecutor appointed as new U.S. attorney for the District of New Mexico

The announced extension of 210 days comes the day after a panel of New Mexico federal judges, in a brief statement posted to the court’s website, declined to approve his appointment. But the panel also declined to name an alternative to the post, which it is empowered to do while an official confirmation plays out in the Senate. 
Typically, panels like this one approve the interim appointment, if a Senate confirmation is pending. The Senate makes those appointments permanent through confirmation.
New Mexico federal court spokesperson Heather Small declined to comment on why the federal judge panel declined to approve him but also didn’t name someone to take his place. 
Ellison, in the statement, said “I applaud New Mexico’s federal district judges for declining to appoint someone other than the Trump Administration’s choice.”
The court’s neutral decision on Ellison’s approval comes a month after a federal judge chastised him for his implementation and prosecution of immigrants arrested within a newly militarized zone along New Mexico’s shared border with Mexico.

Ellison is just the latest chief prosecutor across the country whose term has been extended by the attorney general through what’s known as the Federal Vacancy Act. Before Ellison, four others received special appointments from the executive branch, according to Bloomberg, instead of the typical judicial approval of interim US attorneys whom the Senate hasn’t yet confirmed. 
U.S. Sens. Martin Heinrich and Ben Ray Luján, both New Mexico Democrats, denounced the extension and said it amounts to  “a deliberate attempt to circumvent” oversight from the Senate or District Court. 
“While we are committed to reviewing [Ellison’s] application and credentials, we are extremely concerned by this administration’s continuing willingness to trample the role of the Judiciary and Congress,” the pair wrote in a Friday news release. 
According to Heinrich’s office, Ellison only last week submitted the final version of an application form to Heinrich’s office that is required for his Senate confirmation process “after substantial prodding by the Senator’s staff,” said spokesperson Luis Soriano in an email to Source New Mexico. 
“Now that the application has been received, the Senators and their staff will review Ellison’s answers and the materials that he has provided, while also conducting an independent vetting process, consistent with how the Senators have approached all prior vacancies,” Soriano said. 
Tessa Duberry, a spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney’s Office, declined to comment on his application to be considered for Senate approval. 
President Donald Trump has not officially nominated him for the post, which is also required before he can be confirmed in the Senate.
The Department of Justice did not respond to a request for comment from Source New Mexico on Friday.
While Heinrich’s office declined to comment on whether he will ultimately vote for Ellison, his office has previously been critical of Ellison’s efforts to crack down on border crossings in New Mexico.
 In April, shortly after being appointed, Ellison stood alongside Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to tout a newly created military border zone along New Mexico’s shared border with Mexico. Ellison announced the new zone enabled him to bring new misdemeanor charges against people who, with the Army’s help, were arrested within the border zone.
Confusion reigns in New Mexico’s militarized border zone

But the creation of the border zone created confusion among recreators and residents who live near the border, and a federal magistrate judge dismissed more than 100 early cases because Ellison’s office failed to demonstrate the people arrested knowingly trespassed. Prosecutors then self-dismissed three cases due to confusion about the border zone’s boundaries.
In mid-July, a federal judge in Las Cruces dismissed one case “with prejudice,” meaning prosecutors can’t bring it again, issuing a scathing ruling that said Ellison’s office failed to ensure defendants constitutional rights in hundreds of the cases. 
“The Government’s inattention to statutory and constitutional rights has been a consistent throughline through these hundreds of cases,” District Court Judge Margaret Strickland wrote. “Time and time again the Government has initiated a prosecution… only to turn around within days and deport the defendant while the charges are pending and thereby necessarily imperil the defendant’s Fifth Amendment, Sixth Amendment, and Speedy Trial Act rights.”
At least two of the prosecutions resulted in convictions, and Ellison’s statement Friday touted his office’s crackdown on illegal immigration and crime. According to his statement, illegal border crossings are down 92% and immigration-related prosecutions are up 180%.
“Our partnership with the U.S. military and the U.S. Border Patrol has made our southern border more secure than at any point in our nation’s history,” he said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image009-1024x827.jpg,,,2025-08-15 18:57:30.951016

(Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)A second group of Montanans has launched a campaign to amend the state constitution to ensure that candidates for court races are elected without political affiliation. 
Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts on Friday launched a political committee and released two versions of proposed ballot language to enshrine a nonpartisan judicial system in the state during the 2026 election. 
“We’re proud to be launching this long-planned effort to protect Montana courts from partisan influence,” Caitie Butler, spokesperson for Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts, said in a press release. “Our campaign builds on years of successful efforts to ensure that judges are accountable to the citizens of Montana and the constitution, not politicians.”
Another committee, Montanans for Fair and Impartial Judges, launched its own constitutional initiative campaign in June. 
Throughout the 2025 Legislature, Republican leadership, including Gov. Greg Gianforte, pushed to make changes to the state’s judicial system.
Among the ideas to increase transparency and accountability to the court system was a plan to allow judges to run under party labels, removing the idea of a nonpartisan court. 
Many Republicans who advocated for the more than seven bills pushing partisanship onto the bench said it would merely clarify what they perceived as an already partisan system.
But detractors, including Montana Supreme Court Chief Justice Cory Swanson, argued that the answer is not to lean further into political alignment. 
While all bills related to political judicial races — except one allowing political parties to donate to judicial candidates — died in the Legislature, the conversations continued after lawmakers left Helena.
Now, two separate groups are working to codify nonpartisan elections in Montana’s constitution.
Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts is a coalition comprising multiple advocacy groups throughout the state including Montana Federation of Public Employees, Big Sky 55+, ACLU of Montana, Forward Montana, and Catalyst Montanan. The coalition has “extensive experience defending Montana’s courts and running successful campaigns to limit the influence of politicians and party bosses in our court system,” according to the press release. 
A committee spokesperson did not directly address a question about why the groups aren’t working together.
However, she said the committee undertook a “lengthy, thorough and responsible” research phase and legal review before publicly launching its campaign. 
“This group has been exploring this for many months,” Butler said. “A lot of the groups involved were also heavily involved in making sure the legislature didn’t make the courts partisan.”
Members of many of the groups publicly supporting the committee, including Big Sky 55+, testified numerous times before the Legislature about why judges should remain as apolitical as possible. 
“Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts believes that judges should be accountable to the citizens of Montana and the constitution, not politicians, party bosses, or donors,” Executive Director of Big Sky 55+ Trent Bolger said in a press release. “These measures ensure the people of Montana get to pick judges who will adhere to the constitution rather than a party line.”
The committee has submitted two ballot initiatives with similar language. Both ensure that all elected judges remain nonpartisan, but one adds an additional provision that any new courts created in the state must also adhere to a nonpartisan election for judges. 
The shared language of both initiatives inserts the following language into Article VII of the state constitution: “Judicial elections shall remain nonpartisan.”
Former Montana Supreme Court Chief Justice Mike McGrath endorsed the committee’s efforts in their announcement.
“It’s simple — judges should be elected based on their record and qualifications alone. Montana citizens deserve to have their cases decided by independent judges, based on the law and facts of each case, without regard to party affiliation,” McGrath said. “The measures Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts submitted today protect our long-standing tradition of electing judges based on the person, not the party.”
The committee also shared the support of former Republican state Sen. Bruce Tutvedt for the ballot measures. 
In early June, Montanans for Fair and Impartial Judges launched its campaign to put a nonpartisan judiciary constitutional initiative to voters in 2026. 
Montanans for Fair and Impartial Judges is led by Pepper Petersen and Ted Dick, the same team behind the ballot initiatives in 2020 which legalized adult use of recreational marijuana.
Petersen told the Daily Montanan earlier this summer that his decades of political work in the state working on issues from coal mining, to gun rights, to marijuana, makes them the right group to bring forward the initiative.
Montanans for Fair and Impartial Judges has earned endorsements from many political pillars of Montana’s past, including Democrats and Republicans. 
“Without independent judges, our entire system of government, our democracy and our way of life fall apart,” former Republican Gov. Marc Racicot said in an endorsement video last week. 
Former Democratic Gov. Brian Schweitzer also endorsed the campaign, as has former Republican Secretary of State Bob Brown, former U.S. Senator Max Baucus, a Democrat, and multiple current and former legislators. 
The filing language for the Fair and Impartial Judges ballot initiative states would add the following into Article VII, section 8 of the Montana Constitution: 
“Supreme court justices and district court judges shall be elected in nonpartisan elections by the qualified electors as provided by law.”
The Daily Montanan was unable to reach Petersen to ask about the competing initiative by publication time.
Such ballot campaigns are expensive to run, but can be lucrative to those in charge.
In campaign finance filings from the end of June, the Fair and Impartial Judges committee reported receiving $20,881 in donations while spending more than $61,000.
The expenses included paying Ted Dick through Bolder Action Consulting $37,500 and Pepper Petersen through Coldwater Group $24,000. 
Financial reports for Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts will be submitted at the end of the quarter.
The two committees are completely independent of each other and not collaborating, but Butler, the Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts spokesperson, said that they have the same goal — preserving nonpartisan judicial elections in Montana. 
She added that the lengthy process for approving constitutional initiatives — by the Secretary of State and the Attorney General — before signature gathering can begin can benefit from having multiple proposals on the table. 
“Multiple policies ensures maximum flexibility in getting a policy through,” Butler told the Daily Montanan.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Old_Supco2-1024x717.jpg,,,2025-08-15 17:57:01.501929

“So this is a different sort of story of immigration because they’re not people who came to America with a plan or even a dream,” an immigration attorney said.

When Nathan Fry served in Afghanistan, he said he met dozens of people who believed in the idea of a free, democratic society and worked tirelessly alongside the U.S. military toward that dream, often at the risk of their own safety.
“They still want to live in a free and democratic society,” he said. “If they can’t do so in Afghanistan, then any endeavor that we can embark on to get them to the United States and help them be a member of a free and democratic society, like part of their dream, I think that’s a worthy cause.”
Fry, of Hinesburg, is a U.S. Army veteran who served in Afghanistan from 2012 to 2013 and teaches international relations as an adjunct professor at the University of Vermont.
Four years after the Taliban regained control of Kabul and U.S. troops withdrew from America’s longest war, Afghan refugees across the U.S., including in Vermont, are still waiting to relocate with their families as the Trump administration’s effort to crack down on all forms of immigration has significantly slowed the process.

“Afghans in Vermont continue to express fear and worry over their loved ones who have not yet been able to join them here,” said Tracy Dolan, director of the state refugee office. 
“Parents, spouses and children remain stuck in dangerous or difficult circumstances and there are many Afghans here who feel that their hearts are torn between Vermont, and Afghanistan and Pakistan or other countries where some of their family members remain waiting for word that they can finally come to join their families in the U.S.,” she wrote in an email Friday.
Vermont has rehomed about 650 refugees from the Central Asian country where Taliban extremists continue their repressive rule going into a fifth year amid continued violence. Recent reports from the United Nations outline worsening human rights in Afghanistan, including restrictions on women’s rights, access to health, education and freedom of movement.

“The U.S. Government has an obligation to keep its promise to these Afghan allies. This 4-year anniversary, we also recognize the resilience, strength, and contributions of Afghan allies across Vermont to our state and communities,” Molly Gray, executive director of the Vermont Afghan Alliance, a Burlington-based nonprofit that supports Afghans resettling in the state, said in a press release.
The Trump administration’s efforts this year to reverse protections granted to Afghan allies and block federal funding for refugee organizations has added to the uncertainty refugees already faced. 
The situation has been exacerbated by the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, including threats to deport Afghan allies and a sweeping travel ban, while neighboring countries turn away Afghan refugees terrified of being sent back to an unstable, hostile country.
Becoming refugees, relocating to a foreign country and waiting four years to reunite with families has taken “an unimaginable toll” on Afghans in Vermont, according to Drew Gustafson, an immigration attorney at the Vermont Afghan Alliance.

“I think people are obviously very anxious to be reunited with their families,” he said. “It takes a lot of effort just to keep that sort of hope alive because it’s been a really long and tough process.”
A handful of the organization’s clients in the greater Burlington area are going through that process, along with others in central and southern Vermont. That coupled with the situation in and around Afghanistan is part of what makes the family reunification process so difficult today, he said.
There is currently no U.S. embassy in Kabul, so cases must be transferred to a post outside of Afghanistan. He said Islamabad — the capital of Pakistan —  is likely the closest place to get to, but the recent acceleration in deportation of Afghan refugees from Pakistan, and the difficulty they face getting visas from Pakistan, is compounding the problem. 
The situation is similar for Afghans in Iran. The U.S. travel ban and the freezing of refugee program funding has made matters worse.

“It just feels like the Afghan community, sort of globally, is going through a really difficult period,” Gustafson said, one that makes the family reunification process particularly tough at the individual level.
For refugees trying to adjust to life in a new country without the knowledge of when they might see their families again — or ever — is “something I can’t even imagine,” Gustafson said.
“These were people who were evacuated from their country or told by the U.S. you have to leave for your own safety, your life will be endangered if you stay,” he said. “So this is a different sort of story of immigration because they’re not people who came to America with a plan or even a dream.”
In an emailed statement late Friday, Gov. Phil Scott asked Vermonters to celebrate the contributions of “our Afghan neighbors” and “ensure those who seek peace, freedom, and the rule of law only our democratic republic can offer, are always welcome in America.”
These refugees “have become our friends, neighbors, and coworkers. Many – due to their cooperation with the United States government during the war – would face deadly consequences if they were forced to return to Afghanistan under Taliban rule,” he said.
Around the world Fry said he has seen people banding together to make their country and lives better — including in Afghanistan and among Afghans resettled in the U.S. The effort to encourage free and democratic societies at home and abroad is “something that we need to see more of,” he said.
“I think we’re all striving for the same thing … for us now and for our children in the future,” Fry said.
The work the alliance is doing to help Afghans in Vermont is invaluable, he said, and “bringing people to Vermont who are going to contribute to our communities in ways that enrich the overall fabric of Vermont — and I think that’s important for us to consider as well.” 
Last year, the organization directly served about 250 Afghans statewide. It helped 35 obtain driver’s licenses, placed 65 people in jobs and provided 50 with interpretation services. Since March, it has helped resettle 12 Afghans on special immigrant visas and hosted Eid celebrations for 250 Afghans, according to the press release.
Some of the Afghans helped by the organization are now case workers in the office, helping others.
“We are determined to help keep a promise made to those who risked their lives to support U.S. military and diplomatic missions in Afghanistan, and to ensure that families are evacuated and brought to safety here in Vermont,” Gray said in the release.
Meanwhile, the organization is facing significant federal funding cuts and has issued an urgent appeal for donations, as it is unlikely to continue beyond Sept. 30 without additional funds.
“Please stand with those who stood with us and donate today to help close our funding gap,” the alliance wrote on its donation page.
On the nonprofit organization’s board is Afghan war veteran Vince Mazzucca.
“If not for our Afghan interpreters and colleagues, I’m not sure I’d still be here today,” he said in an email. “I feel an obligation to do my small part to keep a promise to this community and to stand by them as they stood by me.”

U.S. President Donald Trump appointed Habba, who currently serves as Counselor to the President, to replace current attorney John Giordano who was nominated serve as Ambassador to Namibia.   (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)WILLIAMSPORT, PA — A Trump administration official on Friday accused federal judges in New Jersey of causing a constitutional crisis by rejecting President Donald Trump’s pick for U.S. attorney for New Jersey and ordering her top deputy to assume the post.
That was an “atypical decision,” said attorney Henry C. Whitaker, who went on to blast the judges for not “collaborating” with Trump officials to ensure the top federal prosecutor job would go to someone both the administration and courts agree on.
“The district court initiated this constitutional confrontation that did not need to happen,” said Whitaker, counselor to Attorney General Pamela Bondi.
Whitaker’s comments came toward the end of four hours of tedious arguments at the Herman T. Schneebeli Federal Building, where U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann joked he was tapped to take the case “for my sins.” The issue before Brann was whether acting U.S. Attorney Alina Habba has the authority to prosecute cases — given the ongoing tug-of-war over her job — as well as whether Trump and Bondi overstepped their authority in overriding the judges who refused to extend Habba’s tumultuous tenure.
Whitaker’s pronouncement irked Gerald Krovatin, one of the attorneys seeking dismissals of their clients’ criminal cases over questions about Habba’s authority.
Krovatin angrily objected and countered that Trump caused a constitutional crisis by “appointing someone who has no business being U.S. attorney of New Jersey or anywhere else.”
The court showdown came nearly five months after Trump appointed Habba, his former personal attorney, as interim U.S. attorney for New Jersey. The Senate did not confirm her within the 120-day window that federal law requires for presidential appointments, prompting a panel of federal judges from New Jersey to intervene.
In such scenarios, federal judges are authorized by law to extend an acting U.S. attorney’s tenure or name a replacement. During Trump’s first term, they were driven to act after the Senate failed in 2018 to confirm Craig Carpenito, who then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions had appointed acting U.S. attorney for New Jersey. The judges unanimously appointed Carpenito 112 days into his tenure.
But on July 22, a panel of federal judges facing a similar decision instead named Habba’s top deputy, Desiree Leigh Grace, to the post. That so enraged Trump administration officials that they fired Grace and reinstalled Habba, kicking off the ongoing legal battle that drew a small army of attorneys to this Lycoming County city best known as the home of the Little League World Series.
Brann said he expects to rule on the matter by Wednesday or Thursday, giving both sides until 5 p.m. Monday to file any supplemental briefs. He agreed to expedite the case, pointing to the disruptions it’s caused in federal courts in New Jersey.
“Are criminal prosecutions happening?” Brann asked.
“Not the way they normally would,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Coyne conceded.
Some judges have refused to arraign indicted defendants, adjourned trials, and transferred cases to other jurisdictions, said Whitaker and Coyne.
Brann urged Whitaker and Coyne to persuade Habba to recuse herself from cases while challenges to her authority remain unresolved.
“Boy, that’s confusing to everybody,” the judge said. “It’s confusing to me.”
But Whitaker said recusal is unnecessary because Bondi’s office is “fully empowered to supervise the office.”
Coyne objected to any pressure for recusal, citing a “dignity component” — although it wasn’t clear whether he meant the recusal would offend the dignity of Habba, Trump, or someone else.
“Ms. Habba is the person the president wishes to lead the office of the U.S. attorney for New Jersey,” Whitaker said.
Earlier, attorneys spent several hours debating a dizzying array of court precedents, federal statutes, and even the verb tenses of language in various laws to make their case. Brann blitzed the attorneys with questions so dense he often stopped to ask: “Do you understand my question?” and quipped, when silence met one such query: “Maybe I don’t understand this. Which is entirely possible.”
Arguments centered on two federal laws governing executive-branch appointments that require Senate confirmation.
Attorneys challenging Habba’s reappointment insist it’s unconstitutional under the Preserving United States Attorney Independence Act, the 2007 law that contains the 120-day timeline and tasks federal judges with acting if that clock runs out without Senate action. Several Congress members who voted in favor of that act filed a brief this week exhorting Brann to respect the constitutionally mandated separation of powers that law was meant to codify.
But the attorneys fighting to keep Habba in the post said her reappointment should stand because it’s valid under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, a 1998 law that directs a vacant position’s second-in-command to become the acting officer-in-charge for up to 210 days. After Trump officials fired Grace, Habba resigned and Bondi named Habba first assistant U.S. attorney, essentially restoring her as acting U.S. attorney.
“There’s little dispute that the president has the authority to remove even a district court appointee,” Whitaker said.
Still, Krovatin warned that the executive branch wasn’t meant to make successive appointments, under several federal laws.
Attorney Thomas Mirigliano, who represents an Irvington man challenging Habba’s authority, called the Trump administration’s use of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act “an end run around” the Preserving United States Attorney Independence Act.
“The president terminated the first assistant in order to backfill the role. Ms. Habba resigned to fill it herself. It’s circular,” Mirigliano said.
Attorney James Pearce, representing the Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers of New Jersey, cited “larger anti-circumvention, manipulation concerns” that such maneuvering raises under the Constitution’s appointments clause. That clause differentiates between principal officers, who are appointed by the president and require Senate confirmation, and “inferior officers,” who don’t require Congressional approval.
Brann told the attorneys he expected neither side would like his ruling and said his exhaustive questioning would help “tee up” the case for a likely appeal before U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals judges.
He also warned that New Jersey’s federal judges likely will have to learn to get along with Habba.
“It’s very likely that Ms. Habba is going to be the U.S. attorney for the District of New Jersey,” Brann said.

(Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)A career attorney who assisted in an Ethics Commission investigation told lawmakers that she thinks the Attorney General’s Office is pressuring the commission’s staff to resign. 
“I believe that what our attorney general is attempting to do is to drive them out,” Pat Monson, who recently retired after 46 years as a trial attorney, said Thursday. “If that happens, it is the state’s loss.”
Monson appeared before the Legislative Audit and Fiscal Review Committee to talk about a recent Ethics Commission investigation report related to a building leased by the Attorney General’s Office. The report focused on Rep. Jason Dockter, R-Bismarck, a partial owner of the building who was found in violation of state ethics laws for voting on bills that included funds for the property.
During her testimony, Monson responded to previous allegations by the Attorney General’s Office that the report is riddled with errors.
“There is nothing contained in our report that is based on speculation, innuendo, falsehoods or anything that this commission made up to support its findings,” she said.
Attorney General Drew Wrigley and Chief Deputy Attorney General Claire Ness were not available for comment, a spokesperson for the agency said Friday.
The Attorney General’s Office and the Ethics Commission have been at odds since this year’s legislative session. In February, the agency told lawmakers that the commission would infringe on the state constitution if it tried to penalize officials who violate ethics laws. The Ethics Commission says the constitution grants it this authority.
Since then, both sides have openly accused one another of unprofessionalism multiple times.
Tensions reached new heights after the North Dakota Ethics Commission in June published its report on Dockter. 
In the report, the commission said a lack of cooperation from the Attorney General’s Office hampered its investigation.
Wrigley has vehemently denied this claim.
In a Wednesday letter to the Legislative Audit and Fiscal Review Committee, he called the notion that his agency was uncooperative “baseless” and said the report is full of “obvious errors.” He said that the commission had requested confidential documents he could not legally provide because they were part of ongoing investigations.
He called on the Ethics Commission to either revise its findings or withdraw the report altogether. 
Lawmakers attempt to clear up unanswered questions over attorney general building lease

Wrigley also accused Executive Director Rebecca Binstock of lacking experience and professionalism, and of trying to punish the Attorney General’s Office for making what he described as good faith criticisms.
“For the Ethics Commission and their staff to now try to blame their delay and lack of diligence on this office is ironic,” Wrigley said in the recent letter. “Furthermore, their creation of a factually unsupported, retaliatory narrative, if left unaddressed, will chill other whistleblowers seeking to shed daylight on important irregularities in the future.”
Rep. Austen Schauer, R-West Fargo, called the tone of Wrigley’s letter “inappropriate for the state of North Dakota.”
“Is this just the way we’re going to treat each other from here on?” Schauer asked Monson. “Pointing fingers, making accusations and being upset and angry at each other?”
Monson said she agreed that some of the rhetoric in the letter was “uncalled for.” 
“I know ethical and experienced performance,” said Monson, who serves on the North Dakota Supreme Court’s Judicial Ethics Advisory Committee and previously sat on the court’s disciplinary board and State Bar Association Ethics Committee. “I’ve worked closely for three years with the staff of this Ethics Commission, and they are highly performing individuals.”
Rep. Emily O’Brien, vice chair of Legislative Audit and Fiscal Review Committee, called it “unfortunate” that such strong language was used in conversations about the building project and the Dockter report. She said public officials should take civility seriously.
“Otherwise we’re going to continue running in circles, and it’s just a mudslinging pit,” the Grand Forks Republican said. 
The Ethics Commission recently asked its chair, Cynthia Lindquist, to arrange a sit-down meeting with Wrigley to discuss ways to improve the agencies’ relationship.
In an Aug. 7 letter, Wrigley declined the invitation. He said that while he wants to meet with Lindquist, he first wants the commission to respond to previous letters sent by his office on Feb. 19 and July 3. Those letters discuss concerns the agency raised about the Ethics Commission’s enforcement authority and its issues with the Dockter report.
In an interview this week with Forum Communications columnist Rob Port and Chad Oban on their podcast, Plain Talk, Wrigley accused the commission of retaliating against Ness, the chief deputy attorney general, for testifying against one of the commission’s bills.
When asked by the podcast hosts whether he thinks Binstock and the commission’s general counsel need to be fired, Wrigley said he doesn’t want to get involved in the commission’s staffing decisions.
The Ethics Commission’s report was the latest of several investigations into the south Bismarck building.
The property on Burlington Drive was selected by former Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem’s administration as new office space for some divisions of the agency. Wrigley, who assumed office in 2022 after Stenehjem died in office, brought the project to lawmakers’ attention after learning it exceeded its initial projected costs by roughly $1.7 million. 
In 2024, Dockter was convicted of a conflict of interest misdemeanor related to the votes he cast on bills funding the Burlington Drive property.
The Ethics Commission’s recent report called attention to a handful of questions it said remained unanswered regarding the building’s finances. 
During the Thursday Legislative Audit and Fiscal Review Committee meeting, staff with the Attorney General’s Office said the agency had resolved all financial concerns regarding the property. Lawmakers asked the staff to prepare and present further documentation at the committee’s next meeting demonstrating this.

The grinding decline of the traditional newspaper business continued in an incredibly sad way last week with news that the Brookings Register, Huron Plainsman, Moody County Enterprise and Redfield Press have closed.
The papers are/were owned by News Media Corp., based in Illinois. I know very little about that company beyond the fact that it closed four South Dakota papers that mattered, apparently with no advance notice for employees and no continuing health coverage or certainty that the staffers will be paid all of what they’re owed.
No time for employees to plan, to seek other work, to set up alternative health insurance or reorganize finances. Just “Boom. We’re done. You’re done. Good luck.”
Company’s sudden shutdown closes four newspapers in eastern South Dakota

How can people treat other people that way? Apart from everything else, it’s just shoddy behavior. Cruel, even, although not particularly unusual in the corporate media world of today.
Any journalist for any length of time in South Dakota has likely had some contact with one or the other of these four newspapers. Meaningful contact. Here I’ll name just a few.
My old friend Roger Larsen, a former colleague at the South Dakota State University student newspaper, the Collegian, worked at the Huron Plainsman for more than 40 years, doing the kind of journalism that served the news business and his community well. He did some work at the Brookings Register while in college, too.
Then there’s Castlewood farm kid Chuck Raasch, who worked at the Argus Leader in Sioux Falls before heading to the Washington, D.C., area, where he wrote for USA Today, Gannett News Service and the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. But his first job out of college was at the Huron Plainsman. He also worked  part time at the Brookings Register during his college years.
I shot pictures for the Register while I skipped classes at SDSU and worked at the Collegian on campus. And my first full-time news job was as staff photographer at the Register. There I enjoyed working with reporter and Lake Preston’s own Rob Swenson, who later worked at the Argus Leader before, during and after I was there.
My friend and former Rapid City Journal editor Steve Miller — also a Castlewood native — worked at the Brookings Register way back when. So did my friend and Lyman County compatriot Noel Hamiel, a newspaper writer, editor and publisher who grew up on a farm a couple of miles down the creek from ours. Like my brother, Terry, and me, Noel found a professional life in covering the news rather than raising grain and cattle.
And he began with the Plainsman, which he says “opened the door for me in newspapers.”
My wife, Mary Garrigan, worked as a reporter and editor at several South Dakota papers during her journalism career. But her first newspaper job was at the Brookings Register during her freshman year at SDSU. She worked in the Register’s mail room and “stuffed a lot of papers back then.”
My friend and gifted poet Doug Cockrell got some of his words-matter training at the Redfield Press, proving that, yes, journalism and poetry can mix, and probably should. Surely I have a Moody County Enterprise connection. I just can’t think of it.
These papers helped educate many journalists and gave others their start or years of employment. More importantly, they mattered supremely to their communities by informing, educating, entertaining and holding those in power accountable.
At this point, we can only hope the suddenly laid-off employees get their final paychecks and can find affordable health insurance and other journalism jobs, if more journalism is what they want.
The best thing will be if those jobs and those people return to those four papers because someone with vision and financial resources revives them. There is some work going on now in Brookings to see if that’s possible.

If it’s not, we can hope that someone comes up with other ways — such as the startup publications now operating in other towns and cities or news nonprofits — to provide professionally produced journalism to those communities, which they need and deserve.
Apparently that’s a possibility, too, at least in Brookings.
This is important stuff. Each newspaper that closes is a loss to the very foundations of our democracy.
As a lapel pin offered by the South Dakota NewMedia Association reads, “Democracy Demands Journalism.” That’s especially true at a time when facts and truth are under relentless attack from social-media manipulators and fib-fabricating politicians.
So I’ll weep for the four papers that closed last week. But I’ll also hold out hope that the professional news gap can be filled, one way or another, in those communities and others that have lost their newspapers.
Because when real news produced by real-news professionals goes away, the void is usually filled by something that is much less than professional, often wrong and sometimes downright dangerous.
And that’s bad for our state and our nation.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Newspaper-printing-press-Getty-e1688080646769-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-15 17:57:01.501929

(Photo by Tang Ming Tung/Getty Images)A southwest Washington restaurant fined nearly $1 million for repeatedly violating the state’s indoor dining ban during the COVID-19 pandemic must pay the penalty, a state court of appeals ruled this week. 
Stuffy’s II Restaurant in Longview, owned by Glenda and Bud Duling under Duling Enterprises LLC, owes $936,000 in fines — $18,000 for each of the 52 days Stuffy’s II remained open for indoor dining while an emergency proclamation banning it was in effect. 
The three-judge panel determined that the restaurant’s willful violations of the emergency proclamation caused significant harm by repeatedly exposing Stuffy’s II employees to a potentially deadly disease. The court also found that Duling Enterprises failed to prove the fine amount was excessive. 
The state Department of Labor and Industries fined Stuffy’s II Restaurant an initial total of $126,000 in January 2021 for violating then-Gov. Jay Inslee’s emergency order banning indoor dining. 
The penalty grew each day Stuffy’s II remained open after receiving the initial fine. 
Inslee issued the proclamation in November 2020 in response to rising COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations. The Department of Labor and Industries separately issued a rule requiring all employers to comply with the conditions of operations laid out in Inslee’s proclamation. 
Stuffy’s II was one of roughly 25 businesses in Washington fined by the Department of Labor and Industries for violating statewide COVID orders as of January 2021, and one of a handful of restaurants hit with a temporary restraining order from the state attorney general’s office requiring them to stop offering indoor dining. 
The Dulings publicly boasted about intentionally violating the governor’s ban.
According to the appeals court decision, the Department of Labor and Industries calculated the fine for Stuffy’s II based on the severity of the offenses and the fact that the violations were willful. 
The restaurant owners first appealed the state agency’s penalty to the Board of Industrial Insurance Appeals, arguing the fine was excessive because they were unable to pay the large sum and there was “minimal harm done” by the violations.
The board upheld the fine and the Dulings appealed to Cowlitz County Superior Court. 
After a Cowlitz County Superior Court judge also ruled in February 2024 that the fines were justified, the restaurant owners sought review by the state Court of Appeals. 
The Court of Appeals issued its ruling on Tuesday, affirming the decisions of the Board of Industrial Insurance Appeals and Cowlitz County Superior Court. 
While Duling Enterprises submitted tax returns from 2020 and 2021 to show that Stuffy’s II operated at a loss in 2020 and was unable to pay the fine, the appellate court ruled that a corporation’s inability to pay a fine doesn’t automatically make it excessive. 
“Such a harsh consequence may be warranted in light of the egregiousness of the violation,” the Court of Appeals states in its ruling. 
Stuffy’s II has been closed since Aug. 4 due to a fire that broke out in the restaurant’s kitchen. 
“The road ahead won’t be easy or quick — it’s going to take time, patience, and a lot of work. But we’re committed to rebuilding, picking up the pieces, and coming back stronger than ever,” the restaurant stated in a social media post on Aug. 8.

An internal memo from a top official sent to all state employees last Friday addressed concerns raised by Gov. Phil Scott’s public comments on the issue the day before.

Gov. Phil Scott fueled speculation last week about the future of state employees’ continued ability to work remotely when he referenced a still-to-come plan to bring employees back to state offices.
“Remote work has been helpful,” Scott said at his weekly press conference on Aug. 7, “but we have plans to bring people back at least part time, so we are hopeful in the next few months to roll out our program about how to bring people back.”
But a memo sent by Agency of Administration Secretary Sarah Clark the following day to all state workers assured employees those plans were “only in the early stages.”
Remote work has been the norm for many state employees since the onset of Covid-19 more than five years ago. Two summers of flooding soon after the end of that crisis disrupted efforts to work in state buildings, Clark wrote.
“As we once again move forward after these disruptions, we are committed to restarting our work on a more consistent approach to remote/in-person hybrid schedules, with more emphasis on in-person collaboration than currently exists,” she added.
Scott’s comments took Steve Howard, the executive director of the Vermont State Employees’ Association, the state employees union, by surprise. While some of the state’s more than 8,000 employees have started increasing their in-person presence, for many, work location is handled on a case-by-case basis, he said.
Howard described the desire for a return to office as “a solution in search of a problem,” one that overlooks how successful a hybrid schedule has been.

“The goal of management should really be, ‘is the work getting done?’ and not ‘where is the work getting done?’” he said. “This change is going to incentivize retirements, cause people to leave and make it really hard to recruit.”
A pivot back to in-person work has caused problems for state employees previously. Howard pointed to when the Vermont Department for Children and Families’ economic services division began requiring people to return to the office. That decision “backfired,” damaging staff morale due to its top-down implementation, according to the union leader. 
Scott’s office declined to comment, referring questions to the Agency of Administration. Beth Fastiggi, commissioner of the Vermont Department of Human Resources, shared the memo penned last Friday by Clark. 
“With this discussion becoming more visible, we know there will be a lot of questions and opinions,” Clark wrote. “The Governor and I assure you that we will communicate a thoughtful, complete approach well before it goes into effect.”
While she did not outline a timeline, she said that the process of developing the return-to-office plans will involve input from employees across agencies. 
“We take the impact of this change — the positives and negatives — on our employees and the Vermonters we serve seriously. So, we are taking the time to get it right,” Clark wrote. “This strategic process is in contrast to our current operating environment, which is the result of multiple emergency responses to conditions beyond our control.”
So far, the state employees union has not heard the specifics of the administration’s proposal, and there is no set time to discuss it, according to Howard. 
After the governor’s comments, Howard said the union has received close to 300 emails about what a new policy could mean for people’s lives. 
“Workers should not have to read about their jobs and their lives on the news,” he said.

Albritton praised Boyd in the memo, saying he “always works to build consensus and has spent countless hours with Senators on both sides of the aisle exploring and talking through ideas to make legislation stronger and bring tough and complex issues across the finish line.”
“When it comes to constituent services, he digs into the details to make sure Floridians are getting the answers they need and expect from our elected leaders.

Boyd served in the Florida House of Representatives for eight years and in 2018 championed legislation that established controlled substance prescribing limits for acute pain and required physicians to use a prescription drug monitoring database before prescribing or dispensing an opioid.
Associated Industries of Florida awarded Boyd its Champion for Business award in this year and the Florida Chamber of Commerce gave Boyd its Distinguished Advocate Award in 2023 and 2024.
Boyd was first elected to the Florida Senate in 2020.

Tuttle Courthouse in downtown Atlanta, home of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. (Photo by John McCosh/Georgia Recorder)A federal appeals court has reinstated a First Amendment lawsuit filed by a pastor and community activist against then-Manatee County school Superintendent Cynthia Saunders after he was kicked out of a board meeting in 2019.
A unanimous panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit Friday upheld dismissals of Arthur Huggins’ complaints about the cop and a school board official who actively tossed him from the meeting, as well as the City of Bradenton.
But the court concluded that Saunders, now retired, was not entitled to qualified immunity from the lawsuit.
“She has not shown that directing the removal of a community member from a Board meeting falls within the scope of her discretionary authority,” Judge Robin Rosenbaum wrote for judges Elizabeth Branch and Embry Kidd.
The ruling means Huggins can go back to trial court to press his complaint against Saunders. The court also said he could press claims under state law.
The episode transpired amid public ferment over the board’s plans to take control of Lincoln Memorial Academy, a Black-owned charter school. Huggins had played a prominent role in protests against the school system.
According to court records, Huggins attended a meeting during which Lincoln was on the agenda. As the meeting stretched to four hours, he left his seat to stand against the back wall, hoping to relieve back pain from sitting so long.
Paul Damico, the school district’s chief of security, told Huggins to sit down or leave. As Huggins tried to explain, Damico summoned a city police officer, who made Huggins move to a lobby. He was barred from re-entering the meeting chamber.
‘Discretionary functions’
“Officials performing discretionary functions are still liable for violations of clearly established rights,” the court explained.
However, “Huggins plausibly alleges that Saunders prevented him from speaking because of his viewpoint. The right to be free from viewpoint-based discrimination is a foundational — and long clearly established — constitutional right.”
Huggins had vocally criticized Saunders, the court noted, including in a recent TV news interview. It is reasonable, the panel continued, to deduce she had been prejudiced against him.
“After all, Saunders knew the opinion Huggins wished to convey, ordered his removal, and — we can reasonably infer — did so because of Huggins’s viewpoint.”
The event was serious enough to deter other community members from speaking out the court said.
“For starters, being ordered out of a meeting room by a chief of security and a police officer can be, as Huggins alleges, humiliating and damaging to a person’s personal reputation. That’s particularly true here because members of the community widely attended the Board meetings in 2019. And since there is no justification for harassing people for exercising their constitutional rights, the adverse effect need not be great to support a violation,” the court said.
“Plus, Huggins’s expulsion showed Huggins that he would face a hard choice if he tried to express his views at a future meeting. He could endure potentially several hours of physical pain from his injuries while sitting through the lengthy proceedings before public comment. Or he would risk a credible threat of arrest if he again sought to relieve his pain by standing in the back of the hearing room or in the lobby until his time to speak came.”
The board ultimately revoked Lincoln’s charter, citing “systematic dysfuntion.”

As Connecticut lawmakers took a bow Friday for passing landmark legislation overhauling the state’s century-old towing laws, proponents of the measure said there are still problems to be addressed, including how to ensure companies give the state the proceeds from selling towed cars. 
They also said they want to increase oversight of the state Department of Motor Vehicles after learning from news accounts that an employee was placed on leave for allegedly manipulating the towing system for personal financial gain. 
“I think it’s an illustrative case-in-point about why government has to be vigilant on regulation, because there are so many cases like this,” Senate President Martin Looney, D-New Haven, said of the law. “If a vacuum exists, someone who is predatory will move into it.”
Lawmakers, local elected officials and tenant union members on Friday celebrated the passage of House Bill 7162, a major overhaul of the state’s towing statutes that garnered overwhelming legislative support following reporting by The Connecticut Mirror and ProPublica earlier this year.
The news organizations found that Connecticut allows tow truck companies to start the process to sell cars valued under $1,500 in 15 days, one of the shortest windows in the country. The stories explained how this and other laws favored towing companies at the expense of low-income residents.
[Gone in 15 days: How the Connecticut DMV allows tow companies to sell people’s cars]
“It’s a bill that had, it felt like, hundreds of pages, but about 80 pages of cleaning up old legislation, cleaning up old statutes, and really addressing the most important part of this, which was how this was hurting working families, how this was hurting people who were just trying to get to work, get to the grocery store,” said Transportation Committee co-chair Rep. Aimee Berger-Girvalo, D-Ridgefield, referring to House Bill 7162.
Berger-Girvalo and other officials gathered in Hamden, across the street from the Seramonte Apartments where tenants reported excessive, predatory towing. The towing practices have since stopped at Seramonte, but the renters’ complaints sparked larger conversations about towing statewide.
Rep. Laurie Sweet, D-Hamden, said when she started visiting constituents to learn more about their problems with towing, she heard stories about cars being towed overnight, while people were visiting family and even when someone was simply dropping off a birthday cake.
“I myself was nervous parking on this street for fear my own car would be towed when I was simply meeting with one of my constituents,” Sweet said. “I know that I will breathe a little easier when I visit constituents here, and I hope residents across Connecticut will too.”
CT Mirror and ProPublica reporters found that the DMV has failed to enforce a law requiring towing companies to hold onto the proceeds from the sales of towed vehicles for a year to give   vehicle owners a chance to claim the money. Tow companies can subtract their fees from the proceeds of the sale, but if the owner doesn’t come forward, the companies are required to turn over any remaining money to the state.
The recently passed law requires the DMV to set up a working group to study the issue. That group, which is scheduled to have its first meeting Sept. 8, is mandated to report its findings to the legislature. DMV Commissioner Tony Guerrera, who will serve as chairman, has named 10 people to the working group, including two consumer advocates and three tow company representatives.
“We’re going to have to work with the Treasurer’s Office as well because the claim [from tow companies] has often been that there was nothing left,” to give to the state, Berger-Girvalo said. “And so by casting this big, bright light on it, we’re going to learn whether or not that’s really true.”
She added that the group will set up a system of oversight for the agency. 
CT Mirror and ProPublica reporting also found internal documents showing that a DMV employee allegedly made thousands by gaming the towing system and selling towed cars for large profits.
“We didn’t really address [in the legislation] that level of corruption within the DMV itself, but by creating this working group there is going to be a default oversight that exists. But that’s one of the things that we’re going to be looking at very closely for future sessions,” Berger-Girvalo said.
Sen. Jorge Cabrera, D-Bethany, said the towing bill showcases the importance of lawmakers standing up to private interest groups for the good of their constituents.
 The legislation “is a testament to the kind of change we can have in Connecticut and across this country as working people face daunting tasks to make a living, to put food on the table, to raise their families,” Cabrera said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025_0815_SR_HamdenPressConference_165-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-15 17:57:01.501929

(Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas lawmakers on Friday questioned whether the state Insurance Department is doing enough to enforce regulations on pharmacy benefit managers, the national prescription drug middlemen that have long frustrated state officials and local pharmacists.
Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) negotiate prescription benefits among drug manufacturers, distributors, pharmacies and health insurance providers, and the biggest ones also own pharmacies and insurers.
The Insurance Department has been receiving fewer complaints from pharmacists alleging illegal behavior from PBMs since December, when the Arkansas Legislative Council approved a rule to require PBMs to include “fair and reasonable” dispensing fees in their reimbursements for prescription drugs, Daniel Holland, general counsel for the department’s PBM division, told the council Friday.

Exhibit H.05.a - DC - AID Rule 128 and PBM Enforcement June and August 2025 
Pharmacies sent the department roughly 3,000 complaints in 2024, claiming PBMs either paid them below the national average of what drugstores pay wholesalers for drugs or paid them at or just above this amount, AID’s general counsel told lawmakers last year. This practice has been illegal since the state enacted Act 900 of 2015.
The Insurance Department analyzed 3,347 data reports from health plans and PBMs and found that 654, or 19%, “consistently reimburse pharmacies below NADAC,” the national average drug acquisition cost, according to the department’s report to the council. These 654 plans, managed by 12 PBMs found to be violating state law, “cover approximately 340,000 Arkansas lives,” the report states.
The Insurance Department asked six of the 12 PBMs for corrective action plans within the past month. Those drug benefit managers have until next month to implement those plans and report back to the department, which “will then evaluate whether those PBMs have increased their average reimbursement to NADAC along with a fair and reasonable cost to dispense,” the report states. The other six PBMs claimed confusion about the request or problems with the data.
“All of this is in an effort to figure out exactly how many plans are paying below NADAC on average so that we can minimize the impact of the cost to dispense [drugs],” Holland said.
The amount the Insurance Department fines a PBM for violating Act 900 ranges from “extremely low” to $5,000, and it depends on the amount the company pays a pharmacy below the average acquisition cost, he said.
“There wasn’t a lot of certainty as to what the consequence was for payments below NADAC,” Holland said. “I’m trying to create that certainty so that everybody kind of knows [this is] where we start, and if we see a pattern, we’re going to go up, all the way to the point of possibly pulling or denying a license.”
Between June and July, the Insurance Department initiated nine new enforcement actions over 26 prescriptions reimbursed below NADAC, the report states. The investigations “will result in consent orders that include statutory penalties” or an Insurance Department administrative order if a PBM under investigation requests an administrative hearing.

Pharmacy benefit managers will have to pay Arkansas drugstores dispensing fees under new rule


 Lawmakers’ concerns

Independent pharmacists said in September 2024 that they were struggling to stay open in rural areas with limited healthcare resources thanks to low PBM reimbursements. Lawmakers went on to pass the dispensing fee rule on a temporary and later permanent basis, though one Legislative Council subcommittee rejected the option and was overruled by the full council.
Sen. Jonathan Dismang, R-Searcy, clarified to his fellow lawmakers that the rule was about dispensing fees rather than about NADAC reimbursements, even though much of the Insurance Department’s report focused on the latter.
“Let’s make sure everyone’s paying everything they’re supposed to be first before we start talking about what it means for a dispensing fee [to be] fair and reasonable,” Dismang said Friday.
Holland confirmed that this is the department’s goal, but some lawmakers said pharmacies in their district are still struggling financially eight months after the rule passed.
“Fair and reasonable is one thing… [but] the local pharmacists are telling me that the PBMs are at fault and they’re not seeing the action that they need to see,” said Rep. Jim Wooten, R-Beebe.
Rep. Jack Ladyman, R-Jonesboro, said his constituents have told him similar things and asked Holland if the Insurance Department can “speed up this process.” Holland said the department should be able to assess the rest of its PBM data in the next 30 days.
At several lawmakers’ request, Holland agreed to compile a report detailing how many penalties the Insurance Department has levied against PBMs, how much money the penalties total, how many PBMs have been fined and how much the volume of complaints about PBMs has decreased this year.










There wasn’t a lot of certainty as to what the consequence was for payments below NADAC. I’m trying to create that certainty.


– Daniel Holland, general counsel for the Arkansas Insurance Department’s pharmacy benefit managers division


After more than a century serving Benton, Smith-Caldwell Drug Store closed in August 2023 due to financial insolvency and transferred its clients to Walgreens. Republican Sen. Kim Hammer, who represents Benton, said he believed the department should issue harsher penalties for PBMs that violate state regulations instead of increasing penalties gradually until they reach $5,000.
“I’d like the agency to quit pussyfooting around with [PBMs],” Hammer said. “‘Fair and reasonable’ has been a discussion for way too long.”
Three pharmacy benefit managers — OptumRx, Express Scripts and CVS Caremark — manage 79% of prescription drug insurance claims for approximately 270 million people, according to a July 2024 Federal Trade Commission report.
All three PBMs were among five plaintiffs that sued Arkansas in federal court over Act 624 of 2025. Hammer was a lead sponsor of the first-in-the-nation law, which would have banned PBMs from holding a permit to operate a drug store in Arkansas after Jan. 1, 2026.
The other two plaintiffs against Act 624 are the Navitus Health Solutions PBM and the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association. The latter sued Arkansas over Act 900 of 2015, and the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the law in 2020.
A federal judge temporarily blocked Act 624 in July, agreeing with the plaintiffs that the law “likely violates” the U.S. Constitution’s commerce clause and is “likely preempted” by a veterans’ health care program.
Act 624’s supporters have said the law is necessary to ensure patients’ access to prescription medications, particularly for patients who live in rural areas or need highly specific drugs. The law received overwhelming bipartisan support in the House and Senate.

Brad Little recapped the 2025 legislative session, touting $400 million in tax cuts. (Kyle Pfannenstiel/Idaho Capital Sun)Idaho Gov. Brad Little is asking state agencies, outside of public schools, to cut spending by 3% by the end of June next year. 
Little signed an executive order Friday directing the agencies to: 

review their operations and consider possible consolidation to reduce spending
eliminate positions that have been vacant for more than six months
review current contracts and recommend ways to reduce costs associated with them 
review the number of boards and number of people serving on them to look for possible reductions
limit state travel 

The reductions and reviews of potential further savings must be completed by the end of fiscal year 2026, which is June 30, 2026. Public K-12 schools and spending were exempt from the directions in the order. 
“It’s in our DNA here in Idaho to balance the budget, cut taxes, and right-size government so we can continue to make public schools our top priority,” Little said in an emailed statement. “My executive order today delivers on our promise to Idahoans that we will implement President (Donald) Trump’s tax cuts for Idahoans and make the best use of their hard-earned money while putting public schools first.” 
The Idaho Legislature during the 2025 session approved more than $400 million in anticipated annual revenue reductions from tax cuts and credits, and another $50 million toward a tax credit for private education and tuition costs. Most of those reductions will go into effect in the current fiscal year. 
 State revenue came in below Idaho Legislature’s projections

The prior fiscal year ended June 30, with most revenue coming in higher than the prior year but lower than predicted. During the month of June, the state’s general fund revenue was $355.2 million, according to a report from the Division of Financial Management, which was $39.1 million less than projected for that month. In May, revenue to the state general fund was $141.1 million below what the legislative budget writers had forecasted, the Idaho Capital Sun reported. 
The Legislature this year approved and the governor signed the state’s largest income tax cut, which is expected to cut revenues by $253 million annually. Lawmakers also passed $100 million to reduce property tax bills, and $50 million to increase the grocery tax credit.

 Idaho Democrats, education union officials push back against budget holdbacks, but Republican legislators support governor’s call

The Idaho Democratic Party criticized the cutbacks ordered by the governor as a result of the “reckless Republican rule” and the tax cuts.

“Idaho Democrats opposed giveaways to the wealthy and costly voucher schemes because we knew they would blow a hole in the budget and do nothing for working families,” Democratic Party Chair Lauren Necochea said in an emailed statement. “Now, the resulting cuts make it harder for the next generation to pursue careers that support a family, weaken state law enforcement, and strip away other critical services, like health care for people with disabilities.”
Idaho Education Association President Layne McInelly said in a Friday statement that the holdbacks were “very unfortunate and completely predictable.”
“The Idaho Legislature’s massive tax cuts easily foretold this outcome, even as lawmakers dismissed the needs of basic governing and Idaho’s most vulnerable residents,” McInelly said. “However, Gov. Little’s exclusion of public schools in these budgetary clawbacks highlights the crucial role he must play as a defender of Idaho public schools.
“Because of the State of Idaho’s chronic underfunding of public education, IEA members and the rest of our state’s dedicated educators have long been forced to do more with less. Further reducing the already spartan funding provided for public schools would have hurt Idaho students and families significantly.”

Republican legislative leaders supported the governor’s order on Friday. 
“The Governor’s executive order today further reinforces our strong track record of living within the people’s means and making government as efficient as possible so we can continue to prioritize education,” Senate President Pro Tempore Kelly Anthon, R-Rupert, said.
 Democrats call for repeal of new state law that funds private schools with public tax dollars

In response to the governor’s ordered budget cuts, Democrats are targeting a repeal of the private school choice tax credit, which allows — for the first time in Idaho’s history — state money to go toward private K-12 education. 
Legislative minority party leaders Sen. Melissa Wintrow and Rep. Ilana Rubel, both of Boise, called for a special legislative session to repeal the school choice tax credit, which has gone into effect but will not be open for families to apply for until January 2026. A special session, which happens outside of the approximately three-month regular legislative session that goes from January to April, can only be convened by legislators with the support of 60% of both chambers. 
“Instead of cutting already lean budgets, a more responsible approach is to call a special session to repeal the costly $50 million private school voucher scheme and pay the bills we already have,” Wintrow said in a written statement. “Ending this wasteful scheme will not close the hundreds of millions of dollars in budget shortfalls created by Republican giveaways.”

State employees will now be asked to pay higher premiums for their care. (Photo by Thomas Barwick/Getty Images)The board overseeing the health insurance plan for North Carolina workers and retirees voted Friday to raise most enrollees’ premiums to help cover a deficit that has grown to $507 million this year. 
State Treasurer Brad Briner, whose office oversees the health plan, said no one wants to increase premiums but the hikes are needed to remedy the plan’s financial instability.
The insurance plan has been relying on cash reserves to pay bills because it has been paying out more than it has taken in. The reserves are running low. 
State employee and teacher representatives told the board that low wages and higher insurance premiums will push workers out of their jobs and make it even harder to fill vacancies. 
While premiums are increasing, state employees and teachers are not guaranteed raises this year. Republicans in the state House and Senate have not agreed on a comprehensive budget that includes state employee and teacher raises. 
“We know that the State Health Plan has financial challenges, but this board’s responsibility is not to balance those challenges on the backs of the people who work with our kids every single day,” said Bryan Proffitt, vice president of the NC Association of Educators. “Your job is to protect the health and well-being of people who serve this state.”
The board should demand more funding from legislators, Proffitt said, because they should not have a “free pass” to underfund schools and benefits. 
Ardis Watkins, executive director of the State Employee Association of North Carolina, blamed the healthcare industry for high prices.
“This health plan had been an ATM for the corporate health care machine,” she said. 
Without raises and with inflation, state employees are already falling behind, Watkins said.

In May, the health plan trustees voted to increase enrollees’ out of pocket costs.
Cherry Hospital employee Charles Owens told the board that the psychiatric hospital in Goldsboro is understaffed, forcing workers to endure 12- and 16-hour shifts.
“A steady paycheck and a decent health care benefit were the last things that were assisting us in getting new hires and retaining permanent staff,” he said. Health plan  trustees should have waited to know the size of employee raises before saddling them with higher insurance costs, Owens said.
The health plan has not increased premiums in seven years.
The plan sets up four salary tiers. Employees who make $50,000 or less and insure only themselves under the basic plan will see increases of $10 per month to $35. Workers in the top tier who make more than $90,000 will pay $80 in premiums for comparable coverage.
Premiums will be reduced for enrollees who include their children in their insurance plans.
Adding more insured children will help improve the plan and help single parents, said Health Plan executive administrator Tom Friedman.

Briner said he was faced with the health plan deficit when he took office this year. He placed the responsibility on former state Treasurer Dale Folwell, though he did not mention Folwell by name.
“We’re here because of the short-sighted decisions of my predecessor,” Briner said. “Premiums were frozen for years, and members were made to believe they could be that way forever. The plan was actually spending more money than it took in each and every year. That meant cash reserves through the plan were being used to keep prices stable rather than doing the hard work with providers and making adjustments to get better services and lower prices for our members.”
A plan developed under Folwell called the Clear Pricing Project was intended to save the health plan money. It ended up being a financial drain.
Folwell wanted to peg health plan medical costs to Medicare reimbursement rates. The legislature didn’t go along, so the program remained voluntary.
Both Briner and Friedman praised legislators for including $150 million in the stop-gap budget the General Assembly passed last month to help close the deficit.
Without that infusion, premiums would have gone much higher, Friedman said.

But in an interview with NC Newsline Friday, Folwell blamed the legislature for the health plan’s money problems.
The General Assembly did not properly fund the plan, have the courage to take on the “healthcare cartel,” or get rid of a law called certificate of need, Folwell said. Under the certificate of need law, some kinds of providers need state permission to set up shop or offer certain services.
Folwell was elected treasurer in 2016 and was in office until January of this year.
“Raising premiums on state employees is the direct result of the General Assembly not funding the plan or doing its job,” Folwell said. “That’s true yesterday, it’s true today, and it’s going to be true tomorrow.”

Carlos Mendoza, a President Barack Obama-appointed judge in the Middle District Court of Florida, issued a summary judgement in a lawsuit filed by book publishers against the 2023 law, HB 1069, this week. 
The suit, filed a year ago, asked the court to deem the state’s interpretation of “pornographic” and content that “describes sexual conduct” unconstitutional. 
“By leaving these items undefined, Florida has given parents license to object to materials under an ‘I know it when I see it’ approach,” Mendoza wrote in his 50-page judgement, referring to a lack of definition for “pornographic” and “describes sexual conduct.”
Publishers Penguin Random House, Hachette Book Group, HarperCollins Publishers, Macmillan Publishing, and Simon & Schuster argued the law removes books without considering their literary or artistic value. 
The law, Mendoza wrote, “does not evaluate the work to determine if it has any holistic value,” a key part of the legal standard to determine whether material is obscene. 
“Educators must again perform statutory interpretation on the fly to determine what exactly is ‘inappropriate’ or ‘unsuitable’ because those terms go undefined. All the while, the specter of harsh penalties looms in the background,” Mendoza wrote.
Especially recently, the Florida Department of Education has made public threats and called superintendents in front of the state Board of Education to explain why certain materials are in school libraries.
Also on the plaintiffs’ side were The Authors Guild, John Green, Jodi Picoult, and other authors and parents.
Mendoza listed various books involved in the suit, including “The Color Purple,” “I am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter,” “Paper Towns,” “The Kite Runner,” “The Handmaid’s Tale,” “Water for Elephants,” and “Homegoing.”
“None of these books are obscene,” Mendoza wrote.
Mendoza determined “pornographic” in law is synonymous with “harmful to minors.”
A Florida Senate committee this year debated further defining what school boards should consider “harmful to minors” but after First Amendment concerns arose, the bill stalled. 
Dan Novack, an attorney representing the publishers called it “a sweeping victory for the right to read, and for every student’s freedom to think, learn, and explore ideas,” in a statement to the Phoenix. 
“We are elated that the federal court in Florida has upheld the First Amendment rights of students, educators, authors, and publishers. The Court ruled that books may only be removed from school libraries if they lack serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value when considered as a whole,” Novack said.

The Northern Arapaho Tribe has joined the Eastern Shoshone in reclassifying bison as wildlife. Next comes a move to amend the tribal game code. The changes will end an era of treating the native species as a farmed, domestic animal. .
The post Buffalo (almost) officially wildlife on some 2M new acres of Wyoming, a step toward roaming free appeared first on[...]","In late April, Jason Baldes sat at a table at the Wind River Tribal Buffalo Initiative’s headquarters processing a setback to his vision of restoring free-roaming bison to the Wind River Indian Reservation. 
Baldes, the initiative’s executive director, is a member of the Eastern Shoshone Tribe, which had recently voted to reclassify buffalo as wildlife. They had been deemed livestock before. But he hit an impasse in persuading the Northern Arapaho Tribe, which shares the reservation, to do the same.
“It’s a bump in the road — it’s not anything in stone — but it’s a challenge,” Baldes said in the spring. 
Nevertheless, Baldes remained sanguine that he could bring the Northern Arapaho Business Council on board: “I think that the [tribal] people overwhelmingly support it,” he said.

Winning over the Northern Arapaho’s leadership would be a necessary step to achieve the initiative’s goals: Amending the tribal game code so that the burgeoning buffalo herds along the eastern slope of the Wind River Range could be classified as wildlife — a key step in helping the herds roam free and thrive. 
“With two tribes making that distinction, we could get [bison ]in the game code,” Baldes said. “Once they’re in the game code, then we can protect that population, we can grow it, and designate more habitat.” 
Four months later, the National Geographic award-winner and son of a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologist saw his determination pay off. 
This week, the Wind River Tribal Buffalo Initiative shared a resolution, signed by the Northern Arapaho Business Council on July 15, that called for designating buffalo as wildlife. 
The large mammals shall be “managed in accordance with wildlife management principles to expand the herd and support the establishment of Buffalo within their traditional homelands,” the resolution reads.

For Baldes, the pieces are now in place to actually change how bison are classified and, in turn managed, on a Yellowstone-sized swath of west-central Wyoming. 
“The next step will be to go to the Inter-Tribal Council, show the two resolutions, and provide the language that could be inserted in the game code,” Baldes said Thursday. “I think that’ll be a pretty smooth step.” 
A change to managing bison as wildlife is important because it’ll mark the end of an era of treating the native species as a farmed, domestic animal — the standard today. After the reclassification occurs, the Wind River Indian Reservation could eventually be among the few places in Wyoming and the West where the United States’ national mammal is allowed to roam the landscape with the protections offered by the wildlife tag. In the 19th century, the American bison was hunted to near extinction as part of the genocide of Indigenous peoples, who depended on the migratory mammals. 
Although brought back from the brink primarily at Yellowstone National Park’s Lamar Buffalo Ranch, the overwhelming majority of bison alive today are farmed, and many states classify the species as livestock. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, only about 19,000 American Plains bison broken into 20 herds are large and free-ranging enough to be “subjected to the forces of natural selection.” It’s a tiny fraction of a percent of the tens of millions that existed before Anglo settlement of the West.
In Wyoming, buffalo roam free as wildlife in the roughly 5,000-animal Yellowstone bison herd — the largest such population in the country.

In the late 1980s, the Wyoming Game and Fish Commission also created regulations that classified bison as a wild big game species, so long as they dwelled in a designated area for the roughly 500-animal Jackson Herd that now encompasses Teton, Lincoln and Sublette counties. But elsewhere in the state, with the exception of the unoccupied Absaroka herd unit east of Yellowstone, bison aren’t considered wildlife but instead “privately owned or bison running at large.”
The former bison-are-livestock classification on the reservation was similar. Now, it’s likely soon to change on tribal land within the Wind River Indian Reservation, which encompasses about 2.2 million acres. 
Baldes is excited: “It’s a big deal,” he said. “It’s substantial that we’re able to reconnect, restore and bring that reciprocal relationship back to our people and communities.” 
Still, he cautioned that any on-the-ground changes would occur methodically and slowly — and bison wouldn’t roam free overnight.
“This will pertain to the buffalo in designated areas,” he said. “We’ll have to continue working with [grazing] permittees and the tribes and [the Bureau of Indian Affairs] to continue retiring cattle permits.”

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)There could be up to three new immigrant detention centers in Colorado run by federal authorities by the end of the year, tripling the state’s existing detention capacity, according to documents published Friday by The Washington Post.
An internal U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement planning document, which was obtained by the Post and last updated on July 30, includes proposed detention sites in Walsenburg, Hudson and Ignacio. The three new facilities would expand ICE’s Colorado footprint by a total of 2,560 additional beds.
Colorado is currently home to one ICE detention facility, an Aurora processing center operated by private prison company The GEO Group. Under ICE’s reported expansion plans, that facility would expand from 1,360 beds to a maximum capacity of 1,530. The Aurora facility has long been the target of criticism from activists over allegations of inhumane conditions and dehumanizing treatment.
ICE is trying to expand its detention and deportation efforts, bolstered by $45 billion in the Republican federal spending and tax cut law approved last month. If the planned expansion detailed by the Washington Post goes through, Colorado would have the sixth most immigration detention beds out of about 107,000 beds nationwide by next year. 
The dormant Walsenburg facility, formally the Huerfano County Correctional Center, is owned by CoreCivic. The Hudson Correctional Facility was previously operated by The GEO Group and closed in 2014. The GEO Group is ICE’s largest contractor, followed by CoreCivic. 
Both locations were among six potential ICE facility sites revealed earlier this year through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union and ACLU of Colorado.
The Southern Ute Indian Adult Detention Center in Ignacio is a tribal facility.
Steve Kotecki, a Denver-based ICE spokesman, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Madison city clerk’s office told the elections commission in a memo Dec. 20 about the lost ballots from two Madison wards. A bag containing 68 unprocessed absentee ballots from two wards was found Nov. 12 in a tabulator bin, the memo stated. During reconciliation of ballots on Dec. 3, clerk employees found two sealed envelopes containing a total of 125 unprocessed absentee ballots from another ward. The discovery of the missing ballots was announced to the public Dec. 26. 
The missing ballots were not enough to change the result of any local, state or federal elections.
WEC launched an investigation into the error. In a report released last month, WEC found that “confluence of errors” and a “complete lack of leadership” in the city clerk’s office led to the ballots going missing. 
The investigation report also proposed a number of requirements for the city to improve its systems for tracking and counting absentee ballots. Those requirements constituted the order the commission approved on Friday. 
Among other things, the order requires the city to develop an internal plan delineating which employee is responsible for statutorily required tasks, print poll books no earlier than the Thursday before elections, change the absentee ballot processing system so bags and envelopes aren’t lost, update instructional materials for poll workers and complete a full inspection of all materials before the scheduled board of canvassers meeting after an election.
Commissioners followed through with enacting the order after interim City Clerk Michael Haas had sent a letter to the commission, requesting that the provisions of the order be made more broad and suggesting that the commission does not have the authority to enforce such changes to local election practices against just one municipality. 
“Individually-tailored orders for jurisdictions across the state also runs the risk of increasing, rather than decreasing, inconsistency of local election practices,” Haas wrote in an Aug. 6 letter to the commission. “If the Commission truly wishes to dictate the staffing, workflow, and procedures of municipal clerks at such a granular level, a regulatory guidance or rule-making that applies to all jurisdictions and that allows for thoughtful input by local election officials makes far more sense and is likely required.” 
In the letter, Haas wrote that the requirements of the WEC order were drafted in a vacuum from the city’s already existing election processes; that they give no end date or flexibility to election law changes made by the courts, Legislature or WEC itself; don’t address the logistic specifics of running an election in the state’s second largest city and don’t provide statutory reasons for the required changes. 
At the meeting Friday, Democratic Commissioner Mark Thomsen was the only member to vote against enacting the order. Thomsen argued that the order seemed “spiteful.” He said the city administered the 2025 spring election with no issues and that it still doesn’t have a permanent city clerk, so whoever is hired will be hamstrung by an order made because of actions they had nothing to do with. 
“I don’t think it’s fair to burden the new clerk with a set of orders that all the other clerks recognize no one else has to follow,” Thomsen said. “It is absolutely tragic that 193 people’s votes weren’t counted. They have separate legal remedies now. We have done what we needed to do. We’ve done an investigation, we’ve laid it out, and I do not think we should do a power grab and create burdens on the new clerk, whether or not we can exercise it.” 
But the supporters of the order said that not imposing it would mean letting the city off without being held accountable. Commission chair Ann Jacobs, a Democrat, noted that even though former Clerk Maribeth Witzel-Behl resigned after the incident, many staff involved in losing the ballots remain in the clerk’s office. 
“I think we need to order it also so that clerks across the state understand the level of seriousness that this commission takes with this,” Jacobs said. “The city needs to straighten out what happened here. And I don’t think there’s been sort of that reckoning yet.” 
Administrative rules 
The commission on Friday also reinstituted the administrative rulemaking process on a number of proposed rules that had been held up by a legislative committee. 
The Legislature’s Joint Committee for the Review of Administrative Rules (JCRAR) had previously suspended emergency rules written by WEC on a number of topics, including instructions for absentee voting and challenges to candidate ballot access. 
Last month, the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled in Tony Evers v. Howard Marklein that JCRAR’s suspension of administrative rules amounted to an unconstitutional legislative veto. Under previous law, state agencies weren’t allowed to promulgate a permanent rule on a topic in which the committee had previously struck down an emergency rule. After the court’s ruling, WEC can once again start the rulemaking process. 
The commission voted to restart the process of establishing rules for challenging candidate nomination papers, challenging declarations of candidacy and mandating that local clerks use a uniform set of rules for absentee ballots.

Duke implies yes, saying the consolidation will result in cost savings of more than $1 billion through 2028.
Others aren’t so sure.
Historically, Duke Energy Progress customers have paid slightly higher rates than Duke Energy Carolinas customers, said David Neal, senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center.
“How to balance that without any undue discrimination or causing harm to existing customers is going to be a challenge,” Neal said.
Dan Crawford, director of governmental relations at the North Carolina League of Conservation Voters, put it more bluntly, telling  NC Newsline in a statement:
“This merger will impact customers the same way everything Duke does impacts customers — their rates will keep going up and Duke will make billions.”
But in its regulatory filing, Duke Energy said the move would optimize efficiency between the two utilities, and is needed as demand on the energy grid grows.
Kendal Bowman, North Carolina president for the two entities, said in testimony with the North Carolina Utilities Commission that the merger would allow “the combined utility to continue to deliver safe and reliable energy to our customers at a lower overall system cost.”
  Duke Energy Carolinas serves the western part of North Carolina while Duke Energy Progress covers Raleigh and eastern counties.
Duke Energy Carolinas serves western areas of the state, including Charlotte and its surrounding area, while Duke Energy Progress covers the eastern half of North Carolina, including the Raleigh region. It’s a total of about 3.8 million retail customers in North Carolina, according to Duke Energy.
“They’re already part of the same company, so it seems maybe rate cases, expenditures on lawyers, and that sort of thing will go down,” Rep. Pricey Harrison (D-Guilford) said. “There are areas where I would be happy to criticize Duke, but probably not on the merger.”
But there is speculation over what a merger would actually mean.
North Carolina has a multi-year rate plan system where Duke Energy files rate plans for a three-year period. This was last done three years ago.
Following current cycles, observers expect Duke Energy Progress to file for a rate increase sometime this fall and Duke Energy Carolinas to do the same in the early part of next year.
Duke is aiming to complete the merger on Jan. 1, 2027.
“The question in our minds is, ‘what does it mean to be filing for this merger at the same time you’d be filing for new rates?'” said Sue Sturgis, research and communications manager at the Energy and Policy Institute.
Duke Energy spokesperson Bill Norton told NC Newsline the details of that are still being worked out.
In a statement, Kodwo Ghartey-Tagoe, executive vice president and CEO of Duke Energy Carolinas, said no retail rates would change immediately upon the merger’s completion. And Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress retail rates would gradually blend over time.
The company does not expect to make significant personnel cuts as a result of the merger. There are about 13,500 employees for Duke Energy based in North Carolina and 4,000 in South Carolina, according to Duke Energy.
Both utilities operate in neighboring South Carolina as well, serving about 855,000 retail customers there.
Duke Energy previously merged with Raleigh-based Progress Energy in 2012, and maintains a corporate office in downtown Raleigh for Duke Energy Progress.
“Since our teams have largely operated as a combined organization since the 2012 merger, most personnel efficiencies have already been realized. There may be some very limited reductions in corporate-related areas, but we anticipate impacts will be managed through natural attrition and careful headcount management over time rather than anything immediate,” Norton wrote in an email.
In her testimony with the state Utilities Commission, Rachel Elliott, director of rates and regulatory planning for Duke Energy Carolinas, said the company expected about 3% of the projected savings to come from corporate administrative costs, such as having to only file one rate case, saving on legal fees and other regulatory expenses.

Mandates from President Donald Trump’s administration to retain aging coal plants could cause a massive spike in energy costs, according to an independent analysis commissioned by several environmental groups.
Orders from the U.S. Department of Energy to save coal plants from retirement could cost ratepayers more than $3 billion per year, according to a report from Grid Strategies, a power sector consulting firm. It was carried out on behalf of Earthjustice, Environmental Defense Fund, Natural Resources Defense Council and Sierra Club.
Under Trump, the agency has issued emergency orders to maintain operations at coal plants that were scheduled for retirement. While federal officials say the coal plants need to stay online to avoid blackouts, power plant owners and state regulators planned their closures because they were no longer economically viable or needed for reliability.
“DOE mandates override those well-informed decisions, inflating electric bills for homeowners and businesses and undermining the competitiveness of U.S. factories and data centers,” the Grid Strategies analysis found.
Across the country, coal plants have phased out as they’ve struggled to compete with cheaper renewables and natural gas. A 2023 analysis by Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan think tank, found that 99% of existing U.S. coal plants “are more expensive to run than replacement by local wind, solar, and energy storage resources.
But Trump, who has pushed to unleash more fossil fuel development and to stymie wind and solar, has ordered a retiring coal plant in Michigan to stay online, along with an oil and gas plant in Pennsylvania.
“Based on the trend to date and indications that DOE has approached the owners of many retiring fossil power plants about potentially mandating their retention, DOE may attempt to mandate the retention of nearly all large fossil power plants slated for retirement between now and the end of 2028,” reads the Grid Strategies report.
The cost of keeping those plants online would be immense. By 2028, if Trump were to mandate the retention of all fossil fuel plants slated for retirement, the annual cost to ratepayers would be more than $3.1 billion, the analysis found.
The report also considers a number of aging plants that are not yet scheduled for retirement. It finds Trump’s actions could create a “perverse incentive,” causing plant owners to claim they’re planning to shut down, inducing the feds to step in and keep them open, with the cost borne by ratepayers.
Accounting for that possibility, the report found that ratepayer costs could reach $5.9 billion per year to keep the entire aging fossil fuel fleet online. California, Texas and Colorado would see the highest increases in electricity bills.

Max Handelman is a reporter with the Community News Service, part of the University of Vermont’s Reporting & Documentary Storytelling program.
Every fall, a crane trundles in and, three times a day, hoists a massive steel hopper from beneath the swirling pools of the Winooski River Salmon Hole. 
The cargo: fish. Atlantic salmon are heaved into pickup trucks by the dozens and deposited as far as 20 miles away into the greater Lake Champlain basin as part of the effort, which has existed since 1993. 
In the past few years, scientists have seen record numbers of the species lifted from the Salmon Hole. In 2023, the latest data available, teams pulled out 212 salmon — the highest number in 30 years. 
The largest tributary to Lake Champlain, the Winooski River snakes 90 miles from Cabot in the east, connecting to seven brooks and streams on the way. Those waters are home to some of the highest-population salmon runs in Vermont, and scientists say the fish are a reliable measure of the lake’s and basin’s ecological health.
So, the salmon’s success is a good sign — and an endorsement of water quality efforts. 
But those close to the efforts say accelerated climate change and federal budget cuts pose a threat to future progress. 
“Atlantic salmon are native to Lake Champlain, and it’s part of our role to maintain those native populations,” said Lee Simard, a leading Salmon Hole researcher from the Vermont Department of Fish and Wildlife. “And if the salmon are doing well, then that’s a good indication of the overall health of the Lake Champlain ecosystem.”
Fish and Wildlife is cracking down on sea lampreys, an invasive parasitic fish, as part of its efforts to bolster salmon numbers. 
Also called “vampire fish,” lamprey have no natural predators in the basin — allowing them to use rows of razor teeth to bore holes into salmon unchecked, siphoning fluids and nutrients to sustain themselves and leaving the salmon to bleed out en masse. 
Researchers have constructed low-head dams — concrete structures hidden just beneath the water — to ensnare adult lamprey, isolate them and use chemical lampricides to exterminate them and their larvae. 
Measures were implemented in 2023 and have yielded positive results since then, Simard said. 
“We’ve had record-low wounding rates,” he said. “As a result, more salmon are surviving and being able to come back to the river to spawn, and so we’ve been seeing stronger returns in recent years.”
Another area of improvement for the salmon has been with invasive plant removal. 
Species like buckthorn, honeysuckle and bittersweet outcompete native river plants for sunlight and soil nutrients, said Tim Larned, superintendent of the Winooski Valley Park District, the main stewardship org for the Salmon Hole. The lack of native plants means less food for insects like mayflies and caddisflies — a vital food source for Atlantic salmon.
These plants damage the river’s water quality, too. The group’s initiatives help stabilize that food cycle and inform locals about the river’s conservation. 
“At the Salmon Hole, we had a large group from Burlington High School help us out,” Larned said. “We spent the day clearing a couple of areas down there, and a high school group can get really motivated and get into pulling out good-sized stumps.”
The Friends of the Winooski River nonprofit replaces those stumps with anywhere from 1,500 to 3,000 native tree saplings every year, according to its website. 
Native forests are usually best positioned to live along rivers and purify the water by absorbing runoff and expunging excess nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus. 
“Having natural areas up to the edge of the water helps improve the habitat,” Larned said. “Anything that we can do on the shoreline can help … fish down in the river.”
Increased flooding threatens to undo those efforts in a single moment — endangering salmons’ migratory routes and livelihood.

Last July, the Winooski River and the Salmon Hole flooded for miles. The high-velocity torrents clawed through the riverbanks, ripping trees from the ground and eroding the soil. The erosion makes it difficult for remaining trees to stay rooted and prevents new trees from growing at all.
Michele Braun, executive director of the Friends of the Winooski River, explained that the river scoured sediment out of the streambanks — carrying soil molecules bound with phosphorus into the water.
Algal blooms fueled by that phosphorus then decompose — the process consuming large amounts of oxygen and the dead plant matter clogging salmons’ gills, causing them to asphyxiate. 
“Cyanobacteria and algae blooms are driven by phosphorus coming from the river,” Braun said. “We need to reduce the phosphorus content contribution in the river by about a third, and we need projects to improve the general health of the sediment transport system of the river, and that should improve water quality and reduce phosphorus to Lake Champlain.”
In addition to phosphorus, PFAS — or polyfluoroalkyl substances, dubbed “forever chemicals” — are also infiltrating the salmons’ home. 
Last year, an activist group sounded the alarm when manufacturer GlobalFoundries dumped PFAS-ridden effluent into the Winooski River. Subsequent research from the state Department of Environmental Conservation found PFAS levels at 26.36 parts per trillion — gravely higher than the state’s 20 parts per trillion safeline. 
Salmon that breathe PFAS-contaminated water suffer from toxic buildup in their skin tissue. Marine biologists are finding that the toxicity can sterilize salmon and lead to ferroptosis — a form of cell death that can cause virus buildup.
“PFAS are a big problem, but we don’t have much information about it,” Braun said. “The testing for PFAS is super expensive. My husband, a water quality scientist, is doing a study on PFAS and says it costs nearly $7,000 to collect one sample. We just wish we had more answers.”
The Friends of the Winooski River coordinates one of Vermont’s largest water quality monitoring efforts. The group takes samples at 30 sites to conduct annual studies to get some of those answers, Braun said.
But the Trump administration’s budget cut spree is jeopardizing the studies’ longevity, Braun said. 
Slashed funding has halted the Friends of the Winooski River’s ongoing projects, she said. 
“We’re very concerned about long-term funding,” Braun said. “Half of our funding was frozen in February and projects were significantly set back. We’ve had great support from Vermont Fish and Wildlife, but we’re worried about their funding too. With all of the federal disinvestment in climate change and resilience, we’re going to be in a difficult position in the future. It’s daunting.” 
The president has also proposed that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Ecological Services Program, a close ally of Vermont Fish and Wildlife, lose $37 million of its budget. 
Despite an uncertain future, other success stories in Lake Champlain are a silver lining. Simard said it took 50 years of hatchery stocking and intervention for lake trout populations to stabilize in the basin.
Simard said it might not be possible to achieve similar outcomes with Atlantic salmon because of dam usage and changing regulations for fisheries management, but he, his fellow researchers and volunteer groups want to do their best to get there.
As Braun put it: “We’re on the right track, but we need to keep it up.”

Jack Bergman speaks at a Grand Rapids rally for Former President Donald Trump, July 20, 2024 | Lucy ValeskiClimate activists are calling out U.S. Rep. Jack Bergman after the Watersmeet Republican sent a plea last week to a fellow member of the Canada–United States Inter-Parliamentary Group, seeking immediate action to manage and mitigate wildfires and consequently, the spread of wildfire smoke. 
In his letter to Canadian Sen. Michael MacDonald, chair of the inter-parliamentary group, Bergman requested greater accountability from the nation of Canada and stronger forest management policies, including forest thinning, fuel reduction and the use of prescribed burns.
“In recent years, communities across my district—and across much of the northern United States—have been increasingly impacted by the devastating effects of wildfire smoke originating in Canadian forests. While wildfire activity is a natural occurrence, the volume, frequency, and intensity of recent smoke events are unlike anything we’ve experienced before,” Bergman wrote.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
This smoke has led to widespread air quality alerts, alongside school closures, outdoor activity cancellations and serious public health risks throughout Northern Michigan and the Upper Peninsula, Bergman noted, raising particular concerns about the impact of wildfire smoke on public health. 
According to an Aug. 4 report from CBS News Detroit Chief Meteorologist Ahmad Bajjey, the state has seen 28 days of advisory or alert-level air quality due to wildfire smoke since its first alert in 2023. 
“Hospitals and clinics across my district are seeing higher rates of respiratory distress, particularly among vulnerable populations such as children, the elderly, and those with preexisting conditions. The combination of chronic exposure and limited local control over the source of the problem has left many of my constituents feeling frustrated and forgotten,” Bergman said.

While Teresa Homsi, deputy director of Michigan Clinicians for Climate Action commended Bergman for calling out the public health risks, the organization challenged the representative for failing to consider a key factor contributing to these wildfires: climate change.
“It is a little bit ironic to focus on Canada’s forest management techniques when our current federal government is dismantling programs that present long-term solutions to the underlying drivers of wildfires,” Homsi told the Michigan Advance.  
Since taking office, President Donald Trump has sought to roll back several vital climate policies and protections, from federal support for solar and wind energy, to the Environmental Protection Agency’s 2009 finding that six greenhouse gases – including carbon dioxide – trap heat in the atmosphere, threatening public health and future generations.
According to NASA, the warming climate is amplifying wildland fire activity, with extreme wildfire activity more than doubling worldwide. 
NASA’s Terra and Aqua satellites detect active wildfires twice each day. Scientists studying this data over a 21 year span found that extreme wildfires are more frequent, more intense, and larger. The regions with the largest increase in extreme fire behavior are the temperate forests in the Western U.S. and the boreal forests in northern North America and Russia.
Additionally, wildfires can be a major source of carbon dioxide emissions, feeding into the warmer, drier conditions that are increasing the risk and length of fires to begin with. 
Alongside children and the elderly, Homsi pointed to individuals with asthma, allergies and lung conditions, pregnant people and outdoor workers as groups who are particularly susceptible to the impacts of wildfire smoke.
“When there’s intense wildfire smoke, it obviously negatively impacts the air quality. And so, people have to spend their summers where they’d like to be outside. They end up having to shutter themselves inside, within air conditioning, if they have it,” Homsi said.
For people who have asthma or are considered sensitive, Homsi said the smoke can make it more difficult to breathe, and even painful to exhale.
“Even as someone who doesn’t struggle with allergies myself, I felt myself getting really winded and tired and groggy,” Homsi said. 
  Teresa Homsi, deputy director of Michigan Clinicians for Climate Action
Wildfire smoke has also been linked to worsening mental health conditions as well as increased risk of dementia.
Homsi said Detroit has been particularly impacted, ranking among the worst air quality in the world. 
Pollution from industrial sites within the city can contribute to worsened air quality, with the combination of worsened air quality and wildfire smoke acting as a double whammy, Homsi said. 
Rather than blaming Canada, Homsi and her fellow clinicians called on Bergman to defend  the health and the environment under threat from the Trump Administration. 
A request for comment was sent to Bergman’s office, but has yet to be answered.
Homsi stressed that regulations like the Mercury and Air Toxics standards address the short term health effects of air pollution and greenhouse gasses.
“We’re focused on the immediate impacts, right? The wildfire smoke, that’s affecting people right now. But then as you’re dismantling these programs, you’re only making the conditions that contribute to those wildfires worse,” Homsi said. 
She also pointed to reporting from the New York Times which noted fire mitigation strategies like prescribed burns and fuel reduction are simply not possible due to the remote nature of where these fires are burning. 
Additionally, Daniel Perrakis, a fire research scientist with the Canadian Forest Service in British Columbia, told NPR that neither the United States, nor Canada has enough firefighters to address the fires.
While Bergman’s acknowledgement of the health risks brought by the wildfires was validating, Homsi said Michigan Clinicians for Climate Action would encourage Bergman to stand up for the EPA and the programs offering  “the most sustainable, cost effective and long term solutions for turning the side against these wildfires.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/P7207381-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-15 16:58:13.650842

Canada geese are a protected species under federal law. State code also prevents private companies from eliminating geese on personal properties. 
  Summersville Mayor Robert Shafer
Summersville Mayor Robert Shafer said that around 60 geese in the area have caused issues for residents, prompting area leaders to explore legal options for removal. 
“It’s amazing, the messes they make and they just go through driveways and sidewalks and through traffic,” Shafer said. “We reached out just to find out what we could do to legally mitigate the situation.”
The town is considering contracting with the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, which offers a Congressonally-approved geese mitigation program. It assists communities with managing wildlife that threaten public property or health.
Tom Elliott, district supervisor with USDA APHIS Wildlife Services, presented a legal mitigation plan Aug. 18 to city council members and officials, saying it would be a year-long process that could ultimately end in capturing and euthanizing Canada geese that remained in the area. 
“As long as you have some short grass and a little bit of water in there, you’re always going to have Canada geese,” Elliott said, explaining that program’s goal is to make the geese relocate to another area. 
The program, according to Elliott, would use an “integrated approach” of lethal and non-lethal means of eliminating Canada geese in the area. The 12-month cycle would begin with oiling the goose eggs in nests, which suffocates the embryo. 
Between nesting and molting season, the process moves to “harassment measures,” where Elliott said they use pyrotechnics, lasers, remote control cars and more to aggravate the geese and prompt them to permanently move from residents’ yards, ponds and more. 
“It’s all things that we try to do to make the geese feel unsure [and] insecure there, so they’re going to want to leave and move out,” Elliott explained.
“Don’t try to just eradicate them overnight, because they’re going to come right back in,” he added.
At the end of the year-long process, remaining geese could be euthanized.
“In most cases we usually have to round up some geese,” Elliott said. “And usually we’re averaging about nine to 10% for the geese that we’re dealing with is all that’s left to round up.”
Local land owners would have to opt into the program for geese removal. 
“We try to get as many signed up as we can because [the geese] will also start figuring out where home base is and you know where they’re safe,” Elliott explained. “I’m sure there will be somebody who will be sympathetic for the geese, and then there’ll be several people who will not be sympathetic for geese.” 
The mitigation process is expected to cost $8,500, Shafer said, adding that he and council members haven’t made a final decision. They’re also considering partnering with a private geese mitigation company based in Michigan. 
“We’ve not made any decisions that we’re moving forward with anything, but obviously we’ve got neighborhoods that are aggravated with the size of the flock that we have,” Shafer said. “We’ve got to do something, because if you don’t, they just keep multiplying.”
Elliott said there is always a chance that the Canada geese could return after the mitigation efforts.

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)The Centurion Foundation won’t have to raise as much money to buy the Roger Williams Medical Center and Our Lady of Fatima Hospital. But it will pay nearly 20% more down the line due to higher interest rates on its debt.
CharterCARE Health of Rhode Island, Centurion’s newly formed Rhode Island subsidiary, is now eyeing an extra $76 million in debt service on the bonds it plans to sell to purchase the pair of urban, safety net hospitals, according to estimates from Barclays, the bond underwriter, included in an Aug. 14 report, which was obtained by Rhode Island Current.
The projected $480.9 million in debt that Atlanta-based nonprofit Centurion will have to repay over the next 30 years marks a 19% increase over the projections from four months earlier, even though the value of the taxable and tax-exempt bonds has decreased, from $165 million to $150 million. That’s because interest rates have spiked since the previous estimates, rising to 8% and 11.5% on the tax-exempt and taxable bonds, respectively. Prior projections were based on assumed interest rates of 5.6% and 8.4% for the tax-exempt and taxable bonds.
Despite the risks, the Rhode Island Health and Educational Building Corp.’s board of directors still agreed to act as the conduit for the tax-exempt bonds, Christopher Hunter, a spokesperson, confirmed via text. 
The quasi-public financing agency’s unanimous vote at a meeting Thursday also increases the value of tax-exempt bonds — the portion issued by the state — to $127.8 million, rising from $84 million. Taxable bonds fall from $56 to $13.5 million.
Board member David Almonte was absent from the meeting.
A recording from the meeting was not immediately available. 
Otis Brown, a spokesperson for CharterCARE Health of Rhode Island, said the company was “greatly encouraged” by the board’s decision.
“We now look confidently ahead to the marketing of these critically important bonds and the preservation of our hospitals’ essential role in the Rhode Island health system,” Brown said in an email Friday. Despite prior authorization, the company never launched a formal process to sell the bonds due to questions from prospective investors and anticipated changes to the financing terms, Brown said.
The agreement between the state financing agency and the hospital buyer includes a 10-year par call provision that lets the state buy back the bonds and refinance at a lower interest rate, if applicable. 
The state’s authorization also doesn’t guarantee Centurion can find investors to back its bonds — a big “if” given the unfavorable rating and negative outlook from S&P Global Ratings Agency. The credit ratings agency reaffirmed its BB- rating for the bonds on Aug. 13, echoing the comments from a March 25 report in which it noted the uncertainty of the company’s financial and operational success. 
Trying again
Centurion’s inability to attract investors to buy the original bonds is what prompted revisions to the financing scheme. The lower bond value reflects revised conditions authorized by the Rhode Island Attorney General’s office — which plays a regulatory role when hospitals change from for-profit to nonprofit ownership —  to help Centurion complete the sale. In exchange for lowering the upfront cash amount that Centurion must inject into the struggling hospitals’ balance sheets, the AG required more state oversight, including the ability to petition for financial receivership of the hospitals if things go south.
The pair of urban hospitals have long suffered financial and operational turmoil under their former owners, Prospect Medical Holdings. Mismanagement by the LA-based hospital chain operator and its former majority stakeholder, private equity firm Leonard Green, is well-documented, with company executives draining hospital balance sheets as their own salaries increased and they paid out more to their investors, according to a January 2025 report by the U.S. Senate Budget Committee. Other Prospect hospitals nationwide have been forced to close.
Its Rhode Island hospitals are hanging on, but barely: Prospect’s Rhode Island subsidiary ended fiscal 2023 $60 million in the red, according to audited statements. Even under new ownership, the hospitals are still expected to face multimillion-dollar losses through fiscal 2024, according to projections from VMG Health, a consultant by Centurion hired to study the feasibility of the sale and hospital operations. VMG expected Centurion to return to a positive operating margin in fiscal 2025, however.
Acacia Financial Group, a consultant for the Rhode Island Health and Educational Building Corp., was unable to draw conclusions about the stability of the new CharterCARE subsidiary nor independently verify VMG’s projections.
VMG’s financial projections also don’t account for newly approved federal spending cuts, which are expected to hurt hospitals nationwide by reducing Medicaid enrollment and curtailing state aid and tax breaks. 
Acacia noted the “material adverse impact” on Centurion’s financial condition from Medicaid cuts and other federal funding changes.
Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha previously acknowledged that the sale is not a cure for the hospital’s financial and operation pains. Instead, Neronha said the new owners offer at least a chance to recover from years of mismanagement, rather than letting the hospitals shutter — a more likely possibility now that Prospect has filed for federal bankruptcy. 
The two hospitals in Providence and North Providence, with 500 beds between them, account for more than 50,000 emergency room visits per year. Together they have 104 beds for behavioral health patients, representing more than 20% of behavioral health beds available statewide.
The United Nurses and Allied Professionals, which represents more than 1,200 employees that work for the Rhode Island hospitals, has also backed Centurion’s ownership despite initial concerns over its lack of experience in hospital operations. 
Terms of the bond sale are expected to be finalized on Aug, 26, with a Sept. 4 closing date. Centurion will make its interest payment on Nov. 15, and first principal payment in 2030. The final payment is expected to be due in 2055. The $480.8 million total debt service includes the $43 million balance owed by Prospect on federal loans, as well as money owed on capital leases.

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)The redevelopment of the Superman building in downtown Providence will proceed as planned, with a new manager brought in following the death of the company’s top executive last month.
High Rock Development, which owns the building at 111 Westminster St., announced Friday that its long-time legal counsel, Michael Crossen, will take over company management. The news comes less than a month after the death of High Rock’s former principal, David Sweetser. Sweetser’s death cast doubt over the fate of the iconic downtown Providence skyscraper.
The 26-story office building, bought by High Rock in 2008, has been vacant since Bank of America moved out in 2013. It got its nickname for its resemblance to The Daily Planet newspaper building where Clark Kent worked in the 1950s TV show.
After several false starts, plans to revitalize the former bank building as a 300-unit apartment complex with commercial space emerged in 2022, aided by $65 million in state and city public financing for what was initially a $220 million redevelopment cost. 
Crossen is  a partner and business lawyer at international firm Foley & Lardner LLP with more than 25 years of experience in corporate and transactional law. He affirmed the company’s commitment to completing the project as a way to pay homage to Sweetser and provide much-needed housing to the capital city.
“David had a clear vision and we plan on seeing it come to fruition,” Crossen said in a statement. “Much progress has been made this year on multiple fronts, which makes this situation sadder. We look forward to continuing to advance this iconic project and the acceleration of all efforts and activities as we enter 2026.”
Among the recent examples of progress is a tax change incorporated into the state’s fiscal 2026 budget by state lawmakers. The rewrite of the Rebuild Rhode Island tax credit program lets High Rock qualify for an extra $4.6 million in state sales tax credits for construction costs. 
High Rock representatives told lawmakers during the 2025 session that the state tax change was the final piece of financial aid needed.
“This complex project will get off the ground and provide hundreds of jobs, housing opportunities and a long-term economic benefit for Rhode Island’s economy,” Crossen said.
There was no timeline for construction or an estimated completion date. 
The property was valued at $13.5 million in 2025, down $500,000 from the prior year’s assessment, according to the city assessment database. A 30-year tax deal made between the developer and the city of Providence in 2022 would save the developer $29.4 million in city property taxes over the next 30 years if the development is completed. The payment schedule assumes the regular payment of $500,000 in annual property taxes — undiscounted — through 2026, with discounts beginning in 2026 as the property value increases alongside its redevelopment.

,DC,2025-08-15 20:08:27+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,AmeriCorps is under siege. What happens in the communities it serves?,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/americorps-under-siege-what-happens-communities-it-serves,,"SILVER SPRING, Md. — Daniel Zare worked one-on-one as an AmeriCorps member with students going through rough times in school, lightening teachers’ workload in the classroom.At AmeriCorps Project CHANGE, based in Silver Spring’s Sligo Middle School, Zare was one of several in his group who tracked adolescents’ emotional and social wellbeing over months using a system dubbed “My Score.” They then helped support the kids who were struggling the most.In April, though, the program screeched to a halt. That’s when the Trump administration abruptly canceled nearly $400 million in active AmeriCorps grants across the United States that fund volunteers who embed in communities, in exchange for a small stipend and education award.“All the work that we had culminating toward the end of the year, the relationships that we built with teachers and students and officials, it just completely went kaput because we were told we weren't allowed to go to work at all,” Zare, 27, told States Newsroom.Like so many longstanding federal programs and institutions severely reduced or dismantled as part of President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency project, AmeriCorps — and its nonprofit partners — are now assessing the damage and seeking a way forward.AmeriCorps programs that survived last spring’s DOGE cuts are slowly beginning a new year of service amid major uncertainty over whether they will be able to continue their work in classrooms, food banks, senior centers and other community hubs.Winners and losers among statesAmeriCorps, a federal agency signed into law in 1993 by former President Bill Clinton, places roughly 200,000 members across the United States at 35,000 service locations, according to current agency data.Members serve in schools, local governments and with a wide range of nonprofits that focus on health, disaster relief, environmental stewardship, workforce development and veterans.The staffers, who pledge to “get things done for America,” are paid a modest living allowance that hovers around the poverty line. Some, but not all, can get health insurance while in the program.Members who complete their service term, which usually lasts from 10 to 12 months, receive an education award that can be used to pursue a degree, earn a trade certificate or pay student loans.AmeriCorps federal dollars reach programs via a couple routes. In many cases, grants flow from AmeriCorps to governor-led state and territorial commissions that divvy them up according to local priorities. In other cases, federal dollars flow straight to a program via a competitive grant process. Kaira Esgate, CEO of America’s Service Commissions, said when the Trump administration ordered the cuts in April, some states lost large portions of their AmeriCorps portfolio, while other states fared better.“There were no real clear trend lines around what or who got terminated and why,” said Esgate, whose member organization represents all 49 state commissions (South Dakota doesn’t have one) and the commissions for the District of Columbia, Guam and Puerto Rico.Abby Andre, executive director of The Impact Project, a new nonprofit tracking government cuts, has been collecting data and plotting on an interactive map where AmeriCorps programs have been canceled. Andre, a former Department of Justice litigator, has also worked with her team to build other maps showing where federal workforce cuts have been felt across the country.""AmeriCorps is a really great example of the federal dollars being kind of invisible in communities. Communities often don't know that a local food bank or a senior center are supported by AmeriCorps volunteers and AmeriCorps money,"" said Andre, who taught administrative law at the Vermont Law School after working under President Barack Obama and in Trump's first administration.Andre said communities with a lack of social services, including in rural areas, will likely feel the biggest losses without an AmeriCorps presence because the agency ""facilitates pennies-on-the-dollar type services through volunteer work.""""It's not as though if these community services folded, those communities would have the money to fund equal or better services through the private market,"" she said.Losing trustThe Maryland Governor’s Office on Service and Volunteerism gave the green light to Project CHANGE to keep its program, which serves Montgomery County in suburban Washington, D.C., running through the upcoming school year.Paul Costello, director of Project CHANGE, is now scrambling to launch a new AmeriCorps cohort after receiving the news on July 22 that the initiative had been funded. He estimates members won’t be able to begin until almost a month into the school year.

“Sadly, AmeriCorps, as a brand name, is badly damaged, I think. I mean, I've got a meeting on Wednesday with a major partner who told us two weeks ago ‘We thought you were dead,’” Costello told States Newsroom in an Aug. 11 interview.Costello’s program not only places service members in Montgomery County Public Schools, where Zare served, but also with partners including Community Bridges, Montgomery Housing Partnership and Family Learning Solutions.The nonprofits respectively focus on helping adolescent girls from diverse backgrounds, children whose families live in community-developed affordable housing units and teens eyeing college and career paths.The county’s school system is the largest in the state and serves a highly diverse population. About 44% of the system’s 160,000 students qualify for free and reduced meals, and close to 20% are learning English while continuing to speak another language at home.Costello’s 18 cohort members embedded in those schools and nonprofits this past academic year were suddenly yanked in April when the government cut his grant. The partners, which had planned and budgeted to have the members through June, were thrown into “total chaos,” Costello said.“So some of them are so desperate, they rely on their members. They had to dig into their pockets to keep them on as staff. And then we go back to them this year and say, ‘You want members this year?’ AmeriCorps has made no attempt to make them whole. So they’ve been screwed,” Costello said.AmeriCorps did not respond to States Newsroom’s questions about nonprofits losing money.Legal actionThe federal courts granted some relief to members and organizations who abruptly lost living allowances and contractually obligated funding.A Maryland federal district judge ordered in June that funding and positions  be restored in 24 Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia that sued the agency.Another district judge in the state also handed a win to more than a dozen nonprofits from across the country that sued to recover funding they were owed.But for many it was too late, and AmeriCorps’ future still feels shaky.After suddenly losing his living allowance in April, Zare had to leave Silver Spring.“I was renting a room off of Georgia (Avenue), and I was not able to pay rent there anymore, so I actually moved back to my mom's in Germantown for the time being,” he told States Newsroom in August, referring to another Maryland suburb.Hillary Kane, director of the Philadelphia Higher Education Network for Neighborhood Development, said by the time the court orders were issued, many of her AmeriCorps members had already found other positions and she had completely let go of one of her full-time staffers.While the court injunctions were “welcome news,” reinstating the programs remained “questionable,” Kane wrote in a July 21 update for Nonprofit Quarterly.Kane’s organization is a member of the National College Attainment Network, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit that was among the successful plaintiffs.Other organizations that joined the lawsuit are based in California, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Dakota and Virginia.The Democratic-led states that won reinstatement for AmeriCorps members include Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin.Going forward?Kane got news on July 10 that PennSERVE, Pennsylvania’s state service commission, reinstated funding for her AmeriCorps program that places members in four West Philadelphia high schools to mentor students on their post-graduation plans.The late notice meant Kane could only begin recruiting new members in mid-July.“And so our start date has to be a bit fluid,” Kane told States Newsroom during a July 22 interview. “We have to essentially recruit people into this one-year cohort position, and say, ‘We're hoping to start September 2, but we're not 100% sure. Can you kind of just roll with it?’ It's an awkward position to have to be in.”

Other AmeriCorps programs have not fared so well, as the Trump administration’s Office of Management and Budget continues to withhold funds that were appropriated by Congress for the ongoing fiscal year.Trump signed legislation in March that extended the $1.26 billion for AmeriCorps for the full 2025 fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30.Kane said the most “insidious” part of the recent AmeriCorps storyline is that programs that receive grants directly from the federal agency are being strung along by OMB.“So there are agencies who have been theoretically awarded money, but they’re like, ‘Is it actually going to happen? Should I spend all this money and then not be able to bill the federal government to reimburse me if OMB is going to hold it hostage?’”Programs at risk include 130 recently expired contracts for AmeriCorps Foster Grandparent and Senior Companions programs that support roughly 6,000 senior citizen volunteers across 35 states. The programs are eligible for just over $50 million for the new service year, which should be off to a start.Congress pleads with budget officeA bipartisan group of U.S. senators pressed the executive branch agency on Aug. 1 to release the funds.“Further delays in grantmaking will have immediate and irreversible consequences for programs, AmeriCorps members, and communities,” the senators wrote in a letter to OMB Director Russ Vought.Republican Sens. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Thom Tillis of North Carolina joined Democratic Sens. Chris Coons of Delaware, Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York in signing the letter. All are members of the Senate National Service Caucus.The White House and AmeriCorps did not respond for comment.The Republican-led Senate Committee on Appropriations voted on July 31 to preserve $1.25 billion in AmeriCorps funding for fiscal year 2026. Collins chairs the committee.U.S. House appropriators, which for the last two years under Republican leadership have sought to cut AmeriCorps funding, are expected to debate its budget in September. But it’s almost certain Congress will have to pass a stopgap spending bill when the end of the fiscal year arrives to stave off a partial government shutdown, so a final decision on funding may not come for months.Change for everyoneZare never did have a chance to say goodbye to all his students in April.And even though the option was on the table, he did not sign up to serve a third year with AmeriCorps.Before he applied and earned a spot with Project CHANGE, Zare was working odd jobs, including as a utilities contractor for Comcast. He had also earned his associate’s degree.

“I don't think there's any other program to take someone like me who was working a couple of different jobs and put them in an environment like this, to see firsthand as an American citizen how our classrooms operate and what position I would need to be in to actually be of benefit,” Zare told States Newsroom.Zare is now freelancing and debating his next move, whether that’s a new job or further higher education.“AmeriCorps is something that I'm always going to cherish because a lot of the people there still help me,” he said.Editor’s note: D.C.

,Mississippi Today,2025-08-15 20:03:46+00:00,Mississippi Today,Memorial Hospital Biloxi will close its labor and delivery unit next month,Sophia Paffenroth,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/08/15/memorial-hospital-biloxi-labor-delivery/,Memorial Hospital Biloxi will continue offering gynecological care but will stop its labor and delivery services as of Sept. 1.,"Memorial Hospital Biloxi will stop offering labor and delivery services as of Sept.1 – a change that comes seven months after Memorial Health System bought the hospital from Merit Health with intentions to expand services, including OB-GYN care. 
The Biloxi hospital will still offer gynecological services, but patients will have to go to Memorial Hospital in Gulfport or another nearby hospital to give birth. 
Kent Nicaud, president and CEO of the hospital system, said his team has prepared for this transition and expects no delays in care or extended wait times at the Gulfport hospital.

“We have recently added several new providers, including physicians and OBs, to support our growth,” Nicaud told Mississippi Today. “These resources ensure there will be no access issues or delays, and every expectant mother will receive the highest standard of care in the region.”
Both hospitals accept the same insurance, Nicaud confirmed. 
Expectant mothers who are currently patients at Biloxi have been informed about the transition, their delivery options and enhanced services at Gulfport. The two hospitals are about 15 miles apart.
The Gulfport hospital is home to Mississippi Gulf Coast’s only Level III neonatal intensive care unit. Level III is equipped to deal with babies who are born earlier than 32 weeks or who have critical illnesses. 
The availability of obstetrics care has been declining for over a decade, with labor and delivery units shuttering across the U.S., particularly in rural areas. Obstetrics is one of the most expensive services hospitals provide. 
Nicaud said this move is intended to improve efficiency, citing Gulfport’s NICU, OB emergency department and 24/7 laborist program. 
“We’re consolidating obstetrics services to give every expectant mother access to all of the region’s most advanced maternity resources in one place,” he said. “This unified approach ensures high-quality and coordinated care from pregnancy through delivery and beyond.”
The following hospitals offer labor and delivery services in Mississippi’s six southernmost counties, according to the Mississippi State Department of Health:

Article Summary

In response to a July letter, the Illinois State Board of Elections provided the U.S. Department of Justice with the same limited voter data that it provides to political parties.
The DOJ, however, countered that it wanted more specific data, that includes dates of birth, partial Social Security numbers and driver’s license numbers.
An elections expert reached by Capitol News Illinois last month said the DOJ is overstating its authority in seeking the data.
JB Pritzker accused the Trump administration of seeking a precursor to claim fraud in the upcoming 2026 elections.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

SPRINGFIELD – The U.S. Department of Justice is insisting Illinois election officials hand over the state’s entire computerized voter registration database, including sensitive information such as driver’s license and partial Social Security numbers.
In a letter dated Thursday, Aug. 14, an attorney in the department’s Civil Rights Division rejected the Illinois State Board of Elections’ offer of a partially redacted database – the same data that state law allows political committees and other governmental agencies to access – insisting that federal authorities are entitled to the complete, unredacted data.
READ NOW: U.S. Department of Justice letter to the Illinois State Board of Elections
“We have received Illinois’s statewide voter registration list (“VRL”),” Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon wrote. “However, as the Attorney General requested, the electronic copy of the statewide VRL must contain all fields, including the registrant’s full name, date of birth, residential address, his or her state driver’s license number or the last four digits of the registrant’s social security number as required under the Help America Vote Act (‘HAVA’) to register individuals for federal elections.”
The letter indicated DOJ was making the request under a provision of the National Voter Registration Act, also known as the “Motor Voter Act,” a 1993 law that was intended to make it easier for people to register whenever they conducted other government business such as obtaining a driver’s license or renewing their vehicle registration.
“Our request is pursuant to the Attorney General’s authority under Section 11 of the NVRA to bring enforcement actions,” the letter stated.
The letter also cited the 2002 Help America Vote Act. Passed in the wake of the controversial 2000 election between Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore, that law made sweeping changes to the nation’s voting processes, including new requirements about how states must maintain accurate and up-to-date voter registration databases.
‘Not entitled to demand’
DOJ first requested a copy of the Illinois database in a July 28 letter. That was a few weeks after the agency filed what’s known as a “statement of interest” in a civil lawsuit that the conservative legal activist group Judicial Watch, along with other plaintiffs, had filed against the state board, alleging it was not meeting its duties under HAVA to maintain the voter database.

In that initial letter, DOJ also requested the names of all election officials in the state who are responsible for maintaining the registration list. It also asked the state to identify the number of people removed from the registration list during the 2022 election cycle because they were noncitizens, adjudicated incompetent or due to felony convictions.
David Becker, a former attorney in the DOJ’s voting section who now runs the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation and Research, told Capitol News Illinois last month that the letter is similar to requests filed in multiple other states and that it goes far beyond the Justice Department’s legal authority.
“The Department of Justice asked for the complete voter file for the state of Illinois, including all fields in that file, which is an absolutely huge file that contains so much sensitive data about Illinois citizens, including driver’s license numbers, Social Security numbers and dates of birth that the Department of Justice is not entitled to receive and not entitled to demand,” he said in an interview. “They know this. Other states have told them this, and yet they continue to seek to receive this information, citing sections of federal law that don’t apply and don’t require that.”
Illinois’ initial response
The State Board of Elections responded to that request Aug. 11 with answers to DOJ’s questions as well as an electronic copy of what it described as the statewide voter registration list.
However, the board also cited a state statute that limits what the agency can disclose from the centralized registration list.
A spokesperson for the board said in an email that the law allows the release of two types of data files. One, available only to political committees or “a governmental entity for a governmental purpose,” includes the voters’ names and addresses, their age at the time the registration was completed, the voting jurisdictions in which they reside, and their voting history. That includes elections in which they voted and, in the case of primary elections, which party’s ballot they selected.
That is the list the state board provided to DOJ. The board also waived the normal $500 fee it charges for providing the list.
Another version of the file, available to the general public, contains much of the same information, but only the name of the street on which they live, not their exact street address.
But neither file, the spokesman said, contains voters’ personal identification information used to verify voter registrations such as driver’s license numbers or Social Security numbers.
DOJ, Pritzker respond
In its letter Thursday, however, DOJ said the list that the elections board provided was insufficient.
“In charging the Attorney General with enforcement of the voter registration list requirements in HAVA and the NVRA, Congress plainly intended that DOJ be able to conduct an independent review of each state’s list,” Dhillon wrote. “Any statewide prohibitions are preempted by federal law.”
The letter directed the board to provide the information by Aug. 21.
The board spokesman said the latest DOJ letter is “under review.”
On Monday, Pritzker declined to say whether the board’s decision to provide the partially redacted database was the correct one. But he also accused the Trump administration of ulterior motives.
“Well, it’s clear why they’re hunting around for voter data, right? They’re trying to say that in the next election, that there will be fraud because they know they’re going to lose,” he said at an unrelated bill signing. “They are looking, essentially, to say that, well, we found somebody who died who’s still on the rolls, and therefore there’s fraud, and therefore these elections are fraudulent and should be overturned.”
He also defended Illinois’ decentralized election system.
“We have, actually, one of the safest, best systems in the entire country, because it’s run by individual county clerks so it’s unhackable,” he said.

And Medicaid funding problems may only increase in state fiscal year 2026-27.
Members of the Social Services Estimating Conference predict Medicaid expenditures for state fiscal year 2025-26 will exceed appropriations by $510.7 million. recently published data show.  
“Most importantly, the current-year estimate produces a General Revenue deficit of $125.5 million relative to the appropriated level,” economists wrote in a summary. 
 Payments to the Medicaid managed-care plans that are contracted to provide long-term care services to the poor, elderly, and disabled are a driving force behind the shortfall.
Economists projected the state will pay plans $7.8 billion by the end of the fiscal year on June 30 next year, or $285.4 million more than legislators budgeted. Conversely, there’s a budget surplus when it comes to payments for the Medicaid managed medical assistance plans that provide general acute care. Economists estimate those prepaid health plans will be paid $19.8 billion this year, which is $19.5 million less than what legislators budgeted.

Economists for the governor’s office and House and Senate routinely meet to analyze spending trends in programs funded with state dollars. Their forecasts inform legislators as they prepare and finalize the state’s operating budget. Members of the Social Services Estimating Conference, which examines spending in Medicaid programs and enrollment trends, met on June 30 and the results were posted this week.
In addition to reviewing spending for the current year, the conference analyzed Medicaid spending for the fiscal year that starts July 1, 2026. Assuming no changes in the law, Medicaid is expected to cost $37.1 billion.
That’s $2.1 billion-plus higher than what’s allocated for in the current year base budget. A base budget only includes projects paid for with recurring  dollars and funded with one-time appropriations.  Again, economists noted in the summary, that’s  $962.8 million more in general revenue than budgeted in FY 25-26.
Again, Medicaid managed-care plans — for long-term care and general acute care — are a driving force behind the gap, accounting for more than $1.75 billion of the projected shortfall for state fiscal year 2026-27.
In addition to projecting expenses, economists forecast Medicaid enrollment, or how many people will rely on the program. Economists agreed that 4,149,320 people will receive health care through Medicaid this year. That’s about 67,000 people fewer than legislators assumed when crafting the budget. 
Economists predict 4,186,782 will rely on Medicaid in FY 2026-27.

The committee chose not to sponsor legislation to tighten deadlines and increase fines for noncompliance, but could revisit the matter. 
The post Lawmakers are mulling changes to public records rules. But will they reconsider exempting themselves? appeared first on WyoFile .","The issue was simply a matter of accountability, former Wyoming Secretary of State Karl Allred told lawmakers Thursday. 
The Joint Corporations, Elections and Political Subdivisions Committee had been discussing several changes to the Wyoming Public Records Act, including a bill to make elected officials’ associations subject to the law, which governs the release of government documents like emails and reports.  
“I do believe as long as they’re getting taxpayer funds in any way, shape or form, they should be subject to public records requests,” Allred said. “You guys are.” 
“Actually, just to correct something,” committee co-chairman Sen. Cale Case, R-Lander, responded. “We’re not subject to the public records requests.”
In 2006, legislators voted to exempt themselves from the Wyoming Public Records Act, arguing it was needed to give them the freedom to conduct their business. The law makes emails and other communications between legislators, legislative staff and constituents confidential unless the privilege is waived by the lawmaker. Other government entities, from the governor to government employees, are subject to the law, and generally must turn over their correspondence if requested.
At the Thursday meeting in Casper, lawmakers mulled other revisions to the act including tightened deadlines, steeper fines for violations and uniform fees for local government entities. 
“The revisions to the Wyoming Public Records Act that you all have presented here, I think are constructive and improve the act, but I don’t think they go far enough,” Cheyenne resident and WyoFile columnist Rod Miller told the committee. 
“I also add that the Legislature opens itself up to valid criticism of hypocrisy if it exempts itself from the Wyoming Public Records Act,” Miller said.  
Ultimately, the committee chose not to sponsor either of the bills that were up for consideration, opting instead to carry the discussion to the next meeting and to form a working group after hearing concerns from local government officials and the state’s public records ombudsman that many of the proposed revisions would be counterproductive. 
It remains to be seen what appetite, if any, lawmakers have to repeal the exemption they gave themselves nearly 20 years ago. 
The Wyoming Freedom Caucus, which now leads the House, has not taken a public stance on the matter, and the group’s chair, Cody Republican Rep. Rachel Rodriguez-Williams, did not respond to multiple inquiries by WyoFile. 
Ahead of Thursday’s meeting, Gov. Mark Gordon weighed in. 
“I think transparent government is essential — what’s good for the goose is good for the gander,” Gordon told WyoFile. “I firmly believe that the Legislature has a responsibility to hold themselves as accountable to the public as they would hold the rest of government. This is especially important in a season of elections.” 
How we got here
When the Wyoming Legislature passed Senate File 5, “Privileged communications,” in 2006, the law made all legislative communications — such as emails, between legislators, legislative staff and constituents — confidential unless the privilege is waived by the lawmaker. 

Former Wyoming Gov. Dave Freudenthal speaks in 2008. (Josh Hallett)
Then-Democratic Gov. Dave Freudenthal opposed the bill, writing in his veto letter that it “can be read as significantly protecting legislators from accountability” and that “such a privilege would protect far more than essential legislative functions.”
Freudenthal also pointed to other governmental entities that lawmakers choose not to exempt. 
“The laws adopted by this body in the past to govern the executive branch and local governments have reflected the presumption of open government with a burden resting on any elected official seeking secrecy,” Freudenthal wrote. “While as governor I have not always liked the result, as a citizen I believe it is correct.” 
Lawmakers overrode his veto. 
Case told WyoFile ahead of the meeting he’s open to reconsidering the exemption, but there’s also good reason for emails to have some degree of privacy. Constituents regularly share personal details in emails to lawmakers, Case said. 
“The reason the Legislature did it was because they know firsthand that you might get something from a woman worried about her husband, for example, and the kids in school,” Case said.
Gillette Republican Rep. Chris Knapp co-chairs the committee with Case and is also vice chair of the Freedom Caucus. 
County commissioners, for example, taking action or voting over email “is very different from private emails back and forth between legislators dealing with any issue,” Knapp said. 
“[Lawmakers] have the right and ability to communicate and have that be private, no different than a phone conversation or anything else,” Knapp said. “I think, when it comes to taking action or building consensus, those things are covered under that act. And so I wouldn’t open it up to further legislation that gets rid of the exemption for lawmakers to be able to just converse.”

Revisions
Complaints about fees and timeliness led the committee to prioritize the study of public records rules in the off-season, also known as the interim when lawmakers meet in the months between sessions to delve more deeply into legislation. 
The complaints related to the effectiveness of the state’s public records ombudsman program, the costs government entities impose on records requesters and the “ignorance and disregard of public records and public meetings statutes by public officials,” according to a letter the committee sent to the Legislature’s Management Council in March. 
In May, the committee requested two draft bills — one to generally revise the Public Records Act, another to subject elected officials’ associations to the law. Such associations represent the state’s school boards, municipalities and county commissions, among other things.
Both bills were up for lawmaker consideration Thursday. 
Among those who urged the committee to reform the law was Darlena Potter, Wyoming’s public records ombudsman. Since 2019, it’s been her job to educate public officials about what’s required of them under the law and to help resolve issues regarding records requests of state and local government agencies. 
Thursday, however, Potter asked the committee to pump the brakes on the draft legislation. More specifically, she was concerned about the legislation significantly increasing workloads for all entities while doing very little to benefit the records requester. 
“When I got to thinking about some of this and how it would actually work with the public as well as with the local entities, I wanted to be very fair and cognizant that as a civil servant, I want to provide them as much as I can, and I know most of my colleagues do as well,” Potter said. And “as a member of the public, ‘What do I expect when I go in and ask for things as well?’ So I try to balance it between those two roles.”
The draft revisions bill would have shortened the current 30-day deadline for agencies to provide records to 10 days. 
“If you can complete it all in 10 days, that’s what you should do. You shouldn’t be holding on to those requests to the 30-day mark,” Potter said.
But there will be times when the full 30 days are needed, Potter said, as in cases with small municipalities with very limited staff, or during peak periods, such as elections. For the same reasons, Potter opposed the legislation’s proposed three-day deadline for a public entity to acknowledge a request. 
“It is not a matter of unwillingness, but rather a capacity issue,” Potter also explained in a letter to the committee.

As such, Potter said the question came down to this — “do we prioritize thorough, accurate, and responsible information, or quick delivery? I believe the public desires both, which necessitates sufficient time and due diligence.”
When lawmakers created Potter’s job in 2019, the law did not authorize the ombudsman to enforce Wyoming’s public records laws. And as a result, government entities don’t always comply, and disputes often land in court. That expense could prove difficult to impossible for those seeking public records.
To address that, the draft bill proposed having the ombudsman refer cases to the attorney general or district attorney, who could then go to the court to enforce compliance. 
But requiring those attorneys to review each case and decide whether to take action, Potter said, would likely yield a similar outcome and may even slow down the process since it would add an additional layer for requesters to navigate. 
Pinedale Mayor Matt Murdock, Mills Mayor Leah Juarez, Riverton City Administrator Kyle Butterfield and Laramie City Manager Janine Jordan also expressed concerns to the committee. 
“A town with one clerk or treasurer and a 10-day clock is not reform. It’s actually a failure point,” said Murdock, who also serves as president of the Wyoming Association of Municipalities. 
Bob Bonnar, owner and publisher of the Newcastle News Letter Journal, spoke in favor of the bill, echoing comments he made at the committee’s May meeting. 
“I do want to sincerely thank the local governments that are doing it right,” Bonnar said. “I honestly wish we had some of these folks in Weston County, or in some cases, from what I’ve heard from citizens and newspapers in their communities, I wish they were on other boards in their communities … Unfortunately, there are still way too many bad actors out there.”
Bonnar urged the committee to stick with the bill, but also asked that lawmakers take it a step further and repeal the law’s current language that stipulates only those who “knowingly or intentionally violate” it are liable for penalty. 
“This law has been ignored, and putting teeth into this law to truly get compliance from governments means pulling that ‘knowingly and intentionally’ language out of the violation part of it, because, again, we don’t get a claim when we get pulled over for speeding that we didn’t see the sign,” Bonnar said. “And I think it’s a bad example to set to allow the state’s leaders, the leaders of these communities, to plead ignorance to a law that, for all intents and purposes, has been on the books in this fashion since 2012.”
Ultimately, the committee chose to table the bill while a working group finesses it. Potter will lead the group, which will be made up of Case, Rep. Ann Lucas, R-Cheyenne, and Paul Hoeft, R-Powell. 
Associations applicability
Elected officials’ associations rely in part, though not entirely, on dues from their members. Cities and towns, for example, pay their dues to the Wyoming Association of Municipalities with tax dollars. 
As such, some argue that means those organizations should be subject to public records laws, including Rep. Marlene Brady, R-Green River.

“These associations are invisible and unaccountable to the public,” said Brady, who is also leading the charge on legislation to halt tax dollars from going to the associations altogether. 
WyoFile followed up with Brady to ask if she also thought lawmakers should be subject to public records laws. She responded that she would address the question at a later date. 
Mark Koep of Sundance spoke in favor of both efforts. 
“We need to rein this thing in. They are operating outside of the legal channels,” Koep told the committee. 
Sen. Cheri Steinmetz, R-Lingle, asked Koep if he’d tried bringing his concerns to his local officials. 
“I’m just hesitant to step over those lines when you could go to your local county commissioners at their budget meeting and say, ‘I don’t want you paying these associations dues, and here is why,’ and take care of this at the local level, without the Legislature stepping in,” she said.
Koep said he had, but still wanted lawmakers to take action. 
Speaking on behalf of WAM, Pinedale Mayor Matt Murdock pushed against the bill. Murdock noted that the organization also has members from the private sector alongside municipalities. 
“Under long standing U.S. Supreme Court precedent, private associations have strong First Amendment protections,” Murdock said. “We do feel that … there is very strong and a high potential [for] litigation that could follow from this bill.”
At Knapp’s suggestion, the committee chose to forgo legislation and take another route. 
In the Management Audit Committee’s work, Knapp said, “we see that small cities and towns really do rely on these organizations. So if they were treated more as a vendor, then they were an association with dues, I think that would help.”
That way, Knapp said, the public could more easily see how taxpayer dollars are spent. The committee plans to develop that approach at its next meeting in November.

Geter-Pataky appeared briefly in Bridgeport Superior Court on Friday and was charged with one count of violation of conditions of release in the first degree. She was released after posting $75,000 bail.
She will appear in court on Sept. 9, the same day she is scheduled to appear on the original charges that she committed more than 90 counts of election fraud, including unlawfully possessing another person’s absentee ballot.
The seven-page arrest warrant detailing the latest charge against Geter-Pataky alleges that she and a man identified as Alfredo Castillo visited a woman listed as a potential witness, and brought absentee ballot applications — along with some grapes.
The potential witness told investigators that Castillo came to her door with the grapes and that Geter-Pataky was in a pick-up truck and waved to her. 
The potential witness said she filled out her own application and signed it but she said she did not sign the application for her daughter, who has Down Syndrome, is nonverbal and is unable to write. She told inspectors “I don’t know why they have her vote,” according to the arrest warrant.
Castillo has not been charged in the case.
The second potential witness told investigators that Geter-Pataky stopped by her apartment in May to tell her she was running for City Council and to get her to sign an absentee ballot application, which she did.
When Geter-Pataky was arraigned in February, a judge specifically warned her that she wasn’t to contact witnesses and could face further charges if she did.
Geter-Pataky has been arrested twice since June 2024 on election fraud charges in the last two mayoral elections. 
The bulk of the recent charges against her stemmed from videos that appear to show her putting multiple ballots into a drop box in front of the City Hall annex.
The charges paint a picture of competing political camps that aggressively and illegally pursued absentee votes for Mayor Joe Ganim and Democratic primary challenger John Gomes — by forging signatures, registering non-citizens to vote, telling people how to vote, changing votes after they were cast and harvesting dozens of absentee ballots so they could be delivered to drop boxes in the city.
A total of 11 people have been arrested on election fraud charges over the past two years. All but one have all their cases still pending.
Only Josephine Edmonds, 63, has pleaded guilty accepting a three-year suspended sentence with three years probation.
Edmonds was facing four felony charges, including witness tampering and illegal possession of absentee ballots stemming from the 2019 election.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025_0306_SR_CTMirrorBridgeportCourt_021-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-15 15:56:43.709230

The suit alleges that heavily redacted records obtained by the ACLU, after significant delays, include correspondence between DMV and ICE, with references to chats on Signal, an encrypted communication app known to be used by federal officials, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. 
“Unfortunately, the reality is that when encrypted applications like Signal are used, it makes it very difficult for anybody in the public to know what’s occurred,” ACLU of Nevada Executive Director Athar Haseebullah said at a news conference Friday. He added the organization has no proof that Signal chats between DMV officials and ICE occurred. 
The ACLU wants to know if DMV staff are secretly communicating with immigration authorities, and the organization is seeking a court order requiring the DMV to turn over the documents, which it alleges contain redactions beyond those allowed under state law. 
The records, which the ACLU had been trying to obtain since February of this year, “don’t paint a complete picture, but those records established, incredibly, that, at best, there was suspicious communications that existed between the DMV and between ICE,” Haseebullah said at a Friday morning news conference. 
Nevada law, Haseebullah noted, “requires the preservation of public records, and the public has a right to know how state agencies are operating – the same state agencies they fund, especially when it comes to data sharing and cooperation between Nevada agencies and immigration enforcement.” 
The “consistent communication” between DMV and ICE makes no reference to subpoenas or warrants, Haseebullah said. 
An April email response from DMV to the ACLU says the organization’s request for ICE communications “is not considered public information and cannot be released, any communication we have to ICE is only for investigations purposes.”
The DMV did not identify what information is for investigation purposes, the suit says.  
Nevada allows individuals who lack the identification needed to obtain a driver’s license to apply for a driver’s authorization card through the DMV. The law prohibits the DMV from releasing data for any purpose relating to the enforcement of immigration laws. 
“Let me be clear. If you cannot operate in transparency, you’re not protecting the people,” Assemblywoman Cecelia Gonzalez, chair of the Nevada Latino Legislative Caucus, said at the news conference. “You are hiding from the people that you so say you represent.” 
The ACLU is asking the state to conduct an independent investigation “and full disclosure by the governor of any and all existences of cooperation between ICE and the DMV.”
Gov. Joe Lombardo, who has instructed Nevada’s National Guard to cooperate with ICE, did not respond to the Current’s inquiry asking whether he’s requested other agencies, including the DMV, to do the same. 
The ACLU’s writ makes three claims – that the DMV failed to respond to a record request; that the DMV failed to cite the proper legal authority that warrants withholding the record; and that the agency cited inapplicable reasons the documents were not shared.
The organization is also seeking civil penalties for what it calls the DMV’s ongoing abuse of the Nevada Public Records Act.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dmv-voter-registration.png,,,2025-08-15 15:56:43.709230

(Photo courtesy of Crop Protection Network) Sudden death syndrome, a fungal disease affecting soybeans, has no cure in the field and can lead to significant yield losses. 
The disease is present in Iowa bean fields every year, but one researcher said conditions have not been this optimal for the disease since 2018. 
Daren Mueller, a plant pathologist with Iowa State University Extension and Outreach, said if a good year for sudden death syndrome, commonly abbreviated to SDS, could be defined, “this would be the year.” 
Mueller said SDS thrives when a cool, wet spring is followed by heavy summer rain events — and these circumstances have been present across most of the state.

The fungus can live in the soil for several years as it feeds on dead plant material, even through a corn rotation. When it’s present, spring planting that is followed by a wet spring creates conditions for the fungus to get into the roots and create root rot. 
Heavy summer rains during the plant’s reproductive season make it easy for the toxin that is emitted by the fungus to travel up the plant and into the leaves. Here in the foliar stage, the toxin causes the leaves to be photosensitive, turn yellow, then brown and sometimes drop off.

Most producers aren’t aware the disease is affecting their plants until it reaches the foliar stage, but Mueller said that doesn’t matter as there is “absolutely nothing” a farmer can do to stop the disease.
Mueller said the best defense against SDS is a seed treatment, but once the seed is in the field there are no sprays or other treatments that can save the plants. 
“The day after planting, it’s too late to do anything,” Mueller said. “Even if you don’t have symptoms … once the seed’s been put in the ground, all of your options for that year are done.” 
The severity of the disease can be increased when other diseases or pests like soybean cyst nematodes are also attacking the plants. 
Mueller said the best thing that farmers can do when they notice SDS is to take note. Write down what type of seed they used, try to obtain an aerial image of the field to determine how much was affected, and talk to neighbors and seed companies to see what they experienced this year.

Mueller said it’s hard for seed companies to accurately rate their varieties for resistance to the disease when it has not been widely present in several years.  
“We’ve had three or four or five years in a row of pretty poor SDS, which is good for farmers, but it’s also not good for the people trying to rate and put an accurate rating on the varieties,” Mueller said. 
While much of the state has received the rain conditions that are conducive for SDS, Mueller said he has not been to “all the corners of the state” to observe the effects of the disease. He said most of his calls and identified cases he’s fielded have come from farms in the southeast, southwest and northwest portions of the state. 
SDS can also look like brown stem rot or red crown rot, the latter of which has not yet been identified in Iowa, according to ISU’s Integrated Crop Management report. The best way to distinguish SDS from brown stem rot, is to look at the internal stems on soybeans. SDS stems will be white, while brown stem rot infected plants will have brown pith in the stems, according to the Crop Protection Network.
Agronomists with the Iowa Soybean Association noted cases of SDS in all regions except southwest Iowa in the association’s latest “Walking Rows” article. Southern corn rust, another fungal disease, has also been widely reported in corn acres across the state.

(Photo by Leah Romero for Source NM)Vallarie Holliday’s children recently returned to school in Silver City and while they are still very early in their educational journeys, the mother of two is already worried they will suffer from an inadequate system.
Both children have language delays, she said, and her son also receives special education services in school. He previously attended a private Montessori school before attending first grade at a public school.
“We actually kept him [in private school] I think longer than was good for him out of fear of transitioning into the public schools,” Holliday said. “But the staff that he’s encountered with has been great.  My just concern is, as he moves up, is he still going to encounter great people.”
Holliday was one of dozens of Grant County residents who attended a community meeting Thursday evening to provide their input on various areas of New Mexico’s public education system. The meeting is one of multiple hosted by the New Mexico Public Education Department and the Los Alamos National Laboratory Foundation to gather public comments to inform the court ordered remedial plan in the Yazzie/Martinez education equity lawsuit.
First Judicial District Court Judge Matthew Wilson found in April that the state had failed to meet the court’s order to improve educational opportunities for at-risk children including Native American students, English Language Learners, low-income students and students with disabilities. Wilson ordered the Public Education Department to take steps to partner with an outside expert and prepare a draft remedial plan by Oct. 1.

New Mexico parents, educators and other members of the public have met at community meetings throughout the state this month to share what they think should be done to improve educational outcomes for at-risk students. Attendees at theSilver City meeting were invited to absorb a brief history of the Yazzie/Martinez case before sharing their suggestions on funding and accountability; high-quality, culturally and linguistically responsive educators; and resources, programs, support and instruction.
Holliday stressed the importance of transparency and communication between all entities involved in the public school system, particularly how schools communicate with parents.
“I feel like I kind of send them to school and I don’t really know what’s going to be happening,” she told Source. “The IEPs [Individualized Education Program] don’t happen until October. So when my son was there last year, we would get tidbits…but it wasn’t until the IEP in October that we really got a breakdown of this day.”
She added that her daughter does not have a speech therapist at her school and visiting a specialist on their own is an expensive, out-of-pocket cost they cannot afford. Holliday suggested addingmore summer preparation for special needs students to fully prepare teachers and students before the first day of school.
Jillian Bernstein, an online educator, told her group at the meeting that she believes the Public Education Department would benefit from a third party monitor, similar to how the Office of the Child Advocate was recently created to provide oversight to the New Mexico Children, Youth and Families Department.
She explained to Source that she is a licensed master social worker and earned her teaching credentials through an alternative licensure pathway. However, she found that she was often dismissed while working in the public schools for not following a more traditional certification route.
“They’re not receptive, but there’s also no accountability whatsoever within the district,” Bernstein said. “We need to have an outside agency and follow models that have been successful from people who are actually listening and passionate.”
Alexandra Neves, associate dean of the College of Education at Western New Mexico University and professor of bilingual education, explained to Source that her role is to educate New Mexico’s future educators, which includes discussing the Yazzie/Martinez case.
“I talk about Yazzie/Martinez, so this is part of our curriculum. But when I go to schools sometimes with teachers that have been there for a while, they didn’t know, like when I talk about Yazzie/Martinez, they didn’t know what it was,” Neves said. 
Details of the lawsuit and its findings, as well as changes implemented at the state level need to “trickle down” to districts, schools and teachers, Neves said.
“The results come from people who are invested and it’s not like just, ‘Oh, you need to do this.’ So it’s one more thing on the plate of teaching when we should be removing things and letting them teach,” she said.

Tim Hand with the Los Alamos National Laboratory Foundation told Source that the meetings have largely been well attended and that participants have started pinpointing helpful, actionable items for the state and other levels of education to implement. 
“We’ve been doing this for years, right? The issues are clear, the barriers are clear, the assets are getting more clear. It’s the actions that are fuzzy,” Hand said. “We’re building upon all the work that’s already been done over the last decade.”
He added that there is some tension in the room during the meetings, but “without tension, there’s no forward momentum.” 
Three more meetings are scheduled to be held this month: Aug. 20 in Albuquerque, and virtually on Aug. 22 and 26. People can also fill out the community survey online.
The Public Education Department and the Los Alamos National LaboratoryFoundation will then take all of the comments and suggestions heard this month and create a report, which will inform the remedial plan. The court gave the state until Oct. 1 to complete a draft plan and then until Nov. 3 to file the complete plan.

Without a deal, the Trump Administration will step in.","In summary
California shoots pointed words at states upriver, as negotiators struggle toward sharing supplies. Without a deal, the Trump Administration will step in. 


After one of the Colorado River’s driest years in decades, Lake Mead and Lake Powell — the largest reservoirs in the country — could see alarming declines in the coming years, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation announced today. 
Federal officials again called for Arizona and Nevada to cut back their supplies from the overtapped river — though California, with its senior claims to the river’s water, will be spared. 
While expected, today’s two-year projection ratchets up tension among seven states in the Colorado River basin, which have struggled to agree on the river’s management after 2026, when current guidelines expire. 
“The urgency for the seven Colorado River Basin states to reach a consensus agreement has never been clearer. We cannot afford to delay,” Scott Cameron, the Department of the Interior’s Acting Assistant Secretary for Water and Science, said in a statement. 
Lower-basin states — California, Arizona, and Nevada — are at odds with upper-basin states — Colorado, Wyoming, Utah and New Mexico — as they negotiate over dwindling water supplies. 
“We’re really sort of staring at what the deal is right now. But as close as it is, the harder it gets,” J.B. Hamby, California’s chief negotiator as chairman of the Colorado River Board of California, told CalMatters. 
Hamby also directed pointed words toward the upper-basin states. 
“The future of the Colorado River cannot rest on our shoulders alone. We have to ensure that every part of the basin takes responsibility for protecting the river’s future,” he added, in a statement.
Becky Mitchell, Colorado’s commissioner to the Upper Colorado River Commission, countered in an email: “If the lower basin is able to join us in adapting to a drier river, a basin states consensus is likely.” 
Federal officials have warned that basin states must hash out the broad strokes of an agreement by Nov. 11, or risk the U.S. government imposing its own. 
Interior Secretary Doug Burgum is “not looking forward to that,” Cameron warned at a June conference. “But in the absence of a seven-state agreement, he will do it.” 
The stakes for California are high. California takes the biggest share of Colorado River water — largely to irrigate half a million acres of alfalfa, winter vegetables and other crops in the Imperial Valley, and also to supply urban Southern California via the Metropolitan Water District. More than half of the power generated at Lake Mead’s Hoover Dam goes to California. 
As negotiators haggle over a seven-state deal, California water suppliers are also in parallel talks about how to share future shortages amongst themselves and with Arizona, said Bill Hasencamp, Metropolitan Water District’s manager of Colorado River resources. 
Plunging water levels at Lake Mead and Lake Powell only make that harder, he added. 
“Even with all of our efforts to do record amounts of conservation, it’s still not enough,” Hasencamp said. “We have to do even more than we’ve been doing in dry years.” 
Dividing up a shrinking river
For more than a century, a collection of deals, treaties and legal agreements have divided up the Colorado River’s water, a vital supply for 40 million people, seven states in the U.S. and two in Mexico, 30 federally recognized tribal nations and 5.5 million acres of agriculture. 
Demand has long outstripped supply, and climate-fueled megadrought and aridification have starved the river in recent decades — drying up the equivalent of Lake Mead by 2021.
By the summer of 2022, the driest 23-year stretch in over a century had sent the river’s massive reservoirs plunging to historic lows. It was a crisis for the basin, prompting the Biden administration to call for emergency cuts or face federal intervention. 
But even with billions of dollars in federal funding and temporary drought efforts anticipated to yield 3.7 million acre-feet of water conservation by the end of 2026, Lake Powell and Lake Mead are once again dipping concerningly low. 
Negotiating a deal is hard enough, said Tina Shields, water department manager of the Imperial Irrigation District, which receives the largest share of California’s Colorado River water. Worsening conditions mean “you have to do a lot more sooner rather than later. It doesn’t make it impossible, but it makes it more challenging.”
The reservoirs, each only 31% full, are projected to remain at levels in the coming year that trigger 18% cuts to Arizona’s total allotment, 7% to Nevada’s, and a 5% reduction for Mexico. 
Federal officials today released multiple different scenarios for the next two years. The one that experts say is most likely shows that one more dry year could send Lake Powell plunging below the levels needed to generate power by December 2026. 
The problem is that as climate change drives temperatures higher, thirsty soils drink up runoff before it reaches the river. Though precipitation reached 80% of average in the upper basin this year — and the snowpack hit 92% of the median at the end of March — spring runoff into Lake Powell was only 41% of normal. 
Brad Udall, a senior water and climate research scientist at Colorado State University’s Colorado Water Institute, told CalMatters that the situation is “beyond awful.”  
“I’m still optimistic that we’re going to pull a rabbit out of the hat at the last minute … although there are mumblings that things are not going so well, ” he said.  
Now, under the Trump administration, a new proposal to allocate a certain percentage of the river’s average flow to each basin is coming together, according to Hamby, California’s negotiator. Under the proposal, the lower basin and Mexico would receive some as-yet unknown percentage between 55% and 75% of average flow. 
The question that must be answered by November is what that percentage should be. 
“In our case, it would be an agreement to live with less than we’re otherwise entitled to,” Hamby said. And the upper basin states, he added, “may actually have to do something wild and crazy, like conserving water sometimes.” 
Becky Mitchell in Colorado said that the water users in the upper basin already reduce their use during drier years, with shortages averaging 1.3 million acre-feet per year. 
Moving forward with a plan, she said, “will depend upon the specifics.” 
If current policies aren’t updated, the reservoirs are highly likely to reach deadpool — the level at which water can no longer be released — at least once in the coming decades, according to a soon-to-be published study. “There’s a risk of these reservoirs dipping into lower water levels that can make them inoperable,” the study’s lead author Benjamin Bass, a researcher at UCLA’s Center for Climate Science, told CalMatters. “That’s really why we need to shift away from existing policy to something more stringent.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/070325-Lake-Mead-GETTY-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-15 14:58:02.629140

Sept. 5, 2023. (Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)With Maine Gov. Janet Mills set to term out after eight years, the field for the November 2026 gubernatorial election is packed with candidates with a spectrum of experience and views. 
Those running as either Democrats or Republicans will first face off against each other in the June 9, 2026 primaries in an effort to win over their base and secure their party’s nomination.
Open to all Maine voters, the primaries will be a ranked-choice ballot, though the general election in November will not. With at least one political heavyweight, Maine Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford, opting out of either major political party, it remains to be seen how that could influence Maine’s historically independent electorate.
The field is already crowded with several well known names vying for the Democratic Party nomination, including Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, former Senate President Troy Jackson, former speaker of the Maine House of Representatives and daughter of a U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, Hannah Pingree, and Angus King III, son of Maine’s independent U.S. senator.
Whoever becomes Maine’s next governor will take the helm for the remaining two years of President Donald Trump’s second term, and will have to navigate massive cuts in funding, the dismantling of federal agencies and programs, and greater pressure on states to conform with his agenda amid increased economic uncertainty.
Here’s the latest on the race for Maine governor.

Former Maine CDC head Dr. Nirav Shah considering bid for governor

Another popular figure in Maine is considering a run for governor. 
Dr. Nirav Shah told the Portland Press Herald in an interview Friday that he’s considering entering the race as a Democrat, which would have him joining a field already crowded with well-known players in Maine politics.  
Shah became a household figure as head of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention during the COVID-19 pandemic, holding daily briefings during which he would answer questions and provide updates on the public health crisis. He often appeared alongside Maine officials, including Gov. Janet Mills. 
He told the paper that experience gave him an appreciation for the impact state government can make on people’s lives.
“What attracted me in particular to the governor’s office is the impact you can have in the executive branch,” Shah said.
In January 2023, he was appointed as the principal deputy director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention under former President Joe Biden. Recently, he returned to Maine to launch a public health education program at Colby College, where he is a visiting professor.









Retired DEP employee is third independent to join the race for governor


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Thursday August 7, 2025 5:44 pm





A former longtime state government employee is running for governor as an independent.
John Glowa of South China is the most recent candidate to add his name to the growing list of gubernatorial candidates. So far, 16 people have entered the race, including three independents.
The most prominent of those is State Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford, who left the Republican Party earlier this year to announce his run, in addition to Dover-Foxcroft resident Alexander Murchison, according to the Maine Ethics Commission website.
Glowa worked for the Maine Department of Environmental Protection as an environmental specialist from 1987 until 2016, according to his campaign website. He then retired and ran for state representative as a member of the Democratic Party, and then for a seat in the Maine Senate.
He also founded the Maine Wolf Coalition, which advocates for wolf recovery in the northeast, and has accused state wildlife officials of deliberately downplaying evidence of wolves’ presence in the state.

Here are the Republicans vying to replace Gov. Janet Mills next November


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Wednesday August 6, 2025 8:04 am





Ben Midgley, a fitness executive from Kennebunkport, on Tuesday officially became the seventh Republican candidate in a crowded race for Gov. Janet Mills’ seat.
Midgley is the latest of 17 officially registered candidates vying to replace Mills, a Democrat who terms out next year. Both the Republican and Democratic primaries, slated for June 9, 2026, are open to all Maine voters. The primaries will be a ranked-choice ballot though the general election for governor in November will not.
Most of the Republican candidates listed on the Maine Ethics Commission website have not held public office at the state level, with the exception of state Sen. Jim Libby (R-Standish). Bobby Charles, a lawyer who served under former Republican presidents, and former Paris selectman Robert Wessels have also been involved in politics in different capacities.
In contrast, the Democratic field is stacked with party leaders, including Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, former Senate President Troy Jackson, and former Speaker of the Maine House of Representative and Mills administration official Hannah Pingree, among others.
Other GOP candidates, including University of Maine System trustee Owen McCarthy, tout their financial credentials while framing themselves as political outsiders. All seven appear to have varying stances on issues including the economy, education and immigration, but almost all have expressed concern about the increasing cost of living in Maine, which according to a Pan Atlantic Research poll conducted this year was the biggest concern expressed by voters.

Republican Sen. Rick Bennett announces independent bid for Maine governor


By: Emma Davis - Tuesday June 24, 2025 12:03 pm





After decades of public service as a Republican, state Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford announced on Tuesday that he is running for governor as an independent.
“My candidacy is not an indictment of either party,” Bennett told Maine Morning Star in an interview. “It’s an indictment of the party structure and parties as the solution to solving our problems.”
Calling his independent bid liberating, Bennett said he intends to take his message — one of fiscal responsibility — directly to Maine people and not a subset of the electorate, an approach he sees as a return to Maine’s independent tradition.
“I see politics beginning to slide more towards the politics of Washington,” Bennett said, “and I think we have the opportunity as Maine people to say no to that.”

Hannah Pingree officially launched her campaign for governor after months of speculation about the candidacy of the former Mills administration official and speaker of the Maine House of Representatives.
She kicked off the campaign with several planned stops around the state on Tuesday, starting with a rally in Rockland, scheduled meetings with local leaders in Lewiston and Biddeford before capping off the day with a celebration in Portland.
Pingree left her role as head of Gov. Janet Mills’ Office of Policy Innovation and the Future, also known as GOPIF, which she held since 2019. The office was created to recommend policy solutions for some of the state’s biggest issues including climate change, housing, workforce development, the opioid crisis and more.

State Sen. James Libby is running in the 2026 gubernatorial race.
Libby, who represents parts of Cumberland, Oxford and York counties, is one of five Republican candidates contending for the Blaine House, according to filings with the Maine Ethics Commission.
The race is already starting to get crowded, with the Democratic ticket drawing notable names including Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, who announced her bid in late March, as well as Angus King III, the son of independent U.S. senator and former governor Angus King Jr., who announced his run earlier this month.
Libby is in the middle of his second consecutive term in the Senate, but he has also spent time as a state representative after being first elected to the Legislature in 1992. He also ran in the 2002 Republican gubernatorial primary.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)A group seeking to decriminalize Alaskans’ use of certain medicinal mushrooms and other psychedelics can start collecting signatures to try to put the question before voters.
Lt. Gov. Nancy Dahlstrom, who oversees the Alaska Division of Elections, said Thursday she has certified a statewide initiative application that proposes legal but regulated use of certain natural medicines for therapeutic and traditional purposes. The sponsors may now start gathering the petition signatures they need to place their initiative on a statewide ballot.
The proposed initiative, titled the Alaska Natural Medicine Act, is modeled after an initiative in Colorado that voters in that state passed in 2022.
Sponsors of the initiative are with Natural Alaska Medicine Inc., a nonprofit organization “dedicated to fostering charitable, educational, and social welfare initiatives that promote the safe and responsible use of natural medicines,” according to its website.
The president of Natural Alaska Medicine Inc. and other team members are Indigenous Alaskans. The proposed ballot initiative includes provisions for Alaska Native traditional healers.
  A psilocybe mushroom is seen in this undated photo. The mushrooms are sources of psilocybin, which is metabolized in the body to the active drug psilocyn, also present in many of the same mushrooms. . (Photo provided by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration)
While the initiative would decriminalize adults’ personal use or home cultivation of psychedelic mushrooms and other psychedelics, it also proposes a regulatory system. It would establish a Natural Medicine Control Board in the state Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development. And it would establish an advisory Traditional Use Council.
Certain psychedelics are excluded and their use would not be allowed, under the initiative’s wording.
To qualify the initiative for the ballot, the petition sponsors must gather signatures equal in number to 10% of the voters in the state’s last general election, according to the Alaska Constitution. Additionally, signatures must come from at least 30 of the state’s 40 legislative House districts. Sponsors have a year in which to gather those signatures.
In her announcement Thursday, Dahlstrom did not indicate a position on the proposed initiative.
“This certification reflects the constitutional and statutory requirements for citizen-led initiatives in Alaska,” she said in a statement. “While voters will ultimately decide the merits of the proposal, the application meets all legal criteria for form and content.”

(Carl Payne for Colorado Newsline)The Colorado attorney general’s office has asked for the dismissal of the habeas corpus petition filed by former Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters, arguing that the federal court does not have jurisdiction in the case.
Peters is serving a nine-year prison sentence for her role in a breach of Mesa County’s elections systems during a 2021 software update. She was convicted by a jury in August 2024 on four felony counts related to the security breach, which was part of an effort to demonstrate that the 2020 election was untrustworthy, even though there is no credible evidence to support that position.
Peters has appealed the conviction, and while the Colorado Court of Appeals reviews her appeal, her legal team filed a federal habeas corpus petition. The petition, which was filed in the U.S. District Court of Colorado, argues that Peters should be released on bond pending the appeal decision.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The filing by the attorney general’s office cites the 1971 U.S. Supreme Court case Younger v. Harris, in which the court recognized “longstanding public policy against federal court interference with state court proceedings.”
According to the filing, if three conditions in the case are met, then the federal court “must abstain from exercising jurisdiction regarding state proceedings.” Those conditions are that the state proceedings are ongoing; the state proceedings implicate important state interests; and the state proceedings afford an adequate opportunity to present the federal constitutional challenges.
The filing argues that those conditions are met, because Peters’ state-level appeal is ongoing, her conviction is criminal, thus an important state interest, and her appeal allows her to present her constitutional challenge. Based on the precedent set in the Younger case, the filing says the federal court does not have jurisdiction in Peters’ habeas corpus petition.
Peters’ attorneys argue in the federal habeas corpus petition that her First Amendment rights have been violated because she has not been allowed bail pending her appeal. Her attorney, Peter Ticktin, cited a statement made by the Mesa County District Court judge when denying her bond. The judge said, “So the damage that is caused and continue to be caused is just as bad, if not worse, than the physical violence that this court sees on an all too regular basis. And it’s particularly damaging when those words come from someone who holds a position of influence like you.”
“(Peters) has been made to stay in prison because people are afraid of what she would say,” Ticktin said in an interview with Newsline.
The filing by the attorney general’s office, however, says, “The court pointed to her deceptive conduct as evidence of Ms. Peters’ belief that she was above the law and noted the impact it had on her reputation and the community. The court also discussed Ms. Peters’ allegations of election fraud in the context of her criminal conduct, explaining that she used her position to commit crimes for the purpose of promoting allegations of election fraud, which benefitted her personally.”
Ticktin has called Peters a “political prisoner.”
Peters was convicted by a Mesa County jury, and prosecuted by the office of a Republican district attorney. There has been no credible claim that the trial was politically compromised.
Peters’ case has garnered national attention and President Donald Trump has called for the U.S. Department of Justice to take “all necessary action” to secure her release. Trump cannot pardon Peters, because her conviction involves state crimes.
Peters’ attorneys have approximately two weeks to file a brief in response to the argument by the attorney general’s office that the federal court does not have jurisdiction in the habeas corpus case.

Originally introduced as LD 1018 and later enacted as part of the budget in June, the law safeguards the federal 340B Drug Pricing Program, which helps health care providers that serve vulnerable populations — such as Federally Qualified Health Centers and nonprofit hospitals — purchase prescription drugs at a discounted price. These cost savings then allow them to provide health care services at a lower cost to patients. Maine has 144 Federally Qualified Health Centers.
However, drug maker Novartis, which has its U.S. headquarters in East Hanover, New Jersey, filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Portland on Aug. 7, arguing that federal law governs the program, therefore states can’t regulate it. 
In the absence of federal legislation on the 340B program, other state legislatures have also passed protections, including Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi and West Virginia. 
Many of these laws have been tied up in lawsuits filed by Big Pharma since passage, but some lower courts have ruled in favor of state protections. And, in 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to take up a petition by a pharmaceutical industry lobbyist to review a lower court decision that did just that in Arkansas. 
The sponsor of the original bill in Maine, Sen. Donna Bailey (D-Saco), has described it as an anti-discrimination measure as it prohibits the pharmaceutical industry from forcing hospitals and Federally Qualified Health Centers to enter into partnerships that do not offer the 340B program.
“I introduced this law because all Mainers — especially low-income patients in rural and underserved areas — deserve access to quality, affordable health care,” Bailey said in a statement. “Now, Big Pharma is trying to undo our work and increase their own profits at the expense of health care providers and the patients who rely on these essential cost-saving programs.”
The Maine law is set to take effect on Sept. 24.

(Kathleen Flynn, special to ProPublica)A three-member panel of Louisiana’s parole board granted medical release Wednesday to a quadriplegic prisoner who is currently suing the state over health care conditions at the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola.
Kentrell Parker, who was convicted by a New Orleans jury for the 1999 murder of his girlfriend Kawana Bernard, suffered a traumatic spinal cord injury while playing in a prison-sponsored football game more than 15 years ago. He is paralyzed from the neck down and requires round-the-clock care, making him eligible for a medical treatment furlough.
Once the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola, where he is currently being housed, finds a nursing home that can accommodate his extensive needs, Parker will be permanently released into that facility’s care. The furlough can be revoked at any time based on poor behavior, or if Parker’s condition improves, which Angola medical staff stated it will not, according to the parole board.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Members of the state Board of Pardons and Committee on Parole voted to grant the furlough after a brief hearing with little discussion. Parker’s family was not immediately available to comment on the vote. Bernard’s family declined to participate in Wednesday’s hearing or provide a statement in opposition of Parker’s release, according to the parole board.
Parker, who was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole, has been pursuing an alternative medical release for more than a decade, claiming that allegedly substandard medical care at Angola threatened to worsen his condition.
A 2024 investigation by Verite News and ProPublica  detailed the conditions Parker and others endured while being held in Angola’s medical ward.
Parker’s family and friends reported seeing him lying in his own feces while suffering from an infection after bacteria had “entered his blood from his stool,” according to the 2015 lawsuit.
During one visit, his mother, Janice Parker, found her son alone in a dark, grimy room slightly larger than a bathroom, with no nurses or orderlies nearby. The medical staff put him there, she said, as punishment for complaining about his care. This was the medical ward’s version of solitary confinement. Parker told his mother he had been there for days. Janice Parker said she feared her son would die due to the prison’s neglect and poor quality of medical care.
Parker is among a dozen named plaintiffs in an ongoing 2015 class-action lawsuit against the Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections, among others. The suit alleged that the prison’s medical care caused inmates to suffer serious harm, including the “exacerbation of existing conditions, permanent disability, disfigurement, and even death.”
In the years that he has been held at Angola, at least 17 other prisoners there have died after receiving substandard health care, according to U.S. District Judge Shelly Dick, who presided over the case. In a 2023 ruling, Dick wrote that Angola’s medical care has caused “unspeakable” harm and amounts to “abhorrent cruel and unusual punishment.” The state has appealed Dick’s ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit in New Orleans, but the court has yet to reach a decision.
The board’s decision is a major victory for Parker and his family, but prisoners who have entered the system more recently may not be able to hope for similar outcomes due to new limitations on parole and other types of early release.
In 2024, at the urging of Louisiana’s tough-on-crime governor, Jeff Landry, the Louisiana state Legislature passed a bill that all but eliminates parole, including two of the three types available to the state’s sickest inmates, for anyone convicted of a crime that occurred after Aug. 1, 2024. Inmates will be eligible for the third — medical furlough — only after serving at least 85% of their sentences.
Landry has long criticized early release programs, even for medical treatment. During the pandemic, Landry opposed releasing elderly and medically vulnerable prisoners, warning that it could result in a “crime wave” more dangerous than the “potential public-health issue” in the state’s prisons.
Significant problems with Angola’s medical care have been well-documented going back decades. In 1994, the Justice Department reported that Angola inmates were punished for seeking medical care, with seriously ill patients placed in “isolation rooms.” Prison staff failed to “recognize, diagnose, treat, or monitor” inmates’ medical needs, including “serious chronic illnesses and dangerous infections and contagious diseases.”
During Wednesday’s parole hearing, Norris Henderson, executive director of Voice of the Experienced, spoke on Parker’s behalf. Henderson, who coached Parker’s football team, said he has fought for years to secure his friend’s release but was rejected at every turn without explanation.
“We got stuck on stupid for a long time,” Henderson said after the hearing. “It’s like a burden has been lifted.”

Use insect repellent registered with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that contain ingredients such as DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus, PMD, 2-undecanone, and permethrin (clothing only). 
Wear protective clothing outdoors such as long-sleeved shirts, long pants and socks.
Limit outdoor activities between dusk and dawn when mosquitoes that can carry West Nile virus are most likely to bite.
Eliminate stagnant water in containers around homes where mosquitoes can lay their eggs, such as: gutters, buckets, flowerpots, old tires, wading pools and birdbaths.
Install or repair screens on windows and doors to keep mosquitoes out of residences.
Maintain a well-trimmed yard and landscaping.

The department said most people who contract West Nile virus do not show symptoms of the disease, but those who do report a fever, headache, body and joint aches or a rash.
People over 60 years old and those with underlying health conditions are more susceptible to serious symptoms associated with the disease, which include paralysis, coma and could lead to death.
“Peak West Nile virus activity historically has occurred in late August, but with earlier human cases and high mosquito populations, this is the time to be vigilant and safeguard against disease,” Bakken said.
In 2024, North Dakota reported 38 human cases of West Nile virus for the entire year, down from 58 cases in 2023.

(Photo by Greg Kramos/USFWS)TOPEKA — The lesser prairie chicken, a dancing grouse that has long teetered between threatened and endangered classifications, lost its federal protections in court in a victory for Great Plains petroleum and cattle industries.
In a Tuesday decision from a Texas federal court, the lesser prairie chicken was stripped of any endangered or threatened species protections, which were established through a Biden-era ruling.
The Trump administration challenged that ruling, arguing it contained mistakes, and the lesser prairie chicken would be adequately protected without endangered or threatened classifications.
U.S. District Judge David Counts, a Trump appointee, agreed, denying a slate of motions in a 15-page omnibus order that reversed the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s 2022 classifications.
The lesser prairie chicken forages on what’s widely considered to be prime ranching and drilling land in the grasslands and brush of southwestern Kansas, southeastern Colorado, eastern New Mexico, western Oklahoma and the panhandle and south plains of Texas. The bird was first protected in 2014, a decision that was overturned a year later.
In the 2022 classifications, the bird’s populations were divided into a southern range in New Mexico and the southwest Texas Panhandle, where it was listed as endangered, and a northern range in Kansas, Oklahoma and the northeast Texas Panhandle, where it was listed as threatened.
More than 70% of the estimated lesser prairie chicken population resides in Kansas.
Fish and Wildlife Service admitted in the case that it erred in creating two distinct populations of lesser prairie chickens, and it failed to justify the classification of the two distinct population segments — northern and southern, Counts said.
He added that “the later endangered and threatened findings have no leg to stand on.”
“Fish and Wildlife is unable to correct this square one error without engaging in an entirely new analysis,” he said.
Counts reasoned that any “disruptive consequences” of removing protections “are short-lived and minimized by the sixteen existing voluntary conservation programs and efforts in place across the range of the lesser prairie-chicken.”
Many of those programs, which are administered by federal, state and private groups, existed before the 2022 listing decision and were designed to mitigate threats to the lesser prairie chicken and its habitat, Counts said.
“These efforts are not thought to be inadequate over the short term,” he said. “Rather, even the current listing decision couched their inadequacies in the long term — a span of 25 years.”
The decision is a win for Kansas agricultural and energy producers, said U.S. Rep. Tracey Mann. He added it is “a huge loss for radical climate activists and bureaucrats who have abused the Endangered Species Act for over a decade to hurt American agriculture and energy production.”
“Kansas farmers, ranchers and agricultural producers have always been and always will be the original conservationists of the land,” he said.
Mann was behind a bill this year that delisted the lesser prairie chicken and prevented any future efforts to relist it. However, the legislation did not progress.
Matt Teagarden, CEO of the Kansas Livestock Association, said in an emailed statement that the 2022 ruling contained “significant flaws” that “disproportionately affected livestock operations.” He said the association, which was part of the lawsuit, is pleased the Trump administration is reexamining the listing.
“Over the coming months,” he said, “we hope the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will take into account the voluntary conservation efforts already taking place, most of which are being done by ranchers.”
Texas agencies initially sued the Fish and Wildlife Service in March 2023. Among them was the state’s railroad commission, which regulates oil and natural gas production in the state. Attorneys general in Kansas and Oklahoma and the petroleum and cattle industries later joined the suit.
Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach and Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond celebrated the decision.
“The listing of the species as threatened or endangered would have crippled oil and wind energy production and would have limited where and when Kansas ranchers could graze cattle on their own property,” Kobach said in a Friday news release.
Drummond said in a Wednesday news release that he had called the Biden administration’s ruling “outrageous and illegal federal overreach.”
“This court decision affirms we were right,” Drummond said. “Oklahoma’s cattle grazing, energy production and rural economy are no longer under siege by this unlawful regulation.”
In Kobach’s initial argument in federal court, he worried Kansas would lose revenues from cattle ranching, farming, oil and gas production, wind energy production and tourism if the lesser prairie chicken’s threatened status stood. He worried the status would lead to job losses in the state, which would “further adversely impact state tax revenues, in addition to causing social instability among Kansans who lose their jobs.”
Under the Endangered Species Act, the habitat and species protections that accompany a threatened or endangered status determination curtail certain land uses such as cattle ranching, oil drilling and energy production in protected habitats.
Jason Rylander, legal director of the Center for Biological Diversity’s Climate Law Institute, which was an intervenor in the case, said the Trump administration’s rationale for removing the lesser prairie chicken’s protections was in bad faith.
“This ruling has nothing to do with science or the law and everything to do with kowtowing to the oil and gas industry,” he said. “We won’t be silent witnesses while the Trump administration and fossil fuel companies try to carve up what’s left of these dancing birds’ habitat and doom them to extinction.”
But the fight for the lesser prairie chicken is not over, Rylander said.
The institute is considering its legal options, including a possible appeal of Counts’ decision and a new petition with the USFWS to relist the lesser prairie chicken.

(Robert S. Craig/CDC)A senior Twin Falls resident died from West Nile, becoming Idaho’s first death from the virus this year, state health officials announced Friday.
Infected mosquitoes spread West Nile virus through bites. Virus activity has been detected this year in mosquitoes in seven southern Idaho counties and Malheur County in Oregon, according to a news release from the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare. The virus has been found in Canyon County and Ada County. But not all counties test mosquitoes. 
Idaho health officials encourage people to take steps to prevent mosquito bites while outdoors and on their properties.
Measles reported in eastern Idaho, becoming state’s second case in one week

“We strongly encourage Idahoans to fight the bite of mosquitoes to protect themselves and their families,” Deputy State Epidemiologist Kathy Turner said in a statement. “This tragic death from West Nile virus is a good reminder for all of us to take protective measures against mosquito bites. Wear long sleeves and pants outside and use insect repellent. Around your home and yard, reduce standing water where mosquitoes can lay their eggs.”
Most people infected with West Nile don’t feel sick. A fifth of people infected develop a fever and other symptoms like a headache, body aches, joint pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, swollen lymph glands or a rash. 
The risk of severe illness is higher for older people and people who have some medical conditions. Severe illness can affect the brain and spinal cord, and can lead to hospitalization or death. Officials encourage people who believe they are sick with West Nile to contact their health care provider.
SUB: Tips to avoid West Nile virus
To avoid West Nile infections, Health and Welfare encourages people to:

Avoid mosquitoes, especially when they are most active between dusk and dawn.
When outdoors, wear loose-fitting, long-sleeved shirts and pants. Wear clothing and gear treated with permethrin, an insecticide. 
Use insect repellents on exposed skin. Find repellents approved by the Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, and follow product instructions carefully. Find repellents online using the EPA’s search tool or a CDC chatbot.
Use mosquito netting to cover strollers and baby carriers. 

People should also take steps to mitigate mosquitos on their property, Health and Welfare suggests, including:

If your home has damaged screens, repair or replace them.
Mosquitos like to breed in standing water. Reduce standing water on your property, like for toys, trays or pots outdoors that can hold water. For bird baths, static decorative ponds and animal water tanks, change water weekly to prevent mosquito larvae from maturing into adults.

Santiago/Getty Images)BILOXI, Miss. — The Trump administration is developing a powerful data tool it claims will let states identify noncitizens registered to vote. But Democratic critics and data experts warn it could allow the federal government to vacuum up vast quantities of information on Americans for unclear purposes.
Some Democratic election officials and opponents of the effort fear President Donald Trump wants to build a federal database of voters to target political opponents or cherry-pick rare examples of noncitizen voters to fuel a sense of crisis. Republican election officials allied with the president counter that he’s helping states to maintain accurate voter rolls.
The Trump administration has rolled out changes to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, tool at the same time the U.S. Department of Justice is asking states for copies of their voter rolls. The timing, combined with questions about what happens to voter data uploaded to the program, has alarmed critics.
Trump wants Congress to pass a national proof of citizenship voter registration requirement and in March tried to unilaterally impose one for federal elections through executive order. But with the legislation stalled and the order halted by the courts, the citizenship data tool may offer a backdoor way to accomplish the same goal.
SAVE was originally intended to help state and local officials verify the immigration status of individual noncitizens seeking government benefits. But U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, this spring refashioned it into a platform that can scan states’ voter rolls if election officials upload the data.

The changes to SAVE, rolled out over just a few months and with little public debate, are “tinkering with sort of the bones of democracy,” said John Davisson, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington, D.C.-based research and advocacy group that argues privacy is a fundamental right.
“You’re talking about the voting process and who will be eligible to vote,” Davisson said. “And to take a system that is not designed for use in that process and repurpose it, really on the fly, without a formal comment process, without formal rulemaking, without congressional intervention — that’s pretty anomalous and pretty alarming.”
Previously, SAVE could only search one name at a time. Now it can conduct bulk searches, allowing state officials to potentially feed into it information on millions of registered voters. SAVE checks that information against a series of federal databases and reports back whether it can verify someone’s immigration status.
Since May, it also can draw upon Social Security data, transforming the program into a tool that can confirm citizenship because Social Security records for many, but not all, Americans include the information. NPR reported earlier on changes to SAVE.
“It is incredible what has been done, really since March,” Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray, a Republican who supports proof of citizenship requirements and the SAVE tool, told a gathering of state secretaries of state in Biloxi, Mississippi, last week.
Individuals registering to vote in federal elections must already sign a statement affirming they are citizens under penalty of perjury, and those who cast a ballot face criminal penalties and deportation. One study of the 2016 election placed the prevalence of noncitizen voting at 0.0001% of votes cast.
But as Trump has spread falsehoods about elections, Republicans have made purging noncitizens from voter rolls a central focus.

Democratic concerns were on display last week at the National Association of Secretaries of State conference, held at the Beau Rivage casino-resort in Biloxi. In interviews on the sidelines of the conference, Democratic secretaries of state voiced deep reservations — or outright opposition — about plugging their voter data into SAVE.
Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said Aug. 6 that the federal government appeared to be trying to take over election administration. She formally rejected the Justice Department’s voter roll request two days later.
Bellows said the Department of Homeland Security told her in a recent phone call that it planned to retain SAVE data for 10 years for “audit purposes only.”
“Just like the [Justice Department] is asking us to hand over an electronic file of all the voters in our state, it seems like the Department of Homeland Security is through this backdoor system also asking us to share voter information about every voter in our state,” Bellows said.
At least one state appears to have granted the federal government sweeping authority over any voter data it provides to SAVE.
Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales announced in July he had reached an agreement with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to access the newly expanded system for voter list maintenance. Indiana’s agreement allows the federal agency to use information the state provides for any purpose permitted by law, including criminal prosecutions.
Morales, a Republican, said in a news release that SAVE represented “another step in safeguarding the rights” of eligible voters. His office didn’t respond to Stateline’s questions.

The Trump administration has ramped up efforts to encourage state election officials to use the expanded program. The White House hosted a bipartisan “fly in” event for state secretaries of state on July 29. Multiple secretaries of state told Stateline that USCIS Director Joseph Edlow, who was confirmed on July 15, spoke at the event.
“The president is very much keyed in on voter list maintenance,” Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, a Republican, said in an interview — echoing other GOP secretaries of state who released statements praising the Trump administration after the meeting.










When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances.


– Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon


Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, a Democrat who attended the meeting, said he questioned how the federal government would handle voter information provided to SAVE. He added that the Justice Department’s request for his state’s voter rolls raised his level of concern about how data would be used.
“When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances,” Simon told Stateline.
The White House referred questions about SAVE and the event to the Department of Homeland Security and USCIS.
In response to questions from Stateline, USCIS didn’t directly answer whether the agency would share voter roll data with other parts of the federal government but confirmed it disposes of records after 10 years.
“The SAVE application is a critical tool for state and local governments to access information to safeguard the integrity of elections across the country. It’s no wonder many states have quickly adopted it, and we continue to promote the tool to other states and counties not using SAVE,” USCIS spokesperson Matthew Tragesser said in a statement.
“We look forward to continued optimization efforts and implementing more updates to SAVE.”
GOP pressure
Some Republican election officials and Trump allies have long wanted the federal government to take an expanded role in searching state voter rolls for noncitizens.
Last summer the Trump-aligned litigation group America First Legal, co-founded by Trump adviser Stephen Miller, encouraged states to submit to the Department of Homeland Security the names of individuals for citizenship or immigration status verification.
Some states did just that. Texas, for example, asked USCIS to verify the citizenship of some voters in September, and Indiana asked the agency to verify 585,774 voters in October. The same month, 16 Republican state attorneys general signed a letter criticizing Homeland Security, then under the Biden administration, for failing to work with states on verification.

After Trump took office, GOP state officials kept up the pressure. Twenty-one Republican secretaries of state urged Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in February to prioritize SAVE improvements.
On April 16, Indiana sued the department in federal court for not responding to its verification request last fall. USCIS announced an overhaul of SAVE less than a week later.
As the agency continues to remake SAVE, the tool will soon allow searches using the last four digits of a Social Security number, multiple state secretaries of state told Stateline. The agency confirmed the feature is under development and will be available soon but didn’t provide an exact date.
The change would mark another significant expansion of the program because most states collect the last four digits when individuals without a driver’s license register to vote.
Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican, said SAVE represents a better way to verify citizenship than a state law requiring voters to produce documents. “I think there’s a real opportunity for us to do a lot of this through just sharing of information and I think that’s what we’re seeing happen,” McGrane said in an interview.
Unreliable data?
But some voting rights advocates and experts on government data caution against an overreliance on Social Security data.
The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, a progressive policy nonprofit, has noted that Social Security only began tracking the citizenship status of all applicants in 1978 — meaning the database doesn’t include comprehensive citizenship information for older Americans. Additionally, Social Security may not always have up-to-date information on the status of naturalized U.S. citizens.
The nonpartisan Institute for Responsive Government also warned in May that since SAVE hasn’t used Social Security numbers to verify citizenship in the past, its accuracy and effectiveness are unknown. The success of the expanded SAVE program may also partially depend on whether it has adequate staff and resources, it said.

A 2017 Government Accountability Office report found that between fiscal years 2012 and 2016, about 16% of the nearly 90 million SAVE searches required additional verification, which the institute says often translates into federal workers manually checking files. Now that SAVE allows bulk searches, the need for manual checking could rise dramatically.
Nick Doctor, director of implementation at the Institute for Responsive Government, said in an interview that a tool confirming the eligibility of registered voters in a way that doesn’t burden individuals can be a good thing. But he emphasized that it depends in large measure on SAVE’s implementation.
“The changes that have been made to SAVE happened very quickly and, to my knowledge, we haven’t seen releases on the level of accuracy of that information,” Doctor said.
During interviews, Republican secretaries of state stressed that voters aren’t kicked off the rolls because SAVE can’t verify their citizenship. Instead, an inability to verify would likely trigger a follow-up process with the voter.
“Just because we get something back from the SAVE database, it’s not a cut and dry, especially on those they’re not sure about,” Hoskins, the Missouri secretary of state, said.
Still, Arizona illustrates why some Democrats worry about any large-scale effort to ask voters — especially longtime, older residents — to prove their citizenship. After the state discovered errors in how it tracked voter citizenship dating back years, election officials are contacting some 200,000 voters seeking proof of citizenship documentation.
Some have been casting ballots for decades without incident and many feel targeted, Arizona Democratic Secretary of State Adrian Fontes said during a presentation at the state secretaries of state conference. “They feel insulted when they get that letter,” Fontes said.










There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside.


– Charles Stewart III, MIT political science professor


Charles Stewart III, a professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies elections, said Arizona may actually point to the potential usefulness of SAVE. If Arizona runs its voter roll through the program, a list of 200,000 voters needing citizenship verification would perhaps drop into the hundreds, he suggested.
“There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside,” Stewart said.
Connecticut Democratic Secretary of State Stephanie Thomas told Stateline that every secretary wants tools to keep voter lists as clean as possible. But the details are important.
When she hears of something new, Thomas said she asks whether it’s the best option available and whether “the i’s are dotted, the t’s crossed.” She said she’s asked USCIS a series of questions about SAVE and is waiting on some responses.
“When it comes to voter lists,” Thomas said, “I don’t want Connecticut voters to be a guinea pig.”

(Courtesy of the Arkansas National Guard)The Arkansas National Guard has asked the federal government for authority to make immigration arrests, data shows.
According to ICE’s website, the Arkansas National Guard applied to receive authority under the so-called “task force model” of the 287(g) program. If the Guard’s application is approved, guard members who complete the necessary training would be allowed to conduct certain immigration enforcement activities.
“The 287(g) Task Force Model serves as a force multiplier by allowing state and local law enforcement agencies to enforce limited immigration authority during routine police enforcement duties,” according to ICE.
ICE’s website noted the Arkansas National Guard’s application as “pending” as of Aug. 14. It did not say when the application was submitted or when it could be approved.
A spokesperson for the Arkansas National Guard did not respond to a request for comment.
The application comes in the months after the Arkansas Legislature approved the Defense Against Criminal Illegals Act. Act 426 of 2025 requires the Arkansas State Police, Department of Corrections and county sheriffs’ departments to apply for authority to serve immigration warrants under the “warrant service officer” model and outlaws so-called “sanctuary cities” within the state.
The Arkansas National Guard was not specifically included in the act. National Guard soldiers typically do not serve a law enforcement role.
However, the Arkansas National Guard joined ASP and several other sheriffs offices in going a step further than what was required in the legislation by applying for “task force model” authority.
According to data obtained by DeportationData.org via federal Freedom of Information Act requests, more than 1,500 people have been arrested by immigration authorities in Arkansas in 2025.
The task force model is one of three 287(g) programs offered by ICE to local law enforcement agencies that impart limited degrees of immigration enforcement powers. The first, the warrant service officer model, allows trained law enforcement agencies to serve immigration warrants to those already in local jails. The jail enforcement model allows local law enforcement to identify and process those it believes are in the country illegally that are brought into the jail.
Eleven Arkansas jurisdictions have received authority under one of the two models this year.

But the task force model, which was originally suspended during former President Barack Obama’s administration, grants local law enforcement immigration enforcement powers outside jails. Agencies approved by ICE can stop, question and arrest people based on suspicions of immigration violations alone — something local law enforcement typically cannot do.
President Donald Trump’s administration revived the task force model after he retook office in January.
The American Immigration Council, a D.C.-based non-profit that advocates for immigrants, has described the task force model as having a “track record of racial profiling and harm.”

Joe Manchin is hitting the road in September to promote his upcoming memoir “Dead Center: In Defense of Common Sense.”
The 288 page book will be published on Sept. 16, but the book tour — which includes five in-person stops and one virtual event — will run from Sept. 12 to Sept. 22, according to social media posts from Manchin. 
The book, according to Manchin, will “pull back the curtain on the thought process behind [his] decisions and have candid conversations about how we fix what’s broken, find compromise and put country before party.”
Manchin will kick off the tour at West Virginia University — the only stop scheduled in his home state — on Sept. 12. Hoppy Kercheval, a longtime West Virginia political commentator and former host of MetroNews Talkline, will moderate a discussion with Manchin centered around his memoir.
Other stops on the tour will have conversations moderated by Brad Paisley, Gayle King, David Axelrod and David Rubenstein.
Manchin’s political career started in the 1980s, when he sat in the West Virginia House of Delegates for two terms before being elected to the state Senate. In 2001, he was elected to serve as the Secretary of State. In 2005, he won his bid for governor of West Virginia, serving one term before winning a special election to fill the late Robert C. Byrd’s seat in the U.S. Senate.
Manchin served in the U.S. Senate for about 15 years, announcing in 2023 that he would not be seeking reelection when his term ended in January 2025. 
For nearly his entire career, Manchin served as a Democrat. During his tenure in the Senate, he was often a moderate voice, opting at times to vote with Republicans instead of his own party.
Throughout his last few years in the Senate, Manchin regularly criticized the increased partisanship that had taken hold of Congress, calling both the left and the right too extreme. 
Following 2020, with a split Senate, he became a key player in proceedings due to his centrist leanings making him a swing vote despite his membership in the Democratic Party. His moderate views often led to more left-leaning policies being watered down in order to guarantee passage.
In May 2024, with less than a year left in his final term, Manchin changed his party registration to unaffiliated, leaving West Virginia without any federally elected Democrats. At the time, rumors were swirling in Washington, D.C. and West Virginia that Manchin was considering a bid for president due to his work with “No Labels,” an organization that was looking to form an independent presidential ticket for the 2024 election. 
That summer, Manchin killed those rumors. He spent his final year in office on a tour to “unite the middle” of America to support centrist policies, candidates and ideals.
According to the book summary, “Dead Center” will combine “eyebrow-raising, never-before-told stories from inside the Senate and the White House with insights into how government does ― or doesn’t ― work.”

Ned Lamont has repeatedly touted the progress Connecticut towns are making toward building more housing, but recent state data shows that some towns in the state are seeing a net loss of housing units.
Many towns are seeing fewer housing units being built, and in a few places, more are being demolished than built. Because of this, some towns have seen decreases in their net number of housing units from 2023 to 2024, and in five of Connecticut’s nine “Councils of Government” regions, the net increase in housing units slowed from 2023 to 2024.
Earlier this summer, Lamont unexpectedly vetoed House Bill 5002, a sweeping housing measure that would have pushed towns to reform their zoning laws, among other measures. The Democratic legislature made the bill a priority and worked with Lamont’s staff to negotiate the details.
Lamont said he wanted to see a law that towns would support. Housing advocates and lawmakers have said that’s difficult, and many towns are simply unwilling to add affordable units without a push from the state.
“Most of them [towns] have already come to the table,” Lamont said when he announced the veto. “Now we’re going to get a lot more specific. Show me what you want your town to look like. Show me where you want the diversity of housing.”
Rob Blanchard, director of communications for the governor’s office, said although the state has made “great strides” to address the housing shortage, post-pandemic building costs have impacted supply.
“Connecticut is also reported to have some of the most constrained housing supply in the nation, which has exacerbated our shortage,” Blanchard said. “Although the state has been working to break ground and fund new development, including 7,000 affordable housing units currently under construction, the governor believes that we can also move forward through greater engagement and collaboration between builders and local community leadership.”
Lamont also focused on the need for increased affordable housing in his 2023 State of the State address, vowing to not let the state fall into a housing crisis.
“But the biggest slam to our affordability and economic growth is housing, or the lack thereof,” Lamont said at the time. 
“Connecticut towns and cities, you tell us where developers can build more housing so more housing can be built faster, at less cost, and local control will determine how and where it is built,” Lamont continued.
But between 2023 and 2024, five of the nine COG regions saw decreases in housing growth. Only one region, Greater Bridgeport, saw increases in housing starts above 1% compared to 2023, and according to the 2026 to 2027 economic report of the governor, this slowing is expected to continue.
The report predicts that housing starts, or the number of residential housing projects under construction, are projected to continue to decline by 2.9% in FY 2026 and 1.9% in FY 2027. They are predicted to increase slightly in FY 2028.
The net growth in the number of housing units statewide from 2023 to 2024 dipped by 1,442. This comes after steady increases from 2021 to 2023. 
Lamont’s administration has made large investments in housing, including promising almost $1 billion toward housing in the last bonding package. But a report from CT Insider showed that in 2024, the state hit a 13-year low in the number of state-assisted units built.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-14-at-4.19.43-PM-1-1024x597.png,,,2025-08-15 13:57:41.414569

The Alabama Department of Corrections has halted preparations for his scheduled execution pending the results of a pscyhological exam. (Alabama Department of Corrections)The Alabama Department of Corrections said Friday it will not challenge a stay of execution while a death row inmate’s mental competence is evaluated.
Marion County Circuit Judge Lee Carter stayed the scheduled Aug. 21 execution of David Lee Roberts, 59, last month after his attorneys said Roberts may not understand the reasons he is being executed.
“The Alabama Department of Mental Health is currently in the process of conducting that evaluation and preparing a written report for submission to the court; however, it will not be completed by August 21,” the Alabama Department of Corrections said in a statement on Friday. “The Department of Corrections understands that the state will not challenge the stay of execution until after the Marion County Circuit Court receives the written report of the competency evaluation.”
The statement said DOC has stopped preparing for the execution and will not resume unless the stay is lifted and they receive necessary approvals.
Roberts’ attorneys wrote in an appeal that Roberts, convicted and sentenced to death for his role in the 1992 murder of Annetra Jones, has schizophrenia. Roberts’ attorneys said a psychologist working with Corrections diagnosed Roberts as hearing voices in February.
A psychologist from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill confirmed the diagnosis and said that Roberts did not understand why people continued to discuss his capital murder conviction.
His attorneys also stated he was diagnosed with delusional disorder in 2002 and was placed in a safe cell in 2009 after writing a letter that the warden believed was a threat to commit suicide.
According to court documents, Annetra Jones was sleeping at her boyfriend’s den where Roberts was also staying. Roberts left work one day and went home, packed his belongings and stole money before he shot Jones three times in the head with a rifle and set the place on fire.
The jury, by a vote of 7-5, recommended he be sentenced to life without the possibility of parole, but the judge overruled the recommendation and sentenced him to death.
The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals remanded the case back to the trial court after Roberts appealed the decision. In the second penalty phase, the jury again recommended life without parole and the judge overruled the recommendation for the second time.
The appeals court then affirmed the decision of the trial court during the second appeal.

The Iowa Board of Pharmacy has charged a Clinton Walgreens store and a Dubuque Walgreen store with failing to maintain accountability of controlled substances and records; failing to ensure accountability of Schedule III, IV and V controlled substances; failing to create and maintain complete and accurate records; and committing acts that render the store’s Controlled Substances Act registration to be inconsistent with the public interest.
The board has not disclosed the addresses of either store, but federal records indicate they are located at 1905 N. 2nd St. in Clinton and 55 John F. Kennedy Road in Dubuque.

The board has not disclosed the alleged conduct that led to the filing of any of the charges. Hearings in the two cases are scheduled for Aug. 20, 2025.
The charges against the two stores were imposed on May 8, 2025, but were only recently made public through a posting on a state website.
In July, three Iowa Walgreens stores were fined by the Board of Pharmacy for medication-dispensing errors, two of which date back to early 2023. The three stores are located at 4600 86th St. in Urbandale, 5 E. Anson St. in Marshalltown, and 625 Pacha Parkway in North Liberty.
In May, the board charged the Walgreens store at 3910 University Ave. in Waterloo with failing to maintain ultimate accountability of controlled substances and records; failing to ensure accountability of controlled substances; failing to create and maintain complete and accurate records as required by law; and committing acts that would render the store’s Controlled Substances Act registration inconsistent with the public interest.
The board has not publicly disclosed the alleged conduct that gave rise to the charges in that case or indicated when the conduct occurred. A board hearing in that case is scheduled for Sept. 24, 2025.
In early 2024, eight Iowa Walgreens stores, all previously sanctioned by the state, were charged with violating pharmacy-recordkeeping regulations related to controlled substances.
The stores involved in that case are located at 15601 Hickman Road in Clive; 901 N. Ankeny Boulevard in Ankeny; 3140 S.E. 14th St. in Des Moines; 2545 E. Euclid Ave. in Des Moines; 111 W.

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The University of Iowa is shutting down two summer writing programs, citing continued difficulties with funding.
The UI College of Liberal Arts and Sciences posted messages online to those involved in the Iowa Youth Writing Project and Iowa Summer Writing Festival this week stating both initiatives will end on Dec. 31, 2025, not because of any issues with staff or participants, but due to “the realities of the resources required” to keep them running.
UI Public Relations Manager Steve Schmadeke said in an email both canceled programs were supposed to be sustained financially by enrollment but ended up with average costs exceeding revenue by $115,000 on average annually over the past five years. The Magid Center for Writing, which receives its funding through its programming, private gifts and the liberal arts college, has been providing support for the writing projects to keep them going.
“Both the Iowa Summer Writing Festival (ISWF) and the Iowa Youth Writing Project (IYWP) are well-regarded outreach programs that have enriched the Iowa writing community in unique ways; but after careful assessment, CLAS has determined they cannot be sustained financially,” Schmadeke said in the email. “The university’s primary focus is supporting writing education at the undergraduate and graduate levels.”

Schmadeke said in his email five positions are being eliminated as a result of the program closures, and the five employees filling them are being laid off. There are currently no plans to continue with the youth writing project and festival in a limited format or in any other way, he said.
The Iowa Youth Writing Project has been in operation since 2010, according to the message posted online, and has hosted writing workshops for young people across Iowa. The Iowa Summer Writing Festival was launched in 1987, welcoming adult writers from all over the U.S. to Iowa City for workshops and more.
“We are forever grateful to all those writers who have participated in the festival over the decades, with many of you coming back year after year,” the message to the writing festival community stated. “You made this festival what it was and brought creativity and energy to Iowa City each summer.”
This has been a year of changes for UI programming relating to the written word, with the university’s international writing program seeing federal funding cuts that led to reductions in programming and the number of residencies it could support.
A new office of writing and communication is also being established at the UI, announced in July, that will serve as a hub for collaboration and resources for writing groups across campus. Magid Center for Writing Director Daniel Khalastchi was announced this week in a news release as the new office’s executive director, and will spend his first year in the role establishing the office’s structure and goals and making connections in other units.
“Writing and communication are essential in every discipline, and Iowa has long been a place where these skills are nurtured, celebrated, and elevated,” Khalastchi said in the release. “I’m honored to serve in this new role and excited to help expand the partnerships and opportunities that make this such a powerful environment for students.”

Abbott’s higher education experience includes overseeing graduate recruitment for the University of Arkansas’ College of Education and Health Professions, directing graduate and online enrollment at John Brown University and serving as director of admissions at Williams Baptist University, according to the release. 
Abbott, whose term will expire on June 30, 2032, said he’s “honored and humbled” by the appointment. 
“It’s a privilege to be part of education policy and oversight at such an important time for our state and our country,” Abbott said. “The changes underway are putting parents at the center, raising literacy rates, and building stronger pathways from the classroom to careers or college. I’m especially excited to get involved at a time when more education oversight is being returned to the states by the federal government.”

The Thursday ruling marks a blow to President Donald Trump’s administration as it continues to take significant strides to try to crack down on DEI efforts across the federal government.
U.S. District Judge Stephanie A. Gallagher found both an agency Dear Colleague letter threatening to yank federal funds for schools from K-12 through colleges and universities that use race-conscious practices in aspects of student life and a memo ordering state education leaders to certify compliance to be “unlawful,” vacating the two.
Gallagher’s ruling follows a lawsuit from the American Federation of Teachers union and its affiliate, AFT-Maryland, as well as the American Sociological Association and a public school district in Oregon.
She noted that both the letter and certification requirement are “unconstitutionally vague.”
Gallagher is one of three federal judges who blocked different parts of the agency’s initiatives back in April, which brought enforcement of the letter and the memo on certifying compliance to a halt.
“The administration is entitled to express its viewpoints and to promulgate policies aligned with those viewpoints,” wrote Gallagher, who was appointed by Trump. “But it must do so within the procedural bounds Congress has outlined. And it may not do so at the expense of constitutional rights.”
Feb. 14 letter to states
The department drew swift legal action after sending a Feb. 14 letter to school districts that threatened to rescind federal funds for schools that use race-conscious practices in programming, admissions, scholarships and other aspects of student life.
The letter gave a sweeping interpretation of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 2023, which struck down the use of affirmative action in college admissions.
The four-page letter raised a myriad of questions for schools over what exactly fell within the requirements. The department in March issued a Frequently Asked Questions document on the letter in an attempt to provide more guidance.
Adding fuel to the fire, the department in April gave state education leaders just days to certify all K-12 schools in their states were complying with the letter in order to keep receiving federal financial assistance.
Reaction from department, union
“While the Department is disappointed in the judge’s ruling, judicial action enjoining or setting aside this guidance has not stopped our ability to enforce Title VI protections for students at an unprecedented level,” a spokesperson for the department said in a statement shared with States Newsroom on Friday.
“The Department remains committed to its responsibility to uphold students’ anti-discrimination protections under the law,” the spokesperson added.
Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, said “the court agreed that this vague and clearly unconstitutional requirement is a grave attack on students, our profession, honest history, and knowledge itself,” in a Thursday statement.
Weingarten added that “it would hamper efforts to extend access to education, and dash the promise of equal opportunity for all, a central tenet of the United States since its founding.”

“This decision was made after careful evaluation of budget considerations and operational needs, and to streamline processes and reduce redundancy to improve efficiency,” ADH spokeswoman Meg Mirivel said in an email.
The remaining 24 laid-off employees are in the following departments:

13 in the Hometown Health Support Services program;
Eight in public health emergency preparedness;
Three in the Office of Performance Management, Quality Improvement and Evaluation.

ADH “is restructuring and streamlining” the Office of Performance Management, Quality Improvement and Evaluation into a new Office of Evaluation Services “to better align resources with agency priorities,” Mirivel said.
Even though the Health Department is shuttering the Office of Health Disparities Elimination, the agency “remains committed to addressing populations that bear a disproportionate burden of disease and adverse health outcomes through its ongoing programs and through the continued work of the Arkansas Minority Health Commission,” Mirivel said.
Laid-off employees were informed of the decision Aug. 5 and will receive special consideration if they apply for other state government jobs for up to 12 months after Nov. 1.
Mirivel did not respond when asked if the restructuring and layoffs are related to the state employee pay plan overhaul that went into effect July 1.

(Greg Kramos/USFWS)TOPEKA — The lesser prairie chicken, a dancing grouse that has long teetered between threatened and endangered classifications, lost its federal protections in court in a victory for Great Plains petroleum and cattle industries.
In a Tuesday decision from a Texas federal court, the lesser prairie chicken was stripped of any endangered or threatened species protections, which were established through a Biden-era ruling.
The Trump administration challenged that ruling, arguing it contained mistakes, and the lesser prairie chicken would be adequately protected without endangered or threatened classifications.
U.S. District Judge David Counts agreed, denying a slate of motions in a 15-page omnibus order that reversed the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s 2022 classifications.
The lesser prairie chicken forages on what’s widely considered to be prime ranching and drilling land in the grasslands and brush of southwestern Kansas, southeastern Colorado, eastern New Mexico, western Oklahoma and the panhandle and south plains of Texas. The bird was first protected in 2014, a decision that was overturned a year later. 
In the 2022 classifications, the bird’s populations were divided into a southern range in New Mexico and the southwest Texas Panhandle, where it was listed as endangered, and a northern range in Kansas, Oklahoma and the northeast Texas Panhandle, where it was listed as threatened.
More than 70% of the estimated lesser prairie chicken population resides in Kansas.
Fish and Wildlife Service admitted in the case that it erred in creating two distinct populations of lesser prairie chickens, and it failed to justify the classification of the two distinct population segments — northern and southern, Counts said.
He added that “the later endangered and threatened findings have no leg to stand on.”
“Fish and Wildlife is unable to correct this square one error without engaging in an entirely new analysis,” he said.
Counts reasoned that any “disruptive consequences” of removing protections “are short-lived and minimized by the sixteen existing voluntary conservation programs and efforts in place across the range of the lesser prairie-chicken.”
Many of those programs, which are administered by federal, state and private groups, existed before the 2022 listing decision and were designed to mitigate threats to the lesser prairie chicken and its habitat, Counts said.
“These efforts are not thought to be inadequate over the short term,” he said. “Rather, even the current listing decision couched their inadequacies in the long term — a span of 25 years.”
The decision is a win for Kansas agricultural and energy producers, said U.S. Rep. Tracey Mann. He added it is “a huge loss for radical climate activists and bureaucrats who have abused the Endangered Species Act for over a decade to hurt American agriculture and energy production.”
“Kansas farmers, ranchers and agricultural producers have always been and always will be the original conservationists of the land,” he said.
Mann was behind a bill this year that delisted the lesser prairie chicken and prevented any future efforts to relist it. However, the legislation did not progress.
Texas agencies initially sued the Fish and Wildlife Service in March 2023. Among them was the state’s railroad commission, which regulates oil and natural gas production in the state. Attorneys general in Kansas and Oklahoma and the petroleum and cattle industries later joined the suit.
Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach and Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond celebrated the decision.
“The listing of the species as threatened or endangered would have crippled oil and wind energy production and would have limited where and when Kansas ranchers could graze cattle on their own property,” Kobach said in a Friday news release.
Drummond said in a Wednesday news release that he had called the Biden administration’s ruling “outrageous and illegal federal overreach.”
“This court decision affirms we were right,” Drummond said. “Oklahoma’s cattle grazing, energy production and rural economy are no longer under siege by this unlawful regulation.”
In Kobach’s initial argument in federal court, he worried Kansas would lose revenues from cattle ranching, farming, oil and gas production, wind energy production and tourism if the lesser prairie chicken’s threatened status stood. He worried the status would lead to job losses in the state, which would “further adversely impact state tax revenues, in addition to causing social instability among Kansans who lose their jobs.”
Under the Endangered Species Act, the habitat and species protections that accompany a threatened or endangered status determination curtail certain land uses such as cattle ranching, oil drilling and energy production in protected habitats.
Jason Rylander, legal director of the Center for Biological Diversity’s Climate Law Institute, which was an intervenor in the case, said the Trump administration’s rationale for removing the lesser prairie chicken’s protections was in bad faith.
“This ruling has nothing to do with science or the law and everything to do with kowtowing to the oil and gas industry,” he said. “We won’t be silent witnesses while the Trump administration and fossil fuel companies try to carve up what’s left of these dancing birds’ habitat and doom them to extinction.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/7482442008_21d0a8afe8_h-1024x693.jpg,,,2025-08-15 13:57:41.414569

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Early migrants to the territory that is now Utah were harried out of every state they settled in during the first half of the 19th century, including New York, Ohio, Illinois, and Missouri. The long-running narrative has always been that these places denied folks religious freedom, but the westward-migrating pilgrims gave locals plenty of reason for objecting to their social and religious practices, including the practice of polygamy in highly monogamous American society and their insistence that Christianity in America had gone entirely apostate.
The “Days of ’47” pioneers sought shelter in the last remaining un-surveyed piece of land left in continental North America. Here, Utahns established a culture of Sabbath day church attendance, early marriage, copious childbearing, and an obedient workforce placing absolute trust in unregulated capitalism. The state more recently has championed a focus on winter Olympics, luxury temple construction and luxury housing, college and professional sports fandom rather than citizen participation in democratic government, a great economy, a solvent state government, and unregulated use of water resources.
Utah’s regularly expressed need to be the best or near best at everything springs inevitably out of the claim to have the best religion and the closest communication with God of all the Christian churches. How can one’s leaders speak regularly to God and not have a leg-up on everybody else in everything from soup to nuts on God’s green earth?
However, more recently leaders and average citizens of the state have manifestly contributed mightily to a 25-year drought of the sort that Old Testament prophets would have unhesitatingly called a punishment from God for ignoring water resource management for so long . . . in a desert no less! Gov. Spencer Cox recently raised eyebrows when he said nobody should be looking down on any neighbor who lets their lawn go yellow today.
Last year, the governor’s approach was to “pray for rain,” and the heavens actually produced some. This year, after a precipitous relapse back to the parsimonious productivity of previous years’ summer monsoons, the governor seems to be getting more desperate, and perhaps a bit more realistic.
One of the most obvious restraints holding Utah back from greater achievement in public policy is political philosophy. Utah’s guiding civic philosophy from “day one” in 1847 is the idea that spiritual people do not need to be forced by government to do anything. One of the state’s most oft-repeated sayings is, “Teach them correct principles, and they govern themselves.” In other words, Utah embraces a radical libertarianism that says if we make sure everybody gets proper instruction, government will have little need to regulate anyone’s public behavior.
Folks, this philosophy hasn’t worked in water resources management. This summer I followed the governor’s reasonable suggestion to let my lawn go yellow, and now in late summer there is still a great sea of green on all sides of me throughout the suburban Salt Lake City community I live in.
Many religious people misunderstand Jesus’ admonition to not judge others. Christians must leave the judging to God and not to fallible human beings, or so the thought goes. This is in part the approach taken by the state’s new water distribution plan for Great Salt Lake mineral extraction companies. The state plans in 2026 to make “voluntary agreements” to conserve water with these companies who account for over 7% of the lake’s human depletion of water resources. Those who do not enter into such agreements may suffer diminishment or loss of water rights when lake levels are low. This is a competent program that is about 20 years overdue.
However, a “hands-off” philosophy still bedevils at-home water consumption in my neighborhood. The water company regularly sends me a comparison of my water use with that of the average of my neighbors. The idea here seems to be that I will be gently shamed into changing my ways if I am using more than average. However, there is no penalty if I don’t.
Utahns, as much as any group nationwide, also misunderstand the concept of states’ rights and local home rule. States and localities are given the police power by our Constitution to decide things like penalties for exorbitant use of water precisely because it is best for locals to make these decisions rather than have the federal government step in to regulate things with one-size-fits-all policies.
One recent Utah article asks, “What if the mega drought lasts another 25 years?” as some professionals are predicting. Preventing the consequences of such an occurrence should not be a matter of mere luck, but aggressive public policy. Folks need to pay a price for not conserving water.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/0805_Great-Salt-Lake_01-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-15 13:57:41.414569

The letter comes just over a week after the U.S. Department of Justice named Connecticut on a published list of 12 states and other jurisdictions with “policies, laws, or regulations that impede enforcement of federal immigration laws.” 
Connecticut Attorney General’s office disputes the characterization. 
Bondi’s letter, dated Aug. 13 and addressed to Gov. Ned Lamont, states, “You are hereby notified that your jurisdiction has been identified as one that engages in sanctuary policies and practices that thwart federal immigration enforcement to the detriment of the interests of the United States. This ends now.” 
The letter asked for a response “that confirms your commitment to complying with federal law and identifies the immediate initiatives you are taking to eliminate laws, policies, and practices that impede federal immigration enforcement.”
Connecticut Attorney General William Tong confirmed receipt of the letter, and said in a statement that the accusations were false. “There is nothing in our laws or statutes that says Connecticut is a ‘sanctuary’ state. We are not. Trump’s own administration certified Connecticut’s compliance with 8 U.S.C. § 1373 in 2017.”
Tong said nothing has chanced since that certification, “and we will explain that in our response. Any claim or suggestion that Connecticut has violated or is not in compliance with federal law is false. Connecticut is prepared to pursue all legal rights and remedies to defend our sovereignty and the people and families of Connecticut from federal overreach.”
Connecticut’s Trust Act limits cooperation with federal authorities in identifying and detaining undocumented immigrants. Originally passed in 2013, and revised in 2019 and this year, the act limits the circumstances in which police and others can alert federal agents to the location of an undocumented immigrant or detain them for deportation, with exceptions for individuals facing serious criminal charges.
The original Trust Act was passed unanimously during the administration of Barack Obama, but the two revisions during Trump’s first and second terms came on largely party-line votes in a General Assembly dominated by Democrats.
State officials say the law is consistent with the anti-commandeering clause of the Constitution, which bars the federal government from forcing local and state authorities to act as agents of the federal government.
Democrats say the intent of all three laws was to ensure undocumented immigrants will feel safe reporting a crime or seeking aid from police without fear of being turned over to ICE. Republicans say they are too restrictive.
The Justice Department earlier this month published a list of the nine characteristics of sanctuary jurisdictions. Six Connecticut municipalities had also been named on such a list by the Trump Administration in May, but were left off of the August list.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AP25223573837051-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-15 13:57:41.414569

Mandates from President Donald Trump’s administration to retain aging coal plants could cause a massive spike in energy costs, according to an independent analysis commissioned by several environmental groups.
Orders from the U.S. Department of Energy to save coal plants from retirement could cost ratepayers more than $3 billion per year, according to a report from Grid Strategies, a power sector consulting firm. It was carried out on behalf of Earthjustice, Environmental Defense Fund, Natural Resources Defense Council and Sierra Club.
Under Trump, the agency has issued emergency orders to maintain operations at coal plants that were scheduled for retirement. While federal officials say the coal plants need to stay online to avoid blackouts, power plant owners and state regulators planned their closures because they were no longer economically viable or needed for reliability.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“DOE mandates override those well-informed decisions, inflating electric bills for homeowners and businesses and undermining the competitiveness of U.S. factories and data centers,” the Grid Strategies analysis found.
Across the country, coal plants have phased out as they’ve struggled to compete with cheaper renewables and natural gas. A 2023 analysis by Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan think tank, found that 99% of existing U.S. coal plants “are more expensive to run than replacement by local wind, solar, and energy storage resources.”
But Trump, who has pushed to unleash more fossil fuel development and to stymie wind and solar, has ordered a retiring coal plant in Michigan to stay online, along with an oil and gas plant in Pennsylvania.
“Based on the trend to date and indications that DOE has approached the owners of many retiring fossil power plants about potentially mandating their retention, DOE may attempt to mandate the retention of nearly all large fossil power plants slated for retirement between now and the end of 2028,” reads the Grid Strategies report.

The cost of keeping those plants online would be immense. By 2028, if Trump were to mandate the retention of all fossil fuel plants slated for retirement, the annual cost to ratepayers would be more than $3.1 billion, the analysis found.
The report also considers a number of aging plants that are not yet scheduled for retirement. It finds Trump’s actions could create a “perverse incentive,” causing plant owners to claim they’re planning to shut down, inducing the feds to step in and keep them open, with the cost borne by ratepayers.
Accounting for that possibility, the report found that ratepayer costs could reach $5.9 billion per year to keep the entire aging fossil fuel fleet online. California, Texas and Colorado would see the highest increases in electricity bills.

(Photo credit: Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)North Dakota utility regulators have recruited support from their counterparts in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Montana to oppose electric grid upgrades from the transmission operator that delivers power to their states and across the nation’s midsection.
Partisan points have worked their way into the debate, with some Republican public service commissioners voicing their distaste for grid plans that involve renewable energy.
On July 30, the North Dakota Public Service Commission filed a complaint with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regarding the issue of who benefits more when major power line projects are built and whether the calculations to determine those benefits are fair.
An organization called the Midcontinent Independent System Operator manages a regional electric grid that services 15 states and parts of Manitoba, Canada. In December, MISO revealed 24 transmission upgrade projects with an estimated combined cost of $22 billion. The projects are part of an annual plan MISO develops every year to identify maintenance and upgrades for its infrastructure. All of the projects are in the MISO-North subregion, and the costs will be allocated to those states.
North Dakota regulators argue the benefit calculations used for the projects are “unjust and unreasonable” for customers in the state, according to a news release they issued on Aug. 7. They have garnered support for their stance from other MISO network members, even though the southern states won’t have to pay for any of the projects.
While it’s not uncommon for state regulators to bring objections to MISO’s governing board, it is rare for states to join forces for a federal complaint on an issue that doesn’t apply to all members, Louisiana Public Service Commissioner Davante Lewis, a Democrat, said.
Although the complaint is already technically filed, Louisiana still has to ratify it, and partisan lines have already been drawn. Republicans hold a 3-2 advantage on the state Public Service Commission, which meets next on Aug. 20.
Lewis said he plans to vote against ratification and rejects the premise of arguments Republican commissioners are making.
“This has nothing to do with Louisiana paying for things up in the north,” Lewis said.
The federal complaint relies on a hypothetical situation that the cost-benefit allocations used in MISO-North might some day come down to MISO-South, Lewis said.
Commissioner Jean-Paul Coussan, a Republican, said he believes it’s a real concern.
“We are not allocated the costs of the transmission projects now, but the precedent and the possibility of a future cost re-allocation that could impact us were factors that prompted us, Mississippi and Arkansas to join in,” Coussan said, adding that he’s closely considering the idea of Louisiana leaving MISO altogether.
Commissioner Mike Francis, also a Republican, said there’s “a lot of windmill projects” up north that only benefit the local area up there.
Although the complaint is an argument against transmission costs, it specifically mentions that some of the proposed power lines would hook up to renewable energy generation.

Lewis said North Dakota and Montana regulators are underscoring the presence of wind turbines in MISO-North in an attempt to turn their complaint into a partisan issue that can drum up support from other states.
“That’s exactly what they are doing,” Lewis said.
During its meeting Thursday, North Dakota Public Service Commissioner Jill Kringstad, a Republican, said the slate of 24 MISO projects would help some states achieve renewable energy goals but pass some of the cost on to North Dakota ratepayers.
She called the costs “unjust and unreasonable” for North Dakota.
Kringstad and her colleagues estimated North Dakota’s share of the projects at $5 per month for an average customer, which the customer would pay for decades.
Commission Chair Randy Christmann, also a Republican, said there could be additional costs for increased power generation on top of the transmission projects.
They said MISO has changed the way it evaluates the cost-benefit of transmission projects to the detriment of North Dakota.
MISO spokesman Brandon Morris confirmed the cost allocation for the plan is on a subregional basis across the North and Central regions and does not include MISO South.
“MISO is reviewing the filing submitted to FERC,” Morris said. “The [proposed] portfolio was developed through a collaborative process that included substantial stakeholder engagement, including more than 300 meetings and feedback on the solutions and benefits. The portfolio supports reliability and the future needs of the system.”

Series: Rx Roulette:The FDA’s Dangerous Gamble on America’s Drugs


 More in this series









For more than a dozen years, the Food and Drug Administration quietly allowed substandard foreign factories to continue shipping medications to the United States even after the agency officially banned them from doing so because of dangerous manufacturing failures.
ProPublica exposed the little-known practice in June. The FDA said the decisions to exempt certain medications from import bans were made to fend off drug shortages and that guardrails were in place to ensure the products were safe, such as requiring the banned factories to do extra testing on the drugs before they were sent to Americans.
But the agency itself didn’t regularly test the drugs or proactively monitor reports filed by doctors and others that described drugs with a foul odor, abnormal taste or residue, or consumers who had experienced sudden or unexplained health problems. The FDA cautions the outcomes described in the complaints may have no connection to the drugs or could be unexpected side effects. But drug safety experts say that without further study, it’s impossible to know whether people were harmed or how many.
The FDA kept the exemptions largely hidden from the public and has never released a comprehensive list of the drugs allowed into the United States from banned factories. ProPublica is publishing that list today.
The list provides the names of the drugs or ingredients that ProPublica has identified as having been exempted from an import ban since 2013 and the names of the manufacturers that made them. The product names are written as they appeared on the FDA’s import alert list. Most of the factories on this list are no longer banned, so their drugs are coming into the country through normal channels. The FDA lifts bans after facilities make all the necessary fixes.
Some of the factories are still banned — and are still allowed to send exempted drugs to the U.S. Those are highlighted in yellow.
All told, ProPublica identified more than 150 exempted products, mostly from factories in India. One factory in China and one factory in Hungary also received exemptions. Several of the factories make ingredients for drugs, which are then sent to the manufacturers that produce pills, capsules, tablets or injectables.
To compile the list of exempted drugs and ingredients, reporters pulled historical records from the internet and used Redica Systems, a quality and regulatory intelligence company with a vast collection of agency documents.
In finalizing its analysis, ProPublica counted all the drugs and ingredients that were exempted from each banned factory. Sometimes, the same product was exempted from multiple factories and was added to each factory’s total. In a handful of cases, the FDA exempted several formulations — such as a tablet, capsule or injectable — of the same drug. ProPublica counted those different forms as distinct drugs.
For this list, ProPublica only included each drug once for each manufacturer.
Generic drugs can have many manufacturers, and it can be difficult to know based on information provided on medicine bottles where drugs were made or by whom. Sometimes bottles list the names of repackagers or distributors rather than the drugmaker itself. Pharmacists and possibly health care providers can provide additional information about the source of prescribed medications.
This list is current as of Aug. 4. The FDA can add or remove exempted drugs at any time.
 Company Responses

ProPublica reached out to all the drugmakers listed here. Most did not respond.
Apotex did not respond to requests for comment. After the inspections that led to the import bans, the company told the FDA that it would launch corrective actions and bring on a third-party consultant, among other things. The factories are no longer banned.
Divi’s Laboratories did not respond to requests for comment. In its response to the FDA at the time, the company said it hired third-party consultants and other experts to resolve the FDA’s concerns. The company also said it had taken corrective actions at the facility. The factory is no longer banned.
Emcure Pharmaceuticals did not respond to requests for comment. In its response to the FDA at the time, the company said it would revise procedures, provide training and engage consultants, among other things. The factory is still banned but no longer has exemptions.
Glenmark Pharmaceuticals did not respond to requests for comment. At the time of the ban, the company said it would engage with the FDA to resolve the concerns. The factory is still banned but is no longer receiving any exemptions.
GPT Pharmaceuticals did not respond to requests for comment. In its response to the FDA, the company defended the quality of its products and said it had brought on a consultant to audit the operation. The factory is no longer banned.
In a statement to ProPublica, Pfizer, which owns Hospira, said it submitted a comprehensive response to the FDA, paused production at the site and then sold the facility to another company in 2019. “We are committed to operating our manufacturing sites at the highest quality standards,” Pfizer said. The factory is no longer banned.
Intas Pharmaceuticals, whose U.S. subsidiary is Accord Healthcare, said in a statement that the company has invested millions of dollars in upgrades and new hires and launched a companywide program focused on quality. Exempted drugs were sent to the United States in a “phased manner,” the company said, with third-party oversight and safety testing. Intas also said that some exempted drugs were never shipped to the United States because the FDA found other suppliers. The company would not provide details. “Intas is well on its way towards full remediation of all manufacturing sites,” the company said. The two Intas factories are still banned and still receiving exemptions.
Ipca Laboratories did not respond to requests for comment. At the time, Ipca said it was working to resolve the issues at several factories. “The company is committed to its philosophy of highest quality in manufacturing, operations, systems, integrity and cGMP culture,” Ipca said, referring to “current good manufacturing practices,” a common phrase in the industry. The factories are no longer banned.
Jubilant Generics did not respond to requests for comment. At the time, the company said it would “engage with the agency to resolve the import alert at the earliest and ensure cGMP compliance.” The factory is no longer banned.
Shilpa Medicare did not respond to requests for comment. In a media statement at the time, the company said it planned to resolve the FDA’s concerns. “We uphold quality and compliance with utmost importance and are committed to maintaining cGMP and quality standards across all Shilpa facilities.” The factory is still banned and one of its medications is still exempt.
Sri Krishna Pharmaceuticals did not respond to requests for comment. The company at the time told the FDA that it was using a consultant to audit operations and assist in meeting manufacturing requirements. The factory is still banned but is no longer receiving exemptions.
In a statement to ProPublica, Sun Pharma said that adherence to quality standards “is a top priority for Sun, and we maintain a relentless focus on quality and compliance to ensure the uninterrupted supply of medicines to our customers and patients worldwide. We continue to work proactively with the US FDA and remain committed to achieve full resolution of any FDA regulatory issues at our facilities.” The factory is still banned and still receiving exemptions.
Teva Pharmaceuticals did not respond to requests for comment. The company said in a statement at the time that it was working to avoid drug shortages “while we focus on resolving regulatory concerns, as patients are always highest priority.” The factory is still banned but no longer receiving exemptions.
Wockhardt did not respond to requests for comment. In a conference call with reporters at the time of the import ban, according to Reuters, the Wockhardt chairman said the company was “making all kinds of effort to satisfy” FDA good manufacturing standards at the factory. The factories are still banned, but in July, Wockhardt announced that it would no longer make generics for the U.S. market.
Zhejiang Hisun Pharmaceutical did not respond to requests for comment. According to a report in Bloomberg, Hisun said at the time that it takes quality seriously and has complied with requirements. The factory is no longer banned.
Mylan/Viatris said in a statement to ProPublica that it immediately worked to resolve the FDA’s concerns. “Patient safety remains our primary and unwavering focus,” the company said. The factory is still banned and still receiving exemptions.
A lawyer for Madhu Instruments told ProPublica in an email that the company has fixed all the problems identified by the FDA and is cooperating fully. The factory is still banned but no longer has an exemption.
