Even among experts the cost of water supplies is hard to pin down. A new study reveals huge differences in what water suppliers for cities and farms pay for water from rivers and reservoirs in California, Arizona and Nevada. 


California cities pay far more for water on average than districts that supply farms — with some urban water agencies shelling out more than $2,500 per acre-foot of surface water, and some irrigation districts paying nothing, according to new research. 
A report published today by researchers with the UCLA Institute of the Environment and Sustainability and advocates with the Natural Resources Defense Council shines a light on vast disparities in the price of water across California, Arizona and Nevada. 
The true price of water is often hidden from consumers. A household bill may reflect suppliers’ costs to build conduits and pump water from reservoirs and rivers to farms and cities. A local district may obtain water from multiple sources at different costs. Even experts have trouble deciphering how much water suppliers pay for the water itself.
The research team spent a year scouring state and federal contracts, financial reports and agency records to assemble a dataset of water purchases, transfers and contracts to acquire water from rivers and reservoirs. They compared vastly different water suppliers with different needs and geographies, purchasing water from delivery systems built at different times and paid for under different contracts.
Their overarching conclusion: One of the West’s most valuable resources has no consistent valuation – and sometimes costs nothing at all.

“It costs money to move water around,” the report says, “but there is no cost, and no price signal, for the actual water.”
That’s a problem, the authors argue, as California and six other states in the Colorado River basin hash out how to distribute the river’s dwindling flows — pressed by federal ultimatums, and dire conditions in the river’s two major reservoirs. The study sounds the alarm that the price of water doesn’t reflect its growing scarcity and disincentivizes conservation.
“We’re dealing with a river system and water supply source that is in absolute crisis and is facing massive shortfalls … and yet we’re still treating this as if it’s an abundant, limitless resource that should be free,” said Noah Garrison, environmental science practicum director at UCLA and lead author on the study. 
Jeffrey Mount, senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California, applauded the research effort. Though he had not yet reviewed the report, he said complications abound, built into California’s water infrastructure itself and amplified by climate change. Moving, storing and treating water can drive up costs, and are only sometimes captured in the price. 
“We’ve got to be careful about pointing our fingers and saying farmers are getting a free ride,” Mount said. Still, he agreed that water is undervalued: “We do not pay the full costs of water — the full social, full economic and the full environmental costs of water.” 
Coastal cities pay the most
The research team investigated how much suppliers above a certain purchase threshold spend on water from rivers and reservoirs in California, Arizona and Nevada. 
They found that California water suppliers pay more than double on average than what Nevada districts pay for water, and seven times more than suppliers in Arizona. 
The highest costs span the coast between San Francisco and San Diego, which the researchers attributed to the cost of delivery to these regions and water transfers that drive up the price every time water changes hands. 
“In some of those cases it’s almost a geographic penalty for California, that there are larger conveyance or transport and infrastructure needs, depending on where the districts are located,” Garrison said. 
Agricultural water districts pay the least
In California, according to the authors, cities pay on average 20 times more than water suppliers for farms — about $722 per acre foot, compared to $36. 
One acre foot can supply roughly 11 Californians for a year, according to the state’s Department of Water Resources. 
Five major agricultural suppliers paid nothing to the federal government for nearly 4 million acre-feet of water, including three in California that receive Colorado River water: the Imperial Irrigation District, the Coachella Valley Water District and the Palo Verde Irrigation District. 
Tina Anderholt Shields, water manager for the Imperial Irrigation District, which receives the single largest share of Colorado River water, said the district’s contract with the U.S. government does not require any payment for the water. 
Cities, by contrast, received less than 40,000 acre-feet of water for $0. The report notes, however, that the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, a major urban water importer, spends only 25 cents an acre-foot for around 850,000 acre-feet of water from the Colorado River. 
Bill Hasencamp, manager of Colorado River resources at Metropolitan, said that the true cost of this water isn’t reflected in the 25-cent fee, because the expense comes from moving it. By the time the Colorado River water gets to the district, he said it costs several hundred dollars.
Plus, he added, the district pays for hydropower, which helps cover the costs of the dams storing the water supply. “That enables us to only pay 25 cents an acre foot to the feds on the water side, because we’re paying Hoover Dam costs on the power side.”
Federal supplies are the cheapest; transfers drive up costs
Much of the difference among water prices across three states comes down to source: those whose supplies come from federally managed rivers, reservoirs, aqueducts and pumps pay far less on average than those receiving water from state managed distribution systems or via water transfers. 
Garrison and his team proposed adding a $50 surcharge per acre-foot of cheap federal supplies to help shore up the infrastructure against leaks and losses or pay for large-scale conservation efforts without tapping into taxpayer dollars. 
But growers say that would devastate farming in California. 
“It’s important to note that the ‘value’ of water is priceless,” said Allison Febbo, General Manager of Westlands Water District, which supplies San Joaquin Valley farms. The report calculates that the district pays less than $40 per acre foot for water from the federal Central Valley Project, though the Westlands rate structure notes another $14 fee to a restoration fund. “The consequences of unaffordable water can be seen throughout our District: fallowed fields, unemployment, decline in food production…”
The Imperial Irrigation District’s Shields said that a surcharge would be inconsistent with their contract, difficult to implement, and unworkable for growers. 
“It’s not like farmers can just pass it on to their buyers and then have that roll down to the consumer level where it might be ‘manageable,’” Shields said.
The most expensive water in California is more than $2,800 an acre-foot
The most expensive water in California, Arizona or Nevada flows from the rivers of Northern California, down California’s state-managed system of aqueducts and pumps, to the San Gorgonio Pass Water Agency in Riverside County. Total cost, according to the report: $2,870.21 per acre foot. 
Lance Eckhart, the agency’s general manager, said he hadn’t spoken to the study’s authors but that the number sounded plausible. The price tag would make sense, he said, if it included contributing to the costs for building and maintaining the 705-mile long water delivery system, as well as for the electricity needed to pump water over mountains. 
Eckhart compared the water conveyance to a railroad, and his water agency to a distant, distant stop. “We’re at the end, so we have the most railroad track to pay for, and also the most energy costs to get it down here,” he said. 
Because it took decades for construction of the water delivery system to reach San Gorgonio Pass, the water agency built some of those costs into local property taxes before the water even arrived, rather than into the water bills for the cities and towns they supply. As a result, its mostly municipal customers pay only $399 per acre foot, Eckhart said. 
“You can’t build it into rates if you’re not going to see your first gallon for 40 years,” Ekhart said. 
The study didn’t interrogate how the wholesale price of imported water translates to residential bills. Water managers point out that cheap supplies like groundwater can help dilute the costs of pricey imported water. 
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, for instance, purchases water imported from the Colorado River and Northern California to fill gaps left by local groundwater stores, supplies from the Owens Valley, and other locally managed sources, said Marty Adams, the utility’s former general manager. (The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power was unable to provide an interview.)
Because the amount of water needed can vary from year to year, it’s added as an additional charge on top of the base rate, Adams said. “If you have to pay for purchased water somewhere, when you add all the numbers up, it comes out in that total,” he said. 
“The purchased water becomes the wildcard all the time.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/121025-Colorado-River-DM-Getty-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-11 03:56:22.838723

We hunt for a good place to hide the gifts we’ve acquired for our family and friends. We seek some semblance of holiday cheer amid the tumult of the day.
That’s why I’m happy to tell you that something that’s long been hidden has reappeared recently: the Lost Springs of the Ocklawaha.
No need to search for them. They’re right out in plain view — for a little while.
Most Floridians don’t even know they exist. Yet there are 20 or so, with names like “Cannon Spring,“ “Bright Angel Spring,” and “Tobacco Patch Spring.”
They’re not on any road maps. Unlike a lot of Florida’s springs, they’re not part of any state or national park. They might be considered part of a national forest.
You can’t see the lost springs unless the Florida Department of Environmental Protection conducts a procedure known as a “drawdown.” That’s when the lost springs re-emerge, and you can not only see them, but you can also visit and even swim in them.

There’s a drawdown going on right now, so charter captain Karen Chadwick took her boat out to renew her acquaintance with the lost springs. When she sees them flowing, she told me, “It’s the most beautiful place in the world.”

“It’s just incredible,” agreed her friend Margaret Ross Tolbert, a Gainesville artist whose paintings often feature Florida springs. “I’m always amazed at how they can bounce back.”
Just last week, Gov. Ron DeSantis was bragging at a Tampa press conference about Florida’s springs, but his words sounded hollow.
“We have the best springs of anywhere in the country,” he said.
If DeSantis really loved our springs the way he pretends to, he’d help the lost springs stay found. But so far, he hasn’t done it.
When the drawdown ends in March, those springs will get lost all over again. If that happens, it will be his fault.
What we’ve lost
In 1971, Elizabeth Abbott of the University of Florida’s Department of Geology wrote a report on these springs.
Here’s how the report described Blue Spring No. 1: “The spring was perfect for those wanting to get away from it all. It was privately owned for many years but always open for public use — swimming and fishing, as well as picnicking and camping.”
The spring’s natural beauty was exceeded only by its natural bounty, Abbott wrote.
“The most discriminating of seasoned fishermen marveled at the quality of fish [in] Blue Springs — not to mention the quantity,” she wrote. “Freshwater mullet and catfish swam like giant denizens convoyed by nervous bream, but the large bass was the most sought-after catch.”
Cannon Springs right now, via Margaret Tolbert
Further along, at Cannon Springs, she wrote, “The forest here is perhaps the most beautiful of all the river. It is a low hammock type with a mixture of palms and hardwoods. The cry of the limpkin is a noisy and interesting distraction.”
Orange Spring, she reported, is a sulfur spring, “with a walled-in circular pool about 75 feet across. The boil is about 18 feet deep. … The sulfur is said to be organic in origin.”
She credited the river’s many springs with swelling the flow of the river itself, as well as maintaining its water’s purity. It’s not mentioned in the report, but those springs were probably popular with manatees, which once used the Ocklawaha to migrate to the St. Johns River. I’m sure the early settlers and Native Americans who found the springs regarded them as pure magic.
Thus, to sum up, the springs were popular for recreation, provided habitat for a wide variety of wildlife, and helped maintain the river’s flow and purity.

“They were pretty well used by the local people in that area,” historian Steve Noll told me. “They were full of fish, too.”
No wonder that when they’re uncovered, people flock to the river to see them anew. Too bad they’re not available but for a few months every few years, due to one of the stupidest public works projects ever attempted.
Digging our grave
The Ocklawaha was once a river of dreams. But then came the Army Corps of Engineers to turn it into a nightmare.
The reason you can’t see these 20 or so springs year-round is because they’re inundated by the Rodman Reservoir. That 17,000-acre artificial body of water was created in 1968 when the Corps built the controversial Kirkpatrick Dam.
The dam is a 7,200-foot-long structure that impounded 16 miles of the 80-mile river, drowning a chunk of the Ocala National Forest.
It was built as part of the idiotic Cross-Florida Barge Canal. The canal was an 19th century idea built in the 20th, an attempt to slice a shortcut across the Florida peninsula for ships — even though, by then, most freight was being carried by trains and trucks.
Opponents could see what a disaster this canal would be. It wasn’t just that by damming the Ocklawaha, the corps would end a popular waterway connection between Silver Springs and the St. Johns River.
The excavation would also cut into the aquifer that supplies most of Florida’s fresh water, allowing salt water to intrude. The Corps was digging Florida’s grave.

The fight to stop it was funded by John Couse, a well-to-do air conditioning contractor who owned a home near Cannon Springs, said historian David Tegeder, who with Noll wrote “Ditch of Dreams: The Cross Florida Barge Canal and the Future of Florida.”
Crouse became involved after seeing the Army mowing down trees using a tank-like machine called the Crawler-Crusher, which did exactly what its name said. Seeing the damage done around the spring gave him a reason to fight.
The canal’s opponents won a temporary injunction. Their efforts got the attention of President Richard Nixon, who canceled construction of the canal.
Now the former canal route is a 110-mile linear greenway for hikers, bikers, and horseback riders named for the canal’s most vocal opponent, scientist-turned-activist Marjorie Harris Carr.
Unfortunately, every effort Carr and others after her have made to rip out the dam has been thwarted.

Dead Lakes and dammed river
Some people want to keep the reservoir intact. They fear what will happen to the fishing if the dam goes away. I point those folks to the story of the Dead Lakes dam in the Panhandle.
After a three-year drought kept the Dead Lakes too low for fishing, the Legislature approved putting a dam on the Chipola River. Built in 1960, the 18-foot-tall dam was supposed to boost fishing by maintaining high water levels.
When the dam was new, fish corralled in the reservoir became easier to catch. Over time, though, the reservoir clogged with silt and weeds. Soon the remaining fish were so small they were hardly worth catching.
In 1987, the state removed the dam, allowing the natural lake level to return. Fisheries biologists studied the Dead Lakes for years afterward and found they were now healthier. There were more and bigger fish. And there were twice as many kinds, too.

That’s why I think the anglers shouldn’t resist restoring the Ocklawaha. They should embrace it — assuming it ever happens.
The most recent effort to remove the Rodman dam happened last year. The Legislature voted to spend $500,000 for an updated study of ripping out the decrepit old dam and freeing the Ocklawaha. The last such study was nearly 30 years ago.
The new study was supposed to be done by the University of Florida Water Institute — not exactly a fly-by-night outfit. It was intended to provide legislators with up-to-date information so they could make an informed decision about the dam.
To everyone’s surprise, DeSantis vetoed the money. He became the first governor from either party since the ’70s to actively oppose restoration of the Ocklawaha. He offered no explanation, either
The springs and the cypress trees that were drowned by the reservoir stayed covered.
Until two months ago.
The drawdown
Every four or five years, the DEP has to draw down the reservoir, lowering its water level. They do this to clear out the aquatic plants that clog the system.
Nina Bhattacharyya via Florida Defenders
The current drawdown began in October, according to Nina Bhattacharyya, now executive director of Carr’s organization, Florida Defenders of the Environment.
“We are encouraging people to get out there and get a glimpse of what a restored river would look like,” Bhattacharyya told me.
The alteration in the waterway is dramatic. With the water lowered, you can see all the cypress stumps from the national forest. As for the springs, they’ve been jolted back to life.
“Any time one of these happens, people rush out to see the lost springs,” Bhattacharyya said.
One of the people who rushed out was Ryan Worthington, whose Instagram account is called “The Florida Excursionist” and who co-hosts a podcast called “The Florida Madcaps.”

“I went out to Cannon and to Tobacco Patch,” he said. “A lot of the others are small in size and back in the woods so they’re hard to get to. Cannon has the best flow and there are a lot of sunfish and other aquatic life in it.”
Tolbert has been out, too. She compared one of the uncovered springs to a volcano, suddenly producing eruptions of water gushing from beneath the earth.
The last time there was a drawdown, Tolbert was moved to film a 40-minute documentary called “Lost Springs: An Artist’s Journey Into Florida’s Abandoned Springs.” It was directed by Matt Keene, who’s also done a movie called “River Be Dammed.”
“You have to keep returning because they’re so unbelievable,” Tolbert says in the documentary. “Yet there they are, something that would only seem to exist in your dreams.”
Now let me tell you about something I dream about.
Finding the courage
In my dream, the drawdown never ends. The springs are never hidden. They remain out in the open, available for anyone who wants to swim in them or toss in a fishing line.
But what if it wasn’t a dream? The drawdown is scheduled to be over in March. But it doesn’t have to be. There’s no law that says the DEP has to return all that water to the reservoir.
What if DeSantis issued an executive order that told DEP, “Don’t put the reservoir back”? What if he decided to copy what happened with the Dead Lakes and restore the landscape?
Think about it. During his two terms, he’s repeatedly messed up this state’s natural resources. He built a polluting immigrant detention camp in the Big Cypress National Preserve. He tried to build golf courses in Jonathan Dickinson State Park. He’s refused to crack down on polluters and instead has spent millions in tax dollars to clean up their messes for them.
In fact, his DEP has repeatedly failed to comply with a state law requiring new rules for stopping the damage to our springs.
Last week, when he was talking about how wonderful our springs are, he was announcing plans to spend millions more on cleaning up pollution. What he didn’t mention is that his DEP will continue turning a blind eye to what the polluters are doing.
I tried repeatedly to get DeSantis’ spokesfolks to comment on the Rodman drawdown, or to explain why he vetoed the money for studying the aging dam. As usual, his staff wouldn’t even acknowledge my inquiries. 
This is a guy who always says the buck stops somewhere else. When a reporter asked him last week why he voted to give a shady campaign contributor $83 million for a 4-acre parcel in Destin that wasn’t on anyone’s preservation list, he repeatedly tried to shift the blame. In three minutes, he blamed someone else six times.
If DeSantis is searching for a way to redeem himself and leave a better legacy than the one he has now, this is it. Here’s hoping he’s able to find the courage to save the lost springs.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Save-the-Lost-Springs-banner-at-Blue-Spring-2025-by-Karen-Chadwick.jpeg,,,2025-12-11 00:56:11.558347

Joe Courtney,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/11/nursing-is-a-profession/,The U.S. Education Dept. exclusion of nursing as a professional occupation is a disgrace.,"As this headline from Newsweek magazine reports, a few weeks ago, the U.S. Department of Education issued probably the most out of touch, offensive new rule in the history of the Department, excluding nursing from its definition of professional occupations, part of its new graduate student loan program, which was created by the One Big Ugly Bill.
For the 4.7 million actively registered nurses and the 250,000 students enrolled in bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral nursing programs across the United States, this decree that they are not professionals is both a disgraceful insult that shocks the conscience and an order which will condemn America’s nurses into second class status for federal graduate student loan assistance.

U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney

This legal demotion is happening at a time when our country is experiencing a nursing shortage. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that we have 195,000 unfilled nursing positions in this country. The Department of Health and Human Services goes even higher. It says it’s 280,000. McKinsey and Company, a respected [consulting firm], predicts that by the end of this decade, the shortage will grow to 400,000.
But members of the House don’t really need to spend much time reading these reports to know that that shortage is real. Just go to any hospital, nursing home, or health clinic in your district, and you’ll hear the same thing, that they are short staffed in ERs, exam rooms, operating rooms, and on the floors. Short staffing is bad for patients and it’s bad for nurse nursing burnout.
Despite this blindingly obvious reality, the Education Department’s designation is putting a hard cap of $100,000 with no indexing on graduate student loans for nurses – all part of the One Big Beautiful Bill, which my Republican colleagues passed in June – a health care monstrosity which cut $1 trillion from Medicaid and cut off premium subsidies for 22 million Americans for their health care exchange plans, and now will suffocate the growth of our nation’s caring professions.
If you doubt my words, then maybe you’ll listen to the President of the American Nurses Association, the largest nursing professional organization in America. Jennifer Mensik Kennedy, the President states, “Nurses make up the largest segment of the health care workforce and are the backbone of our nation’s health system. At a time when health care in our country faces an historic nurse shortage and rising demands, limiting nurses’ access to funding for graduate school threatens the very foundation of patient care.”
Well said. But [the American Nurses Association] is doing more. They have organized a petition drive because this rule goes into effect next July. They, again, as of the middle of last week, had 180,000 signatures, and that will grow. It definitely will grow in the coming days.
And every member in this House, and I will be one of them, should write to the Department of Education saying that this rule makes no sense in terms of the health care system today, and also is an insult to the people who go through extensive training, testing, and certification before they are, again, allowed to practice their profession, the caring profession.
And while we’re at it, we should also help other professions which were excluded by the Department of Education – physician assistants, physical therapists, audiologists, speech language pathologist, architects, accountants, advanced degree educators, social workers, dental hygienists, and occupational therapists. This proposal by the Department of Education is madness, and Congress should actually do more than just support the regulatory process in terms of reversing these rules.
We should also go back and revisit the One Big Beautiful Bill and recognize what, again, our health care sector is telling us that we are risking the financial solvency of institutions all across America. And again, we are damaging our future in terms of getting young, motivated people to join the health care professions.

My older brother, my hero, was losing himself to addiction. 
Throughout his senior year, he began experimenting. What was at first recreational spiraled into full blown dependence by the time he graduated. Xanax, percocet, cocaine, hard drugs seized him by his mind and his body. From roughly the age of 17 or 18 until just two years ago, he was in and out of rehab, trying to reclaim his life. 
He has been clean for over two years now, and I am grateful and proud every day. But his fight is lifelong. Every single day, he fights.



I tell his story not just because I am incredibly proud of my brother, but because we must confront a truth: drugs are far too accessible to teenagers. It is time to take this urgent crisis seriously.
How easy is it, really?
You don’t have to meet some dealer down at the end of the alley anymore: for many teens, access is just a text away. Surveys show that older adolescents routinely report drugs are “fairly easy” or “very easy” to obtain. Among 12th graders, 65 % said some drugs were easily available. That perception speaks volumes. 
If a kid believes they can get something, they’re more likely to try.
In Connecticut, the numbers are alarming. Among youth aged 12–17, approximately 8.95 % report using illicit drugs in the past month. Among those users, more than 80 % report marijuana use. In the 18–25 age group, substance use jumps dramatically: 44.8 % report marijuana use in the past year, and over 20 percent meets criteria for a substance use disorder.
Cannabis remains the common drug used by young people in our state. In Connecticut’s youth population, 14.08 % had used cannabis in the past year; 7.46 % in the past month, both rates higher than the national average.
More alarmingly, harder drugs aren’t always far behind. In Connecticut, about 1.99 % of residents over 12 report past-year cocaine use, with the highest prevalence among young adults.
These numbers do not completely capture how easy it can be for teens to get their hands on pills, stimulants, or other addictive substances from people such as peers, social media marketplaces, or family prescriptions. The data reflects a system broken by convenience and, more importantly, normalization.
The stakes are real, and personal
When addiction takes hold, it doesn’t just wreck the addict’s life. It fractures families, depreciates safety, and steals futures. Watching my brother fall to addiction the way he did was like literally watching him become a different person. Angry, frail, lost. The drugs were like a parasite, feeding on his dreams, altering his personality, hollowing him out.
He eventually clawed his way back. His recovery wasn’t about heroism, it was brutal, arduous work. But every person trapped in addiction deserves at least a chance to climb out. That opportunity can’t purely rest on personal willpower; it must rest on a society that acknowledges the problem. It takes a village.
A call to Connecticut
This isn’t just a fight for the next generation of Connecticut, this is now. If we fail to act, we risk thousands more young people emptied out by substances, dreams deferred or destroyed, families torn apart in the name of silence.
Yes, drugs are more accessible than they should ever be. But the access we must fight is not just to pills or powders; it is a fight for access to intervention, treatment, resources, hope. We owe that access to every teenager in this state.
My brother’s journey is a testament both to the cruelty of addiction and to the possibility of redemption. He is no longer lost. But thousands of others may be if we don’t change course, and quickly.

In a nation that prides itself on equality, too many are still forced to suffer in the shadows. Contemporary LGBTQ+ survivors face barriers such as discrimination, a lack of culturally competent shelters, and limited access to mental health services.
Quantitative data from the Centers for Disease Control shows that 44% of lesbian women, 61% of bisexual women, 26% of gay men, and 37% of bisexual men experience intimate partner violence in their lifetime. These barriers contribute to increased rates of depression, anxiety, and trauma within the community. And for many, the absence of inclusive domestic violence shelters creates a direct pipeline into homelessness. Even law enforcement —often seen as the ultimate safety net— can pose risks to LGBTQ+ survivors who fear police bias, misgendering, or harassment.
Take Clara’s story: a young trans Latina who fled her abusive partner only to discover that most shelters wouldn’t accept her. She found temporary safety only after locating a rare LGBTQ-affirming program —yet the moment she left, her abuser tracked her down, and the violence resumed. 
Or consider Sheila, who after transitioning left a seven-year abusive relationship. When she sought a restraining order, the judge brushed her off, telling her she was “too big to be afraid of anyone.” That wasn’t just a failure of empathy. It was a systemic refusal to see LGBTQ+ abuse as real. These are not hypotheticals. These are people—living, hurting, and too often forgotten. (The names Clara and Sheila are pseudonyms used in the NCAVP report to protect survivors’ privacy.)
Now I know what you’re thinking: Why should this matter to me? Because when abusers know certain victims are less likely to be believed or protected, it emboldens violence everywhere —not just against LGBTQ+ people. Harm tolerated in one corner of the community spreads to all of us.
I say this not as an outsider, but as a survivor myself. As a masculine-presenting lesbian, I have been assaulted by a man who believed my identity made me a target. The fear, shame, and confusion I felt in that moment still follow me—yet even then, I hesitated to seek help, wondering whether anyone would take me seriously. My story is not rare. It is precisely why culturally competent protections matter.
And what if I told you there is a way to strengthen those protections  —yet it remains stalled in courtrooms and in Congress? The Equality Act, first introduced in 1974 and reintroduced multiple times since, has repeatedly passed the House but died in the Senate. This bill explicitly prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in employment, housing, public accommodations, and federally funded programs.
I can already hear the next question: If this bill is so important, why hasn’t it passed? Opponents argue it threatens religious freedom, undermines parental rights, or exposes women to harm. I’m not here to dismiss every concern outright. Some questions people raise come from fear, confusion, or a lack of information—not from hate.
Do we need real conversations about fairness in women’s sports? Yes. Do we need safeguards to prevent predatory men from weaponizing gender identity? Absolutely. These concerns deserve good-faith discussion, not political fear-mongering. But here’s the truth: the Equality Act doesn’t take away anyone’s right to worship, doesn’t redefine sports policy, and doesn’t erase common-sense safety protections. What it does is ensure that LGBTQ+ people cannot legally be denied housing, fired, refused service, or turned away from life-saving programs simply because of who they are.
You don’t have to understand every nuance of gender or sexuality to understand this: no one deserves to be homeless because a shelter won’t take them. No survivor should be turned away while begging a judge for safety. No teenager should be denied care or service because their identity makes someone uncomfortable. Equal rights aren’t a special privilege —they’re the bare minimum in a democracy.
And before you say, “This doesn’t affect me,” let me offer this: it could be your child one day. Or someone you love. You don’t build a safer country by protecting only the people who look like you, love like you, or believe like you. You build one by ensuring everyone has access to safety, dignity, and a fair shot at life.
The truth is simple: if equality isn’t for all of us, then it isn’t equality at all.

Jeff Landry administration's decision to abruptly cancel a massive contract providing health insurance to hundreds of thousands of Medicaid recipients.,"Legislators, advocates worry about the impact of canceling a major state Medicaid contract right before the Christmas holiday. (Photo illustration by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Several Louisiana senators and health care advocates are aghast at Gov. Jeff Landry administration’s decision to abruptly cancel a massive contract providing health insurance to hundreds of thousands of Medicaid recipients. 
“It’s unwarranted. It’s unnecessary and it fails the people we serve in that program,” Senate Democratic Caucus Chairman Gerald Boudreaux, D-Lafayette, said in an interview Tuesday. 

Legislators in both political parties said they were blindsided this week when they learned the Landry administration terminated a $4.2 billion agreement with UnitedHealthCare to provide Medicaid coverage in 2026. Lawmakers, hospitals and other health care providers said they weren’t given any notice of the governor’s decision in advance. 
UnitedHealthCare provides health insurance for 330,700 Louisiana residents and holds one of the largest contracts in state government. Without a deal in place, its participants will have to be moved into other Medicaid plans before Jan. 1. 

Lawmakers and advocates questioned whether such a big shift is feasible over a short period of time, especially with the holidays approaching. Many said disruptions in health care will be inevitable. 
“We are going to have problems. We are going to have people who fall through the cracks,” Senate Pro Tempore Regina Barrow, D-Baton Rouge, said in an interview Wednesday. “We are going to have people who are not going to get health care.” 
All Medicaid plans not the same, advocates say 
The remaining organizations that provide Medicaid coverage for the state are Aetna, AmeriHealth Caritas, Healthy Blue, Humana Healthy Horizons and Louisiana Healthcare Connections. 
The Louisiana Department of Health plans to use an algorithm to help pick a plan for each person who needs to switch from UnitedHealthCare, Health Secretary Bruce Greenstein said in an interview this week. 
It will prioritize keeping families together with the same health care company and making sure the doctors and other medical professionals a person sees most frequently take their new insurance.
“This will take place over the next two weeks, so it will take place over Christmas,” Greenstein said on Monday night. “I feel confident that we will be able to execute on this.”

If a Medicaid recipient is unhappy with their new health care coverage, they will have 90 days starting Jan. 1 to switch into another plan, Greenstein said.
Health care advocates and legislators said they aren’t convinced the transition will go so smoothly.
Attorney General Liz Murrill
UnitedHealthCare covers one quarter of the 1.4 million people who receive insurance through a Medicaid managed care organization. Only Louisiana Healthcare Connections, with 362,600 enrollees, has a larger share of enrollees.
When the health department has tried to switch large numbers of people from one Medicaid plan to another in the past, advocates said it has taken several months. Having such a massive change take place over the holidays will likely cause confusion, they said. 
“That isn’t a good time to make a change involving hundreds of thousands of people,” said Peter Robins-Brown, executive director of Louisiana Progress, an advocacy group for low-income people. 
UnitedHealthCare coverage is also widely accepted by doctors, hospitals and other health care providers. Many of the remaining health care plans have more limited provider networks, especially in rural areas, said Katie Corkern, an advocate for mental health care and people with disabilities. 
Corkern said she also worries there will be gaps in services after people switch into new health care plans and have to seek a new round of prior authorizations for medical treatments. 
Health insurers use prior authorization to review whether an enrollee requires the care or treatment they are seeking. They won’t agree to pay for certain services until prior authorization is granted. Prior authorization procedures differ among companies, and that status doesn’t automatically transfer when a patient has a new insurance plan. 
It’s also not clear that the five remaining health care plans have enough doctors, hospitals and other medical providers who take their insurance to absorb potentially thousands of new patients, said Jan Moller, executive director of Invest in Louisiana, a left-leaning organization that works on state tax and budget policy. 
“Sometimes, it can be hard for Medicaid beneficiaries to find doctors and other providers who will treat them,” Moller said. “How are we going to make sure we have enough doctors in our [remaining] networks to provide everything we need?”SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 
Lack of communication
Lawmakers are bewildered as to why the UnitedHealthCare contract is being dropped so suddenly. 
At the urging of the Landry administration less than a month ago, legislators approved UnitedHealthCare’s Medicaid contract for 2026 alongside five others. No concerns about the company’s services were brought up by the governor’s team during a nearly three-hour hearing Nov. 20. 
State Medicaid director Seth Gold then sent a short letter to UnitedHealthCare less than two weeks later telling the company its contract was ending on Dec. 31. 

“I’ve spoken to senators from both parties, and they have significant questions about what has evolved since the last [legislative] meeting that would force or require [the Louisiana Department of Health] and the administration to cancel,” Senate President Cameron Henry, R-Metairie, said in an interview Tuesday.

The Senate Insurance Committee and Senate Health and Welfare Committee are holding a joint hearing Tuesday to discuss the canceled contract with Attorney General Liz Murrill and state health officials. 
“Hearings need to be held to determine how this decision is made and why it is made and the ramifications,” said Sen. Thomas Pressly, R-Shreveport, who sits on the Health and Welfare Committee and voted to approve the UnitedHealthCare contract last month. “It needs to be on the record so people understand what’s going on.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX 
Problems with litigation 

Murrill and a recent setback for her in a state lawsuit against UnitedHealthCare appear to have played a major part in the contract termination. 

She sent a letter to Greenstein, the health secretary, on Dec. 2 urging him not to renew the UnitedHealthCare agreement because of the company’s “ongoing noncompliance with its contractual obligations.” That same day, the health department, which Greenstein leads, sent notice to UnitedHealthCare abruptly canceling its 2026 extension. 
In her letter to Greenstein, Murrill said UnitedHealthCare and its pharmacy benefits manager, OptumRX, has failed to turn over full access to its pharmacy claims processing system, which she alleges is required by its existing state contract. 

This claim is also the basis for the state’s years-long lawsuit against UnitedHealthCare, which Landry initially filed in 2022 when he served as attorney general. 
Landry and Murrill, who took over the lawsuit when she became attorney general in 2024, have more broadly alleged in the lawsuit that UnitedHealthCare and OptumRX overcharged the state Medicaid program for prescription drugs. The company has denied wrongdoing, saying it is in compliance with all state laws. 

Last month, the state lost a crucial court battle regarding the lawsuit. The Louisiana First Circuit Court of Appeal ruled against Murrill on Nov. 21, the week before Thanksgiving and 11 days before she sent the letter to Greenstein. 
The timing of the appellate court’s decision may explain why legislators were caught off guard by the contract termination. The ruling came out the day after legislators voted to renew UnitedHealthCare’s agreement. It’s not clear whether Murrill had raised objections to Greenstein and state health care officials before the court decision and that vote took place. 

The appellate court ruling also isn’t directly related to the merits of the lawsuit. It has to do with a side issue regarding how the attorney general had structured her contract with the private law firm, Salim-Beasley of Natchitoches, that is handling the case against UnitedHealthCare for the state. 

UnitedHealthCare has alleged in court that Murrill’s contract with Salim-Beasley violates state law. The company says the legal arrangement is too similar to a contingency fee contract, in which attorneys are only paid from the financial damages or settlement dollars awarded to the state if they win a case. 

The attorney general is only allowed to hire attorneys on a contingency fee basis if she received approval from the legislature to do so, according to state law.
Murrill’s attorneys have argued the Salim-Beasley contract doesn’t have to meet this requirement because its payment wouldn’t come directly from an award of damages or settlement the state receives. It would be given out separately from UnitedHealthCare under a judge’s direction and therefore is not a contingency fee contract. 
But the appellate court concluded UnitedHealthCare’s argument over the Salim-Beasley contract may have merit and needs to be heard in the lower district court before the state’s lawsuit can move forward. 

Murrill said the court fight is a factor in wanting to cancel UnitedHealthCare’s contract. 

“United has engaged in frivolous attacks on the AGs contracting authority as well, in an attempt to divert attention away from the issues,” she wrote in a text message to a reporter Monday.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/COVID-vaccine.jpg,,,2025-12-10 23:56:23.924927

It followed a hearing during which the company's attorneys sparred against the Trump administration, which has announced plans to reconsider the permit issued for its Maryland wind farm. (Photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)Offshore wind company US Wind battled the Trump administration in a Baltimore courtroom Wednesday, defending its Maryland project against the government’s plans to revoke and reconsider a construction permit issued under President Joe Biden (D).
For US Wind, the threat is existential, attorneys said Wednesday. Not only would the government’s revocation of the permit threaten to upend the project along Ocean City’s coast, it also could send the entire company heading toward bankruptcy.
“We’re not there yet,” US Wind CEO Jeff Grybowski said Tuesday outside the U.S. District Courthouse. “We’re in this fight because we made a promise to Maryland that we’re going to build the biggest renewable energy project in the state’s history.”
US Wind’s project is the closest to development along the Delmarva coast. Other companies — Ørsted and Equinor — have leases offshore, but do not have approved construction plans, like US Wind. But having an approved permit did not stop the Trump administration from trying to stop the project — one of a number of offshore wind projects that have been targeted, including some where stop-work orders have stalled construction.
Wednesday’s hearing is the latest twist in a case that began with the parties in entirely different roles. It began in October 2024, when Ocean City challenged the Biden administration’s approval of the permit, called a Construction and Operations Plan, or COP.
The Interior Department initially defended its issuance of the permit. But it reversed course after President Donald Trump (R) took office this year, and in September it asked U.S. District Court Judge Stephanie Gallagher to remand the permit back to the agency for reconsideration, saying it was not properly evaluated under Biden.
Judge strikes Trump order that froze wind energy permitting, leasing

US Wind fired back, asking Gallagher to bar the federal government “from taking any action to vacate, remand, withdraw, rescind, or in any way undermine” the project’s permit while the case proceeds.
Gallagher, who previously set aside the government’s remand request to allow for additional legal filings, said Wednesday that she plans to issue a written decision on US Wind’s preliminary injunction request.
Samuel Vice, attorney for the Justice Department, said this is not the time for an injunction. The government’s reevaluation of the US Wind permit is proceeding, though the department has taken “no affirmative steps” yet.
“We have not gotten to them in the queue,” Vice said. He said the US Wind reevaluation is part of a “broader reevaluation for all existing leases” spurred by Trump’s executive order, which also banned new or renewed leasing for offshore wind projects.
US Wind attorneys had argued that the president’s offshore wind ban meant that an Interior review of their project could reach no other conclusion than to deny the permit, since it is barred from issuing renewed approvals for wind farms.
Vice said on Wednesday that ban “has been vacated and is no longer operative,” so it can’t be used to justify a preliminary injunction for US Wind.
A federal judge in Massachusetts overturned Trump’s wind ban Monday, determining that the administration failed to justify its change in policy.
Gallagher said she found it concerning that the US Wind review is “in the queue,” noting that if Interior moves forward with a reconsideration, US Wind could be stuck in “limbo land” while it awaits a renewed ruling.
“They are suffering — I think that is clear from the record — ongoing harms from this delay,” Gallagher said.
US Wind said Wednesday that the project was already mired in legal confusion because of the Trump administration’s anti-wind pronouncements. Delays have “already caused harm” to the company — which is headquartered in Baltimore and funded by American and Italian firms — which has been forced to press pause on a “very, very expensive” Facility Design Report to the federal government, said Toyja E. Kelley, an attorney for US Wind.










There’s no procedure for this. They’re making it up as they go along.


– US Wind attorney David Newman, on the government's justifications for reversing it position.


If the permit were actually remanded, it might be the final straw for the project.
“The damage that’s been done to this project already may well be irreparable. But the project can still proceed,” said US Wind attorney David Newman. “This project cannot withstand another blow.”
The company believes it needs an injunction from Gallagher to protect it as Ocean City’s litigation proceeds.
The Town of Ocean City, for its part, is opposed to US Wind’s motion for a preliminary injunction, which would apply to “any person or entity acting in concert or participation with the Government.” That language  is “too broad,” said Nancie Marzulla, an attorney for Ocean City, and could be construed to include Ocean City.
A significant portion of Wednesday’s proceedings focused on whether Interior had taken a “final agency action” on US Wind’s permit.
US Wind argued in various court filings that the government signaled it has made a final decision about revoking the permit — even if it has not actually done so just yet.
“It [the agency] doesn’t have to actually pull the trigger for us to get review,” Newman said.
But Vice said that because the department has yet to actually issue its decision, court intervention now “would be an overstep.” The time to file a legal challenge is after Interior makes a decision about the permit, he said, not before then.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The department believes that Biden-era administrators applied an improper standard for review, and did not adequately consider the project’s effects on activities such as commercial fishing and search and rescue efforts.
But US Wind argues the government is “retroactively” moving the goalposts by changing the standard of review. And the new standards are “far more restrictive than the old ones,” Newman said, adding that “virtually no wind energy project could satisfy” the new rules, which require minimal impact to surrounding activities on the water.
US Wind said there are ways the government could revoke the COP, but only if there is an imminent danger to the environment or to national security, or if US Wind has violated terms of its lease. But instead of following the playbook, he said, the government moved abruptly to seek remand and reconsideration from the court.
“There’s no procedure for this,” Newman said. “They’re making it up as they go along.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_9773-cropped-e1765410333423-1024x664.jpeg,,,2025-12-10 22:56:25.850655

(Amy Bushatz/Mat-Su Sentinel)Gov. Mike Dunleavy on Tuesday issued a disaster declaration for the Matanuska-Susitna Borough to provide aid for individuals and local governments affected by the recent three-day windstorm.
The declaration, requested by Mat-Su officials Tuesday afternoon, provides grants to individuals and families to make home repairs, secure temporary housing or address other needs caused by the weekend storm, according to a state news release sent Wednesday.
Details on how much money may be available or how individuals can apply will be provided “in the coming days,” the release said.
“We are activating our disaster programs to bring relief to individuals and families who suffered property damage, and to ensure the Mat-Su Borough is reimbursed for emergency protective measures and infrastructure repairs,” Dunleavy said in the statement.
The borough will waive construction and household waste disposal fees at the Central Landfill near Palmer through Dec. 21 to help with cleanup, officials said in a release Wednesday.
The waiver also covers furniture, concrete and other nonhazardous construction trash, the release states. Brush and woody debris dumping at the landfill is already free.
“This measure is intended to support the disposal of storm-related waste and to assist residents who experienced damage or loss to personal property from the recent windstorm,” the release states.
The waiver applies only to individuals, not businesses or commercial landfill users, it states.
An American Red Cross emergency shelter at the Curtis D. Menard Memorial Sports Complex in Wasilla closed Wednesday morning, hours after power was restored to all homes and businesses in the region.
An average of 17 people stayed in the shelter each night between Saturday and Wednesday, Red Cross officials said in a release. Volunteers helped more than 50 people and provided more than 200 meals and snacks during operations, they said.
Officials with Matanuska Electric Association said some areas may experience brief power outages this week as crews work to fully remove trees from power lines.
Winds were expected to return to the Mat-Su on Wednesday evening, with gusts of up to 60 mph forecast through the weekend, according to the National Weather Service in Anchorage.

(File photo by Danielle E. Gaines/Maryland Matters)If it was supposed to be musical chairs, it was a short song.
Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) announced committee chairs for the 2026 General Assembly, his seventh as president, but most of the faces are familiar to anyone who haunted the Miller Senate Office Building during the 2025 legislative session. That familiarity starts with Ferguson and Senate President Pro Tem Malcolm Augustine (D-Prince George’s), who were reelected by a unanimous vote Wednesday of the Senate Democratic Caucus, according to a press release from Ferguson’s office.
The biggest change was in the Senate Executive Nominations Committee, where last year’s chairman, Sen. Clarence Lam (D-Howard and Anne Arundel) was moved out, replaced by Sen. Benjamin Brooks (D-Baltimore County). Lam, who had the misfortune of getting out, loudly, in support of redistricting just as Ferguson and the rest of the Senate were moving toward opposing, keeps his seat on the Finance Committee.
The only other standing committee chair to move is Sen. Shelly Hettleman (D-Baltimore County), who leaves the Rules Committee to become chair of Budget and Taxation’s Public Safety, Transportation and Environment Subcommittee in place of former Sen. Michael Jackson, who left the Senate to become superintendent of the Maryland State Police. Sen. Katie Fry Hester (D-Howard and Montgomery) takes over Rules.
Sen. Karen Lewis Young (D-Frederick) takes over as chair of Budget and Taxation’s Pensions Subcommittee, which had been held by Hettleman. Additionally, Augustine will fill Jackson’s seat on Budget and Tax, and Sen. Nick Charles (D-Prince George’s) takes over as vice chair of the Senate Democratic Caucus.
Sen. Kevin Harris (D-Prince George’s, Charles, and Calvert), who was just sworn in Wednesday, will join the Senate Committee on Education, Energy and the Environment.
“The Senate Democratic Caucus agenda will focus on growth, affordability, and protecting against attacks from the federal Administration in the 2026 Legislative Session,” Ferguson said in a statement released with the appointments. “We must give Marylanders the certainty and financial relief needed to navigate this avoidable chaos.”
A new gig, an old burial ground
Marc Schindler, former assistant secretary and chief of staff with the Maryland Department of Juvenile Services (DJS), will lead a national initiative to conduct research on children who died at juvenile facilities. The Forgotten Children Initiative at the Center for Youth Justice at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy launches next month.
Schindler said in an email Wednesday that the first phase will focus on a burial site at the old House of Reformation and Instruction for Colored Children in southern Prince George’s County, a wooded area believed to hold the remains of at least 230 Black teens from the 19th and 20th centuries.

Work on that restoration project began with former DJS Secretary Vincent Schiraldi, who stepped down in June. Schindler, who also worked as an executive director of the Justice Policy Institute, first visited the site last year and later returned with department staff, a volunteer genealogist and some youth from the nearby Cheltenham detention center to look for headstones.
Schindler led a tour of the grounds with members of the Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland in September, when he said there are 230 known graves and possibly 100 more marked only with cinder blocks. But records from the time are missing and death certificates were not issued in most parts of the state until 1898.
DJS applied this summer for a $31,000 grant to the African American Heritage Preservation Program to work on restoring the wooded area.
“Marc brings energy, wide-ranging experience and vast knowledge of the youth justice field from a number of perspectives,” Michael Umpierre, director of Georgetown’s justice center, said in a statement. “Most importantly, he has the passion, expertise and drive needed to positively impact today’s justice system.”
The Black Caucus hopes to pass legislation in the 2026 General Assembly for a commission to investigate the deaths of the Cheltenham boys, and possibly identify other forgotten burial sites and cemeteries throughout the state.
The national effort by Georgetown’s justice center plans are to research unmarked graves, to not only tell the stories of youth buried there but also memorialize them.
“It may be easy to think that this is an initiative about the past, but the past is with us,” according to the justice center. “We need to ensure that all of our country’s forgotten children – whether laying under a cinderblock grave, or sitting in detention today – are treated with dignity and humanity.”
Have a seat on the bench
Gov. Wes Moore has appointed three new judges to the Baltimore City District Court and elevated an Anne Arundel County District Court judge to the county’s circuit court, “four exceptional legal minds who have dedicated their careers to upholding the law,” he said last week when making the appointments.
“Their collective experience — from public defense to prosecution and federal service — has prepared them well for the bench,” he said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Moore named District Judge Sidney A. Butcher to a circuit court seat. First appointed to the bench in 2019, Butcher previously worked in the Medicaid Fraud Unit of the Maryland Attorney General’s Office, was in private practice and worked for a decade as a prosecutor in the Baltimore City State’s Attorney’s Office. He also served on the Anne Arundel County Board of Education. Butcher earned his law degree from the University of Kansas School of Law.
Moore appointed Elizabeth López, Noelle W. Newman and Otis W. Freeman to the Baltimore City District Court.
López has spent her entire legal career as a public defender, with 15 years in the Maryland Office of the Public Defender and the last four years in the Office of the Federal Public Defender, where she is a felony attorney supervisor, overseeing four attorneys. In Maryland, she created a model for the defense of children charged as adults. Earlier in her career, she represented juveniles and adults in criminal and civil commitment proceedings with the Defender Association in Seattle. She got her law degree from the University of St. Thomas School of Law.
Newman has served as counsel for Pessin Katz Law’s general litigation group since 2022, handling domestic relations matters, civil, and state and federal criminal defense. She spent 15 years before that at the Baltimore City State’s Attorney’s Office, rising to deputy state’s attorney in 2021. In district, juvenile, and circuit courts, she handled cases ranging from misdemeanors to complex felonies including sexual child abuse and homicides. Newman earned her law degree from the Catholic University of America, Columbus School of Law.
Freeman has been assistant chief counsel since 2o22 in the Baltimore Office of the Principal Legal Advisor in the Department of Homeland Security since 2022. Before that, Freeman spent four years with the Maryland Office of the Attorney General representing the Uninsured Employers’ Fund in workers’ compensation hearings. He spent seven years in the Baltimore City State’s Attorney’s Office, and began his legal career as a law clerk for the office’s homicide unit.

More than 600 miles southwest of Anchorage, on the Alaska Peninsula, the town of just 56 people is the gateway to the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge and home to a 10,000-foot runway used as an emergency stop for trans-Pacific flights. 
Cold Bay is a stop on the ferry route between Kodiak and Dutch Harbor, but the dock serves more than ferries — it connects the town with ships that supply groceries, water and almost everything else it needs.
State surveys have found that the existing dock “is nearing the end of its serviceable life and is at risk of failing.”
Most of the funding for the new dock is expected to come from the federal government; the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act passed by Congress during the Biden administration included $43.4 million for the dock, and the state will contribute another $8.7 million in matching funds.
The final cost of the dock may be higher than that; inflation has driven the cost of all construction projects higher than they were in 2023, when the federal government awarded a construction grant.
Under DOT’s timeline, the project will go out to bid in spring 2027, with construction beginning the following year, and projected to be completed in 2029.
The new dock is expected to be large enough to support the planned replacement for the ferry Tustumena.

An Eastern Shore biologist is asking for the public’s help reporting sightings in Maryland of a bright yellow invasive spider that looks scary but is actually harmless to humans.
Washington College professor Angela Chuang says the Joro spider, Trichonephila clavata, is easiest to spot in the late fall when the adult females reach their maximum size, with a leg span of up to 4 inches. She is calling for observers to snap photographs of the spiders and report them in the iNaturalist app.
Chuang said it isn’t uncommon to spot the species in large numbers in Georgia, Tennessee and other parts of the South. They weren’t documented in Maryland until 2022, when they were found  in Elkridge.
“The main thing is, we would like it if people could report when they see these spiders, so we have a better understanding of how Joro spiders are spreading around, especially because this is a distinct population from the older one,” Chuang said. “It represents an opportunity to study an invasive population at its earliest stages.”
The Joro spiders’ yellow bodies and black legs make it easy to mistake them for yellow garden spiders, which are Maryland natives. The Asian Joros don’t seem to pose a danger to humans or pets, and tests have shown their bites to cause little or no reaction in subjects.
Still, Chuang is concerned about the impact they might have on local wildlife, particularly local spider communities. When they settle into a new region, Joro spiders tend to quickly become the dominant species, she said. People in the Baltimore and Eastern Shore areas should be especially on the lookout, she added.
Residents of those areas can email the researcher directly at JoroSpidersWC@gmail.com to invite her team to their properties to study them.

Tony Evers signed “Bradyn’s Law,” which creates a new crime for sexual extortion and the “Swenson Starkie Act,” which extends the statute of limitations for hiding a corpse. Evers addresses the Legislature in his 2024 State of the State message. (Baylor Spears | Wisconsin Examiner)Gov. Tony Evers signed two bills this week introduced in response to crimes, including “Bradyn’s Law,” which creates a new crime for sexual extortion and the “Swenson Starkie Act,” which extends the statute of limitations for hiding a corpse. 
AB 201, now 2025 Wisconsin Act 48, was introduced by Rep. Patrick Snyder and Sen. Jesse James after the death of 15-year-old Bradyn Bohn from Kronenwetter, a village outside of Wausau. Bohn died by suicide in March after being targeted online by a perpetrator who convinced him to send photos of himself and told him that he needed to send money or face major consequences. He suffered through hours of threats and was coerced into sending money before his death.
“Today is an important day to remember Bradyn as we honor him and his memory, because now, moving forward, we will be able to hold bad actors responsible for reprehensible behavior, especially when they prey on our kids, and that is so important,” Evers said in a statement. “We wouldn’t be here today without Bradyn’s family and their relentless advocacy to keep kids safe online and hold predators accountable. We will be able to protect more of Wisconsin’s kids because of Bradyn’s family’s efforts to fight back.”
Sexual extortion, or “sextortion” is defined by the Federal Bureau of Investigation as a crime in which “an offender coerces a minor to create and send sexually explicit images or video and then uses that material to extort the victim by threatening to release it.” 
2025 Wisconsin Act 48 makes it a Class I felony to coerce someone to engage in sexual conduct or to produce “an intimate representation” by threatening to injure someone’s property or representation, by threatening to commit violence or by threatening to distribute intimate photos of another person. The crime would be a Class H felony if the victim does any of those acts or is under the age of 18, and a Class G felony if the defendant was previously convicted of a sexually violent offense, the violation was committed during the course of a child abduction or the victim is under age 18 and the defendant is more than four years older than the victim. 
A person can also be prosecuted for felony murder if the person commits extortion and it causes the death of the victim. 
Sexual extortion has become a growing threat in the U.S. in recent years. The FBI observed from October 2022 to March 2023 an increase of more than 20% in reports of financially motivated sextortion incidents involving minor victims. 
From October 2021 to March 2023, the FBI and Homeland Security Investigations received over 13,000 reports of online financial sextortion of minors that included at least 12,600 victims, mostly boys, and led to at least 20 suicides.
Rep. Brent Jacobson (R-Mosinee) said in a statement that the bill is the first step towards “protecting vulnerable Wisconsinites from exploitation.” 
“As technology creates new avenues for exploitation, my colleagues and I have an obligation to make sure our laws protect our constituents, and that Wisconsin parents have the resources and awareness to keep their children safe from harm,” Jacobson said. “We must continue to come together to prevent these heinous crimes from claiming children in our state.”
Statute of limitations for hiding a corpse
SB 423, now 2025 Wisconsin Act 59, extends the statute of limitations for prosecuting the crime of hiding or burying a corpse by specifying that it only begins “once the victim’s remains are found and identified or when the crime occurs, whichever is later.” The current statute of limitations is six years in Wisconsin.
The legislation was introduced by Sen. Van Wanggaard (R-Racine) and Rep. Ron Tusler (R-Harrison) after the case of Starkie Swenson. Swenson disappeared in 1983 but his remains weren’t found until 2021, 38 years later. 
According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, John C. Andrews accepted a plea in the case and was convicted on a charge of homicide by negligent use of a vehicle in 1994 and served 16 months in prison. He refused to reveal where Swenson’s body was. 
Police charged him with hiding a corpse after identifying the remains in 2021, but the charges were dismissed due to the statute of limitations. 
“The killer should’ve faced justice for hiding the remains in an attempt to conceal his crime. However, because of a loophole in Wisconsin law, Starkie’s killer was able to avoid charges,” Tusler said in a statement. “Although we cannot heal the wounds caused by the murder of Starkie Swenson, 2025 Wisconsin Act 59 ensures that no violent criminal will be able to exploit the corpse-hiding loophole again,” Tusler said in a statement.
Notifying parents of sex offenses
AB 74, now 2025 Wisconsin Act 57, requires Wisconsin schools to notify a pupil’s parent or guardian if the pupil is an alleged victim, target or recipient of alleged sex offenses while at school. The law also requires school boards to provide parents and guardians each year with information on their rights to access records regarding school employee discipline.
“Doing everything we can to keep our kids safe at school, at home, and in our communities is a top priority for me, as well as our schools and education professionals, who are frontlines of doing what’s best for our kids every day,” Evers said in a statement. “This bill will strengthen transparency by making sure parents and family members are notified if any misconduct at school affects their kids’ safety or well-being and bolster accountability by ensuring they know what their rights are and what their kids’ rights are.”
Evers signs several other bills this week
Under AB 136, now 2025 Wisconsin Act 55, the penalty for impersonating a peace officer, a firefighter, an emergency medical services practitioner or an emergency medical responder is increased from a Class A misdemeanor to a Class I felony. Sen. Jesse James (R-Thorp) and Rep. Chuck Wichgers (R-Muskego) introduced the legislation this year following an incident in New Berlin.
AB 388, now 2025 Wisconsin Act 75, creates a legal framework to establish a behavioral health hospital in Chippewa Falls using $10 million, which was set aside in the state budget this year to be used for Rogers Behavioral Health. Sen. Jesse James, who coauthored the bill, said in a statement that it “is extremely monumental for the people of northwestern Wisconsin” and provides “a renewed sense of optimism” to the community as it will provide mental health support for children and adults in the area.
Under SB 11, now 2025 Wisconsin Act 79, principals will now be required to allow youth membership organizations, including the Girl Scouts and the Boy Scouts, to schedule at minimum one time to visit their school to encourage students to join their organization. The visit can consist of both spoken and written information on how the organization helps students with educational interests and civic engagement. 
Sen. Rachael Cabral-Guevara (R-Appleton) celebrated Evers signing the bill, saying that the organizations “create more engaged, confident, and community-minded citizens” and the law “ensures the next generation of Wisconsin children will continue to benefit from these life-changing experiences.” She also criticized Evers for vetoing another bill that would have added new requirements on schools related to military recruiters, saying the state should “proudly support our military, not slam the door shut when they’re offering students legitimate career options, which is precisely what the governor did with this veto.”
SB 310, now 2025 Wisconsin Act 61, limits the amount of time covered by an emergency power proclamation by a local government’s chief executive officer to 60 days, unless extended by a local governing body. The bill was part of a controversy surrounding Rep. Sylvia Ortiz-Velez earlier this year who claimed that Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley, who is running for governor, abused his power during the COVID-19 pandemic when he issued emergency orders in 2021.
AB 265, now 2025 Wisconsin Act 56, requires judges to sentence offenders to a minimum of 10 years in prison if convicted of a human trafficking crime and 15 years for a child trafficking crime.

Maya Homan/Georgia RecorderEconomists are offering a “sobering” forecast for 2026, marking the second consecutive year of slowed growth across both Georgia and the U.S. at large. The state’s economy is projected to grow 1.5% in 2026, only marginally better than the 1.3% growth expected nationally, according to economists at the University of Georgia.
During a 2026 Georgia Economic Outlook presentation in downtown Atlanta Wednesday, interim Terry College of Business dean Santanu Chatterjee told business leaders that Georgia’s economy grew by roughly 3% in 2025. But heading into 2026, he said, growth will be slower as a result of “uncertainty” around trade policies, slowing population growth, labor force declines, and slower national economic growth.
Unemployment is also expected to be on the rise, with Georgia’s rates estimated to climb to 4.1%, an increase of half a percentage point. National unemployment is expected to sit at 4.7%, up from the current 4.4%. Inflation is expected to hover around 3.5%, up from 3% in September.
As with last year’s prediction, Georgia is expected to have a stronger economy than the U.S. as a whole, but the state’s economy is still predicted to struggle. Nationally, the U.S. faces a 49% risk of recession.
Georgia has a few protective factors that make its economy more resilient than the U.S. as a whole, Chatterjee said. Existing economic development projects from companies like EnergyTek Corporation, TriNet and JS Link America will continue to ramp up production.

Additionally, the state’s numerous military bases and the cities around them will likely benefit from increased federal spending on defense and immigration enforcement. An expanded immigrant detention facility near Folkston, Georgia — which is expected to be the nation’s largest — is also projected to create 400 new jobs in the area.
Data centers are also expected to be a major source of growth in the upcoming year. According to one report, Georgia recently surpassed Virginia as the most active data center market in the nation.
Federal policies begin to make an impact
Though Georgia is expected to have a slightly brighter economic outlook than the U.S. at large, national trends around wage growth and consumer spending indicate that the country is experiencing a “K-shaped economy” where high earners see their wealth and income rise, while lower earners struggle to keep pace with the rising cost of living.
“Across the board, lower income households appear to be significantly more challenged right now than the rest of the economy,” said Mark Mathews, the executive director of research at the National Retail Federation, who delivered the national economic forecast at Wednesday’s event.
As President Donald Trump wraps up the first year of his second term, his policies on tariffs and immigration are also beginning to make their impact on the national economy.
Tariffs on imports are expected to settle at around 15% in 2026, which is six times higher than the rate at the beginning of 2025. The rate is not high enough to trigger a recession by itself, Chatterjee said, but elevated global tensions and economic uncertainty could slow growth. 
Some companies may also choose to postpone hiring and other business decisions “until trade policies stabilize and become more predictable.”
Trump’s immigration policies could also lead to changes in the economy. Normally, immigrants help contribute to annual population growth, Mathews said. But under policies that have ramped up immigration enforcement and placed a new emphasis on “self-deportation,” 2026 “could well be the first year in American history where we have a population decline,” he said.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_2076-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-10 19:57:15.419887

Sens. Regina Barrow, D-Baton Rouge, and Katrina Jackson-Andrews, D-Monroe, were also critical of the leadership at the Department of Children and Family Services and its lack of experience in child welfare. Its leader, Rebecca Harris, appeared Thursday before the legislature’s Select Committee on Women and Children and acknowledged that her top executives don’t have backgrounds working directly on child abuse and neglect. 
Jackson-Andrews said that having no one among the department’s top six leadership positions with a background in child welfare is “alarming,” given the agency’s primary mission.
“That’s what we do at DCFS. That’s the main thing, protecting children,” Jackson-Andrews said.

Lawmakers have long scrutinized the department over instances when repeated abuse apparently went unchecked. Through September, 39 children in Louisiana died this year as a result of suspected abuse or neglect. Of those deaths, 25 were at households the agency had previously investigated.
Harris, who was named the department’s leader in August, has put an emphasis on placing more child welfare workers in “front line” jobs where they can respond to allegations of abuse and neglect. So far, she’s reassigned about 100 child welfare supervisors from office jobs to positions where they can handle child welfare cases directly. Another 48 recently hired “second shift” workers have boosted those numbers, DCFS Assistant Secretary Bret Hanemann said.
Some of the shuffled supervisors contacted Jackson-Andrews to complain they were given extremely short notice about their new assignments, the senator said. Harris confirmed that the employees were moved to new roles in less than a week, adding “we did not do all this perfectly.” 
Harris also intends to end remote work for the 51 staffers who field calls to the state’s 24-7 child abuse hotline. She said no other state allows those employees to work from home, where they could potentially lose power or their internet connection. The decision is also in line with an executive order from Gov. Jeff Landry in April to require in-office work for all state employees with limited exceptions.
Instead, the department is launching a call center at its downtown Baton Rouge headquarters starting Dec. 15. The five hotline employees who live in the Baton Rouge area will have to work at the new location, which Harris is fashioning to work like a 911 call center. The remaining 46 employees, which include call workers, their supervisors and  managers, are being offered front line jobs at regional DCFS offices.
Hundreds of Louisiana child abuse reports filed online sat untouched for days

Lacy Simms, who Harris has placed in charge of the call center, provided lawmakers with details on Harris’ plans to model the hotline after an emergency call center in an effort to reduce call wait times and how long staffers spend on each call. The secretary said calls should average seven to nine minutes, including the time needed to dispatch first responders if warranted. Currently, the call center averages 26 minutes per call.
Simms said she has reached out to the Association of Public-Safety Communications Officials, an organization for emergency communications professionals, to develop what she said would be the first-ever training for child abuse hotline workers. 
“I really believe with the right training, with the right information, with the right people put into our training, I really believe we’re going to take off and be the first child welfare agency in the nation where our people are certified, and we operate it as a 911 call center,” Simms said. 
The secretary originally planned for the transition to the call center to be complete by Jan. 1, but she has since extended that deadline to June 30. The additional time will allow new and existing employees to be trained on new technology and procedures being put in place.
Lawmakers also heard from Melanie Mann, who was on the hotline staff until last month when Harris began the process to relocate the team to Baton Rouge. Mann said she resigned because her disability would not allow her to work at the closest DCFS regional office to her in Amite.   
Jackson-Andrews said she has received calls and emails from about a dozen hotline employees who have said they have contemplated quitting or retiring rather than taking regional office jobs. Mann said she knows of several former co-workers who also have disabilities and aren’t likely to take new roles with the department.
Simms said Mann and one supervisor are the only departures from the DFCS hotline staff to date. Forty people have applied for jobs as hotline operators, and 10 applications have been submitted for the vacant supervisor position, she added.


Let us know what you think...


 

Earlier in the meeting, Mann questioned the department’s new emphasis on hiring communications workers, rather than persons with background in social work or child services, to staff the hotline. She said the restructuring could result in the loss of staff with specialized training and years of experience. 
“We make high stakes decisions that can impact children’s lives every time we process a report,” Mann said.  
Jackson-Andrews said multiple times she did not want to pin the longstanding issues at Children and Family Services on Harris but stressed that her reorganization should include input from its child welfare workers, especially because that experience is lacking on her executive team.
In an interview after the hearing, Harris said the department’s top managers, who are just one level below the executive team, have the institutional knowledge and background the senator mentioned. She referenced her own experience as an investigator with the state health department involving cases of sexually transmitted disease among minors, which she said often overlapped with DCFS child welfare cases. 
“Between all of the different skills and knowledge and experience that’s brought to the table, I believe that we have a very solid team,” Harris said.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)While a majority of nurses at UnityPoint Health — Des Moines voted this week to unionize in initial results, the National Labor Relations Board did not announce the outcome of the election Wednesday amid a dispute over challenged votes.
Nurses working in four UnityPoint Health locations in the Des Moines area — Iowa Methodist Medical Center, Blank Children’s Hospital, Methodist West Hospital and Iowa Lutheran Hospital — voted from Dec. 7-9 on whether to unionize. The nurses who would be represented voted on whether they wanted to become a bargaining group represented through the Teamsters Local 90.
Results were counted Wednesday, and totaled 871 votes in favor of Teamsters representation, and 666 votes opposing the union. There are 251 challenged ballots, according to a statement from UnityPoint Health, largely coming from Teamsters, which are not included in the final vote counts released Wednesday.

Approving union representation only requires a simple majority. Without the challenged ballots, the union effort is ahead by 205 votes. If all challenged ballots were approved — and if all were opposing the union — the unionization effort would be defeated.
But Nico Hernandez with Teamsters Local 90 said he did not believe the challenged ballots would be approved nor would they overturn the current election results, as the Teamsters challenged ballots of people who were ineligible to participate in the vote.
“(UnityPoint) agreed to a stipulation timeline, they agreed to a list of voters that were eligible to vote, and they intentionally tried to tell people that were ineligible to vote to go to the polls,” Hernandez said. “They told agency nurses, for example, to go vote, they told — there’s LPNs that they told t0 vote, people who are not registered nurses. And so as a result, there’s a fair few challenges. However, obviously, with a margin of 205, it’s very substantial, and as a result, we’re very confident that at the end of the day, once we have our day at the Labor Board, these nurses will be certified as a union. Because they have fought for so much, and they, you know, they deserve the ability to bargain and negotiate for fair protections on the job and for dignity at work.”
UnityPoint officials said in a statement they “don’t believe there is any merit to the International Brotherhood of Teamsters’ challenges.”
“We have reason to believe they only challenged the ballots of certain nurses based on how they believed those nurses would vote,” the UnityPoint statement read. “UnityPoint Health did not challenge the ballots of any nurses currently employed in the bargaining unit – we believe everyone’s vote should count and everyone’s voice should be heard.”
Hernandez said the Teamsters disputed that any ballots were challenged based on how they believed individuals would vote, as well as the claim that UnityPoint Health did not challenge ballots, saying UnityPoint challenged ballots of “people that are nurses in the bargaining unit.”
According to a statement from UnityPoint Health – Des Moines, the NLRB “has not confirmed an outcome to today’s vote, which means a result is undetermined and there is no union at UnityPoint Health – Des Moines.”
The effort to form “United Nurses of Iowa” effort has built over more than a year as some nurses sought voluntary recognition from UnityPoint for the planned bargaining group in August before moving forward with an NLRB vote. The vote was originally scheduled for October, but was delayed due to the government shutdown.
Nurses involved in the organizing effort said they were pursuing a union as a way to address issues like staff shortages, safety concerns and compensation.
Following the vote, there will be a hearing scheduled with the NLRB to go over the facts of the case — something Hernandez said the Teamsters are “hopeful that it’ll be scheduled as soon as possible.”
“We’re looking forward to, you know, get this thing across the finish line,” Hernandez said. “These nurses know that they’ve won their union. We just need to get the paperwork.”
UnityPoint officials said the health care system “will continue to stay focused on delivering exceptional care to our patients, families, and communities” while proceeding through the NLRB process for evaluating challenged ballots.

Patrick Andrews stood outside his home in Kipnuk, Alaska, securing his boats and supplies while the sky above was calm on the morning of Oct. 11. The air was crisp and clear, the horizon stretching endlessly in every direction. An open country where the wind, the rain, and the sea spoke in familiar tones.
The lifelong hunter and fisherman heard there was a storm on the way. Typhoon Halong, the forecast said. But no one knew how bad it would get. Weathering storms was part of life in his community.
By nightfall, everything changed.
“The wind just kept getting stronger,” Andrews recalled, who is Yupik and a member of the Native village of Kipnuk. “It seemed like every 15 minutes, the water level would be really higher than the last time I looked.”
As midnight passed, the river swelled into the roads, seeping closer to his home. Andrews, his wife, and their three children watched as the calm morning gave way to chaos.

In many western Alaska communities, schools serve as more than classrooms. When strong winds or a winter blizzard rolls in, they often open their doors to families who need a safe and sturdy place to shelter.
“I wasn’t gonna evacuate to the school until I knew I had to,” he said. “Around 2 a.m. I was really concerned, seeing that it was already flooding and the peak was a few hours away, and I decided that I should evacuate to the school.”
He rushed inside his home, yelling for his family to grab what they could: blankets, pillows, a few dry clothes stuffed into trash bags. The wind howled as they scrambled onto their four-wheeler.
“My wife and kids were holding on to each other,” he said.

Along the boardwalks and against strong winds, Andrews and his family drove on four-wheelers in one direction he had planned to take to higher ground. But the water was already too high.
Turning around, Andrews took his family through the storm with another family to the school. Andrews was among the few who made it to the school, while other relatives and families couldn’t get back in time.
Phones began to ring and vibrate once they were sheltered there. It was those who hadn’t evacuated to the school in time.
“We were starting to get phone calls from people asking for help. They were terrified,” he said.

They were caught in the flood and trapped in the homes as the water rose.
“We couldn’t do anything with nothing,” he said.  “They were drifting away in their house, and that feeling of helplessness was really stressful.”
By dawn, the village was underwater.

More families poured into the school — more than 700 people in total. The generator hummed weakly, powering a few lights and a small water tank. Outside, houses drifted in the flood.
The scale of Typhoon Halong’s destruction across western Alaska became clearer as state officials released new damage assessments.
In an update published on Oct. 13, the State Emergency Operations Center reported, “49 communities are reporting impacts, and 1,400 residents are sheltering in 12 shelters.” Among the villages affected was Kipnuk, where homes were swept off their foundations and many residents were forced to evacuate.
The numbers underscored how widespread the storm’s effects were, stretching across remote communities where evacuation routes are limited and recovery is expected to take months.
A day later, the Coast Guard and National Guard arrived.
On Oct. 15, evacuation orders were issued. Andrews and his wife returned to their house to gather pieces of their home and memories. “A couple of pictures, and grabbed our Bibles,” he said.
Along with those sentimental items, Andrews also collected some essentials.
“And my shoes, my kids’ shoes that were dry. We were able to get a couple of shoes for my kids, but that was it. We filled her backpack and she had her bag of blankets, pillows,” he said.

Andrews and his family were flown first to Bethel, then to Anchorage, and finally to Fairbanks, where they now stay in an apartment.
Relatives in the interior of Alaska were the reason Andrews and his family decided where to go next.
“My wife told me that her aunt was telling her that we should come to Fairbanks,” he said.
They arrived in Fairbanks on Oct. 17 and learned that an AirBnB host had offered their cabin for about two weeks. “We stayed at the cabin in North Pole for about a week or more until we were able to find an apartment,” he said.
“The day after we got to Fairbanks, we got all these donations, clothes and food, and one donation was a car. A small car. It’s an earlier, older, older car, but it helps us get whatever we need around town,” he said.
For Andrews’ children, adjusting to city life was a cultural shock, but also a relief.

Andrews said all three of his kids had never even crossed a street with a walk signal before. They had never ridden a school bus, and the basic daily routine of getting to and from school was completely new to them. They were used to playing on a playground and going to school, but the need for food was different.
In the city, he said, you have to pay for almost everything you eat, while back home they lived off what they hunted, caught and gathered.
City life brought a lot of differences, but also a lot of conveniences.
“My kids just gone to their first week of school,” he said, smiling. “And they just tell stories of everything they did, and it’s really, really refreshing that they’re enjoying their time in school.”
 A community response

Across town, in an office at Denakkanaaga, Sharon McConnell was on the phone. As director of the nonprofit, she and her colleagues had been tracking the evacuees’ arrival in Fairbanks.
“At that time, we found out that there were about 10 or so, well, there’s 10 adults and about nine children,” she said. “We just thought it would be a nice gesture to get to know them, welcome them, let them know who we are, what’s available in Fairbanks.”
McConnell and a coalition of Native-led organizations — including the Fairbanks Native Association and Doyon, Limited — organized a welcome luncheon. It wasn’t just a meal. It was a gesture of home.

“People brought Native food. Denakkanaaga and [Fairbanks Native Association] put together a menu and we each made different dishes, moose soup, salmon salad with salmon eggs, things like that,” McConnell said, smiling at the memory. “Other folks brought seal oil, dried meat, salmon strips.”
When Andrews and his family arrived, the room was quiet at first. New faces, a new place, the uncertainty of starting over. But as the dishes were passed around and the children laughed, the air began to change.
“By the end of the luncheon,” McConnell said. “People were laughing and teasing each other. You know that we that we do in the Native community,”
Among the guests were community leaders and elders, the Fairbanks Chief of Police, and representatives from Doyon and Fairbanks Native Association. One woman from Southwest Alaska even brought homemade frybread.
“Someone brought seal oil which was wonderful,” McConnell added.

Still, practical needs remained urgent.
“One little child that was at the luncheon needed boots right away,” McConnell said. “Another little toddler, the family needed a car seat for him or her, and [Fairbanks Native Association] was able to provide that immediately while we were at the lunch.”
Beyond material aid, McConnell’s focus — and that of Denakkanaaga — was on connection.
“We’re more of an advocacy organization, not a hands-on direct services,” she explained. “What we’ve offered them, of course, is a place to visit, a place to come to, to meet elders, meet more Native families.”
 The strength of connection

For McConnell, the experience reaffirmed the importance of Native-led response efforts.
“No matter where we reside, that really strong Native connection is there, whether it’s in Fairbanks, rural communities, Anchorage,” she said. “We come together, we support each other. Not just our own cultures, but other Native cultures of Alaska, the statewide Native community”
And for Andrews, that connection is what carried his family from chaos to stability. “We lost a lot,” he said. “But we found kindness everywhere we went.”

He had spent the fall building a new 10-by-10 shed, finishing the door, the walls and the roof just the night before the flood. “It’s a brand new shed that I made where my wife could process fish and some seal meats,” he said, adding that it was also where they planned to keep their freezers.
When he returned after the water receded, everything was gone. The house was gone, the shed was gone and so was his homemade wood stove sauna. He listed the rest quietly: three boats, including “a 22 footer with 115 horse Yamaha,” a snowmachine, three utility sleds, an aluminum ATV trailer with the boat trailer, his Honda ATV 500, all of his guns, camping gear, fishing gear, salmon and the fuel tanks he used for traveling.
“Those are all gone,” he said. Even his wife’s 10-foot kayak had washed loose, though he later found it wedged under what was left of the house. “We lost our fish rack,” he said.
Now, in Fairbanks, as his children settle into their new schools and his family finds their footing, Andrews still thinks of home. The open skies and the sound of the wind sweeping across the tundra.
“It’s different here,” he said.  “But people have made us feel like we belong.”

The family’s daily rhythm has shifted in ways he still notices.
“Our days are too different now compared to our routine at home,” he said.
Back home, school for all students started around 9 a.m. from kindergarten through 12th grade. In Fairbanks, his middle schooler begins much earlier.
“So we’re starting our days earlier and going to bed earlier now,” he said. He wakes up ahead of dawn, gets everyone out the door and finishes the day on a new schedule. “I’m picking up the kids by myself,” he said, another change in a life that still feels new but is slowly settling into place.
 Epilogue

In the weeks after the luncheon, McConnell and her team continued to invite the families to community gatherings like beading circles, craft nights, and elder lunches.
“It’s just the beginning,” she said.
For Andrews, the road ahead remains uncertain, yet hope persists.
The future for western Alaska remains uncertain in the wake of Typhoon Halong.
With “as much as 90 percent of structures” destroyed in villages like Kipnuk, according to the American Red Cross, limited access due to remote locations, and ongoing threats from thawing permafrost and rising seas, many residents face a long and difficult recovery.
“Almost all of the supplies have to come in by barge – plywood to nails to windows – and that isn’t going to happen in winter. You can’t truck it in – there are no roads. Planes can only fly in small amounts – the runways are short and not built for cargo planes,” said the University of Alaska Fairbanks’ International Arctic Research Center.
While some families will likely return, the process may take months or even years, and for others, permanent relocation to higher ground may be the safer option.
“Recovery is a priority for the impacted areas, and recovery operations continue with an emphasis on restoring critical infrastructure and services, including water, power, and communications, and emergency home and boardwalk repairs,” according to the Alaska Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management.
Officials continue to provide support through shelters, donations, and temporary housing, but the storm has highlighted the broader challenges that climate change and extreme weather pose for Alaska’s remote communities.
“I hope we’ll be able to return home,” Andrews said softly. “While we are in the cities, wherever we are, wherever people ended up after the storm, I just hope that all of us will be alright for as long as it takes.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)The Tennessee Supreme Court vacated a lower court’s judgment that a 2022 state Senate map was unconstitutional, ruling that a voter in a misnumbered Davidson County district lacked standing to challenge the map.
The ruling also upheld a lower court’s decision that declared the 2022 House redistricting map was constitutional.
This is the latest development in a lengthy legal battle over the maps that has spanned multiple courts since state lawmakers approved the new districts after the most recent U.S. Census.
Francie Hunt, executive director of Tennessee Advocates for Planned Parenthood, sought an expedited ruling from the state Supreme Court in 2023 for her challenge against the new Senate districts. She lives in a part of Davidson County that was placed into Senate District 17 along with the entirety of Wilson County in the redistricted Senate map.
Hunt challenged the Senate plan because it numbered Davidson County’s four Senate districts out of compliance with a constitutional rule that districts in multi-district counties must be numbered consecutively.
Judges order Tennessee Senate redistricting map to be redrawn; trial possible for House plan

Prior to redistricting, the map numbered Davidson County’s four Senate districts consecutively. Because Senate terms are staggered, this meant two of the county’s senators would be up for election in presidential election years, and the other two would be up for election in gubernatorial election years. Under the Senate map adopted in 2022, three Davidson County senators would be up for election in gubernatorial election years, and only one would coincide with the presidential election cycle.
Justice Sarah K. Campbell, who wrote the majority opinion, stated that Hunt needed to show a “distinct and palpable” injury for her claim to be valid.
“Hunt’s complaint is simply that she lives in a non-consecutively numbered Senate district, while other Tennessee voters do not,” the opinion states. “But that difference does not affect the weight or strength of her vote, so it is not vote dilution.”
The opinion states that Davidson County’s Senate districts were also numbered nonconsecutively in redistricting plans following the census releases in 1990 and 2000. Hunt has lived in Davidson County since 1999, but “was unaware of the numbering issue at that time,” according to the opinion.
Voters have challenged district misnumbering in other courts when it caused voters to wait longer than usual to elect an official, Campbell wrote, but the redistricted Senate map allowed Hunt to vote for a Senate candidate in 2020 and in 2022, two years sooner than she would have been able to had her district been numbered consecutively.
While the court found Hunt lacked standing, “other plaintiffs — whether voters, candidates or public officials — may be able to establish standing based on different facts in future cases,” Campbell wrote.

Three plaintiffs backed by the Tennessee Democratic Party initially sued the state to block maps drawn by the Republican-dominated Senate and House following the February 2022 redistricting process. The lawsuit alleged the House redistricting plan violated the Tennessee Constitution because it divided more counties than necessary and rejected an alternative plan that would have left seven counties whole.
A three-judge panel issued an injunction against the Senate map in April 2022 because it failed to meet a constitutional requirement that Senate seats in the same county must be numbered consecutively. The panel ordered lawmakers to come up with a new map within 15 days. 
In response, Gov. Bill Lee, Secretary of State Tre Hargett and Tennessee Elections Coordinator Mark Goins filed an appeal in the Tennessee Court of Appeals. The Tennessee Supreme Court intervened because of the case’s urgency and lifted the panel’s injunction days later.
Hargett said little about the case other than “congratulations to the Attorney General’s Office in another court victory.”
Minority opinion finds Senate map misnumbering did violate rights
In the court’s minority opinion, Justice Holly Kirby found that Hunt’s constitutional rights were violated in the redistricting plan that moved her from the district held by Republican Sen. Ferrell Haile in Sumner County to that of Republican Sen. Mark Pody of Lebanon, who she said was not “connected” to her community. 
The minority ruling found Hunt “sustained” injury from the 3-1 staggered terms in Davidson County and said it is neither “conjectural nor hypothetical” and that it would “manifest itself” each time District 17 changes.
Senate and House redistricting rulings challenged at Supreme Court level

Kirby threw a few barbs at the majority opinion, saying the justices “quibbled” with Hunt’s description of her injuries and cast it as vote dilution.
She summed up her ruling by saying, “Under our standing jurisprudence in redistricting cases, it should not be easier for the proverbial camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a voter to challenge the constitutionality of her own voting district. Ms. Hunt has proper standing, and her claim should be considered on its merits.”
The majority opinion determined that another plaintiff, Gary Wygant, did have standing to challenge the House plan, but only for Gibson County, where he resides. The court upheld a lower court’s ruling that Wygant “failed to prove that the legislature lacked a rational or legitimate basis for dividing Gibson County.”=
In a separate opinion, Justice Dwight Tarwater wrote that Wygant could not prove he was harmed by the slicing of Gibson County from one state House district into two. Wygant claimed he and other voters were hurt by “the denial of a single representative to represent all of Gibson County” but Tarwater opined the claim lacked merit.

Plaintiff attempts to bolster case against the Women's Center with a 2023 federal audit that found blind spots and an incomplete investigation into staff-on-inmate sexual abuse allegations. 
The post New filings in Wyoming women’s prison sexual assault lawsuit point to secluded off-camera locations appeared first on WyoFile .","New filings in an ongoing lawsuit against officials at the women’s prison in Lusk point to a 2023 federal audit that found surveillance camera blind spots within the facility and an incomplete investigation into staff-on-inmate sexual abuse allegations, among other deficiencies. 
In the last five years, three former prison guards at the Wyoming Women’s Center have been convicted and found guilty of sexually assaulting female inmates. 
In August, one of those women filed a federal lawsuit that alleges the sexual abuse she experienced was the result of “deliberate indifference to the rights and safety of inmates” by the prison’s staff and leadership. 
Filed in Wyoming’s U.S. District Court, the complaint names Joseph Gaul, a former correctional officer, alongside Warden Timothy Lang and Deputy Warden Robert Harty. Five John Does are also listed as defendants, whom the plaintiff could not name but believes were Women’s Center employees. 
In 2023, Gaul admitted to inappropriate sexual contact with the plaintiff, Chasity Jacobs. He then pleaded guilty to second-degree sexual assault and was sentenced to two to five years in prison. 
The Wyoming Attorney General’s office is seeking to dismiss Jacobs’ lawsuit, contending that it does not make a plausible claim and was filed outside the statute of limitations. 
In the meantime, attorneys for the plaintiff filed an amended complaint on Dec. 1. It names an additional defendant — Rick Catron, the former women’s prison warden — and includes details from a 2023 federal audit. 
“Multiple sexual assaults have been investigated internally by [the Wyoming Department of Corrections] rather than immediately referred to outside law enforcement, undermining accountability and potentially concealing the full scope of abuse,” the amended complaint argues. “Investigations are often incomplete, shielded by internal review procedures, and rarely result in systematic reform or staff discipline beyond the individual perpetrator.” 
PREA audits
The Prison Rape Elimination Act requires agencies like the Wyoming Department of Corrections to track and report sexual victimization at each of its facilities on an annual basis. 
In the last decade, PREA records indicate there have been 11 substantiated instances of a prison guard sexually assaulting a female inmate at the Women’s Center.

Federal law also requires that facilities undergo independent audits every three years to remain eligible for substantial federal funding. The last PREA audit of the Women’s Center was completed in 2023. In July of that year, between the on-site PREA visit in February 2023 and the report’s completion in September 2023, Jacobs says Gaul raped her in a secluded closet, and a week later, sexually assaulted her in a vestibule. He was later convicted of the second incident.
“Although surveillance cameras had been installed throughout the facility, the February 2023 PREA audit identified multiple camera blind spots that posed significant safety risks and allowed areas of the prison to remain unmonitored,” the amended complaint states. 
More specifically, “the auditor identified one blind spot in the commissary caged areas,” according to the audit report. “The auditor also observed a door to the boiler room unsecured, causing a blind spot and safety issue.” 
The facility was required to take corrective action, which, according to the audit, included providing a memo to staff related to unsecured areas and unsecured doors. 
“The memo advised of the importance of securing doors and that failure to do so moving forward would result in disciplinary action, including up to termination,” the audit states.  
The facility also “provided six photos of mirrors installed in [the] commissary,” the audit states. “The photos provided confirmation that the blind spots were alleviated.”
The amended lawsuit also points to the audit’s review of sexual abuse and sexual harassment allegations and investigations at the Women’s Center. 
“During the 2023 audit, it was discovered that WWC failed to complete an investigation into a staff-on-inmate sexual abuse allegation, requiring corrective action for its failure to conduct or document a complete investigation by PREA standards,” the lawsuit states. 
As the audit report details, “a review of nine allegations indicated that one was sexual abuse while the others were consensual sexual activity. The sexual abuse allegation involved staff sexual abuse in addition to numerous other allegations.”
While “the facility investigator completed an investigation into the other allegations,” the audit states, “an investigation into staff sexual misconduct” was not completed because the investigator “did not have the authority to conduct a staff-on-inmate sexual abuse investigation.” 
After the investigation was forwarded to “agency investigators,” there was no documentation that it was completed, according to the audit.
The facility was once again required to take corrective action, which included completing the investigation, providing “a process memo to the auditor related to who is responsible for the different allegation types” and providing “a list of sexual abuse allegations during the corrective action period and the corresponding investigative reports.”
Those tasks were completed by Aug. 23, 2023, including the investigation, which “determined the allegation was unsubstantiated.”
The lawsuit
Approximately five months after the on-site portion of the 2023 PREA audit was completed, Gaul, the former guard, assaulted Jacobs, according to her lawsuit.  
The first of two assaults took place in a chemical closet, according to the complaint, and the second occurred in another unsupervised area of the prison. 
Before he was hired to work at the women’s prison, Gaul was terminated from at least two public-sector jobs in Nebraska due to misconduct toward women, according to the lawsuit. 
“During the 2020 PREA audit, the auditor examined all WWC’s self-reported policies and interviewed Defendant Catron who indicated all potential hires undergo background checks and are asked questions about previous terminations,” the lawsuit states. “Despite these representations, the facility continued to employ male officers who engaged in grooming behavior, rule violations, and abuse of inmates.”
The state now has the opportunity to respond to the amended complaint.
The Wyoming Department of Corrections did not respond to WyoFile’s request for comment by publishing time.

(Keila Szpaller/The Daily Montanan)A Sheep Creek mine would bring economic development to the Bitterroot Valley, but the U.S. Forest Service should ensure the mine exploration moves forward with “needed transparency,” Montana’s congressional delegation said in a letter to the agency chief.
“We have been ardent supporters of new mines and mine expansion in Montana, including the Libby Exploration Project and the Sibanye-Stillwater Mine, both located on Forest Service land,” said U.S. Sen. Steve Daines and the Montana delegation in a letter Monday.
The letter said the delegation saw at Sheep Creek the potential to “greatly expand U.S. critical mineral production” and its ability to bring jobs and important revenue to the community.
However, the delegation said federal land use decisions need the support of local communities, and, “importantly, county commissions,” which the project does not have. The letter called for “ample local engagement.”
U.S. Critical Materials has proposed a controversial 3.9 acre mine exploration project for “rare earth” minerals at the headwaters of the Bitterroot River to see if a fullscale operation is feasible.
Company representatives argue the project could support national security and bring jobs to the area, but local residents have decried the lack of communication and doublespeak from mine officials and raised concerns about impacts to water, critical for local agriculture, tourism and recreation.
Last week, Ravalli County Commissioners unanimously voted to send a letter to the Congressional delegation asking the Sheep Creek mine exploration be removed from the FAST-41 list of federal projects to be expedited, citing lack of public engagement.
FAST stands for Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act.
The commissioners did so at a meeting they estimated drew 700 people. During public comment, not one person spoke in favor of the mine, and many raised concerns, including whether the mine should ever operate in the area.
The letter from the Congressional delegation was addressed to U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Schultz and Emily Domenech, director of the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council, which oversees FAST-41 projects.
In the letter, the delegation did not ask the Forest Service or permitting council to remove the project from the FAST-41 list, or “fast track,” although U.S. Sen. Tim Sheehy and U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke made such calls earlier, but it called for the chief and director to ensure transparency from U.S. Critical Materials or any successor companies.
“Unfortunately, it has become clear to us that the developers of the proposed Sheep Creek deposit have not engaged with community leaders and gained their trust to proceed with the development of this deposit,” the letter said. “As such, we cannot support the project and urge the Forest Service and the Permitting Council to ensure full transparency and increased local engagement in the permitting process.”
The letter was signed by Daines, Sheehy, Zinke and U.S. Rep. Troy Downing, all Republicans.
Wednesday, Ravalli County Commission Chairman Dan Huls said the Commission had not heard from either of the U.S. Critical Materials mine officials since they presented at the meeting last week.
The project is still named on the FAST-41 project list for Montana, and Huls said it’s frustrating to be in “hurry-up-and-wait mode” regarding its status.
“I hope that our congressional delegation has the horsepower to get this thing off of the fast track,” Huls said.
The letter he and Commissioners Greg Chilcott and Jeff Burrows signed also requested full environmental reviews for any work at Sheep Creek.
The Permitting Council has not responded to requests for comment about the status of the Sheep Creek proposal. Wednesday, U.S. Critical Materials also did not respond to messages from the Daily Montanan.
In the letter this week, the Congressional delegation thanked the Forest Service chief and permitting council director for their work “expanding mineral production in Montana” and on other FAST-41 projects, like the Stillwater Mine and Libby Exploration Project.
“The Sheep Creek deposit has the potential to greatly expand U.S. critical mineral production and reduce our dependence on China for rare earth elements that are vital for the US economy,” the letter said. “Future development of the Sheep Creek deposit will bring jobs, economic development, and important revenues for the local community that can be used to increase public safety, fix roads and infrastructure and fund schools. This can be done while also protecting environmental assets, water quality, and wildlife.”
But one piece is missing at Sheep Creek compared to the projects at Libby and Stillwater, the delegation said.
“Unlike the proposed Sheep Creek mine, both (the Libby and Stillwater projects) enjoy strong support of the local community and the confidence of county commissioners and stakeholders,” the letter said. “We hope that the lack of engagement will be rectified promptly and urge the Forest Service and the Permitting Council to ensure the project receives the needed transparency and ample local engagement.”
Huls, though, said he remains skeptical about the project in the Bitterroot, and he sees better opportunities to mine the same minerals elsewhere in Montana.
“I very much wish that everything the proponents said was true,” Huls said of the mine officials. “But what they lined out for us, in my opinion, was a project that’s too good to be true.”
Huls said he wasn’t necessarily speaking for the other commissioners. He also said he agrees the U.S. is under China’s thumb when it comes to rare earth minerals, and it concerns him.
“There’s no doubt about that,” Huls said. “But my understanding is there’s a tremendous amount of those minerals that are in the tailings of the mines that were in Butte and Anaconda where that processing took place.
“And if we could get our critical minerals from those places, that would be much better, and it would probably improve the landscape over there instead of placing the mine at the headwaters of the Bitterroot River and potentially having an incident.”
An incident, he said, would be a matter of when, not if, and a question of severity of impacts, whether a truck full of minerals wrecking into the river or water pollution from washing tools.

Williams building on March 21, 2021. (Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)An Idaho legislative task force is preparing to propose a complete re-write of the state’s child custody code.
The Child Custody and Domestic Relations Task Force met Wednesday to discuss its legislative proposals compiled after hours of meetings with testimony from judges, attorneys, parents, social workers, advocates and others.

“It’s like we’re playing catch up from years and years and years of problems,” task force member Sen. Carl Bjerke, R-Coeur d’Alene, said Wednesday. 
Multiple proposals are expected to result from the task force, but the primary one will be an overhaul of Idaho Code Section 32-717, which involves custody in divorce actions. The potential changes include a baseline 50/50 joint custody presumption unless there is a “clear evidence of danger,” a requirement that children’s wishes be considered, added expirations on temporary protective orders unless a hearing is held, and new definitions. 
The exact draft bill proposal wasn’t available Wednesday. Co-Chair Rep. Heather Scott, R-Blanchard, said changes were still being made. 
There will also be a proposal to clarify that police must enforce violations of custody orders, and to require a wealthier parent to pay attorneys fees for the other parent in cases where there is a substantial resource imbalance. 
The proposed changes and a “white paper” report outlining the issues in the family court system discussed during the task force hearings were presented by Mila Wood, a volunteer who worked with the task force. 
Many of the proposed changes were included in a framework that task force members discussed in November. 
 Proposal focuses on parental rights, but adds child safety, domestic violence safeguards 

Wood said the proposed legislation would “significantly reduce erroneous deprivations of parental rights, improve due process compliance, and create statewide uniformity and custody cases.” 
She also said she worked with advocates of Kayden’s Law, which are a collection of laws to prioritize child safety in custody cases. Part of the law and the proposed legislative changes are meant to strengthen protections for both the parent and children in cases that involve domestic violence. 
The Kayden’s Law framework would prohibit unsupervised visits if the parent had a history of abuse or domestic violence, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
The bill would also add to domestic violence statutes a definition of “coercive control,” or a “pattern of domination including intimidation, isolation, monitoring, economic abuse, and psychological manipulation,” according to meeting materials provided Wednesday. 
Wood said a repeated issue brought up in hearings was that domestic violence was being framed in some court cases as “mutual conflict.” 
“I think that kind of speaks to training,” Wood said. “A lot of the domestic violence health agencies I spoke with just said that there really is a lack of training and understanding of what a domestic violence survivor goes through and how that might apply in the actions or reactions.”

 Proposed bill would add custody interference to kidnapping law 

A repeated complaint in testimony was, although the law related to child custody court orders resides in the criminal code, law enforcement often did not feel empowered to enforce a civil matter. 
Task force members on Wednesday discussed a proposal to add “child custody interference,” to the kidnapping code, while adding escalating penalties for multiple offenses. Wood said she is working with Rep. Bruce Skaug, R-Nampa, to finalize a draft of the bill. 
Child custody interference would include knowingly and unlawfully taking away, withholding, concealing or failing to return a minor child in violation of a court custody order. 
The proposed penalties include a $50 fine for the first offense and a $300 fine for a second offense that happens within 12 months of the first. A third offense within two years would be a misdemeanor crime, with a fine up to $1,000 and incarceration for up to two weekends in jail. 
The proposed bill would include exceptions for actions taken with “articulatable facts” that the child faced imminent physical harm or required urgent medical care. 
The proposal would also enumerate law enforcement’s duties in these cases, including accepting, documenting and filing reports when a criminal complaint is made and to conduct an immediate welfare check on the child. 
 Lawmakers plan to workshop legislation ahead of 2026 session 

The task force cannot pass legislation, but it may present recommendations for fellow lawmakers to consider during the legislative session. Legislative Services Office bill drafters are expected to give members the updated proposal early next week.

Scott and co-Chair Sen. Tammy Nichols, R-Middleton, told the Sun that the task force won’t meet again but the hope is that members will look at the ideas and decide to bring proposed legislation themselves during the session, which begins Jan. 12. 
Scott said Wednesday that she and other lawmakers have repeatedly heard complaints about the judges presiding over family court cases. The courts have constitutionally protected separation of power from the Legislature to enforce laws. Scott said she wanted to focus on what was in the lawmakers’ purview. 
“I’m hearing, ‘you need to get rid of the judges.’ ‘The judges need this.’ ‘The judges need that,’” Scott said. “How can we expect to look at our judges honestly, and say they’re not doing a good job or they are, if we are not clear in our law?”

“Plastic is everywhere — wrapped around our food, stitched into our clothes, even coursing through our veins.” That’s how Judith Enck begins her new book, “The Problem with Plastic: How We Can Save Ourselves and our Planet Before It’s Too Late,” co-authored with Adam Mohoney. 
A former regional administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency, Enck warns that plastics are a toxic industry that are poisoning people and the environment. Plastic production has gone from two million tons per year in 1950, to 450 million tons per year today. 
The plastics industry has spent millions selling the material as safe and sustainable, but only 6% of plastic is recycled. Plastic recycling is a “false solution,” Enck said. “Plastic recycling has never worked. Never will work.” 
The plastics industry has “spent millions of dollars advertising, telling us, ‘don’t worry about all the plastic you’re generating,’ just toss it in your recycling bin. That is deceptive, and it is so deceptive that the Attorney General of California Rob Bonta sued the nation’s largest maker of plastic, the little mom and pop company known as Exxon Mobil, for deceptive claims around plastics recycling and chemical recycling.”
Plastic never breaks down. It breaks up into smaller microplastics, circulating in the environment for centuries, said Enck. “16,000 different chemicals are used to make plastic, and the chemicals will sometimes hitchhike on the microplastics. So we’re having the physical presence of microplastics in our bodies, but also the presence of chemicals that are used to make plastic, including PFAS chemicals, lead, mercury, formaldehyde.” Microplastics have been found in lungs, testicles, blood, breast milk and semen. They are associated with a rise in reproductive cancers, cardiovascular disease and diabetes, among other ailments.
The plastics industry has deployed an army of lobbyists to beat back attempts to limit the use of plastics. As an example, Enck cites New York’s effort this year to consider “a comprehensive packaging reduction bill that will reduce all single use packaging by 30% over 12 years.”
“This was the most lobbied bill in the 2026 legislative session in nearby Albany,” said Enck, noting that “there were 106 registered lobbyists against this bill, and 24 in support. I have never seen so many special interest lobbyists wandering the halls of the State Capitol in Albany, including the final night of the legislative session, where they killed the bill on the assembly floor after it passed in the State Senate.”
That experience has led Enck to conclude that “reducing plastic in our bodies, in our environment, in Lake Champlain, in the ocean, is more of a political science issue than a science issue. We have enough science to act.”
Judith Enck was appointed EPA regional administrator by former President Barack Obama and she has served as New York’s deputy secretary for the environment. She is now a professor at Bennington College and the founder and president of Beyond Plastics, a group that works to eliminate plastic pollution.

(Photo by yanguolin/iStock Getty Images Plus)Local governments in Iowa should pause the use of automated license plate readers, civil rights advocates said Wednesday, arguing the devices infringe on the privacy of drivers who have not violated any laws.
Researchers and technical and legal experts released a report Wednesday on automated license plate readers, or ALPRs. They said contracts made across the state between communities and the companies that provide the tools have created a “patchwork” network across the state where people’s data is tracked and saved for potential use by unknown parties.
Members of the ACLU of Iowa and University of Iowa Technology Law Clinic said Wednesday during a media conference they recommend that municipalities, counties and other community governing groups get out of their contracts for the cameras if possible and stand up to companies trying to gather data on residents’ travel habits. The ACLU of Iowa retained the technology law clinic to conduct the study, according to the report.

Pete McRoberts, policy director at the ACLU of Iowa, said the research team received varying responses from the 48 communities it contacted. Many provided information but others refused to state how many cameras they operate and where. Some claimed information that is disproven by their own contracts, he said.
“The patchwork of responses to this is really a good eye-opener as far as how problematic these contracts are,” McRoberts said.
Surveillance before a crime is committed
Unlike speed cameras or those placed at stoplights to catch drivers running a red light, automated license plate readers “capture and read license plates on all passing vehicles, so not just people that they suspect of violating a law,” ACLU of Iowa Legal Director Rita Bettis Austen said.
These pictures can provide a snapshot of where someone is at a given time, she said, with the devices recording date, time and location alongside license plate numbers.
Austen said the ACLU of Iowa “has been engaged in education and policy advocacy” related to ALPRs for just over a decade, but adoption of the technology, and its capabilities, has grown exponentially over the past couple of years. This has caused significant privacy and civil rights concerns for the organization, she said, as well as among Iowans.
“ALPRs are being placed along roadways throughout Iowa, and they’re taking thousands of snapshots of all of the license plates that are going by of all of the vehicles, and then that information can be fed into a network of nationally shared databases that are being maintained by these private vendors who contract with local governments to put these cameras up and access the data,” Austen said.
One in 10 of those captures will be incorrect in some way, Austen said, as the camera systems have been found to have a 10% error rate. The report provided examples from between 2009 and this year of drivers, some with family members in the car, being detained by police after an ALPR flagged their vehicle as stolen after misreading the license plate.
Examples of misuse of the camera systems and the databases where information is stored were also listed in the report. In one incident, according to the report, Sioux City police officers were using racist phrases to search ALPR databases. According to the report, the phrase used to search was “Traveling Romanian Theft Group.”
Austen acknowledged “non-objectionable potential uses of ALPRs,” such as checking license plates against lists of stolen cars, tracking license plates associated with AMBER alerts and collecting tolls, but said the lack of state regulation as to how this technology can be utilized is leaving the privacy of Iowans vulnerable.
ALPRs create network of surveillance
Flock Safety is the largest provider of ALPRs in the state, Austen said, and the report stated that the company’s systems hold more than 20 billion readings — an ever-growing number. She added the company’s business model “encourages” communities it works with to let their data go into a national database system in order for those communities to be able to “access the data that’s coming from other communities.”
UI Technology Law Clinic Director Megan Graham said during the media conference that ALPRs are “widely used in Iowa, and there is a substantial network of surveillance of this kind across the state.”
The team found 19 “transparency portals” with ALPR information from Iowa agencies contracted with Flock, Graham said, and between Nov. 8 and Dec. 7 of this year, the cameras in those agencies completed more than 4.2 million vehicle detections, with more than 90,000 detections per camera. There were 13 “hot lists” per 1,000 vehicles, she said.
Each group that uses the technology has control over how widely their data is shared and who has access to it internally, and their policies as to what is public information can be different from place to place.
“Iowans’ privacy is affected by these policies, and because of the policy differences, the policy shifts and changes as Iowans drive from place to place around the state,” Graham said.
Report encourages education 
Graham pointed out that while law enforcement and government agencies are using this technology, so are homeowners’ associations and private businesses. Flock Safety states on its website that private customers are unable to access law enforcement data but can share their data with police if they choose, and the company does not sell data — the customers are the ones who decide with whom to share data, and generally information in the company’s system is deleted after 30 days.
In Iowa, Austen said there is no state code requiring residents to be notified about ALPRs, and no state or local rules the team could find required a warrant to use the ALPR databases.
Of the nearly 50 communities the team reached out to about ALPR usage, Austen said the police departments in Des Moines and Clinton and the sheriff’s offices in Fayette, Fremont and Mills counties did not respond to inquiries by the report’s publication.
Des Moines police have “identified responsive records but have not shared them yet,” Graham said, and the Mills County Sheriff’s Office stated they couldn’t complete the team’s request due to staffing issues, but the sheriff’s offices of Fayette and Fremont counties have not responded at all.
Nearly every agency contacted by the team didn’t provide everything they requested, Graham said, mostly because they said they didn’t have the sought-after information, but there were some cases where agencies would refuse to provide information on where cameras are located or how many incorrect flags they get from the system.
“I do think that it’s ironic that our interest in trying to get access to these public records is to ensure the privacy of Iowans, and in comparison, the police that are withholding these record records are saying that they want to do so to ensure the privacy of surveillance technology,” Austen said. “So they want to watch us. They want to be able to do so in secrecy, and this is fundamentally at odds with our democracy and the way that most Americans want to live our lives.”
McRoberts said this variance in responses to records requests is a “good example” of how local governments are either unequipped or unwilling to deal with the consequences of their contracts relating to the violation of residents’ privacy. He cited a situation in which a “high ranking city official” denied that they were feeding data to their ALPR’s larger system when “it’s explicit that the contract gives a worldwide nonexclusive license for any of that data that’s collected.”
Calling the contracts “largely one-sided,” McRoberts said municipalities need to have their attorneys analyze them and recognize that they can try and protect their citizens’ privacy. If agencies are already contracted with a vendor, he added, they should try “to return to protecting individual privacy by using any legal means to get out of those contracts.”
Iowa lawmakers “have been very interested in finding out facts” about ALPRs and how cities are using them, McRoberts said, and the ACLU of Iowa is recommending to them that the state should “press pause on” the camera systems until the Iowa Legislature can figure out a potential “comprehensive fix on privacy.”
With laws already in place directing law enforcement to have a warrant for GPS tracking devices and other areas of technology surveillance, Austen said questions need to be asked whether law enforcement is using ALPRs in a way that “safeguards” against risks, if it’s appropriate for these agencies to have regulatory power over the technology and data and whether “broader, uniform minimum protections” should be in place for Iowans.
“That’s why the value of this report is an educational tool for the general public, for policymakers, to include city council members and state legislators,” McRoberts said. “This is a good day for openness and for transparency.”

Andy Beshear speaks to a crowd. (Provided by Office of the Governor)FRANKFORT — In the middle of his second and final term as Kentucky governor, Democrat Andy Beshear says he’s focused on helping Kentuckians keep the American Dream within reach. 
Beshear, 48, who will lead the red state through 2027, has spent much of the year pushing back against Republicans at the federal level, particularly when it comes to health care and food assistance jeopardized by the Trump administration.
As for what’s ahead, Beshear, who’s talked about as a presidential contender, recently became the head of the Democratic Governors Association, which will support candidates in 2026 elections and put the governor in a key position to influence national Democratic politics. 
Beshear has joined multiple lawsuits by Democratic state officials against the administration since Republican Donald Trump returned to the White House. In a Wednesday afternoon interview with the Lantern, he vowed to keep challenging the president. 
Beshear pointed to AmeriCorps funding being restored in Kentucky as an example of what Democrats can accomplish. AmeriCorps is a public service and volunteerism program that works with communities on housing, hunger, disaster relief and more.
“I sued on that. We won, but only the states that went to court got that funding,” Beshear said. “So, blue states or states with Democratic governors have AmeriCorps and Republican states do not, so we’re going to continue to stand up for our people.”
However, Beshear hopes “standing up for Kentuckians is bipartisan.” He referred to calls from Republican state lawmakers earlier this year for him to fill a funding gap in meals for seniors. His administration ended up re-allocating $9.1 million to support the program in October. 
“You know, I heard a lot of Republican senators push really hard on senior meals, saying, ‘Listen, people should have enough to eat. No one in my community should starve,’ but I didn’t hear one of them speak out when Donald Trump said he wasn’t going to pay SNAP benefits during the shutdown,” Beshear said. “Either you believe that people shouldn’t go hungry or you don’t. It shouldn’t be political.”
Beshear echoed comments he’s publicly made before, such as criticizing Trump for being the first president to not pay SNAP benefits during a government shutdown. The governor was also critical of threats by the Trump administration to block food assistance for states led by Democrats that have not complied with requests to provide personal information of SNAP recipients. 
“I promise to protect that data,” Beshear said. “I’ve gone to court once to protect it. I’ll do it again.”
What’s next? 
Beshear is seen by some as a 2028 presidential candidate given his repeated electability in red state Kentucky. However, he is “trying to live in the here and now,” adding that he will be governor until Dec. 14, 2027, and he doesn’t want to “waste a single minute or a single moment.” 
The governor also believes the next two years will be “complicated by federal policy … hurting our American families,” such as tariffs, rising costs and the GOP One Big Beautiful Bill Act (which Beshear called the “Big Ugly Bill”) that could put rural hospitals nationwide at risk. 
As leader of he Democratic Governors Association, Beshear said he’s “got 36 races to think about in 2026 before thinking about anything past it.” The association helps candidates across the country. 
But some Kentucky Democrats have suggested that Beshear enter the 2026 race for Kentucky’s open U.S. Senate seat. Longtime Republican U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell announced earlier this year that he would not seek reelection. Candidates — both Republican and Democratic — have lined up to launch campaigns to replace McConnell in office. 
Beshear doesn’t want to join them. 
“My parents always taught me never to interview for a job that you don’t want. At the end of the day, it’s just not something that I’m interested in,” Beshear said. “I’ve loved my time being governor. I wouldn’t give up one year of being governor for a six-year term in the U.S. Senate, and I like getting things done. Voting on the rule to the amendment to the continuing resolution — it just isn’t how I want to spend my days, and so if that means eventually going back into the private sector, I’m at peace with that. Getting to serve as governor for eight years is pretty special.”
He does believe that Democrats will be in good shape when it comes time for him to leave office, Beshear said. He sees a “big shift across the country,” and that “the Republican Party has turned its back on our American families” when it comes to affordability issues. 
Democrats have “a chance to be the party that reignites and refuels the American dream that focuses on families’ everyday concerns,” such as working hard to afford needs like groceries but also still being able to take family vacations and enjoying time together, the governor added.
“Part of the American Dream is that affordability,” he said. 
Final budget session
Next month, Kentucky lawmakers will return to Frankfort for the 2026 legislative session. It will also be the last time Beshear can make proposals for the next two-year state budget. 
Throughout Beshear’s time as governor, Republicans have held supermajorities in the state House and Senate, making it difficult for Beshear’s agenda to get through the General Assembly and all GOP legislation is veto-proof. 
Nevertheless, Beshear said his final budget proposal would include “investments in our Kentucky families” in areas such as job creation, health care and public education. He will unveil his recommendations at the annual State of the Commonwealth address the first week of January. 
“I don’t want to give away too much of what we’re going to be talking about, but to me it’s going to be centered on the fact that while we are doing better in Kentucky right now, life has gotten harder for many, if not most American families, and for government to work, we’ve got to be supporting that American Dream, where if you work hard and you play by the rules, that you can get ahead,” Beshear said. 
Beshear has taken steps to highlight one particular proposal he’ll put before the legislature — his Pre-K for All initiative. In June, he established an advisory committee of education officials, former Democratic and Republican state lawmakers and workforce development leaders to explore support among Kentuckians for universal pre-K programs. 
The group later announced its recommendations, including that Kentucky should phase expanded access to pre-K over several years. 
Asked if he had concerns about Pre-K for All becoming partisan in the Republican-controlled legislature, Beshear quipped he did not know “how four-year-olds can be partisan” as they can’t vote, “so if it becomes partisan, it is because someone made it partisan.”
Beshear said he’s approached the idea differently by going to rank-and-file Democrats and Republicans, particularly those in education policy.
He also said the proposal has changed since he first introduced the idea earlier this year after getting feedback from Kentuckians, including lawmakers. 
“This is going to be the people’s proposal,” Beshear continued. “And so if leadership from the other side wants to create an us versus them, it’s going to be them versus the people of Kentucky and their plan. But I hope that doesn’t happen.”
Also looking ahead, Beshear said his upcoming State of the Commonwealth address may have answers for a coalition of advocacy groups that urged him earlier this week to halt utility disconnections in Kentucky until March amid an uncertain future for federal housing, heating and food assistance. The group’s request was to issue a moratorium through executive order like Beshear had in the beginning months of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the governor said that he was able to do so in 2020 because of the state of emergency and powers it gave him.
“But what I’d tell that group is, tune in to the State of the Commonwealth and the budget address, and they’ll see how much I believe in helping people and keeping that heat on,” Beshear said.
Power of a Kentucky governor
Beshear has frequently defended his authority as governor against pushes by Republicans in the General Assembly to limit his power. 
Earlier this year, Beshear’s office appeared before the Kentucky Supreme Court to argue against two Republican-backed state laws that shift appointment power of the governor to other constitutional officers, all of whom are currently Republicans. 
Asked if he has concerns about similar efforts to limit his power in the next legislative session, Beshear said Kentucky Republicans should be asked about their support for checks and balances, as Trump has repeatedly tried to expand his own executive powers at the federal level. 
“I think to be fair, if they’re going to attempt to increase legislative power and decrease executive power, they should be asked about the federal government where a president they support is trying to vastly increase executive power,” Beshear said. “So, either you believe in checks and balances, or you don’t.” 
Amid legislation on the table for 2026, Northern Kentucky Republican TJ Roberts is working on a bill that would require all Kentucky police agencies, including the Kentucky State Police, to enter federal agreements with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for immigration enforcement under the 287(g) Program.
Beshear, who has authority over KSP as governor, expressed concern about the proposal, saying that day-to-day officers do not have the training ICE officers have, which includes an “intense education in federal immigration enforcement and federal law.” Beshear also pointed to reports that ICE has attempted to recruit employees from law enforcement agencies with which they have such agreements.
“I think what that bill would be doing is creating an open season on trying to take our law enforcement officers away from the city they’re working for, away from the county they’re working for, away from the state that they’re working for, and leave us with fewer day-to-day law enforcement officers that are keeping us safe,” Beshear said. 
Beshear said the executive branch he heads is “critically important” as it is charged with administering law. 
“A signing of a bill or a piece of legislation doesn’t get to the end result on its own. It takes an executive branch that operates, and operates in many instances quickly, to try to get especially positive results for our people,” the governor said. “So, limiting an executive branch could also limit the effectiveness of legislation they want to pass.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54810002888_bb76ce3ab6_o-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-10 18:57:48.902986

Under Section 2812 of the Election Code, people who are not registered as members of the two major political parties cannot vote in partisan primaries.
The group, which also includes David Thornburgh, chairman of Ballot PA Action and son of former Gov. Dick Thornburg, argues the provision is unconstitutional. 
It violates the right “to cast an equally weighted vote” and to “have an equal opportunity to translate votes into representation,” enshrined in the Free and Equal Elections Clause of the state Constitution, the lawsuit claims.
“After 88 years of being treated as second-class Pennsylvania citizens, 1.4 million independent voters will finally get our day in court,” Thornburgh said in a statement.

The filing in Commonwealth Court follows an unsuccessful request to the state Supreme Court to exercise its power to hear extraordinarily important or sensitive matters without first being considered in lower courts. The high court rejected the group’s King’s Bench petition in August.
“Our current law disenfranchises independent voters,” said Shanin Specter of Kline & Specter, who represents the independent voters. “It is past time independent voters are given the same rights as Republican and Democratic voters.” 
In addition to Kline and Specter, the five petitions are represented by Faegre Drinker Biddle & Reath.
The new petition includes expert testimony citing Pennsylvania election data that shows how denying unaffiliated voters participation in primaries dilutes the power of their votes.
Carnegie Mellon University Department of Mathematics Professor Wesley Pegden analyzed election data between 2002 and 2020 for all state House and Senate races. He also looked at mayoral and school board elections in the counties where the petitioners live and major local elections for mayor and other executive roles across the state.
The analysis measured voter influence, which is the number of votes it would take to flip the outcome of an election. The smaller the margin, the more individual votes matter in a given race, Ballot PA Action said in a news release. 
“Since Democratic and Republican voters get to vote in two elections — both a primary and a general election — and independents are only allowed to vote in the general election, the partisan voter’s influence is greater when elections are contested,” the organization said.
Pegden found the median influence of Democratic and Republican voters in legislative elections from 2002 to 2020 was nearly double that of independent voters. The only time affiliated and unaffiliated voters have equal influence is when the primary and general elections for an office are uncontested. 
“In other words, the only elections in which independent voters have equal electoral influence to partisan voters is when no voters have any choice at all,” Ballot PA Action said. 
According to the Department of State, more than 1.4 million Pennsylvanians are registered to vote as unaffiliated or as members of a minor party. The Democratic and Republican parties have 3.8 million and 3.6 million registered voters, respectively, according to the most recent count Nov. 3.
Legislation intended to end the prohibition on independent or unaffiliated voters casting ballots in primaries has also fizzled in recent years.
Rep. Jared Solomon (D-Philadelphia) has a bill currently making its way through the state House that would allow unaffiliated voters to participate in either the Democratic or Republican primary, but wouldn’t allow third-party voters. The legislation passed the House State Government Committee in May.
Sen. Lisa Boscola (D-Northampton) introduced a bill to end closed primaries in 2023 but it did not advance beyond the Senate State Government Committee. Boscola said earlier this year she intends to reintroduce the bill.
Sources vary, but Pennsylvania is one of between nine and 11 states with closed primaries in which only voters registered as a Democrat or Republican may vote. 
Other states allow voters to cast primary ballots through a variety of systems — ranging from registering with a party at the polls to choosing which party’s ballot to vote on in the voting booth, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/VOTE-ART-NEW-2-1024x704.jpeg,,,2025-12-10 18:57:48.902986

(Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)Montana’s tourism economy is centered on the outdoors — and nowhere is that more obvious than its national parks and monuments.
But beginning in 2026, the days in which visitors are allowed into them for free is changing, according to a press release from the U.S. National Park Service.
On Wednesday, it was also announced that a public lands group had sued the Trump administration for removing a photograph of Montana’s Glacier National Park on an annual pass as it was swapped for a collage portrait of George Washington and Donald J. Trump.
The Trump administration pushed back saying that the Glacier Park photograph would be used on national park passes for non-U.S. citizens, while the more common resident passes would contain Washington and Trump.
The Department of the Interior eliminated almost all the free-pass days listed for 2025, only keeping one of the eight designated days, Veterans Day (Nov. 11).
Instead, the Department of the Interior said that the new round of days will be “resident-only patriotic fee-free days.”
The newest line-up of fee-free days include Trump’s birthday, June 14, which is also Flag Day. It also includes former President Theodore Roosevelt’s birthday on Oct. 27.
Another change will be an increased fee system for out-of-country tourists. The fee-free days will not apply to out-of-country visitors.
Interior Secretary Doug Burgum explained the changes in a press release:
“President Trump’s leadership always puts American families first,” Burgum said. “These policies ensure that U.S. taxpayers, who already support the National Park System, continue to enjoy affordable access, while international visitors contribute their fair share to maintaining and improving our parks for future generations.”

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island’s child welfare agency shared one item from its wishlist with the state’s properties board on Tuesday: taking ownership of the former campus of St. Mary’s Home for Children, the nonprofit that ran the psychiatric care campus which closed its doors in August 2024 after a year of scandals and accusations of chaos and abuse.
The Rhode Island Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF) formally relayed its hopes to acquire the seven-building campus in North Providence at a Tuesday morning meeting of the State Properties Committee. No vote or action was taken after the DCYF’s presentation, which was only intended to begin the discussion of a possible state purchase of the complex owned by the dissolving nonprofit. 
The state has a ceiling price of $1.5 million under a tentative purchase and sale agreement for the 8-acre site with St. Mary’s. But the cost of renovating buildings and environmental remediation work could require spending up to an estimated $25 million more.
“We need to purchase St. Mary’s and move forward with the legislature’s plan to care for our own children by creating their own psychiatric residential treatment facility for adolescent girls in our state,” DCYF Director Ashley Deckert told the state panel. “This treatment is designed to reintegrate them into the families and communities of Rhode Island.”
The proposal would open up approximately 16 beds for adolescent girls and make available the highest level of psychiatric care beneath a hospital stay. DCYF would find a new provider to run the revived facilities, which would consist of three buildings which satisfy the federal label of a psychiatric residential treatment facility (PRTF), a Medicaid-subsidized form of care. 
Medicaid has traditionally excluded coverage for residential psychiatric care of adults, unless an institution has 16 or fewer beds. The rule does not apply to youth, but according to one Congressional Research Service brief, revisions to Medicaid coverage over the years suggest that “Congress supported the use of smaller facilities rather than larger institutions” when it comes to psychiatric care, making 16 beds a norm for Medicaid-supported institutions. 
Medicaid funded all youth who stayed at any of St. Mary’s psychiatric residential treatment units as of April 2024, according to an email from a former DCYF spokesperson.    
Recent history
The road to St. Mary’s closure in August 2024 began with an explosive December 2023 report from the Office of the Child Advocate, the watchdog agency charged with overseeing DCYF. The investigation found incidents of staff burnout and neglect, frequent runaways, teen overdoses, and improper reporting of such incidents to state regulators. 
The Child Advocate did not spare DCYF, however, and argued the agency often worked in siloes when overseeing St. Mary’s, magnifying its blindspots. The agency’s structuring of provider contracts tended to encourage overzealous placement at St. Mary’s, even if it was not the best fit for a particular youth.
Still, the Child Advocate’s office warned in January 2024 that the state needed the capacity of St. Mary’s. As of Wednesday, the state still does: There are 19 adolescent girls in out-of-state behavioral health placements, DCYF spokesperson Barb Francella said in an email to Rhode Island Current.
The overall number of out-of-state placements is 70, but most are boys who would not be treated at St. Mary’s. Wednesday’s numbers showed that boys with developmental or medical disabilities, numbering 26 overall, comprised the largest share of out-of-state placements.
DCYF stopped placements at St. Mary’s in early 2024, and eventually removed all children from the home. With the closure of St. Mary’s, Rhode Island lost its only psychiatric residential treatment facility. 
The lack of this particular brand of Medicaid-eligible facility has been a perennial problem for DCYF. In 2022, an open solicitation for new PRTF vendors attracted no viable bids. In a memo that year, DCYF asked the state purchasing department to waive the bid process and continue working with St. Mary’s as its only option, citing an “immediate and critical need” for these services for adolescent girls.
According to DCYF’s Tuesday presentation, the Fruit Hill Avenue complex is already outfitted to be a psychiatric residential treatment facility, offers necessary school, recreational and residential facilities not available elsewhere,” and represents the “best use of taxpayer money” for the state’s needed capacity.
Maintaining a psychiatric residential treatment facility within the state is not only a capacity issue for DCYF, but a way to satisfy its legal obligation. 
Per a consent decree with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced in December 2024, Rhode Island needs to broaden its options for kids with severe psychiatric issues — an order informed by the DOJ’s observance that DCYF had been “warehousing” kids in psychiatric hospitals for far too long because they had no other place to go. 
“A PRTF is necessary to fulfill our obligations under the federal Consent Decree,” read the DCYF presentation from Tuesday.
The consent decree, finalized in January 2025, does not specifically mandate a psychiatric residential treatment facility. A May 2025 report from the court-appointed monitor of the decree, however, noted that Rhode Island needs to build out its residential care options, and noted that the state lacks any PRTF capacity.

‘This transaction is pretty unique’
DCYF seeks to purchase the entirety of the two parcels of land that comprise the St. Mary’s Fruit Hill Avenue campus, but it would only immediately renovate three buildings for use. Two buildings would be used for residences and another would serve as an educational and recreational space, both of which are required to be designated as a psychiatric residential treatment facility.
“That’s a little different than what the committee normally sees,” committee member Rebecca Weber said of the $1.5 million cap.
Lisa Martinelli, the executive legal counsel for DCYF’s parent agency, the Executive Office of Health and Human Services, told the properties committee in her opening remarks, “From the legal standpoint, this transaction is pretty unique.”
The uniqueness derives from the deal’s price calculation, which is pegged to the costs associated with St. Mary’s dissolution. The nonprofit’s board has “agreed to a discounted purchase price which equals the remaining amount for St. Mary’s to dissolve,” Martinelli said.
Attorney Stephen Del Sesto, who represents St. Mary’s Board of Directors, told the properties panel that private developers had offered as much as $5 million for the property. The board declined those offers in favor of a potential state purchase which would continue the campus’ original purpose of serving youth.
Another nuance in the ownership switch-up involves leftover charitable donations given to St. Mary’s over the years. Del Sesto didn’t have a specific amount, but told the properties committee “it’s a significant amount of money.” 
If the state acquires the campus, Del Sesto said the “easiest way” to deal with eligible funds might be to transfer them to the state. The funds would not be part of the purchase price, he added, but could be transferred to the state with Attorney General approval under a doctrine known as cy-prés: The moving of funds intended for one purpose to the next most similar purpose.
“I mean, essentially it is an offset,” Martinelli said of the possible bonus funds. 
While Martinelli told the panel that there is no deadline attached to the sale, she cautioned that at least some haste would be prudent. That’s because the defunct campus will continue to generate expenses — fees which will ultimately influence the state’s final purchase price. 
“The longer this is delayed, the more expensive it is to the state,” Martinelli said.
Del Sesto said St. Mary’s has a similar perspective: “We have limited cash to maintain this space, which is why we needed to close…I can’t speak to any timing issues for the state, but the St. Mary’s has been in this dissolution mode now for about 15 months, and…cash is becoming critical, and timing is becoming critical.”
The purchase price does not bundle in the other costs associated with the project, namely the $15 to $20 million expected in renovation costs. 
Karen Greco, a spokesperson for the Department of Administration, said in an email Wednesday that a copy of the purchase and sale agreement can be shared “once it is executed.”
The State Properties Committee will reconvene to discuss the potential deal at a future meeting.

Old fruit orchard a lingering concern for Fruit Hill soil
The St. Mary’s campus received state approval for a makeover in 2023, prior to the fallout. When the facilities closed, the time-sensitive pandemic subsidies intended for that project were eventually transferred to a different type of residential facility under construction, Martinelli explained Tuesday. That facility broke ground in Exeter last summer.
But in 2024, before construction on the St. Mary’s expansion could continue, discovery of the Fruit Hill Avenue campus’ soil toxicity paused the buildout. 
The soil issues rose afresh at Tuesday’s meeting and consumed a chunk of discussion time. The state’s capital projects staff had Michael Flynn, principal environmental scientist with Pare Corporation, on hand Tuesday to discuss findings past and present. The state enlisted the company in 2025 to further investigate, according to an email from Department of Administration spokesperson Greco. 
Flynn told the properties panel that soil tests found elevated levels of lead, perhaps from old buildings’ paint, and arsenic, in a wooded area once home to a fruit orchard. There were also polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the soil, a byproduct of combustion. 
An estimated $1 million to $5 million could be spent on remediating the problem areas, said Dane Kwiatkowski of the Division of Capital Asset Management & Maintenance.
Flynn noted the contaminants are mostly a concern where kids could come into long-term contact with bare soil, and don’t pose a danger to drinking water or indoor air.
“What we’re seeing primarily is this stuff is in grassy areas,” Flynn said. “It’s kind of bound up in the matrix. It’s not a particularly dusty site.”
“These levels that we’re having are high enough to be concerned about,” Flynn said of the arsenic. “You definitely want to do something about them.”

Underutilized?
One person with mixed feelings about the state’s proposed purchase of the campus is North Providence Mayor Charles Lombardi, who previously sat on St. Mary’s board. 
Lombardi said in a phone interview Wednesday that he had hoped the property could become housing or some other source of revenue for the town. 
“I’m looking at the square footage there, and I’m saying, ‘Oh, man, this is perfect for resources for the town,’” Lombardi said. 
Because the campus sits in a residential neighborhood, Lombardi said he would like to see some of the vacant property on the complex’s backend ceded to the town.
Still, he added, he won’t be “negative toward a facility for…treatment for the needy children.” He said he’s fine that the campus might continue to provide the services it offered for decades before its closure last year. 
“But again, the majority of the board feels that the best use at this point in time is to enter into an agreement with the state. And like I said, I’m not going to be the person to try to make a big deal of that,” Lombardi said.
But asked about the state counsel’s assertion that time is short, Lombardi said, “That’s an understatement.”
The campus has sat vacant for months and is patrolled by local police to deter trespassing.  
“I’m just wondering why it took the state so long to make their feelings known here,” Lombardi said. “They should have made a move to purchase this property maybe a good 10 months ago.”

At a U.S. House hearing on Wednesday, lawmakers weighed changing a landmark federal voter registration law, the 1993 National Voter Registration Act, or NVRA, which requires state motor vehicle agencies to offer residents the opportunity to register to vote. Some conservatives say the law makes it too difficult for states to keep their voter rolls up to date.
Since President Donald Trump took office, the U.S. Departments of Justice and Homeland Security have ramped up efforts to scoop up data on voters and pressure state officials to conduct more aggressive maintenance of their lists to ensure that everyone on the roll is eligible to vote.
Justice Department sues 6 more states for voter lists

Some Democrats and privacy advocates have raised concerns about how the Trump administration plans to use the information. The Justice Department has sued more than a dozen mostly Democratic states, seeking to force officials to turn over lists of registered voters.
While Republicans control Congress and the White House, any GOP-led measure likely would  face a Democratic filibuster in the Senate. And the chance of major voting legislation clearing Congress before the November 2026 midterm elections is minimal. 
But Wednesday’s hearing before the Committee on House Administration’s Subcommittee on Elections showed that at least some congressional Republicans are fully on board with the Trump administration’s efforts to inject the federal government into a process, voting roll maintenance, that has historically been left to the states. 
Other congressional election measures have stalled, however. The House in April passed a measure that would require voters to show proof of citizenship when registering, but the bill has stalled in the Senate. Trump attempted to impose a proof of citizenship requirement through an executive order that has been blocked in federal court.










Election officials benefit from clear and unambiguous laws, which will help them carry out their duties and ensure voter lists are accurate and up to date. 


– U.S. Rep. Laurel Lee, Florida Republican 


U.S. Rep. Laurel Lee, a Florida Republican who chairs the subcommittee, said the NVRA’s language on maintenance of state voter rolls should be more clear. The law requires states to have a general program of maintenance but leaves many of the specifics up to states.
“Election officials benefit from clear and unambiguous laws, which will help them carry out their duties and ensure voter lists are accurate and up to date,” Lee said at the hearing.
Options for data sharing
Michael Morley, a law professor and the faculty director of the Election Law Center at Florida State University, testified that the NVRA only allows states to remove voters due to changes in their circumstances, such as a felony conviction or death. The law doesn’t explicitly allow states to remove voters who should have never been registered in the first place, he said.
Morley urged lawmakers to amend the law to require states to try to identify voters “who are ineligible on any basis” — a change that could significantly expand the scope of voter removals.
“There are a variety of circumstances under which a person could be ineligible to vote,” Morley told lawmakers, such as a lack of citizenship or a move out of state.  
4 Republican states will help Homeland Security obtain driver’s license records

Morley also raised the prospect of Congress mandating that state election officials receive information from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s SAVE system, a powerful search tool originally built to check the immigration status of individuals applying for government benefits. The Trump administration has repurposed SAVE into a program to verify citizenship.
Homeland Security has been encouraging states to upload their voter rolls into SAVE, after the agency linked the program with Social Security data in May.
“This committee could look at the possibility of either requiring states to enter into agreements to receive information from the SAVE database, or potentially even other databases to the extent that there are other agencies that have information concerning citizenship that could be shared with states,” Morley said. 
Some Democratic state election officials oppose using SAVE, citing worries about whether residents’ personal data could be shared with other agencies. Unredacted voter rolls often contain driver’s license numbers and partial Social Security numbers.
Twelve state secretaries of state submitted a federal public comment on Dec. 1 sharply criticizing the SAVE rollout. The changes to SAVE “are likely to degrade, not enhance, State efforts to ensure free, fair, and secure elections,” they wrote.
“This is, again, part of a power grab pattern when it comes to control over our elections,” Minnesota Democratic Secretary of State Steve Simon told Stateline earlier this month.
Many Republican secretaries of state had called on the Trump administration to implement the changes to SAVE. A handful of GOP states also sued Homeland Security last year, alleging the Biden administration wasn’t doing enough to help states identify ineligible voters; those states — Florida, Indiana, Iowa and Ohio — settled with the Trump administration in late November.
“Accurate and up-to-date voter rolls are essential for safe, secure, transparent, and accessible elections,” Montana Republican Secretary of State Christi Jacobsen said in a November news release announcing that her state would soon use SAVE.
Worries about ‘overzealous’ purges
On Wednesday, Sophia Lin Lakin, director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Voting Rights Project, cautioned lawmakers against engaging in “overzealous” purges of voters. 
Homeland Security wants state driver’s license data for sweeping citizenship program

The current law, she testified at the U.S. House hearing, includes protections that guard against hasty removals of voters made in error. For example, the NVRA mandates a 90-day “quiet period” before federal elections that prevents election officials from systematically removing ineligible voters during that period.
“This prevents last-minute purges that leave voters to discover they’ve been removed and get back on the rolls in time to cast a ball that will count,” Lakin testified.
U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell of Alabama, the ranking Democrat on the subcommittee, said Americans too often have to jump over unnecessary barriers to cast their ballots. She said conspiracy theories and misinformation surrounding elections have spurred state-level legislation to make voting harder.
“The NVRA is a critical component to our federal voting legislation,” Sewell said, “and it provides vital access and protections to voters, as well as guardrails for election officials to conduct voter maintenance.”

Superintendent Bob Thibault said the agreement is “not an admission of wrongdoing in this case.”

The Windham Central Supervisory Union will pay a historic $250,000 in damages to two Black students who allegedly faced discrimination, under a settlement agreement signed last month.
The consolidated lawsuit had alleged that school authorities did “little or nothing” to deal with the complaints reported at the Leland & Gray Union Middle and High School in Townshend. As part of the settlement, the school district also agreed to centralize and improve its recordkeeping and implement training sessions to better handle hazing, harassment and bullying in school. 
It is the largest single settlement in the history of the Vermont Human Rights Commission, according to a press release Thursday.
“This settlement represents a significant step forward in our ongoing efforts to ensure that every student can learn and thrive in a safe and inclusive environment,” Big Hartman, executive director and general counsel of the Human Rights Commission, said in the release.
The commission received complaints and took up the cases involving harassment faced in school by two students of color. The lawsuits outline pervasive incidents of racial harassment including students calling a Black male student the N-word and “little brown banana” and a Black female student being teased and taunted and called “lesbian” due her sexual orientation.
The commission determined that both students were racially discriminated against in violation of the Vermont Fair Housing and Public Accommodations Act, according to the lawsuits filed in 2022 and 2024 in Vermont Superior Court.
Bob Thibault, superintendent of schools for WCSU, said the agreement is “a means of avoiding “protracted litigation with families” and “not an admission of wrongdoing in this case.” He noted the settlement money will come from the union’s insurer and not taxpayers.
“We are pleased to resolve the lawsuit on favorable terms given that it covers two students with two separate claims,” he wrote in an emailed statement Friday.  “The School is constantly working to improve and welcomes the additional training from HRC to supplement our own rigorous training on the prevention of harassment.”
A training program will be developed in partnership with the Human Rights Commission and Windham County NAACP to be implemented over the next three academic years, according to the settlement agreement signed last month.
“By investing in comprehensive training for supervisory union staff, we are committed to creating lasting change that will benefit students, families, and educators alike. Schools and administrators must understand the importance of addressing student discrimination and following the mandates of Title 16’s harassment complaint process,” Hartman said in the release.
Mary Gannon, an education consultant and vice president of the Windham County NAACP, said the settlement brings justice to the students and helps families pay for the expenses incurred due to ongoing harassment. But school leaders hiding behind settlements to avoid acknowledging the harm done is “absolutely preposterous,” she said.
“So no, you didn’t do the best you could and that’s been an issue at Leland & Gray for a very long time, as it is with other schools that we are talking with, some of which have cases in front of the Human Rights Commission,” Gannon said. “We have a lot of people in positions of leadership, mostly white men, who don’t have an understanding of what the cumulative impact is of something like this.”
Conflicts of interest and insurance companies, law firms and school boards protecting their own further hinder progress on hazing, harassment and bullying (HHB) cases, she said, adding that Vermont needs to better foster individual responsibility among educational leaders.
This settlement comes after the Agency of Education reestablished an HHB prevention advisory council this year to seek advice and recommendations to update current policies.
The state agency has created a new Safe and Healthy Schools Division, according to agency spokesperson Toren Ballard. It aims to help schools foster a safe, inclusive and culturally responsive environment for students, educators and staff. 
“This renewed focus is crucial in ensuring that instances such as those that occurred at Leland and Gray Middle School do not happen again,” Ballard said in a Monday email.

Persistent racial harassment
The lawsuits shared with VTDigger describe complaints from the parents of two Black students who faced multi-year harassment at the Leland & Gray Middle and High School in Townshend, a small Windham County town.
According to the first complaint, an unnamed minor identified as A.B., who attended the school from 2019 to 2022 and was the only Black student there, was subjected by students to “continuing unwelcome conduct, including verbal, written, visual, and physical conduct” and electronic communications based on his racial identity. 
Incidents outlined in the complaint included students calling him the N-word and “little brown banana” and described white basketball players mocking a kneeling pose used by professional athletes protesting police harassment during the Black Lives Matter movement.
Despite written or verbal accounts of the incidents he faced, authorities at the school and the district “failed to take prompt and appropriate remedial action” or follow their own policies for addressing student harassment, the complaint noted.
While he started school as a “personable, intelligent, curious student and athlete, eager and willing to make friends, and interested in participating in and learning at school with other children,” the “pervasive harassment” A.B. faced at Leland & Gray “substantially and adversely” affected his access to equal education there, according to the complaint. 
As a result, A.B. self-isolated, lost interest in attending school and participating in sports, refused to socialize with other students and cried when he came home from school.
Eventually, his parents transferred A.B. to private school and began mental health treatment for him in March 2022, “all at considerable expense,” to “protect their son from continued harassment, suffering, and denial of educational opportunities,” according to the lawsuit filed April 2024.

‘Little or nothing’ done
In the second complaint, a Black female student identified as D.B., faced “unwelcome conduct” from other students about her sexual orientation from 2020 to 2022. These included “verbal, written, visual, physical conduct, the use of epithets, stereotypes, slurs, comments, insults, derogatory remarks, gestures, threats, graffiti,” and the display or circulation of written or visual material, the complaint filed in May 2024 states.
Examples include a student threatening to “beat the fucking shit out of” D.B. because of D.B.’s sexual orientation. A dean handling complaints in school reportedly overheard the threat and emailed the parent to notify a student had spoken “in an unkind way” and would be disciplined. But nothing was done, according to the Human Rights Commission.
The complaint outlined other incidents in which D.B. was allegedly called “lesbian” by a student who took food from her tray at lunch, bit into it and threw it back on her tray, and another where students drew graffiti on the bathroom wall insinuating that D.B. and her best friend were lesbians.
“D.B. was thereafter repeatedly humiliated, even by students she did not know, including by being told “to shut the fuck up” or “to get her [ass] out of here,” according to the complaint.
The complaint noted that school and district authorities who were notified of the incidents “imposed little or no discipline” on the perpetrators for the harassment.
The parents withdrew D.B. from school in March 2022 “to protect their daughter from continued harassment, suffering, and denial of educational opportunities,” according to the complaint.
D.B. entered the school as a “personable, intelligent, and curious student, eager and willing to make friends,” but by the end of those two years her performance declined and she became “depressed and self-isolating,” lost interest in going to school, refused to socialize with other children and came home crying, the complaint stated. 
The complaints state the school and district “did little or nothing to satisfy the requirements” of its own policy to prevent harassment, “failed to take prompt remedial action” to stop the harassment, “failed to keep contemporaneous or accurate records” of the harassment the two students faced and as required by Vermont statute.
School discrimination cases in Vermont have surged in recent years, yet very few make it to the Vermont Human Rights Commission. Last December, the commission was forced to stop taking cases in a year that saw a record increase, due to a serious funding gap.The commission that enforces anti-discrimination and civil rights laws in Vermont has declined to investigate 45 cases in the current fiscal year and has requested three new positions for fiscal year 2027, according to Hartman. It is currently investigating 12 school discrimination complaints and has accepted two additional school cases that have not yet been initiated.
These are among 23 cases accepted by the commission this fiscal year. It has 70 open investigations and 14 cases under litigation currently.
Students push for reform
Last week, parents and students shared similar testimony of discrimination faced in other schools at a press conference announcing the next phase of Narratives for Change, a statewide campaign, at Essex Middle School. 
Alice Langbauer, a youth organizer for the Education Justice Coalition and a Colchester High School student, said they faced increased bullying after reporting harassment. Friends were afraid to speak up on their behalf because of potential retaliation from peers, they said, and school leaders did nothing to address the issue. 
“I’ve experienced bullying getting worse or more people joining in on the bullying after reporting,” said Langbauer, who called for the agency to include whistleblower protection in its hazing, harassment and bullying policy “because knowing that someone will report them makes a bully feel unsafe.”
Superintendent of Schools Amy Minor said she was sad to hear of it because addressing harassment and making sure students are heard is “a core priority” at the Colchester School District. When she hears about students feeling unheard or unsupported, she said she takes it as an opportunity to examine their systems and make improvements.
“Personally, I really want to make sure that every student feels safe, respected and supported in our schools,” she said Wednesday.
In Berkshire, a middle school student was urged to report sexually explicit comments from a classmate, but no action was taken when she was called a racial slur at school, said parent Caroline Elander. 
“I don’t feel like educators are given enough help,” she said in the release. “Right now the staff don’t know how to stop (bullies) from picking on other kids. There needs to be specific training to support staff to interrupt harm.”
Youth advocates outlined progress made in some areas, such as students in White River Valley School District creating a youth council to process cases of harassment and bullying. They demanded the state agency implement student-driven priorities — such as whistleblower protection, mandatory intervention and restorative justice — to address “the growing crisis” of harassment incidents across Vermont schools. 
“At its root, bullying and harassment is about power and abuses of power. Schools must use their power to intervene on behalf of those who are being harmed,” Alyssa Chen, co-coordinator of the Education Justice Coalition, said at the Dec. 3 press conference.
The concerns “underscore the need for proactive engagement that centers the lived experiences of students, educators, and caregivers,” Ballard, the Agency of Education spokesperson, said in an email, which is why Secretary of Education Zoie Saunders reestablished the Hazing, Harassment and Bullying Advisory Council this year.
“The Agency is listening, and we are deeply appreciative of the students, educators, and caregivers who have engaged in this process,” Ballard wrote. “The Agency looks forward to continuing to collectively work towards our shared goal of ensuring that every student in Vermont can learn and thrive in a safe and supportive setting where every member of the community is treated with respect.”

“​​Since I became governor, we have run budget surpluses, reduced the state’s legacy debt by more than 50%, and enacted record tax relief,” DeSantis said in a statement, hours after his Orlando budget rollout. “Today I announced the ‘Floridians First’ Budget, which will keep Florida on the course of fiscal responsibility and delivers on the priorities that have made Florida the greatest state in America.” 
His proposal would eliminate 354 vacant positions — 225 of which are county health roles — and launch novel testing of contaminants in food with a $5 million allocation toward Florida’s new MAHA Commission, co-chaired by First Lady Casey DeSantis and Lieutenant Gov. Jay Collins.
The commission emerged in September as a way for Florida to align with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy’s nationwide push to “make America healthy again” through targeting processed foods and chemicals, and questioning water fluoridation.
The governor proposed a bill, too, that would transfer land from University of South Florida’s Sarasota-Manatee campus to New College of Florida. DeSantis proposed last session that those Ringling Museum facilities be transferred to New College. 
The governor’s budget would expand the school guardian program, providing security to K-12 schools, colleges, and universities, with about $6 million to implement it. 
Another provision is aimed at an emerging battle between Florida officials and the Trump administration. DeSantis wants to allocate $6 million to the Florida Defense Support Commission and $1.5 million for the Defense Reinvestment Grant Program to counter the White House’s plan to explore for oil off the Florida Gulf coast.
“This investment is especially critical as Florida continues to advocate that leasing of oil and gas developments off Florida’s Gulf coast may negatively impact the Gulf Testing Range,” the governor’s office wrote in the budget proposal. 
The document referred to concerns that the military’s ability to train in the Panhandle would be severely hindered by oil rigs near their training areas. Florida has multiple military bases in Panama City and the Pensacola area.
One of the big items being sought by DeSantis is $1.56 billion targeted for teacher pay raises, nearly 15% more toward increases than last year. The governor emphasized that the stand-alone item for teacher pay can ensure that money appropriated from Tallahassee goes to the classroom and benefits students.
“The classroom, 90% of it is what teacher do you have standing in front of the classroom. That’s the most important thing,” DeSantis said.
Fiscal strength
DeSantis, who is term-limited from running for reelection, touted the state’s fiscal strength, noting that his proposed spending plan earmarks $118 million for the Budget Stabilization Fund, also known as the state’s “rainy day” fund. DeSantis has tripled the amount in the fund since first taking office. The fund could reach the constitutional limit of $5 billion next year if the Legislature approves.
“Our overall footprint from a government perspective is that we have the lowest number of state government workers per capita and we either are the lowest or the second-lowest in state spending per capita of all 50 states. So, the outcomes are superior to states that are spending 25, 50, 100 percent more per capita … ,” DeSantis said.
The 2026 regular legislative session begins Jan.13. Although the Legislature will consider thousands of bills during the 60-day session, there is just one they are required to pass: the General Appropriations Act, or the budget. If lawmakers are unable to pass a budget within that time, the Legislature can extend the session or call a special session.
Homestead property tax relief
DeSantis focused much of his energy on the proposed spending plan but also used the opportunity to push for property tax reductions for homestead properties in the coming session. DeSantis’ budget would set aside $300 million to “support ongoing property tax relief conversations.”
DeSantis called the issue “huge” and said he’d have more to say about it “going forward.”
“But we have an opportunity to give people relief on this. So, we’re going to be working, you know, I know there’s been a lot of great work that is being discussed, you know, I’ve been talking with some of the senators, but I know some House members are working on a lot of stuff. We got to be bold, we got to be strong, and we got to do something that’s going to have a meaningful difference in people’s lives and the lives of families. And, you know, otherwise, you know, it just ain’t gonna it ain’t gonna fly,” DeSantis said.
No money for social justice, net zero policies
DeSantis’s budget includes funding for 25 additional circuit and county court judges.
The governor’s budget bill would amend a 2023 statute that made it illegal for a governmental entity, the state group health insurance plan, or a state-contracted health care provider to spend state dollars on gender-affirming or -conforming care.
The bill would expand that law to ban all governmental entities from spending tax dollars on “efforts which advance, promote, entertain, or support fundamental considerations of social justice, including those focused on critical race theory; diversity, equity, and inclusion; or that otherwise defend the concept that mankind is inherently racist, sexist, or oppressive, whether consciously or unconsciously, solely by virtue of his or her race or sex.” 
DeSantis’s proposed budget bill would prevent governmental entities from spending funds to advance, promote, entertain, or support Net Zero policies, carbon taxes and assessments, and carbon emission trading programs, commonly known as cap-and-trade or cap-and-tax programs. The bill would amend statutes to say such  programs are “detrimental to the state’s energy security and economic interests. “
He’s also suggesting $693,455 — nearly identical to the current budget — for the State Board of Immigration, a commission created during the 2025 session to oversee Florida’s immigration laws and ensure statewide enforcement and compliance.
The governor’s budget would expand the school guardian program, providing security to K-12 schools, colleges, and universities and about $6 million to implement it.

Vermont has in recent years lost hundreds of homes to flood damage and subsequent property buyouts.

This story, by Report for America corps member Carly Berlin, was produced through a partnership between VTDigger and Vermont Public.
In the aftermath of three consecutive summers of damaging floods, state officials have awarded nearly $50 million in federal flood recovery grants. The lion’s share of the funding is going toward housing construction on higher ground.
“The majority of these funds are focused on housing projects that will create new units which are out of harm’s way for future storms and help replace units we’ve lost in recent years due to the severe weather events we’ve faced,” said Nate Formalarie, deputy commissioner of the Department of Housing and Community Development, at a Wednesday press conference.
Vermont has in recent years lost hundreds of homes to flood damage and subsequent property buyouts, in which the government pays owners of properties for their homes and turns lots into greenspace. Flood recovery grants are a form of long-term disaster aid that is appropriated by Congress. For communities around the country, these funds are a rare opportunity to use federal disaster recovery money to construct new homes where they didn’t exist before.
In Vermont, these funds, which are Community Development Block Grants for disaster recovery, are tied specifically to the July 2023 floods. The funding has been awarded to 25 projects concentrated primarily in Washington and Lamoille counties, two of the hardest hit areas in the state that year. 
The housing projects include the construction of a 31-unit apartment building in downtown Barre, the renovation of a vacant Vermont State University building in Johnson into housing and the conversion of an underutilized office building into apartments in Montpelier.
“These efforts represent recovery and stability,” said Angie Harbin, director of Downstreet Housing and Community Development, the primary affordable housing nonprofit in central Vermont, at the press conference. Her community development organization received $14.5 million of the federal grant funding.
State officials received over $120 million in applications for the funds from municipalities, developers and planning commissions, which was nearly twice the amount of money available.

One project left out of the mix was the high-profile redevelopment of Barre’s North End neighborhood, first pitched by Gov. Phil Scott, a native of Barre, soon after floodwaters devastated the area over two years ago.
Without these federal funds, the original vision for Barre’s North End is now on “life support,” said Barre City Manager Nicolas Storellicastro. City officials denied Federal Emergency Management Agency buyouts to many homeowners there because approving them would stipulate that nothing could be built on those lots in the future. Such a scenario would deplete the city’s housing stock and property tax rolls. Storellicastro had hoped these more flexible federal funds would be the key to fixing up the neighborhood.
“That one…you know, tugs at the heartstrings, because there’s people still living in that neighborhood who want a way out,” Storellicastro said. Barre City did receive funding to acquire land and build out infrastructure for a separate housing development as well as grants for widening a floodplain and planning future stormwater upgrades.
Formalarie said state officials prioritized projects that had other funding already lined up and were close to “shovel ready,” among other factors.
Other awards went to relocating a homeless shelter in Barre out of the flood zone, restoring a floodplain in Hardwick and replacing a bridge in Cabot to better accommodate rising waters.
State officials are accepting applications for another $14.4 million in federal recovery funding specifically for housing projects that needed a little more time to finalize their proposals, Formalerie said. Pre-applications are due by Jan. 12.

(Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)The number of Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainees held at an Estancia jail has decreased sharply since its contract with the federal government expired Oct. 31, according to newly released data.
The number of detainees dropped from a peak of up to 700 detainees in May to approximately 340 as of late November, according to data from the Deportation Data Project, run by a team of lawyers and academics who analyze ICE data they receive via public records requests. 
According to that data and interviews with people with regular access to the jail, the decline began on or shortly after Oct. 31, when an intergovernmental service agreement between ICE and Torrance County expired without explanation.
Torrance County immigration detention center continues operating without ICE contract

The contract’s expiration means ICE no longer pays roughly $2.5 million monthly to private contractor CoreCivic, Torrance County officials said during a County Commission meeting Wednesday in Estancia. Officials told Source New Mexico they are concerned about the potential economic implications for the county, which relies on the jail as a major employer and tax revenue source, if the population continues to decline and no contract extension is reached. 
While the expiration and subsequent detainee decline have no immediate financial implications for the county, County Manager Jordan Varela said he is keenly interested in what a new contract might say and what that could mean for the jail’s future. 
“The big financial obligation would be if the facility closed, because we lose that guaranteed revenue and, two, now we incur the expenses of having to transport our inmates miles away to other counties,” he said. 
Immigrant advocates, however, said they remain concerned that CoreCivic, the private company, no longer has any financial incentive or legal reason to provide adequate care at a facility they say already has a long history of substandard care. 
“Conditions there could continue to decline, and it’s alarming that hundreds of people are being held in New Mexico under no apparent authority,” Zoe Bowman, managing attorney at the New Mexico Immigrant Law Center, which has clients at the jail, told Source New Mexico. 
The expiration has renewed calls from advocates and U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-NM) that ICE immediately stop housing detainees in Torrance County. Standard operating procedures require that ICE remove all detainees and equipment absent a contract, and Heinrich has pressed ICE’s director to explain what legal authority it has to continue holding detainees. 
The decrease in population identified in the Deportation Data Project has continued into December, according to PJ Podesta, a senior program manager for Innovation Law Lab, which conducts weekly jail visits. His best estimate is that 250 ICE detainees are at the jail, based on conversations with detainees in different pods. 
NM advisers to US Civil Rights Commission call for closure of ICE detention facilities

The decline is “striking,” Bowman said, given that the number of ICE detainees is increasing or staying level at New Mexico’s other two ICE detention facilities in Milan and Chaparral, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearing House,  along with other facilities across the country amid President Donald Trump’s mass deportation push. 
“The Trump administration is doing absolutely everything they can to detain as many people as possible and fill ICE detention beds,” she said.
Podesta and Rogelio Bolufé, a Cuban immigrant detained at the facility who says he’s also witnessed the decline, told Source that they believe the reduction in population is because CoreCivic is not admitting new detainees, while ICE is transferring detainees out at the usual rate.
The detainees Podesta has been able to track from Estancia have mostly ended up at Camp East Montana, an ICE detention facility at Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas. 
Source New Mexico asked ICE and CoreCivic on Tuesday about whether a decrease has occurred and, if so, what the reason might be behind it, including whether the expired contract played a role. Source also asked what a decline in detainees could mean for the future of the facility. 
An ICE spokesperson did not respond to Source New Mexico’s request for comment. CoreCivic spokesperson Brian Todd did not address those questions in an emailed response to Source New Mexico, though he noted that the population “may fluctuate week to week” at the jail.

Thirteen Republicans joined all Democrats voting for the resolution. Maine’s Jared Golden, a Democrat, and Pennsylvania's Brian Fitzpatrick, a Republican, forced the vote by garnering enough signatures from lawmakers under a legislative move known as a discharge petition. The procedure allows rank-and-file members to compel the chamber to vote on measures that are not brought up by the leadership of the majority party, which is how bills typically reach the floor.Wednesday’s vote was to discharge the bill out of committee and bring it to the floor for a vote. A vote on the bill itself is expected Thursday. The discharge petition gained the 218 signatures needed from 213 Democrats and five Republicans: Fitzpatrick, Don Bacon of Nebraska, Rob Bresnahan of Pennsylvania, and Nick LaLota and Mike Lawler of New York. In March, Trump signed an executive order that banned collective bargaining agreements for federal agencies dealing with national security. Those agencies include the departments of Defense, Veteran Affairs, Homeland Security, State and Energy, along with the National Science Foundation, the U.S. Coast Guard, most entities within the Department of Justice and several pandemic response and refugee resettlement agencies within the Health and Human Services Department, among others. “Protecting America’s national security is a core constitutional duty, and President Trump refuses to let union obstruction interfere with his efforts to protect Americans and our national interests,” according to the executive order.Federal law enforcement and firefighters are exempt from the order.Bargaining agreements for federal employees are somewhat limited.

Without the record, which is part of an ICE database, Öztürk has been unable to do the research jobs that she and her attorneys say would help advance her career.

A federal judge in Boston has ordered the Trump administration to restore a record the government previously wiped so that Rümeysa Öztürk, the Turkish student who was detained in Vermont and other states by immigration agents earlier this year, can take on paid research jobs as part of her studies.
The Tufts University Ph.D. student was first arrested in March by masked federal agents on a street in Somerville, Massachusetts. She was whisked north and held overnight at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in St. Albans, before being transferred via Patrick Leahy Burlington International Airport to an ICE detention center in Louisiana. The federal government has not charged Öztürk with a crime related to its case against her.
ICE officials have said they took Öztürk to Vermont because it was the closest facility they had available to detain her at the time. Her lawyers have contended, however, that the move was an effort to muddy the waters over which state her detention could be legally challenged in.

ICE held Öztürk in Louisiana for 45 days until a Vermont federal judge ordered her release on bail.
Just hours after the government arrested Öztürk in March, it also terminated her record in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System, or SEVIS, according to court records. ICE uses the system to track international students who live in the U.S.
According to court filings, without that record, Öztürk has been unable to participate in a paid research assistantship under her academic advisor that both she, and the advisor, say would be a substantial benefit to her studies and her career. Öztürk is studying child development and the impact of media on children’s well-being.
On Monday, U.S. District Court Judge Denise J. Casper granted Öztürk’s request for a preliminary injunction ordering the government to restore her SEVIS record. In Casper’s decision, the judge determined Öztürk would face “irreparable harm” from a continued inability to take on new research opportunities, including financial losses.
The Trump administration had argued in court filings that a federal district court judge had no authority to weigh in on its decision to terminate Öztürk’s SEVIS record.
Öztürk, in a statement provided by the American Civil Liberties Union, which has been part of the legal team representing her in court, said she was grateful for the court’s decision though felt “a great deal of grief for all the educational rights I have been arbitrarily denied as a scholar and a woman in my final year of doctoral studies.”
“Nonetheless,” she added, “this decision gives me hope, and I earnestly hope that no one else experiences the injustices I have suffered.”
Öztürk appears to have been targeted by the Trump administration for an op-ed she co-wrote in Tufts’ student newspaper that criticized the school’s response to Israel’s war in Gaza. The Trump administration has said it arrested her in Somerville following a decision to revoke her student visa, though her attorneys say she got no notice of that decision until after being taken into custody. The government has not challenged her lawyers’ assertion that she was targeted in the first place over the newspaper article.
Öztürk has since been challenging the legal merits of her arrest and her subsequent detention in federal court, in large part on grounds that it violated the First Amendment. In May, a federal judge in Burlington ruled that Öztürk should not be kept in custody while that legal challenge is being considered, so she was released. The judge found that Öztürk’s right to free speech was being chilled by her ongoing detention and that ICE was not giving her adequate care for her asthma while detaining her.
At the same time, because her visa was revoked, Öztürk is facing the possibility of being deported. She is challenging those removal proceedings, but that is taking place in the federal immigration court system, which is separate from the U.S. district courts where judges are considering her challenge to the legal merits of her detention.

(Kyle Dunphey/Utah News Dispatch)Top Republican lawmakers critical of the Salt Lake City Police Department under its former chief demanded the city come down harder on crime and homelessness last year. 
Now, with arrests up, stepped-up enforcement on camping and overall crime sticking to a downward trend, some said Tuesday they’re satisfied with the department’s direction under new police Chief Brian Redd.

House Speaker Mike Schultz praised Redd’s “great work” and Mayor Erin Mendenhall’s “true leadership.” Nonetheless, Schultz and other members of an audit committee turned their attention to the rearview mirror Tuesday, reviewing findings of an inquiry that blames ex-chief Mike Brown’s leadership for past problems in the state’s largest municipal police force. 
The panel, co-chaired by Schultz and Senate President Stuart Adams, deemed the review a priority in a November 2024 meeting, roughly a month before they called on Mendenhall to “restore public confidence, security and safety” to Utah’s capital city.  
Will the Utah Legislature follow SLC mayor’s plan for public safety, homelessness?

The mayor responded by releasing a wide-ranging plan, and Brown announced less than a month later that he intended to retire.
The legislative audit released Tuesday pointed to poor culture and morale that auditors said stemmed from Brown’s “poor leadership.” But Brown, who led the department for 10 years before stepping down in February, called it a “political attack” that “functioned as a vehicle to present a manufactured partisan indictment, not a fair and independent inquiry.”
Brown said in an emailed statement Tuesday that legislative auditors didn’t get in touch with him or ask him to respond to their findings. 
“That deliberate omission is more revealing than any conclusion they have tried to represent as objective,” Brown said.
The auditors wrote that “the previous chief’s inability to make decisions empowered civilian risk-management advisors to effectively lead the department.” They said oversight and planning weren’t priorities, officers were sometimes paid for hours they didn’t work, and administrative leave was “misused.”

Brown defended his record as chief, saying his leadership delivered “innovative policing strategies, stronger community engagement, and safer streets. Those results are still being felt across the city today and carrying it forward.” 
Mayor Erin Mendenhall and Chief Brian Redd said they’re working closely together on the department’s new vision. They said funding from the Legislature has contributed to pay raises that have helped recruit and retain officers. 
“We’re going to keep working hand in glove as we undo the challenges that this department faced over the years, and the audit has helped provide great clarity for us,” Mendenhall said. 
Redd said his department is staffed “at full strength” and crime has ticked down this year, but with a rise in violent crime he said is driven by cases of rape and sexual assault he believes are being reported by people as they’re booked into jail. 
He said officers paid for hours not worked were disciplined before he started the job in March 2025 and the police department’s changing how officers report their hours, with a new system starting in the first quarter of 2026. 
House Minority Leader Angela Romero, D-Salt Lake City, told the mayor and police chief that “with you leading, I fully trust we’re going to get to where we need to.” Romero noted that apart from her part-time job as a lawmaker, she’s also an employee of the city. 
House Majority Leader Casey Snider, R-Paradise, added, “you have stepped up and it is noticeable.”

Tim Walz on Wednesday urged U.S. Secretary of Homeland Secretary Kristi Noem to review all recent arrests in Minnesota after reports that at least two U.S. citizens were detained this week in the Trump administration’s mass deportation campaign.
On Tuesday, a man alleged that federal immigration officers chased him on foot in Minneapolis’ Cedar-Riverside neighborhood, tackled him and arrested him even though he’s a U.S. citizen, the Sahan Journal reported. Mubashir, who declined to share his last name, said he offered to show officers his I.D. and said he was a citizen multiple times. The officers ignored him, Mubashir said.
A 55-year-old woman, who is a U.S. citizen, was also arrested in Minneapolis Tuesday after confronting Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers over the arrest of her neighbors, according to MPR News.
In his letter to Noem, Walz said the arrests raise concerns about the due process rights of U.S citizens.
“The forcefulness, lack of communication and unlawful practices displayed by your agents will not be tolerated in Minnesota,” Walz told Noem in his letter.
Walz urged the Homeland Security secretary to find out whether agents possessed a warrant authorizing search and seizure. Any federal agents who acted unlawfully should be placed on administrative leave, Walz wrote.
The Minnesota governor, who is seeking reelection to a third term next year, also asked that Noem clarify the legal standard for citizen observing law enforcement interactions, ensure ICE agents receive clear guidance about respecting the civil rights of U.S. citizens and to “reassess the broader ‘surge’ enforcement strategy.”
The Trump administration has ramped up the presence of federal agents in Minnesota in the past two weeks. It’s unclear how many people have been detained by ICE. DHS has identified 19 people arrested by agents who are allegedly in the U.S. illegally and have criminal records.
“Our state’s safety and community trust depend not only on effective law enforcement, but on justice, fairness and respect for civil liberties,” Walz said in his letter. “We cannot allow public trust to be further damaged by detaining citizens under unclear or questionable circumstances.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/08-Noem-MN-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-10 17:57:46.798173

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)The gender equity nonprofit Gender Justice sued Swift County and the Minnesota Department of Corrections Wednesday on behalf of a transgender teenage girl who was placed in a state-licensed group home that did not affirm her gender.
The lawsuit, filed in Ramsey County District Court, alleges that Swift County officials and the Minnesota Department of Corrections violated the Minnesota Human Rights Act and the Equal Protection clause of the Constitution by forcing the girl to stay in boys’ facilities, where she was subject to bullying and harassment on the basis of her gender identity. 
The Minnesota Human Rights Act protects Minnesotans from discrimination on the basis of race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, gender — including gender identity — in employment, housing, education, public benefits and more. The Department of Corrections and its Commissioner Paul Schnell are defendants in the lawsuit because the department licensed the group home in question. 
When the child, who is identified only by the initials S.R. in the lawsuit, entered foster care in 2020 at the age of 12, she told her mother she did not want to stay in a boys’ home because she was a transgender girl. The mother then requested that her child be placed in an LGBTQ-friendly home.
The lawsuit alleges that Swift County instead placed her in a group home that assigned children sleeping arrangements and activities based on biological sex rather than gender. 
Boys in the home called the child slurs and harassed her by repeatedly asking her questions about her genitals, according to the complaint. When the child and her mother requested an alternative placement, their request was denied. 
“Transgender youth in Minnesota have the right to safe and affirming care, including in the foster care system,” said Sara Jane Baldwin, senior staff attorney at Gender Justice, in a press release. “When a foster care facility discriminates against a child and the agencies overseeing it fail to act, that’s a violation of the law and a betrayal of public trust.”
LGBTQ youth are over-represented in the child welfare system, accounting for approximately 20% of foster youth nationwide, according to a report by the Minnesota Department of Human Services. The report found that LGBTQ youth are twice as likely as non-LGBTQ children to report mistreatment in out-of-home care. 
The complaint notes that after the girl returned to her mother’s custody in June 2021, the child’s therapist reported that her “aggressive behaviors probably occurred due to a placement in a facility that was not set up for transgender youth.”
A spokesperson for the Minnesota Department of Corrections said the department does not comment on ongoing litigation.

Bob Ferguson signed a statewide emergency declaration on Wednesday.
Ferguson said he’d also seek an expedited emergency declaration from the federal government in response to the flooding, which is the result of an atmospheric river that has dumped multiple inches of rain in parts of the state since Monday. 
A National Weather Service forecast for Wednesday morning through Thursday afternoon showed 6 to 8 inches of rain in communities on the western edge of the Cascades, like Concrete, Gold Bar and Darrington. Even more rain was forecast at higher elevations.
“Lives will be at stake in the coming days,” Ferguson said, urging people to follow evacuation orders. 
Ferguson also activated the Washington National Guard through Dec. 31. Adjutant General Gent Welsh said there’d be 100 National Guard members deployed immediately and more than 300 by the end of the day tomorrow, including aviators and rescue specialists.
National Guard members will be positioned tonight near Skagit County, according to Karina Shagren, a spokesperson for the Washington Military Department.
Robert Ezelle, director of the Washington Military Department’s Emergency Management Division, emphasized the deluge was “far from done” and warned that next week could bring more wet weather.
Rivers from around the Canadian border down to southwest Washington are at moderate to major flood stage, with water levels expected to remain high through the end of the week. Officials expect a number of rivers to reach or exceed record flood levels.
A chief concern is the Skagit River, where Ezelle said current flood levels are expected to surpass a 1990 record by about 4 feet upriver.
County officials are preparing to evacuate about 75,000 people from low-lying areas in that region, according to Ezelle.
He said levees on the Skagit and other rivers could be overtopped, as well as a floodwall in Arlington.
The emergency declaration will give the state the chance to seek federal funds in response to the flooding. Ferguson described the federal declaration as critical and said it would help to unlock potentially life-saving resources for the state.
A slew of major routes and local roads are experiencing closures.
A 50-mile stretch of Highway 2 is closed between Index and Coles Corner, west of Leavenworth, due to heavy rain causing slides and flooding of the highway. As of 2 p.m., state transportation officials had no estimate on when the major east-west route would reopen.

The unsolved murder case of Manchester resident Sarah Hunter nearly four decades ago finally came to a close Tuesday.
The longtime suspect David A. Morrison pleaded guilty Tuesday afternoon to first-degree murder in Bennington County Criminal Court and was sentenced to life in prison without parole. 
Earlier that morning, Morrison pleaded guilty in Berkshire Superior Court to a kidnapping in Massachusetts over 40 years ago and was sentenced to two to four years in prison, according to a joint press release from the Berkshire County State’s Attorney’s Office and the Bennington County State’s Attorney’s Office. 
Morrison had been serving a life sentence with the possibility of parole in California for kidnapping with a firearm, sexual assault and robbery, according to the press release. 
Morrison, 65, will serve out a life sentence without parole in Vermont, concurrent with the  sentences in Massachusetts and California. Morrison was transferred and booked at Southern State Correctional Facility in Springfield Tuesday, according to the Vermont Department of Corrections offender locator. 
“The guilty pleas entered by Mr. Morrison to these terrible crimes, including the abduction, sexual assault and murder of Vermont resident Sarah Hunter, bring a long-awaited resolution to cases whose impact continues to resonate through families and communities to this day,” said Maj. John-Paul Schmidt, commander of the Vermont State Police Criminal Division, according to the joint press release.

In September 1986, Hunter, a 32-year-old local golf pro at the time, was kidnapped and murdered, and her body was found in Danby. Morrison admitted to taking Hunter by force after she visited a gas station in Manchester. Morrison placed her in the trunk of his car bound and gagged and stabbed scissors into her ear, killing her, according to court documents. 
Morrison faced charges for Hunter’s murder over a decade ago, but the case was dismissed after a discrepancy over where key evidence was located. Morrison pleaded not guilty at the time but told police earlier in a jailhouse interview he would address Hunter’s murder when he “felt it was time,” and that he thought he would not “take this to my grave.” 
At the Berkshire Superior Court in Massachusetts, Morrison pleaded guilty Tuesday morning to kidnapping Laura Sheriden in 1981. A 15-year-old at the time, Sheriden was hitchhiking and received a ride from Morrison. After Morission passed her house and pulled out a gun, Sheriden fought Morrison and escaped the kidnapping, according to the press release. 
Bennington County State’s Attorney Erica Marthage said at a Wednesday press conference that the cooperation between law enforcement and state officials in Vermont, California and Massachusetts was crucial in coming to a complex interstate agreement and finding resolution in these cases. 
Jared Bianchi, Bennington County Deputy State’s Attorney, said in an interview that the three-state requisition agreement required review by attorneys in each state and a signature by the Governors of each of the three states, including Gov. Phil Scott. 
Marthage gave special thanks to Detective Sergeant Samuel Truex, who was the original investigator of Hunter’s murder case and came out of retirement to aid its resolution 39 years later. 
Morrison’s indictment in Massachusetts was the missing “chess piece” to closing the cases, Marthage added. 
“I think it was just all those pieces and that collaboration and setting aside all of our individual agendas and getting this done,” Marthage said. 
At the press conference, Sheriden said she admired the people dedicated to finding resolution for her and Hunter’s cases and the sense of “finality” it brought to the Hunter family. 
Wilmington’s Haystack Golf Course has previously hosted golf tournaments named and held in Hunter’s honor, and “in recognition of the career she could have and should have had had David Morrison not crossed her path,” Sheriden said. 
“Yesterday, when I kind of fully processed what this meant for Sarah Hunter, that was really tough,” Sheriden said. “I know she lives on through her family.”

(Photo by Kyle Joly/National Park Service)A population decline is continuing in one of North America’s biggest caribou herds, threatening hunting opportunities for rural residents who depend on the animals for food.
The Western Arctic Caribou Herd, which ranges in Northwest Alaska, is down to 121,000 animals, according to the most recent census by state biologists and their partners.
It is the lowest population since the 1970s, continuing a slide since 2003, when the herd peaked at 490,000 animals. In 2023, the last time a population survey was completed, the herd was down to 152,000 animals. 
Alex Hansen, a Kotzebue-based wildlife biologist for the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, presented the population numbers on Tuesday to the Western Arctic Caribou Herd Working Group.
“So, no end in sight at this point. Certainly, some concerns we all have, and not sure where this is going,” Hansen told the group at a meeting in Anchorage. “But hopefully, we can get through it together.”
The likely response, he said, will be additional hunting restrictions.
The Western Arctic Caribou Herd Working Group, which began its three-day annual meeting on Tuesday, will consider making recommendations for such restrictions.
The group is made up of subsistence users, hunting guides, conservationists and others with interest in the herd, and advises state and federal management regulators. As the herd has declined, state and federal agencies have imposed hunting restrictions, based in part on recommendations made by the working group.
Hansen said biologists calculate that the population, at its current size, will likely support a hunt of about 5,800 animals, far below the general goal of up to 20,000 animals.
While calf birth rates and survival rates are adequate, the herd’s problem comes down to survival rates for adult caribou, especially for adult female caribou, he said.
“We’re seeing that we’re not getting the survival rates that we need to keep this population going and growing as we continue to decline. If we expect to see growth, we probably want to see that survival rate of 85% or higher,” he said. Instead, the survival rate is believed to be 79%, he said.

	Refraining from hunting females will be key to preserving the herd, he said.
“If we want to continue to drive this population further into decline, harvesting cows is the way to do it,” he said. “If we want to avoid that, removing cow harvest is one of the few things we can do to accomplish this.”
Charlie Lean, a working group member from Nome, said he sees evidence of the decline.
“it’s pretty grim,” Lean said. “From Nome, from my viewpoint, the caribou were very hard to find. They’re not coming as far on the Seward Peninsula as they used to.”
But hunting limits can cause hardships in the Indigenous villages where residents depend on the hunts for subsistence.
Mary Hugo, a working group member from Anaktuvuk Pass, said she understands the gravity of the problem and the desire to prevent hunting of females.
However, male caribou do not migrate in the area around her non-coastal North Slope village, she said. That makes it difficult for her to sign onto any possible recommendation that hunting of females cease, she said.
“We’re still hunting what goes around, and it’s just females. So it’s hard for me to have an opinion about something that I feel so personal about, because I hunt for my family, and that’s basically saying that I can’t hunt for my kids,” she said, her voice breaking. “So for us to hunt females, it’s not what we want to do, but if we have no choice, we will.”
It is unclear whether the Western Arctic herd is again the biggest in Alaska.
In recent years, that distinction belonged to the Porcupine Caribou Herd, which has a range that straddles the Alaska-Canada border. The Porcupine herd hit an all-time high of 218,000 in the last population census, completed in 2017.
That made it one of the few tundra caribou herds in the Arctic that was not declining during the past two decades.
However, release of new population census is pending, and there are now signs of decline in that herd as well.
Arctic-wide, tundra caribou herd populations have declined by about two thirds over the past two to three decades, according to last year’s Arctic Report Card issued by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Applying a new policy update Bluesky also implemented in Australia, the decentralized social media platform said it would allow legal adults in Mississippi to access its app, while keeping the service unavailable for minors. Bluesky made the change after altering its “Age Assurance system,” despite its ongoing concerns over a 2024 Mississippi state law that requires users of websites and other digital services to verify their age.
“We continue to believe that Mississippi law limits free speech and disproportionately harms smaller platforms,” the company said in a statement. “As a result, we will not follow the law’s requirements to track children’s online conduct in detail, and we will not devote our limited resources to build the verification systems, parental consent workflows, and compliance infrastructure the law requires. However, because we have the technical means to offer a choice for older users, we want to let them decide for themselves if they are comfortable confirming that they are at least 18 years old.”
In August, Bluesky announced that it would go dark in Mississippi after the U.S. Supreme Court declined to block a Mississippi age-verification law, which the company said limits free expression, invades people’s privacy and unfairly targets smaller social media companies.
Bluesky grew after the 2024 presidential election. Many users of X, which is owned by Elon Musk, retreated from the platform in response to the billionaire’s strong support of President Donald Trump.
Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch, a Republican whose office defended the law, told the justices that age verification could help protect young people from “sexual abuse, trafficking, physical violence, sextortion and more,” activities that the First Amendment does not protect.
The age verification law added Mississippi to a list of Republican-led states where similar legal challenges are playing out.
NetChoice is challenging laws passed in Mississippi and other states that require social media users to verify their ages, and asked the Supreme Court to keep the measure on hold while a lawsuit plays out.
That came after a federal judge prevented the 2024 law from taking effect. But a three-judge panel of the 5th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals ruled in July that the law could be enforced while the lawsuit proceeds.
On Aug. 14, the Supreme Court rejected an emergency appeal from a tech industry group representing major platforms such as Facebook, X and YouTube.

Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham), right.Direct punches have been few and far between on the Democratic Party side of the 2026 U.S. Senate nomination fight, but that changed Wednesday when two of the race’s heavy hitters – Mallory McMorrow and Haley Stevens – threw their respective gloves to the ground.
It was a sign of life for a primary battle that is expected to be politically bloody – and expensive – and could be a harbinger of gut punches to come.
This week, McMorrow (D-Royal Oak) celebrated the passage of a 10-year Michigan economic development plan that she championed alongside state Sen. John Damoose (R-Harbor Springs). McMorrow’s bill would assess the diverse needs of the state by region, including those regions’ challenges with infrastructure, transportation, housing and other amenities needed for economic growth. Development strategies would be hammered out from those region-based assessments.
On Wednesday, Stevens (D-Birmingham), a current member of Congress, introduced articles of impeachment against U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Her announcement followed a September comment in which Stevens said she planned to file an impeachment resolution against Kennedy for a host of reasons. U.S. Rep. Shri Thanedar (D-Detroit) last week issued similar articles of impeachment against U.S. Department of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.

For the most part, both McMorrow, Stevens and Abdul El-Sayed, the progressive in the race also seeking the nomination, have stayed in their lanes and saved their punches for Republican former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers of White Lake, who at present is the frontrunner in the GOP side of the contest, including a coveted endorsement from President Donald Trump.
McMorrow, however, saw an opportunity to pounce on Stevens for what appeared to her campaign as pure “political theater” – referencing, of course, the new articles of impeachment against Kennedy.
“On Tuesday, McMorrow passed a raft of legislation to boost Michigan’s economy and keep money in Michiganders’ pockets.” the release said. “Notably, her decade-long economic development plan cleared the Michigan Senate with bipartisan support, earning praise from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. The legislation, co-sponsored with Republican Senator John Damoose, creates a holistic, region-by-region approach to economic growth that addresses infrastructure, housing, and community needs across the state.”
Field shaping up in Michigan’s contested U.S. Senate race

The release went on to quote McMorrow, who rallied around her work in the Senate. That included the economic plan, but also a bill preventing unemployment benefits clawbacks that would have cost almost 350,000 Michiganders thousands of dollars, despite their not having participated in any wrongdoing; a bill to broaden a program addressing blighted brownfields; legislation protecting against invasive bodily exams while under anesthesia; and a bill to safeguard domestic violence and stalking victims.
“Real economic growth requires vision and measurable metrics.” McMorrow said in a statement. “My legislation gets at the heart of what actually makes communities thrive – it sets out a clear, long-term roadmap to make sure every corner of our state has the tools and resources to succeed, not just today, but for generations to come.”
McMorrow’s campaign specifically contrasted that work against Stevens’ work in Congress.
“At the same time, Stevens, describing herself as a ‘serious lawmaker’ and ‘not one for political theater,’ filed impeachment articles that, according to the New York Times, ‘do not have the support of her party’s leaders and are all but certain to fail,’” McMorrow’s campaign said. “Even Stevens’ Democratic colleagues view the impeachment push as ‘the politically motivated move of a candidate who has struggled to gain traction in a heated primary,’ the Times reported.”
Decade-long, bipartisan Michigan economic development plan championed by McMorrow passes Senate

The campaign went on to say that McMorrow knows Kennedy has “no business being in power, but the way to stop his dangerous overreach is communicating everywhere and winning at the ballot box, not doomed resolutions and political stunts.”
Stevens’ campaign swung back hard.
“Haley’s job is to fight for Michigan and protect Michiganders’ health and safety,” Stevens campaign manager Sam Barrett said in a statement to Michigan Advance. “After months of working with doctors, scientists, and her colleagues in the House to fight back against Secretary Kennedy’s chaotic and reckless policies that put Michiganders’ lives at risk, Haley took the serious step of introducing articles of impeachment.”
Barrett said that Stevens, as someone who has been consistently named one of the most effective Democrats in the House, knows “it is her responsibility to stand up for Michiganders.”
Stevens, Peters rated most effective Democrats in technology, other key policy areas

“Anyone who thinks we should let RFK continue to wreak havoc on health care instead of using every tool available to hold him accountable is wrong,” Barrett said.
While striking, it wasn’t the first crack at the bat for a candidate against another in the Senate race. El-Sayed took a swipe at McMorrow after she took heat for her shifting stance on the Israeli war on Gaza and the ongoing genocide of the Palestinian people, which McMorrow has acknowledged is a genocide. El-Sayed has held that position since he launched his campaign.
At a November college Democrats event at Michigan State University, El-Sayed noted, with a few barbs, that the issue was something that separated him and McMorrow and especially Stevens, who has not acknowledged the situation in Gaza as a genocide but has called for an end to the war. Stevens is also a strong supporter of Israel and has been backed by pro-Israel political action committees.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_1182-1024x541.jpg,,,2025-12-10 17:57:46.798173

New guidance from the U.S. Department of Agriculture requires that certain groups of noncitizens who were recently denied food assistance in Vermont should regain eligibility, according to advocates. 
Among those who will regain access to benefits are green card holders who entered the country as refugees and asylees, as well as Afghan Special Immigrant Visa recipients, advocates said.
Advocates said Tuesday’s memo will require the state to restore eligibility to dozens of the more than 140 households statewide who have lost access to food benefits due to visa status in recent months, following the congressional passage of July’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

Molly Gray, who leads the Vermont Afghan Alliance and coordinates support for a number of Special Immigrant Visa holders, said Wednesday that the return of food assistance would be a huge relief to many “given the significant humanitarian impact this has had on our newest Vermonters.”
The federal clarification was long overdue, she and other advocates agreed. Meredith Owen Edwards, senior director of policy and advocacy at Refugee Council USA, called previous federal guidance “contradictory and confusing,” in an interview Wednesday.
Gray and others have maintained throughout the last several months that Vermont erroneously removed several groups from food assistance, while officials in Gov. Phil Scott’s administration said their decisions were informed by federal law and USDA guidance. The eligibility of Special Immigrant Visa holders — participants in a program supporting largely Afghan nationals who assisted the U.S. military during the war in their home country — was particularly contested.
The Department for Children and Families, which administers 3SquaresVT, did not respond to requests for comment.
In recent months, the groups affected by Tuesday’s memo were removed from 3SquaresVT, Vermont’s version of SNAP, unless they had been a lawful permanent resident for five years or longer. The new guidance states that these populations are eligible for SNAP as soon as they become lawful permanent residents, a status change marked with a green card.
Edwards welcomed the announcement, which she said should help enable affected groups “to actually meet their basic needs.”
Refugees and asylees can generally apply for a green card after one year — though Reuters recently reported that such requests had been frozen at the federal level — while Special Immigrant Visa holders become lawful permanent residents immediately on arrival.
Advocates said the timeline for reinstating benefits to the relevant households remained unclear Wednesday. Gray said her team had offered its services to help the state “reenroll eligible individuals as quickly as possible.”
The development comes after Vermont Attorney General Charity Clark joined a multistate lawsuit earlier this month seeking to force the Trump administration to clarify its policies and allow those groups to access the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.
Amelia Vath, a spokesperson for Clark, pointed to the fact that Tuesday’s guidance came hours before the Trump administration’s Wednesday response deadline in that suit.
“We believe this development is a direct result of the lawsuit,” Vath said in an emailed statement Wednesday. “While we see this as a positive step towards ensuring all those who are entitled to get SNAP benefits are able to get them, there may still (be) work to be done,” she added.

De’Jon Fox, 19, died as result of gunfire near Whitney M. Young Jr. Hall, a dormitory, according to a Frankfort Police Department press release. Police did not release the name of the second victim.
Charged with murder and assault in the first degree is Jacob Lee Bard, the parent of a KSU student and resident of Evansville, Indiana. He is being held at the Franklin County Regional Jail. 
KSU held a candlelight vigil in memory of Fox Wednesday afternoon at the dorm. 
The university had previously announced that it was cancelling “all classes, final exams, and campus activities for the remainder of the week” and that counseling resources would be made available to students, faculty and staff.
“The Kentucky State University community is deeply saddened by the tragic incident that occurred on our campus. Our thoughts and heartfelt condolences are with all who have been impacted,” said KSU President Koffi Akakpo in a statement. “We remain committed to supporting our students, faculty and staff during this difficult time and ensuring the safety and well-being of our campus community.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_0918-2-e1752102703655-1024x679.jpg,,,2025-12-10 17:57:46.798173

The U.S. Supreme Court Wednesday heard arguments in an Alabama death penalty case, in which the state is challenging lower court determinations that Joseph Clifton Smith, convicted of the 1997 murder of Durk Van Dam, is intellectually disabled and ineligible for the death penalty.  (Jane Norman/States Newsroom)The U.S. Supreme Court Wednesday heard arguments in an Alabama death penalty case in which the state is challenging multiple federal courts’ determinations that a death row inmate is intellectually disabled and ineligible for capital punishment.
The three liberal justices on the nation’s highest court questioned the attorneys from the Alabama Attorney General’s Office about what attorneys for the state called errors made by U.S. District Court Judge Callie V. S. Granade when she ruled in 2021 that Joseph Clifton Smith, convicted and sentenced to death for the 1997 murder of Durk Van Dam, had IQ scores that made him ineligible for the death penalty.
The state argues that Smith scored above 70 on IQ tests, one of several factors in Alabama’s administrative code used to determine intellectual disability. Robert Michael Overing, an attorney with the Alabama Attorney General’s Office who argued on behalf of the state, said both the lower court and the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals erred in their judgments.

“He didn’t come close to proving an IQ of 70 or below, with scores of 75, 74, 72, 78, and 74, but the lower courts changed the rules,” he said.
In its appeal to the nation’s highest court, attorneys for the Alabama Attorney General’s Office said that both the federal district court and the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals changed the standard and that, by the results of Smith’s IQ scores, he is not intellectually disabled.

Following oral arguments, Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall said Smith’s IQ scores indicate that he does not have an intellectual disability.
“The Eleventh Circuit’s approach would require states to ignore clear evidence to indulge hypotheticals designed to delay a convicted capital murderer from accountability after 27 years,” Marshall said in the news release. “The people of Alabama have the right to enforce the punishment chosen by their laws and juries, and our team has presented a strong case before the Justices to hold the line against criminals who have committed heinous murders.”
The federal district court focused on Smith’s lowest IQ scores and, along with the margin of error, ruled that his IQ could be below 70. The lower court also used other evidence for his daily life called adaptive functioning to declare that Smith had an intellectual disability.
The attorneys for Smith said that the lower courts judged the case correctly, citing Hall v. Florida, a 2014 U.S. Supreme Court case in which the court ruled that a strict IQ threshold for determining intellectual disabilities in executions was unconstitutional.
“I am holding all 12 reported cases on this issue post Hall in Alabama, and there is not a single case, including the two that my friend mentioned, in which the court said, ‘We are only going to look at the test scores, we are not going to consider the other evidence,’” said Seth P. Waxman, an attorney for Smith.
The more liberal justices expressed skepticism of Overing’s argument.
“What the district court did here was not only look at the IQ scores holistically, but also other evidence of adaptive functioning, and that is precisely what our case law says what the courts are supposed to do,” said Ketanji Brown Jackson, associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.
Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the case troubled her, because Alabama did not make the same argument throughout the appeals process but used the same standard that others have used in the past.
“You didn’t argue this below,” she said. “Your own expert did exactly what you say is wrong. Your expert said he (Smith) had valid scores between 72 and 78, and he relied on all the other indicia to determine that he believed this person was not intellectually disabled.”
Overing said courts have reviewed other cases in the same way but did not grant an exception based on intellectual disability based on the other evidence besides IQ scores.
“There is certainly not an Alabama case in which the courts used the lowest score alone and said that represents a possibility of intellectual deficits,” Overing said.
Waxman also said that Alabama statute follows the decision that the U.S. Supreme Court made that allows courts to look beyond just the IQ scores of defendants when deciding if they have an intellectual disability.
“That includes evidence of intellectual functioning other than IQ test scores at least where a court, considering expert testimony, concludes that those scores alone don’t decide the issue,” Waxman said.
Associate Justice Sam Alito said that the law could be interpreted another way, that it allows states to define whether someone has an intellectual disability without violating the Eighth Amendment — which bans cruel and unusual punishment — so long as they are doing it in a way that is not permitted.
“And so long as a state does not go below that floor, a state court does not go below that floor, there’s no Eighth Amendment violation,” he said. “And so long as a state does not go below that floor, a state court does not go below that floor, there’s no Eighth Amendment violation.”
Waxman did not directly answer the question before the justices moved on.

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – The Oklahoma Democratic Party is challenging what it says is a decision by the Oklahoma Election Board to close the party’s primaries.
The Oklahoma Election Board on Wednesday issued a press release saying no party notified the agency by deadline that it wanted to open its primaries.
As a result, all party primary elections will be closed to the over 487,900 registered independent voters in the upcoming elections.
The Oklahoma Democratic Party for a decade had opened its primaries to independents. 
It voted in June to continue the practice and notified the Oklahoma Election Board in August by sending the agency its minutes from the meeting, said Lauren Craig, Oklahoma Democratic Party executive director.
“In our mind, we had done all the appropriate steps,” Craig said.
The party said it did not learn of the decision to close its primaries until the press release, the party said.
“Oklahoma Democrats welcome independents in our elections,” said Erin Brewer, the state chair. “We value their voices in selecting our general election candidates. We are working with the State Election Board to correct this error and exploring legal counsel if necessary.”

Craig said it was a “miscommunication.”
“We were shocked to get this news,” Craig said.
Paul Ziriax, Oklahoma Election Board secretary, said state law “is very clear,” and “unambiguous.”
He said that although not required by law, he sent out a reminder on Oct. 30 and a follow up letter on Dec. 3.
He said the notice the Oklahoma Democratic Party sent the agency in August was about changing the party’s symbol on the ballot, not about open primaries.
Ziriax said he has never had a party fail to meet the deadline and was a little surprised by the party’s reaction.
He said it is regrettable if the party intended to notify the agency but failed to do so.
“It is a done deal,” Ziriax said.
Oklahoma is one of about a dozen states that has  a modified primary system.
To participate in a party’s primary or primary runoff election, a person must be a registered voter of that party, with an exception.
In every odd-numbered year between Nov. 1 and Nov. 30, recognized political parties can notify the State Election Board that they have opened their primaries to independents.
If a party notifies the agency, the deadline is extended to Dec. 15 for the other recognized parties to respond.
If notice is not provided, primaries remain closed, according to the Oklahoma Election Board.
Oklahoma has three recognized political parties, Democrat, Republican and Libertarian.
Recently, only Democrats have chosen to open their primaries to nonaffiliated voters.
The dispute over access also comes as supporters of open primaries are seeking to gather enough signatures to put the issue on the ballot in the form of State Question 836.
Jan. 26 is the deadline to submit the 172,993 signatures needed to get the constitutional amendment on the ballot, according to the Oklahoma Secretary of State.
State Question 836 proponent Tony Stobbe, a retired U.S. Coast Guard commander, said the dispute underscores the need for reform. He said he is not able to vote in an election that decides anything.
“It’s wrong that hundreds of thousands of taxpayers, including veterans like me, are shut out of the process,” he said.
The announcement from the Oklahoma Election Board “means it’s more important than ever that we give Oklahomans a chance to open our primaries and ensure all registered voters can participate in our elections,” Stobbe said.
As of Nov. 30, Oklahoma had nearly 2.4 million voters.
Of those, nearly 1.28 million were Republicans, 608,661 were Democrats, 487,927 were independents and 23,277 were Libertarians.

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Colorado health officials continue to recommend universal hepatitis B vaccinations for newborns after the Trump administration changed a policy that has been an accepted standard for more than 30 years. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted last week to move away from a recommendation that all newborns receive the hepatitis B vaccine, now recommending doses only for infants whose mothers test positive for the virus or whose status is unknown.
The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment next Wednesday will ask the Colorado Board of Health to incorporate vaccine recommendations from the 2025 American Academy of Pediatrics, which recommends universal hepatitis B birth doses, into its vaccine requirements for children in schools. The emergency rulemaking is necessary so that the switch to following the academy’s recommendations can take effect immediately, CDPHE spokesperson Hope Shuler said.

Colorado still requires children attending child care or school to receive the hepatitis B vaccine, and most insurance plans will continue to pay for the birth dose of the vaccine. 
The U.S. has seen a 99% reduction in pediatric hepatitis B infections since the birth dose was first recommended in 1991. Colorado saw only 23 cases of perinatal hepatitis B between 2001 and 2015, and the state has seen no confirmed cases since 2016, according to CDPHE.
“Colorado has spent decades building an effective system of maternal screening and universal birth dose vaccination that has nearly eliminated infant hepatitis B infections in our state,” Jill Hunsaker Ryan, executive director of CDPHE, said in a statement. “The evidence is strong, the science is clear, and the vaccine has an exceptional safety profile. We want providers and families to know that the hepatitis B birth dose remains safe, effective, and strongly recommended for all newborns.”










Colorado has spent decades building an effective system of maternal screening and universal birth dose vaccination that has nearly eliminated infant hepatitis B infections in our state.


– Jill Hunsaker Ryan, executive director of CDPHE


Dr. Ned Calonge, CDPHE’s chief medical officer, said the CDPHE wants providers to have all the information they need to explain to families the well-documented benefits of the vaccine. 
“We still strongly recommend it, it’s still available, and it’s still paid for,” Calonge said. “We would like to just remind parents that nothing has changed around the evidence. It has a great effectiveness and benefit and no significant downsides, so nothing really should change in terms of the acceptability, or parents obtaining this dose for their newborns.” 
The 30 years of evidence showing the safety and efficacy of the hepatitis B vaccine speaks for itself, Calonge said, particularly its effectiveness in Colorado. He said parents should understand that the vaccine is still recommended by “every credible health care entity in our state and provider groups nationally.”
The risk of developing chronic hepatitis is much higher for newborns and children, Calonge said, which can lead to serious liver diseases including cirrhosis and liver cancer. 
Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has spent decades spreading misinformation and conspiracy theories about vaccines and other health issues, fired all 17 previous members of the ACIP and replaced them with a slate of hand-picked appointees, many of whom are seen as vaccine skeptics.
Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, said the state will continue to reinforce the importance of the birth dose and ensure families have “the best information” available on its effectiveness. 
“Colorado will continue to follow the science and strongly support the hepatitis B birth dose as a safe, simple, and effective protection for every newborn, even as ACIP creates confusion for families,” Polis said in a statement. 
In September, Hunsaker Ryan issued a public health order to allow Coloradans to have continued access to COVID-19 vaccinations after the Trump administration limited who was eligible.

Larry Rhoden awarded $1 million Wednesday from a fund he controls to help pay for two business parks in the hometown of a political opponent.
Rhoden announced the Future Fund award during an event on the campus of Northern State University in Aberdeen. The city is the business and population center of northeastern South Dakota, but it only has one vacant property available for large-scale business projects, according to a press release from Rhoden’s office.
“These business parks will help ensure that Aberdeen’s economy continues to grow and remain competitive,” Rhoden said in the press release.
The money will be added to $7 million raised by local leaders and private investors, the release says.
Aberdeen is the home of Toby Doeden, who owns businesses in the area and is seeking the Republican nomination for governor in next spring’s primary election. The other declared candidates for the nomination are Rhoden, U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson and state House Speaker Jon Hansen.
Doeden did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday’s Future Fund award. 
Noem’s uses of credit cards and an economic fund cause lawmakers to propose restrictions

The Future Fund is a pool of state money, funded by a tax on employers, over which the governor has exclusive control. State law says the money must be used for research or economic development. Earlier this year, Rhoden pledged $1.5 million from the fund to support the build-out of a diesel mechanic training program at the state penitentiary.
The fund has existed since 1987 but became controversial under Rhoden’s predecessor, Kristi Noem, whose uses of the fund included a fireworks show at Mount Rushmore, a Rapid City-area shooting range that legislators refused to fund, a Governor’s Cup rodeo in Sioux Falls, and a workforce recruitment campaign that Noem starred in.  
Lawmakers on a government oversight committee recently endorsed a draft bill for the 2026 legislative session that would take the ability to act as the fund’s sole manager away from the governor. The bill would require each Future Fund grant to be approved by a majority of the Board of Economic Development, which already has oversight of other economic development programs.
Shortly after the $1 million award announcement, the Governor’s Office of Economic Development sent a news release saying that the office’s Board of Economic Development had voted to award a $500,000 grant to the city of Watertown “to support critical infrastructure expansion in the Calvin Industrial Park.” The grant is from the state’s Local Infrastructure Improvement Program.
“This investment reflects our commitment to keep South Dakota communities strong, safe, and free,” Rhoden said in that press release.
The Watertown money will help pay for sanitary sewer infrastructure at the industrial park.

Credit: FloridaRedistricting.govA pending ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court regarding the 1965 Voting Rights Act could trigger the Florida Legislature to conduct a mid-decade congressional redistricting effort, but it won’t require them to do so.
That was the opinion of Tallahassee election attorney Andy Bardos, who spoke Wednesday before a Florida House select committee charged with considering congressional redistricting, the second “educational and informative meeting” in the past week that did not allow public comment.
Denying that redistricting would have anything to do with partisan advantage, Gov. Ron DeSantis has maintained that Florida will be “forced to” redistrict once the high court rules in a case called Louisiana v. Callais, which could redefine Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act or declare it unconstitutional. The justices have twice heard the case and are expected to rule sometime before next July.
“In terms of binding effect, it has binding effect on Louisiana,” Bardos told lawmakers. “Whether Florida chooses after Callais to keep its maps in place, await either the next cycle, or await litigation, or redraw its districts, that will be a judgement call made when we see the Callais decision.”
Bardos and committee chairman Mike Redondo, R-Miami, confirmed during the hearing that if the Legislature does in fact redo the congressional map sometime next year, it would do so based on U.S. Census and voter information data that used previously when it did the decennial redistricting in 2022.
Court rulings
What has changed since then is the Florida Supreme Court’s ruling in July upholding the state’s 2022 congressional map, which had been legally challenged by voting rights groups such as Black Voters Matters after it was approved by the Legislature.
Those groups argued the map had violated the 2010 Fair Districts amendments when it redrew Congressional District 5. That seat stretched for more than 200 miles along the Florida-Georgia border to encompass Black populations in Florida’s old plantation belt from Gadsden to Duval counties.
One of those protections in the Fair Districts amendments prohibits lawmakers from drawing districts that “diminish [racial and language minorities’] ability to elect representatives of their choice.” The plaintiffs had argued that eliminating a district in which Black voters were electing their preferred candidate violated that provision.
The Florida Supreme Court ruled that the old District 5 seat was likely an illegal race-based gerrymander that failed to meet the equal-protection standards under the U.S. Constitution. “In the process of deciding that, the court articulated legal principles that had never before been set forth by a court in that way,” Bardos said.
The Fair District amendments also state that “no apportionment plan or individual district shall be drawn with the intent to favor or disfavor a political party or an incumbent,” which seemingly would contradict the stated goal of President Donald Trump, who said explicitly in July that he wanted Texas to create more House seats favorable to his party for the 2026 midterm elections. Gov. DeSantis said publicly weeks later that he thought Florida should do so, as well.
Bardos went on to tell Rep. Kevin Chambliss, D-Homestead, that the Florida Supreme Court ruling that the 2022 congressional map was constitutional “raises questions now about how does this articulation of additional principles effect other parts of the state which the court wasn’t focused on.”
This was the last meeting scheduled by the select committee until the 2026 legislative session begins on Jan. 13. However, both DeSantis and Senate President Ben Albritton have said they would prefer the Legislature wait to address the issue again in a special session after the U.S. Supreme Court weighs in on the Louisiana v. Callais — which, as Bardos said Wednesday, might not be for another six months.
No public comment allowed
Opponents of the proposed redistricting expressed outrage that the public wasn’t given time to speak during the hearing.
“The people of Florida deserve better than a rush job behind closed doors,” said Jessica Lowe-Minor, president of the League of Women Voters of Florida. “There’s no compelling reason to do redistricting at all right now, and it certainly shouldn’t be done when the public doesn’t have sufficient opportunities to engage and provide input.”
“When lawmakers show up in Tallahassee, they should be fighting for the hardworking people who sent them there,” added Amina Spahić, political director with Florida For All. “But, instead, we see them catering to the powerful interests and mega-donors who bankroll their campaigns.”
Noting that some of his constituents drove up from South Florida before learning that they would not be able to speak during Wednesday’s hearing, Chambliss asked committee Chair Redondo if he could provide notice earlier if he planned to disallow public comment during future committee meetings.
Redondo responded that both hearings held so far involved only presentations, which he said typically do not allow for public comment. “When there’s some sort of legislative action being considered, that’s typically when we see public comment in normal meetings. But we’ll certainly try to notice the meetings as reasonably early as possible,” he said.
Republicans hold a 20-8 lead over Democrats in the state’s congressional delegation. Republican National Committee chairman and Sarasota-County state Sen. Joe Gruters reposted an analysis of the situation around the country on Tuesday.
That analysis predicts that Florida Republicans would gain five seats if and when they go through with redistricting and voters follow through as the GOP expects them to in November 2026.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Gov_Ryan.Newman.jpg,,,2025-12-10 16:57:28.161333

“Discussions about technology these days invariably lead to the topic of generative artificial intelligence, or GenAI,” Supreme Judicial Court Chief Justice Kimberly Budd said in her State of the Judiciary speech Tuesday. “My colleagues on the SJC and I recognize that GenAI offers enormous potential for streamlining many aspects of the work of attorneys and courts alike. At the same time, we also recognize that the use of GenAI raises many questions and concerns, especially at this relatively early stage in its development.”
Budd noted questions surrounding the reliability, confidentiality and cost of using GenAI in courtrooms. And while the courts are open to the technology, they are being “deliberative and thoughtful” about how to use it.
“On a more fundamental level, we must ensure that GenAI does not adversely impact judicial independence and undermine public confidence in the administration of justice,” Budd said.
She said the judiciary asked the court’s Standing Advisory Committee on the Rules of Professional Conduct to consider whether changes need to be made to state Rules of Professional Conduct to address attorneys’ use of GenAI. The committee did not recommend any changes, but that may change as the technology evolves.
Also, the Supreme Judicial Court issued interim guidelines for how judges and court personnel should use GenAI. Right now, GenAI is only used for administrative tasks, she said. Also, only public information can be used and the AI tools can not retain or use any information that is entered to train the programs. 
Budd said the guidelines are a “modest first step” but they are necessary and expected to be updated as the judiciary learns more about GenAI.
Also, she said the technology has the potential to help those who can’t afford lawyers. The Access to Justice Commission is studying ways to use GenAI to boost access to justice, while also limiting cost disparities.
Across the US, courts are adopting AI more slowly than the private sector, according to a May report from the Thomas Reuters Institute and the National Center for State Courts AI Policy Consortium for Law and Courts.
Of those surveyed, 34 percent said their courts have used a sort of GenAI or plan to do so in the next year. And many respondents expressed concerns about overreliance on technology and malicious use of AI, like falsely created evidence. At the same time, the respondents acknowledged AI can help boost efficiency and estimate the technology could save three hours every week in the next year.
“Whatever improvements new technologies, including artificial intelligence, may bring, I want to stress that our legal system is, and will remain, centered on human intelligence, understanding and judgment,” Budd said, adding judgement ultimately depends on those who work within the system.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/JusticeBudd2-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C656&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-10 16:57:28.161333

The deployment, which is reportedly expected this month, was first publicized by Seven Days.

Lt. Col. Meghan Smith, another guard spokesperson, said the Vermont Guard does not have the exact departure timeline. She referred all further questions to the Office of the U.S. Secretary of Defense, which referred questions back to the Vermont National Guard.  
Gov. Phil Scott has twice this year chosen not to deputize the Vermont National Guard for federal initiatives, first to help with clerical immigration enforcement work and later as part of President Donald Trump’s efforts to crack down on crime in Washington, D.C. 
But in this instance, Scott said at his weekly press conference Wednesday that the authorization did not require his approval. 
“It’s going to be under federal control. So everything, from my understanding, is coming out of either the National Guard or the Pentagon at this point,” Scott said of the deployment. He did not provide additional details on the upcoming mobilization. 
In the early days of the war in Ukraine, the Vermont Air National Guard deployed to Europe. At the time, officials said the mission was in support of NATO but not in direct response to the war. 
Earlier this year, the Vermont Air National Guard deployed on a scheduled rotation to Japan.
The Trump administration has recently deployed National Guard troops to American cities like Washington, D.C., and Memphis. The new use of troops on U.S. soil has drawn criticism from local leaders and received mixed reactions from the courts as lawsuits proceed on the legality of Trump’s orders. 
Reports from across the country detail the recent deployment of Air National Guard members to countries like Djibouti and Italy. 
Vermont’s Air National Guard utilizes F-35A fighter jets, which the Guard describes as the “most advanced and capable weapon system in the U.S. Air Force.” The 158th Fighter Wing has about 1,000 members.

Dec. 10, 2025. | Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance. Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Twp.) and House Appropriations Committee Chair Ann Bollin (R-Brighton Township) celebrated the committee’s vote along party lines on Wednesday afternoon to disapprove around $645 million in work project spending during a press conference held after the vote. 
The vote took place under a provision of the Management and Budget Act where either the House or Senate Appropriations Committee could vote to disapprove any of the newly requested work projects. The House committee did not hold any debate or testimony on the spending package prior to voting, which committee Democrats heavily criticized. 
“I look at this as a negotiation the way this process is set up,” Hall said. “It is my favorite law, the law that allows the House Appropriations Committee to unilaterally kill hundreds of millions of dollars of Democrat pork and waste, fraud and abuse.”
Asked if this move — which Hall said he believed had only been used once before, and committee Democrats said they believed had never been used — would increase political tensions in future budget years, Bollin responded, “It’s the law, we’re just following it.”
Bollin also pushed back against arguments that the process of deciding which work projects to reject was not transparent. 
“Everybody on the Appropriations Committee got a copy of the request, the recommended work projects,” she said. “They too had 30 days to be asking questions, recommending, having input. Certainly, I’ve always had an open door to do that.”
However, speaking to reporters immediately after the vote, Democratic members of the committee expressed their anger and frustration about the process and what they saw as a lack of transparency. 
“For this process to be laid out in a time frame where we were handed the document as soon as we gaveled in and we had no discussion, to even be able to ask questions of HFA [the House Fiscal Agency],” said Rep. Will Snyder (D-Muskegon) after the committee session, “This is the most untransparent and democratic process that I’ve ever seen and been a part of.”
“We were just handed this list. There are things like sexual assault kits on here, community colleges, human trafficking, public safety, survivor justice,” said Rep. Julie Rogers (D-Kalamazoo). “This is cutting projects that have already been approved.”

Hall specifically called out projects including those that pushed for climate infrastructure, a charter school transparency database and the Office of Global Michigan in the press conference. 
“Now the Democrats are trying to shove another $2.7 billion of slush fund money through this work project scheme, which is something that really has taken off under Governor Whitmer,” he said. 
Hall emphasized repeatedly that the projects that would have been funded by this spending package will now go through HEAT, the Hall Ethics, Accountability and Transparency plan, an earmark reform law that Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed into law in November. 
“I will caution you not everything that the Appropriations Committee cut was waste, fraud and abuse,” he said, adding that projects would be able to be re-reviewed under his ethics law and potentially receive more funding. “There are some valid things that were cut.” 
Hall also noted that the money disapproved in Wednesday’s vote will now go into the state’s general fund.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC_3333-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-10 17:57:46.798173

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)It’s easy these days, in the face of the dysfunction, grasping ambition and negativity that characterizes our politics, to lose sight of the value of true public servants. But there are still leaders out there who put service before self. People who are willing to make sacrifices of their time and their personal lives in order to make their community better.
Adrienne Jones is a leader like that. Maryland should take a beat to recognize her, and honor her work, in the wake of her decision to step down as speaker of the House of Delegates.
I served with Madame Speaker for all 12 years I was in the legislature, the last four as majority leader under her speakership. She, of course, served a lot longer than I did — next year will mark her 30th year as a delegate. Good leadership, though, isn’t about length of service. It’s not about titles either, or social media clicks or quotes in the press. Good leadership in elected office is a daily effort to do right by your constituents on matters large and small.
It’s responding to the everyday challenges people face and helping where you can, whether it’s getting a pothole filled on their neighborhood street or helping them get the unemployment benefits that will keep food on their table. It’s making the thousands of decisions that come across your desk while putting aside the noise and chaos of politics and the entreaties of special interests. It’s about staying focused on one core question, “What’s the right thing to do?” Not the politically expedient thing. Not the thing that will get you more campaign contributions or attention. The right thing.

I’ve seen Speaker Jones ask that question time after time. In all the years I’ve known her, I’ve never known her to make a decision for the wrong reasons. That was as true when she was a backbencher before my time as it was when she served in leadership under Speaker Michael Busch. And it was the cornerstone of her speakership.
It’s the question she asked for so many years as a member of the Appropriations Committee and as House chair on the capital budget. Her legacy is written in brick and mortar across the face of this state. In the schools and roads and parks she funded in those days
It’s embedded now in the character of the state’s spending decisions, which are fundamentally driven by the premise that the state should support communities that are struggling. That the enormous power of our state government to make investments should be wielded as a tool to make life better for regular people.
When she was speaker, it was the question she asked her staff and her leadership team as they were weighing tough decisions. And she guided the House so many times towards actions that have done right by Marylanders. Efforts to reduce inequality. To protect health care and reproductive rights. To give our children paths to a better future.
And she did it quietly, confidently. She isn’t the kind of elected official who tries to get her way by talking louder than others. She has never been the look-at-me type. It just isn’t her personality.
Her leadership has been the steady, calm, quiet sort; a reassuring style of leadership in normal times and an essential one when our national politics is more Thunderdome than Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.
When she took on the speakership, at a very difficult time for the House after Mike Busch’s untimely death, the press noted rightly the ground she broke. She was the first woman and the first African-American to hold that office. A tremendous historical milestone in the state that bequeathed to the world Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass.
But the significance of her speakership isn’t just in who she is, but in what she did. Her work, sometimes obscured by louder personalities, often underrecognized and even thankless, has made life better for every single one of us. She has done the right thing, so many times, over so many years. And for that, we should all be grateful to Madame Speaker.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2024_jan29_jones_enoughleg-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-10 16:57:28.161333

Vermont Gov. Phil Scott said Wednesday that he supported calls for the resignation of Eva Vekos, the embattled state’s attorney in Addison County. Meanwhile, Vekos was adamant Wednesday that she had no intention of stepping down. 
Calls from Scott and other top political leaders in the state come after VTDigger published a story on Monday in which sexual assault survivors criticized Vekos’ handling of their cases and described ethics complaints filed against her. 
Scott said he agreed with a statement issued shortly after on Monday by the chair of the Vermont Democratic Party, Lachlan Francis, that Vekos was “unfit to serve as State’s Attorney, and she should resign from her office immediately.” The statement cited VTDigger’s reporting.

“I do think that it’s time to make a change,” Scott, a Republican, said at a Wednesday press conference in Montpelier. The press conference was not specifically about Vekos or her conduct.
“I compliment the Democratic Party for moving forward,” the governor said. “It’s something that I think they feel strongly about — and I believe that there is some merit to that.” 
Vekos is in her first term as Addison County’s top prosecutor and ran for office in 2022 as a Democrat. Francis said if Vekos decides to seek reelection to another four-year term in 2026, the Democratic Party would not support her candidacy.
The governor’s comments also come after the Vermont Progressive Party called on Vekos to resign. The party said in a statement Wednedsay that “her complete and total lack of regard and respect for sexual violence victims cannot continue.”
“It is clear that Eva Vekos has failed morally, ethically, and legally to protect the sisters and daughters of Addison County, whom she took an oath to protect,” the Progressive Party said.
If Vekos does not resign, the party added, Addison County’s delegation to the state Legislature should start the process of impeaching her.
Some state leaders have previously called for Vekos’ resignation. After she was arrested for allegedly drunken driving in January 2024, a number of lawmakers in the  county demanded that she step down, though she did not.
Asked Wednesday if she would resign in the wake of Scott’s and the other leaders’ comments this week, Vekos was defiant, writing in an email: “Absolutely not.”
“There is no reason for me to step down. I’ve done nothing different than any other prosecutor in VT or anywhere,” she said. “And, anyway, it would be unfair to the residents in Addison County to leave them in the lurch. Not to mention unfair to my staff.”
Vekos also said the Democratic Party chair’s call for her to resign was “short-sighted and rash.” 
“He should have first reached out to me — rather than blindly accepting the truth of a one-sided story,” she said, referring to VTDigger’s reporting this week.
In a separate statement Vekos sent Tuesday after VTDigger published its story, Vekos said she was “distressed to hear that some victims are still suffering from the pain and frustration related to the outcomes” of cases described in VTDigger’s reporting. However, Vekos called those outcomes “an unfortunate reality of criminal court.”
“The choices I made in handling these cases was consistent with preceding prosecutors,” she said. Her office, she later wrote, was “crushing it.”

The Education Freedom Savings Account Oversight Committee will hold a public meeting Dec. 16 at 10 a.m, according to the committee’s official webpage. 
The scheduling move came after the Bulletin reported about the lack of meetings Monday. The committee last met in November 2024. It is required by statute to “monitor the implementation of” education freedom accounts, which allow families to access state education funding to use toward private and home school education expenses.
According to state law, the committee must produce a report by Nov. 30 of each year detailing its findings and any recommendations for changes to the program, but because it hadn’t met this year, the committee missed that deadline 
Sen. Ruth Ward, a Stoddard Republican and the chairwoman of the committee, said in a statement last week that the committee had not met because of scheduling challenges with House representatives.  The committee consists of two senators and three representatives and requires a quorum of three members to meet; Ward said House travel restrictions over the summer and the resignation of Rep. Glenn Cordelli had prevented that quorum from being met.
Democratic members of the committee, meanwhile, have criticized the lack of meetings, noting that they come as the  education freedom account program has nearly doubled after lawmakers removed the income limits and imposed a 10,000-student cap. That increase makes the role of legislative scrutiny particularly important, they argue. 
Oversight over the accounts has become fraught amid increasingly intractable partisan attitudes around the program. Republicans say the program provides important financial support for families who do not believe public school is the right option for their children; Democrats say state funds should only support public schools.

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)A House legislative oversight hearing at the North Carolina General Assembly Wednesday devolved into shouting and book-throwing by the committee chairman.
Republican lawmakers pressed Chapel Hill-Carrboro school leaders over whether the district had complied with the requirements in the state’s “Parents’ Bill of Rights,” which became law in 2023.
It was so heated that Rep. Amos Quick (D-Guilford), who had been watching the hearing remotely before arriving, ruefully described the proceedings as “pretty good TV.” 
“There was book throwing, there was cussing, there was all of that,” Quick said. “I’ve been elected here for going on 10 years, and I have to say… I had secondhand embarrassment for the way this meeting was being conducted.”
For nearly two hours, members of the House Select Committee on Oversight and Reform grilled Superintendent Rodney Trice and former School Board Chair George Griffin and accused them of defying the law. 
Both men were called to appear after Board Chair George Griffin was recorded  at a school board meeting saying that CHCCS was openly defying Senate Bill 49, the state law requiring schools to notify parents when a student changes their name or pronouns. The video clip went viral among conservatives.
“You’re not here today because of a misunderstanding. You’re here today because you chose to wage war against the law, you chose to deceive the public, and now you’re here because you got caught,” Chair Rep. Brenden Jones told the men in his opening remarks. 
Both Trice and Griffin maintained throughout the hearing  that the district was following the law.

Griffin repeatedly declined to say whether he believed the law was constitutional, saying he was not an attorney. When pressed, he said only, “I think there’s a part of the law that singled out a subgroup of students.”
For his part, Trice defended the district’s practices saying, “Parents are essential partners, and we believe in involving them in every decision affecting their kids.”
Griffin said the board ultimately voted to follow Senate Bill 49. 
“That evening, we enacted seven parts of the bill—all the parts—except for putting in policy the one clause on pronouns,” Griffin said. “It was our understanding that the board should direct staff to develop written guidance for that issue, and that is what we did. ‘In our judgment, that is in complete compliance with the law, and that’s where we left things at the end of the night.”
Rep. Jeff McNeely (R-Iredell) asked, “So you thought the law that we gave you was multiple choice? You could kind of choose what you liked?” he asked.
McNeely also questioned Trice about the district’s finances and reliance on state funding. “So y’all don’t have the money to be able to educate these kids with your own money, you’re going to need some help, aren’t you?”
“Certainly we need state funds to help educate our kids at a high level,” Trice replied.
“There’s a darn good chance you may not get them,” McNeely shot back. “We’re not going to put up with rogue school systems who have no money and will not comply with the laws of this state. Do you understand what I said there?”
‘Attack on gay, trans people’
Jones also accused the school district of “grooming” students, saying it had “promoted sample pronoun surveys for kids without telling their parents” and “pushed gender support plans that included a check box to exclude parents.”
Jones read from several pro-LGBTQ+ children’s books he said were recommended by the district to K-4 students, denounced them as “pure trash,” and slammed them to the floor. He also accused the district of “indoctrinating” students.
Rep. Allison Dahle (D-Wake), one of the few openly LGBTQ+ lawmakers in the General Assembly, described the committee’s scrutiny as an “attack on gay, trans people.” 
“This is a way for everybody to be afraid of something that is 1% of this population,”she said. 
Dahle also noted the difficulties school administrators face in balancing the needs of all students, including LGBTQ+ students. 
“The school system is between a rock and a hard place,” she said. “You’ve got kids that are on one end of the spectrum to the other, and you have to do everything you can to help each and every person learn.” 
Democratic lawmakers on the committee criticized Republicans for focusing on the school district rather than addressing broader funding issues. 
In a joint statement, Reps. Maria Cervania (D-Wake) and Eric Ager (D-Buncombe) said the hearing was a distraction from the legislature’s failure to pass a budget or fully fund public schools, including rural districts that are severely under-resourced.
“Instead of being angry when local schools try to protect our kids and teach them the truth,” they said, “perhaps the majority should follow the Leandro court order, fully fund education in North Carolina, stop starving rural school districts of funding, teachers, and capital improvements, and scrap the disastrous and bloated school voucher welfare program that shuffles money to the wealthiest members of our community.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0557-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-10 16:57:28.161333

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas attorney general is dropping his federal lawsuit that targeted health care for immigrants across the U.S.
Kris Kobach announced Wednesday he voluntarily dismissed the lawsuit, but health care for certain immigrants was stripped away more than three months ago when President Donald Trump rescinded the Biden-era rule that offered health care plans to people who migrated to the U.S. as children.
The roughly 10,000 immigrants in the United States under Deferred Action of Childhood Arrivals who purchased health insurance from the marketplace were removed from their plans by Oct. 1. An estimated 525,000 people are in the U.S. under DACA.
Kobach initially filed the lawsuit involving 18 other states after the Biden administration adopted rules in November 2024 enabling DACA participants to enroll in public health insurance plans, which wasn’t previously possible under the Affordable Care Act. Kobach argued in court against the policies, winning a preliminary injunction.
“This is a big win for the rule of law,” Kobach said in a Wednesday announcement. “Congress never intended that illegal aliens should receive Obamacare benefits.”
The lawsuit is one piece of Kobach’s broad range of anti-immigration efforts. He helped Kansas earlier this year become one of the first states in the country to deputize state law enforcement agents to enforce immigration law.
He is party to another lawsuit that seeks to exclude certain immigrants from U.S. Census counts. Kobach argued counting people in the country without particular documentation or with temporary visas skews congressional district apportionment. The U.S. Constitution mandates a count of “the whole number of persons in each state” every 10 years.

The nine-member Senate Study Group on Women, Children and Families, chaired by Sen. Nicole Boyd, a Republican from Oxford, was formed in 2022 after the overturning of Roe v. Wade. The group’s mission was designed to make the state safer for moms and babies. In Tuesday’s five-hour meeting at the state Capitol, stakeholders touched on health care, child care, youth court, foster care, food aid and addiction services. They suggested ways to improve the interrelated structures surrounding the Mississippi mothers who risk their lives giving birth and the children who grow up supported – or not – in a state with some of the nation’s highest rates of infant mortality, poverty and hunger. 
“We saw legislation that we need to go back and change, which is important always to look at the things that were or were not effective, or something that needs to be tweaked,” said Boyd.  
One example is the Child Care Tax Credit, passed in 2023, which offers a 50% income tax credit to employers who either provide their employees with child care during work hours or provide at least $6,000 in a stipend to a licensed child care provider for their employees. 
The program has had next to no uptake, said Biz Harris, director of the Mississippi Early Learning Alliance. Harris attributes that to mid-size employers not having the bandwidth to take on the administrative burden the program currently has, and the $6,000 minimum being too high. 
Currently, employers have to complete a long list of requirements to take advantage of the program. These duties include verifying if employees are eligible and providers are licensed, keeping detailed records and reporting to the Department of Revenue. 
“While we know some of those responsibilities have to remain with employers, we really hope you’ll explore ways to lower that minimum amount per employee and streamline the requirements so the credit can be more accessible and practical as an employee benefit.”
That kind of public-private partnership is important since Mississippi child care is getting hit hard right now. Efforts to fix those issues are competing with  the needs of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, serving over 350,000 residents, or about 1 in 8 Mississippians. 
“Those are the two things I think that I deal with that are going to have the most immediate impact on women, infants and children – particularly in the next year,” said Mississippi Department of Human Services Director Bob Anderson during the meeting.

Looming federal changes will shift an estimated $140 million in SNAP costs to the state. Meanwhile, Covid-era funding that dried up has forced nearly 20,000 eligible families who rely on child care vouchers – essentially coupons making child care more affordable – onto a waitlist, Anderson said. That number is up nearly 4,000 from last month, according to state estimates provided this week. 
Anderson requested $15 million from the Legislature in September’s Legislative Budget Committee hearing to cover the immediate cost increases for SNAP, after the federal budget bill shifted states’ administrative cost burden from 50% to 75%. But in the next two years, Mississippi expects to pay an additional $125 million to cover a portion of the actual nutrition benefits, which used to be completely covered by the federal government.
National policy experts have also expressed concerns about the toll new SNAP work requirements will place on state agencies’ aging technology. 
“Replacing your state’s administrative systems is usually not high on any legislator’s list of priorities, but we do pay the price for that later,” Elaine Waxman, a senior fellow in the Tax and Income Supports Division at the Urban Institute, told Mississippi Today. 
Vicki Lowery from the Mississippi Administrative Office of Courts shares that concern. 
“Our system is based on technology from 1999,” she said. “Think about what you were using in terms of technology in 1999 – a flip phone.” 
Health and mental health
In his presentation to lawmakers, State Health Officer Dr. Daniel Edney drilled down on obesity as a leading cause of preterm birth. In Mississippi, one in four children are battling obesity – the highest rate in the nation. Edney commended Mississippi Medicaid for covering GLP-1 drugs, which are used to treat type 2 diabetes and weight loss. 
“If we’re going to take fluoride out, can we put GLP1s in? Putting GLP1s in the water might help this,” Edney joked.

But data suggest reliable access to nutritious food already poses an immediate need for many Mississippians. Seventy-seven percent of Mississippi’s counties are considered food deserts, leaving many of the state’s residents without access to fresh fruits and vegetables. People in these areas rely on high-calorie, low-nutrient foods from convenience stores and fast food chains, contributing to obesity and disease. 
Several communities in Mississippi have begun the process of discontinuing fluoride treatment of water. Decades of research has shown a link between fluoride and the reduction of dental health disparities, particularly fewer dental cavities in children. Edney said that if the state is determined to take fluoride out of the water, the Legislature should put money in the Medicaid budget to “pay for the rotten teeth of the kids that are coming.”
Christina Dent, founder and president of End It For Good, a nonprofit advocating for a shift away from a criminal justice approach and toward a health-centered approach in addressing drug use, added context to some of Mississippi’s health woes. 
“When we think of childhood trauma, we tend to think of a one-time experience,” Dent said. “But trauma doesn’t just impact us at the moment that it happens. It creates this toxic stress that lives in our bodies and often has this long-term, decades-long outcomes in our health.”
Studies show that trauma, instability and abuse as a child can influence the risk of later developing chronic illnesses and diseases, such as obesity, cancer and heart disease, as an adult. If a person has five adverse childhood experiences – experiences of abuse, neglect, household dysfunction and community violence that undermine a child’s sense of safety, stability and bonding – that person is seven to 10 times more likely to use illicit drugs, according to one estimate. 
When the term adverse childhood experiences was first coined, its definition was limited to family and household trauma and received scrutiny for not taking into account broader issues like systemic racism and neighborhood violence. The definition has since evolved. Some schools of thought have worried ACE screening locks individuals into outcomes rather than taking into account the resiliency of people. 
In order not to perpetuate the cycle of trauma and addiction, it’s important to make sure pregnant women struggling with substance use are not cut out of the health care system, Dent said. Those women are often afraid to seek care for fear of criminal justice and loss of custody. 
“When you look at the research on states that have punitive-first policies related to substance use on prenatal or parenting women, they are worse outcomes – not just for the mother but for the baby, as well,” said Dent. “And we end up with all those things we’re trying to move away from.”
Dent’s organization hopes to play a bigger role in being part of the solution for Mississippians who need help. It was one of 127 groups to apply for opioid settlement money in September. Her organization’s proposal, which would create family support groups in the state aimed at helping families develop evidence-based skills to support loved ones battling addiction, was scored in the second-highest tier. It will be up to lawmakers whether or not to grant the $209,000 she requested as they consider the Opioid Settlement Fund Advisory Council’s recent recommendations about how to spend millions of dollars awarded that corporations have paid out for the role they played in contributing to the deaths of 10,000 Mississippians since 2000.
“When you hear from these programs, it really reiterates over and over how important prevention is,” Boyd said. “The quicker you can get at a problem or issue, the most effective and less expensive it’s going to be.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/09142233/3X0A6700.jpg,,,2025-12-10 16:57:28.161333

NCDEQ has denied the mining permit application from Horizon 30 LLC. (Drone shots courtesy of Leo Sharp) North Carolina has cut its state environmental agency more deeply than any other state in the country, according to a report released Wednesday by the Environmental Integrity Project, a nonprofit advocacy group.
The report, titled “State of Decline: Cuts to State Environmental Agencies Compound Damage from the Dismantling of EPA,” examines impacts of the Trump administration’s planned downsizing of the Environmental Protection Agency.
With cuts to the EPA, the federal government plans to shift certain tasks to the state level. But states may not have the capacity to shoulder additional responsibility for environmental oversight, the EIP found in its report.
Almost two thirds of states – 31 – cut jobs at their environmental agencies from 2010 through 2024, leading to the elimination of 3,725 positions, according to the document.
North Carolina is one of the fastest growing states in the country and home to a large and expanding manufacturing and farming sector, Jen Duggan, executive director of the EIP, said.
Despite this, North Carolina’s Department of Environmental Quality has lost nearly a third of its staff since 2010, the steepest decline of any state in the country at 32%. This translates to 394 eliminated jobs in pollution control and other environmental programs, according to the EIP.
Connecticut (26%), Arizona (25%), and Louisiana (24%) are next on the list in terms of percentage cuts.
“The effectiveness of our nation’s environmental laws relies on a well-resourced EPA working in partnership with capable state agencies,” Duggan said. “When states have the necessary authority, expertise and commitment, the EPA can delegate many responsibilities to them, but this shared system only works when both levels of government are adequately supported.”
The cuts are harmful to the state, said Drew Ball, Southeast campaigns director for the Natural Resources Defense Council. Reduced staffing leads to weaker enforcement, which in turn results in dangerous conditions for North Carolinians.
Ball described stories of a family in eastern North Carolina noticing their tap water turning cloudy after a heavy rain and a neighborhood near Wilmington smelling ammonia from a poultry operation. Because of the decrease in staff, state inspectors could not immediately investigate, leading to public health concerns.
“The very agency responsible for protecting these families is facing a growing burden,” Ball said. “That’s a recipe for disaster in states like ours, where the state agency is already stretched thin.”
In addition to federal cuts that have already occurred, there could be more in the upcoming months. Congress is expected to vote on the EPA’s budget for fiscal year 2026 in January.
Earlier this year, the White House said President Donald Trump wants the EPA to cut 65% of its spending, POLITICO previously reported.
The agency put out a statement in response saying the president and EPA administrator Zeldin are working towards creating a more efficient and effective federal government.
“Compared to 2024, the total amount spent year over year at EPA will deliver significant efficiencies to American taxpayers by cutting wasteful grants, reassessing the agency’s real estate footprint, and delivering organizational improvements to the personnel structure,” the statement read.
Ball compared the situation to dismantling the fire department when a house is already burning.
“North Carolina cannot keep its people safe if the agencies meant to protect them are left to wither, and the federal government cannot expect states to do more while it simultaneously knocks their legs out from under them,” he said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mining-along-Nolichucky-River_Photo-LeoSharp.jpg,,,2025-12-10 16:57:28.161333
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-10 21:17:33+00:00,CT Mirror,Lamont: CT savings habits are paying big dividends,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/10/ct-pension-payments/,Officials said next year's pension payment would have been $857 million more if CT hadn't put $10 billion into its pensions in recent years.,"By pouring more than $10 billion in budget surpluses into its cash-starved pension system since 2020, Connecticut has stemmed the skyrocketing costs that threatened public service programs in the 2010s, Gov. Ned Lamont announced Wednesday.
Lamont, who was joined by Treasurer Erick Russell and Comptroller Sean Scanlon during a late morning press conference in the State Office Building, also challenged the General Assembly to remain faithful to the budget caps that have generated these surpluses, warning that the global economic future remains uncertain.
Analysts project Connecticut must contribute at least $3.62 billion next fiscal year to its pension systems for state workers and municipal teachers. That’s only $14 million less than the minimum contribution it must make this fiscal year — essentially the same amount.
But Lamont, Russell and Scanlon say next year’s required payment would much greater — by about $857 million — had Connecticut not poured $10 billion extra in budget surpluses into its pensions over the past six years.
When calculating the minimum contribution Connecticut must budget for, analysts consider likely earnings for decades to come through the investment of pension assets. If the pension funds hold an extra $857 million, then likely investment income over the next 25 to 30 years will be significantly greater. And if that’s the case, the state’s minimum contribution doesn’t have to grow as much year to year, making it easier to balance the budget and avoid tax hikes.
“The perception of the state is incredibly important,” the governor said, adding that Connecticut’s fiscal prosperity in the 2020s, which followed a decade marred by numerous deficits and some huge tax hikes, has been noticed.
“It means we’re a place where businesses want to be and where individuals want to be,” the governor said. It also has led Wall Street credit rating agencies to repeatedly upgrade its evaluations of Connecticut in recent years, helping to lower borrowing costs for school construction, transportation work and other capital projects.
Thanks also to the robust 10.1% return that pension investments generated in 2025, “Connecticut continues to make undeniable progress in strengthening its pension funds and restoring long-term fiscal stability,” Russell said.
Lamont often touts these pension contributions savings as a huge boon to other programs in the state budget, such as education, human services and municipal aid. “You can put that [$857 million savings] to social services, take care of people,” the governor said Wednesday.
And certainly, these programs would be at risk of steep cuts if Connecticut had to find an extra $857 million next fiscal year to cover its minimum mandatory pension contribution.
But that also doesn’t mean all, or even most, of this extra $857 million will be invested in schools, Medicaid, programs for vulnerable populations or grants to cities and towns.
Connecticut has a spending cap designed to keep most budget growth in line with household income and inflation. According to the legislature’s nonpartisan Office of Fiscal Analysis, the preliminary $28.6 billion budget lawmakers and Lamont approved last June for the fiscal year that begins next July 1 has room for only $70 million more in appropriations before it hits the cap.
In other words, Connecticut will dodge a big increase in mandatory pension spending that could gut core programs but also will keep most of that savings, not invest it in other services. And this has been the case since Connecticut imposed a more aggressive budget cap and other fiscal controls in 2017.
Many of Lamont’s fellow Democrats in the General Assembly have argued for several years that these caps are focusing too heavily on shrinking pension debt while siphoning huge dollars from municipalities, schools, health care and social services. While state budget surpluses have averaged an unprecedented $1.8 billion since 2017, annual spending in most non-pension areas hasn’t kept pace with inflation for more than a decade, leaving some to charge most vital programs are slipping.
Critics also note that Connecticut amassed its huge pension debt, which still exceeds $33 billion, over more than seven decades prior to 2011. And since it took at least three generations to create the problem, one generation can’t pay it off responsibly, not without doing great harm to other programs.
The Lamont administration currently projects the state’s unfunded pension liabilities will be eliminated by the mid-2040s.
Given the huge debt still unresolved, and growing fears of a looming global economic recession, both Lamont and Scanlon said it’s important Connecticut remains focused on paying down its unfunded liabilities.
“It is important that we continue to find the balance between maintaining Connecticut’s fiscal health and responding to residents’ needs,” said Scanlon, who served in the General Assembly when the 2017 budget controls were enacted. “I am proud of the progress we’ve made and look forward to continuing to work with this administration.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DBA8D6B4-58A1-4B53-ABC3-B1F764C93D2D-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-10 16:57:28.161333

,California,2025-12-10 21:03:42+00:00,CalMatters,Rural California gets a lifeline in school funding as Congress restores money it cut,Carolyn Jones,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/k-12-education/2025/12/rural-schools-california-2/,"A century-old program pays for schools, roads and other services in 39 California counties.","In summary
A century-old program pays for schools, roads and other services in 39 California counties.


Rural schools and communities are poised to receive millions in funding after Congress resurrected a program left for dead a few months ago.
The Secure Rural Schools Act, which Congress passed overwhelmingly this week, is headed to President Donald Trump for final approval. It would bring $471 million for schools, roads, fire prevention, public safety and other critical needs. In California, 39 counties would share more than $40 million.
“It’s absolutely amazing,” said Jaime Green, superintendent of Trinity Alps Unified in Trinity County, which is set to receive almost $4 million from the bill. “A lot of people worked very hard to make this happen. I’ve never been more proud of our country than I am right now.”
Secure Rural Schools was created a century ago to reimburse communities that have large tracts of untaxable federal land. The program had been funded almost continuously until this year, when it apparently fell victim to the so-called Department of Government Efficiency’s push to eliminate programs it deemed wasteful.
But relentless bipartisan badgering by rural politicians and school officials apparently worked. Green, for example, visited Washington D.C. more than a dozen times to push for the bill. Rep. Doug LaMalfa, a Republican who represents much of northeastern California, hounded Speaker Mike Johnson for months until he placed it on the House calendar for a vote. A bipartisan group of more than 80 senators and representatives sent a letter to Johnson last week asking for the bill to be fast-tracked.
Public pressure, spurred in part by CalMatters coverage, also made a difference, Green and others said.
Razor-thin budgets
The money is especially important to rural communities because overall funding is so low to begin with. Rural school districts often operate on razor-thin budgets, with very little extra money to make up for swings in revenue. Trinity County, where 70% of the land is owned by the federal government, was anticipating layoffs, program cuts, deferral of costly repairs and other money-saving measures to make up for the loss of Secure Rural Schools funds.
Counties received their last Secure Rural Schools payment in March. The current bill will reimburse counties for the past nine months and cover the next two years, as well. The first checks will arrive 45 days after Trump signs the bill. 
“When the program lapsed, rural schools and counties were cut short of the funding they rely on to provide basic services,” LaMalfa said. “This bill restores that funding and keeps future payments on schedule.”
He added that a long-term solution would be for the government to help rural communities re-establish their timber economy, so programs like Secure Rural Schools aren’t necessary.
Another long-term solution would be to extend Secure Rural Schools from a 3-year bill to a 5- or 10-year bill, said Allan Carver, superintendent of Siskiyou County, which will receive more than $4 million through the bill. 
That would allow schools to make more permanent funding decisions — such as hiring classroom aides — and not have to continually lobby for the bill’s passage. A longer-term bill, spanning at least one presidential term, would also avoid some political skirmishes in Washington D.C., he said.
“We’re all celebrating today. This was truly an all-hands-on-deck effort,” Carver said. “But we’d love to see a permanent solution to this, so we’re not right back out there advocating a year from now.”
Other cuts on the horizon
James Gore, a Sonoma County supervisor and former president of the National Association of Counties, agreed that Secure Rural Schools should be exempt from the shifting political winds in Washington. Not only does it have strong bipartisan support, but the money is absolutely necessary for rural schools, he said.
“This is an unequivocal lifeline for kids in rural communities,” he said. “We’ll take the win, but it’s a shame that something so important was used as a negotiating tool.”
The fight is far from over, he added. Rural communities, which are disproportionately low-income compared to their urban and suburban counterparts, are facing federal cuts in Medicaid, food assistance, education and other programs which will have a far greater impact on residents’ day-to-day lives, he said.
“We all know that reform is needed,” Gore said, citing social services cuts in the Republican spending bill also called the One Big Beautiful Bill. “There’s going to be so many more fights in the next few years. Secure Rural Schools is only the first of 10 or more.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/052125_Paradise-School-Mental-Health_MG_CM_02.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-10 16:57:28.161333

(Photo by Anna Padilla for Source New Mexico)The New Mexico Higher Education Department on Wednesday asked lawmakers for $1.5 billion to fund public colleges and universities across the state. The department’s budget request prioritized creating free access to high school equivalency testing, as well as loan forgiveness for teachers and healthcare workers.
Department Secretary Stephanie Rodriguez, who presented the budget request to the Legislative Finance Committee, said that of the $1.5 billion requested, more than $1.3 billion will go directly to higher education institutions. The funding will maintain the Opportunity Scholarship, which covers fees and program costs for state residents who take at least six credit hours of instruction at a public college or university, and cover testing fees for New Mexico adults who want to earn a high school equivalency credential through a test like the GED. State lawmakers earlier this year passed legislation to make these tests, which the state estimates cost $145 each, free for the first time.
Rodriguez said college enrollment has increased for four consecutive years in New Mexico, while it declined nationally from 2020 to 2023. The nearly 114,000 residents across the state are pursuing educational paths ranging from career training certificates to graduate degrees at public institutions this semester, an increase of 3.6% from 2024, she said.
“I’m incredibly proud of this department,” Rodriguez told lawmakers. “Oftentimes you hear we’re last in education. That is not the case for higher education, adult education and early childhood education.”
The proposed HED budget for the upcoming fiscal year represents a 3% increase in “new money” and a $30 million increase to base funding. Rodriguez proposed directing $976.7 million of the request to instruction and general funding and $128.3 million to research and public service projects.
The budget proposal included new appropriation requests, including $25 million for a health professionals loan repayment program; $5 million for a teacher loan repayment program; $5 million for adult education programs; $3 million for the New Mexico Longitudinal Data System, which analyzes education and workforce data to guide policy discussions; and $1.25 million to cover high school equivalency testing fees across the state.
The new spending comes as the Trump administration moves to eliminate a Biden-era loan forgiveness program.

Representatives from the Council of University Presidents and New Mexico Association of Community Colleges also presented a unified budget request for higher education institutions across the state.
They credited the Lottery and Opportunity scholarships for ranking New Mexico fifth-lowest for student debt in the nation. The group sought funding for employee pay raises, campus safety, cybersecurity, building renewal and replacement equipment renewal and replacement. 
Cybersecurity was of particular concern to the group, whose officials cited an April cyberattack at Western New Mexico University.

(Photo by Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)A congressional redistricting proposal that has split Indiana’s Senate Republicans advanced to its final stage Wednesday after lawmakers quickly dispatched three Democratic amendments and positioned the high-stakes bill for a decisive vote on Thursday. 
But it remains unclear whether the Senate GOP caucus has enough support to pass the measure.
The chamber met for just 30 minutes with little of the marathon discussion that marked Monday’s six-hour committee hearing.
House Bill 1032 targets Indiana’s current two Democratic U.S. House members and is designed to create a 9-0 Republican map ahead of the 2026 midterm election — as demanded by President Donald Trump.
No Republican amendments were filed Wednesday, and all three Democratic proposals failed on voice votes.
The bill passed the Senate Elections Committee 6-3 earlier this week.
Sixteen GOP senators have publicly supported the bill; 14 have said they oppose it; and 10 — including several who supported advancing the bill out of committee — have not revealed how they plan to vote on the chamber floor.

Indiana’s Constitution requires a majority of the 50-member Senate to approve legislation, meaning the 40-seat Republican supermajority must muster at least 26 votes if all 10 Democrats vote no. GOP Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith can break a 25-25 tie if all members are present.
But not all senators have been at the Statehouse this week. 
Several GOP senators were missing on Monday and Tuesday, and by Wednesday, Republican Sens. Jim Buck, Scott Alexander and Ryan Mishler remained absent. 
Sen. Linda Rogers, R-Granger, noted in committee Wednesday morning that Alexander recently had open-heart surgery and said he was “doing really well,” but Senate Republican staff could not confirm who would or would not be present for Thursday’s vote.
Uncertainty surrounds Thursday vote
The bill’s advancement follows a Monday committee vote where two Democrats and one Republican opposed the measure — although several Republicans who voted to move it to the floor said they could still vote no on final passage. 
That included Sens. Greg Goode, Stacey Donato and Rogers. The three are among the 10 GOP lawmakers who have not publicly committed to mid-cycle redistricting.
Goode, R-Terre Haute, said after Wednesday’s Senate session that he remained undecided ahead of Thursday’s expected vote.
“I’m going to give it one more night to sleep on it, and then I want to hear one more time among my colleagues the arguments for and against,” he told the Indiana Capital Chronicle.
Goode said he has had two phone calls with Trump about redistricting, the most recent one on Monday and another call with White House officials Wednesday morning.

Goode described those calls as “very spirited advocacy,” but said has has”never felt threatened or pressured by the White House.”
At least a dozen legislators, many Senate Republicans — including Goode — have publicly disclosed being targeted in swatting attempts, bomb threats and more. The incidents have prompted an ongoing investigation now led by the Indiana State Police.
Sen. Mike Crider, R-Greenfield, said Wednesday he remained a firm opponent of the redistricting plan and that senators needed to resist such intimidation attempts.
“When you get kind of bullied and threatened, if that tactic works, then you can expect to deal with that for the rest of your political career,” Crider said after Wednesday’s Senate session. “This has been really kind of a discouraging thing that we’re experiencing this in Indiana. It’s not been our style in the past, and I’m hopeful that it’s not something we deal with in the future.”
Goode and Crider, who are both members of the budget-writing Senate Appropriations Committee, said they wouldn’t be swayed by arguments that the Trump administration could financially punish Indiana if the Senate doesn’t support the redrawn maps.
Goode said he believed the federal government would fulfill any obligations to the state.
“Now, can the administration potentially slow walk something? Could a grant request or some type of line of funding take a little bit longer, possibly,” Goode said. “But I have not, and I will not, make my final decision based on worrying of what could happen. That’s not the way, I think, we should govern.”
Crider said he expected Indiana’s congressional delegation to stand up to any financial threats.
“My opinion is that the spread on votes are so thin in Congress that if our federal delegation won’t stand together and say, ‘Leave Indiana alone,’ then they’re not doing their jobs,” Crider said. “I think that they have the ability to say, ‘If you’re going to hurt Indiana, then we’re not passing anything out of the House of Representatives until you stop that.’ That’s what I think should happen.”
Democrats keep amendments brief
The House approved the redistricting bill Friday, as expected, on a vote of 57-41. Twelve Republicans joined all Democrats present in opposition.
Gov. Mike Braun has stood by threats that he and Trump have made to support Republican primary challengers against senators who reject the new maps.
Wednesday’s floor debate in the Senate centered on three Democratic amendments, each defeated in a matter of minutes.
Outside the chamber, just a handful of protesters lingered in the hallway, and the usually crowded Senate balcony sat nearly empty — also a shift from the packed committee room on Monday.
Indiana Senate committee pushes redistricting bill forward though future still unknown

An amendment offered by Sen. Fady Qaddoura, D-Indianapolis, would have deleted the bill entirely and replaced it with a prohibition on redrawing congressional districts except immediately after the decennial census.
Qaddoura has already filed similar substantive language for the 2026 session in Senate Bill 53.
“The amendment deletes the content of House Bill 1032 completely, A to Z, and it explicitly adds language to prohibit mid-cycle congressional redistricting, because that’s not what Hoosiers asked us to come and do during this session,” Qaddoura said. “Hoosiers did not send us here to do a mid-decade redistricting of congressional seats.”
Sen. Mike Gaskill, R-Pendleton, the bill’s sponsor, urged colleagues to oppose what he called a “strip-and-insert” amendment. 
Another amendment from Sen. J.D. Ford, D-Indianapolis, would have required counties to report costs related to implementing new maps and authorized the state comptroller to reimburse them.
Ford noted that clerks — particularly in Marion County — testified that implementing new congressional boundaries so close to the 2026 election cycle would require new materials, additional staff and overtime hours, and substantial public-information efforts.
“These folks are likely to be saddled with extra costs … including updating ballots, hiring more temporary staff, moving the appropriate voters and conducting information campaigns,” Ford said. “At a time when Hoosiers families are begging for relief … we should not be forcing local governments to spend scarce taxpayer dollars on political power grabs such as this.”

– Sen. J.D. Ford, D-Indianapolis


Gaskill, in opposition, maintained that the amendment “basically creates an appropriation,” which would make it procedurally out of order at this stage in the legislative process.
Sen. Lonnie Randolph, D-East Chicago, offered a third amendment, which aimed to strike language that limits where and how lawsuits challenging the maps could be filed. The current draft of the bill would bar temporary restraining orders against the maps and route appeals directly to the Indiana Supreme Court.
Randolph called his proposal a “simple amendment,” arguing that trial courts should retain jurisdiction and that forcing precincts to straddle multiple congressional districts would create confusion for local precinct officials.
Gaskill urged the Senate to defeat that amendment, too. He defended the bill’s legal-challenge language as a way to avoid “chaos and confusion.”
“Often, throughout the country, chaos and confusion has been created with election related lawsuits,” he said. “And this sets up a clear procedure … and gets them expeditiously to the Indiana Supreme Court. … I think that’s very important, regardless of which side of the redistricting issue you’re on.”

(Photo by Amy Dalrymple/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakotans receiving federal food assistance will not be able to use those benefits to pay for candy, soda and some other foods, after the state implements changes approved by the Trump administration. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture has approved North Dakota’s application for a food restriction waiver in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, formerly known as food stamps. 
Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins and Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced the waiver for North Dakota and five other states. The waivers will change the definition of “food for purchase” under SNAP beginning in 2026. 
The North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services wrote in its application that it would take about eight months to implement the changes. The agency plans to work with retailers to implement the changes by September 2026.
About 600 North Dakota retailers that take SNAP benefits will have to update their sales systems so that attempts to purchase prohibited items with SNAP money are declined, according to the waiver request.
The list of banned items includes soft drinks; energy drinks; candy; some baking ingredients such as marshmallows and chocolate chips; nuts coated in chocolate or candy; and sweetened cereal and energy bars. 
North Dakota submits proposal to ban candy, soda from food assistance

North Dakota has 29,250 households, a total of 58,570 people, receiving SNAP benefits. 
“The SNAP waiver encourages North Dakotans to make more nutritious food choices that not only reduce chronic disease rates, but also foster long-term health, vitality, and stronger communities,” Pat Traynor, commissioner for North Dakota Health and Human Services said in a news release. 
The state pursued the food ban in part to secure more money from the federal government’s $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program. States will get at least $500 million from the grant, but federal guidelines show that states could be eligible for more money if they implement certain health-related policies, including banning non-nutritious foods from SNAP purchases.
Gov. Kelly Armstrong has set Jan. 21 as the tentative date for a special legislative session to allocate the rural health funding. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is expected to award funding to states by Dec. 31.

,DC,2025-12-10 20:46:42+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump administration tags $700 million for regenerative farming,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-administration-tags-700-million-regenerative-farming,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Agriculture will spend $700 million to support regenerative agriculture as part of the Make America Healthy Again agenda, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced Wednesday. The USDA pilot program for regenerative agriculture — a conservation management approach centered on improving the health of soil and increasing biodiversity — enacts part of President Donald Trump’s administration’s September “Make Our Children Healthy Again Strategy,” which offered more than 120 recommendations for addressing childhood chronic diseases.  The pilot program will take funding from existing USDA conservation programs, which provide financial and technical assistance to farmers, with the aim of improving soil health.“Protecting and improving the health of our soil is critical, not only for the future viability of farmland, but to the future success of American farmers,” Rollins said at a press conference alongside Kennedy and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz. “In order to continue to be the most productive and most efficient growers in the world, we must protect our topsoil from unnecessary erosion and boost the microbiome of the soil,” Rollins said.Kennedy said a September report from the administration’s Make America Healthy Again Commission, which the health secretary chairs, included “the promise to make it easier for farmers in this country, to give them an off-ramp — farmers who are dependent on ... chemical and fertilizer inputs — to give them an off-ramp where they can transition to a model that emphasizes soil health.” Kennedy has long advocated against use of chemicals in farming.Repurposing fundingThe department will dedicate $400 million to the initiative through the department’s Environmental Quality Incentives Program and $300 million from its Conservation Stewardship Program, according to a USDA press release.“It’s baseline funding that we received through our budget, so we have the ability to tag that funding specifically for this pilot, and that’s what we’re doing,” Aubrey J.D. Bettencourt, chief of USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service, or NRCS, said.Rollins also said she would seek corporate partners for the program using a 2022 law that authorizes USDA to channel private contributions to conservation programs. The move “will bring corporate label and supply chain partners directly into partnership” with NRCS, Rollins said.The pilot program “connects the producer and the work that they’re doing on the farm, granting them the credit for that voluntary action of change in practice on their farm that then can transition into the supply chain, into the marketplace and directly back to the consumer,” Bettencourt said. SNAP waivers Meanwhile, Rollins and Kennedy also announced Wednesday six more states whose waivers were approved to prohibit Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits from being used to purchase certain non-nutritious items beginning in 2026. The effort, also part of the Make America Healthy Again agenda, adds Hawaii, Missouri, North Dakota, South Carolina, Virginia and Tennessee to the list of states that will have such bans. The bans restrict which items recipients of the federal food assistance program that helps 42 million Americans afford groceries can buy with their SNAP benefits.Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah and West Virginia already have similar incoming bans.",,,,2025-12-10 15:57:32.547476
,New Jersey Monitor,2025-12-10 20:45:12+00:00,New Jersey Monitor,Fraud probe of South Jersey nursing homes triggers new call for legislative action,Dana DiFilippo,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/12/10/south-jersey-nursing-homes-fraud/,Investigators found that the owners of two nursing homes in Hammonton and Deptford schemed to illicitly pocket over $100M in Medicaid funds.,"Investigators found that the owners of two nursing homes in Hammonton and Deptford schemed to illicitly pocket over $100M in Medicaid funds. (Getty Images)The owners of two South Jersey nursing homes scammed the state out of more than $100 million in Medicaid funds during a yearslong scheme in which they intentionally understaffed their facilities, resulting in widespread neglect of residents, two sexual assaults, a death, and 3,400 calls to police for help, a state watchdog found in a new report.
Investigators with the state comptroller’s office found “a troubling pattern of mismanagement, self-dealing, and profiteering” by Daryl Hagler and Kenneth Rozenberg, who own Hammonton Center for Rehabilitation and Healthcare and Deptford Center for Rehabilitation and Healthcare, according to the report released Wednesday.
Kevin Walsh, the acting state comptroller, blasted the men for getting “rich off the backs of people who were unable to care for themselves.” Hagler and Rozenberg could not immediately be reached to comment.
CDC vaccine reversal spurs NJ legislators to act

He also bashed legislators for failing to act on recommendations his office has made for years to tighten oversight of the state’s 350 long-term care homes.
“The facts we uncovered in this report cry out for state government, including the Legislature, to finally recognize that New Jersey nursing homes are straining under the weight of fraud, waste and abuse. The problem isn’t limited to just a few nursing homes. This problem is systemic, uncontrolled, and shows no signs of getting better,” Walsh said.
In December 2024, Walsh pushed legislators to act after his office found similar fraud by the owner and operators of a Bridgeton for-profit nursing home. He also recommended reforms to state health officials after examining the state’s 12 lowest-rated nursing homes in a March 2023 report.
Yet little has changed in the industry since those reports, Walsh said. Legislators in June even cut a program in the state Department of Human Services that had allowed state officials to bar new admissions at low-rated nursing homes that failed to improve, Walsh noted.
“Report after report, both in New Jersey and nationally, has shown the extent of the problem,” he said, adding that “the Legislature did pretty much nothing.”
Wednesday’s report was Walsh’s first since state legislators tried to strip his office of its investigative powers.
Sen. Nicholas Scutari (D-Union), who led that effort, has said he merely intended to streamline the state’s watchdogs, but critics called his legislation payback for Walsh’s investigations of state Democrats and other Scutari allies. Scutari on Tuesday said he would no longer pursue that bill after uproar from critics, including Attorney General Matt Platkin and U.S. Sen. Andy Kim (D), who warned it would defang a key New Jersey watchdog and fuel corruption.
Scutari’s failed legislation loomed large Wednesday, with advocates applauding Walsh’s office for its latest and prior reports and condemning legislative inaction.
Laurie Brewer, New Jersey’s long-term care ombudsman, said New Jersey nursing homes received more than $4 billion in taxpayer funds through Medicaid and Medicare in 2023 alone.
“The public deserves to know where every dollar went, and the harsh truth is that we really don’t,” Brewer said, adding: “Too often, we have allowed unscrupulous owners with poor track records to set up shop and do business or continue to do business in New Jersey. The only entity that’s saying no and closing that door is the state comptroller, and good for them.”
Walsh on Wednesday urged lawmakers to pass a bill that would require disclosures by all nursing home owners and related companies, including audited, consolidated financial statements. The measure has been stalled in the Statehouse since it was introduced in January 2022.
Brewer said her office has pushed for the bill’s passage since then.
“The Legislature needs to act rather than continually passing rate increases for nursing homes with no transparency,” she said.

 The South Jersey probe

Walsh’s office began investigating Hagler and Rozenberg in 2023 after New York’s attorney general sued them and accused the two of defrauding New York’s Medicaid program of $83 million. The men own 46 nursing homes in New Jersey, New York, Kansas, and Missouri.
During their two-year probe, investigators from Walsh’s Medicaid fraud division found that the men, who were next-door neighbors and friends, grew rich off Medicaid by using complex and improper real estate deals, excessive loans, inflated rents, and undisclosed fees paid to nine “related entities,” which were companies they or their relatives owned and controlled.
Their nursing homes received $134.8 million in Medicaid funds from 2019 through mid-2024, but the men funneled $92 million of it to their related businesses, according to the report. Almost $28 million of that went into bank accounts that belonged to Rozenberg and a related company, while Hagler and Rozenberg illicitly spent nearly $8 million of Medicaid money to help them buy the nursing homes, the report says. The men also misrepresented their finances on state and federal forms, reporting just $882,666 in payments instead of the $92 million actually paid, the report says.
At both homes, investigators found chronic understaffing, as well as staff who were unlicensed and unqualified for their jobs. The homes failed to meet required staffing minimums on all but two of 146 days investigators reviewed, the report says.
The few staff members at the homes left residents sitting in their own waste and ignored cries for help for hours, investigators discovered.
The problems went beyond neglect. Two residents of the Hammonton home were sexually assaulted in 2021. A Deptford resident died of asphyxiation in 2022 after staff served them a sandwich and cookie even though their diet was restricted to pureed foods. Another Deptford resident, an amputee who used a wheelchair, was discharged to a motel in 2021 but got immediately sent back because the motel couldn’t accommodate a wheelchair. The next day, Deptford’s staff discharged him again and dumped him outside a social services office that was closed, the report says.
More than 2,400 emergency calls were placed from inside the homes to Deptford police, and another 1,000 to Hammonton police, alleging severe neglect and negligence, including one resident who went missing “all day,” investigators found.
Both homes had been repeatedly declared “special focus facilities” by the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for their persistent, serious shortcomings.
“Rampant profiteering leads to poor quality care and often misery, as the most vulnerable people in our society press call buttons and scream for help without anyone answering — hour after hour, day after day, year after year,” Walsh said.
Officials in 2023 suspended Hagler, Rozenberg, and their related entities from the state’s Medicaid program and installed an independent receiver to oversee both facilities, the report says. Walsh declined to comment on whether anyone was referred to police or prosecutors for possible criminal charges.
Walsh said Hagler, Rozenberg, their family members, and related entities owe the state $123.9 million plus penalties, with $87 million of it stemming from “pervasive and egregious violations” of staffing requirements.
Both men have refused to talk with investigators, citing their constitutional right against self-incrimination, the report says. The investigation remains ongoing.
 A ‘pervasive business model?’

Chris Widelo, the New Jersey state director of AARP, said Walsh’s report exposes “a level of dysfunction and lawlessness in New Jersey’s nursing homes that is nothing short of shocking.”
He also called on legislators to pass the stalled bill to mandate expanded disclosures by long-term care homes.
“This is not mismanagement — it is a systemic, dangerous breakdown in oversight and accountability that is putting residents’ lives at risk while operators enrich themselves at taxpayer expense,” Widelo said in a statement.
He singled out investigators’ finding that the owners took out mortgages on the nursing homes, transferred the mortgages to their real estate companies, and then charged the nursing homes inflated rents.
“This practice has long been suspected, but this is the first time it has been publicly documented. And given how widespread excessive ‘rent’ payments are across the industry, this is almost certainly not an isolated scheme, but a pervasive business model,” Widelo said.
Brewer said state lawmakers must increase funding for the state Department of Health, which inspects nursing homes, and the state Department of Human Services, which administers the Medicaid program, so that both can better monitor nursing home conditions and scrutinize their finances.
Facilities with persistent failures to fix problems should not only face fines, but also be barred from accepting new admissions, she added.
“Today’s report makes one thing painfully clear: nursing home residents are living in unsafe conditions, operators are exploiting financial loopholes for profit, and taxpayers are footing the bill,” Widelo agreed. “This must end.”

But the person, Marcus Taylor, was already set free by the state’s appeals court because he had been imprisoned five years longer than the maximum sentence. 
Taylor, now 43, was convicted of conspiracy to sell a controlled substance in 2015 in Choctaw County. At the time, the sentence carried a maximum penalty of five years, meaning he would have been released in 2020. But he received 15 years.
Reeves’ order directs the Mississippi Department of Corrections to release him within five days. 
Weeks earlier, the Mississippi Court of Appeals decided unanimously to reverse Taylor’s case and set him free, allowing him to return to his wife and children – teenagers who were young when he went away. 
Reeves called the man’s sentence illegal and noted how Taylor has already served more than a decade in prison. As governor, Reeves said it is his duty to ensure the state’s laws are executed “without passion or prejudice,” and commutation of Taylor’s sentence to time served fulfills that constitutional duty. 
“This is about justice, not mercy,” Reeves said Thursday. “ … Respect for the rule of law and protecting every Mississippian’s right to individual liberty and self-determination are the bedrock principles upon which our Constitutional Republic and state were founded. If justice is denied to one Mississippian, it is denied to us all.”
A decade earlier, Taylor pleaded guilty to selling opioid painkillers but the plea petition incorrectly listed the maximum sentence as 20 years. At the time, nobody in court, including his former attorney, caught the error. It was discovered in 2023 when Taylor claimed to be eligible for parole. 
Reeves has been asked to grant clemency in a number of cases, including for the four death row inmates executed while he has been governor. He has also been asked to look at clemency in a number of other cases. Several Mississippians have been granted clemency for federal crimes across several presidencies, including 11 people who had sentences commuted by President Barack Obama during his two terms.

Rosemary Bayer aimed at preventing suicide.
The West Bloomfield Democrat’s Senate Bill 539 would require the Michigan State Police to create and maintain both a temporary and an indefinite “do-not-sell” firearms list where individuals can voluntarily add their names, as well as a process for someone to have their name removed from the indefinite list if their addition was not voluntary. 
Adding another person’s name to a do-not-sell list would be considered a felony, punishable by up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $5,000. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Individuals can ask their local clerk or police to add them to one of the lists, Bayer said. While names on the temporary list expire after 180 days, names on the indefinite do-not-sell-list remain there until a person asks for their name to be removed. 
The state police would also be required to make applications for the lists available to health professionals free of charge.
“As in many medical situations, with suicide, prevention is the best prescription,” Bayer said, noting that mental health providers suggest patients with suicidal ideation remove suicide tools from their home and workplace. 
“Anything that causes a delay in acting on suicidal thoughts can be, and frequently have been, a lifesaver,” Bayer said.

Suicides attempts made using a firearm are deadly in 90% of cases, Bayer said, and that her bill would help save lives by placing that method farther away.
Alongside Bayer’s testimony, committee members welcomed comments from Fredrick Vars, a law professor at the University of Alabama. 
Vars shared the story of Donna Nathan, a woman who died by suicide using a firearm she’d purchased the same day. Her death prompted her daughter to advocate for voluntary do-not-sell list laws, also known as Donna’s Law.
“Suicide claimed the lives of 1,530 Michigan residents in the most recent year for which data are available, 2023,” Vars said. “Fifty-six percent of those deaths involved a firearm. Gun suicides get less attention than mass shootings, but they outnumber all types of gun homicide by thousands of victims. Our veterans are among the hardest hit.”
Vars said the bill would not infringe on anyone’s Second Amendment rights, as nobody would be forced to participate or would have their firearms taken away. 
“This is simply not gun control. It’s self control,” Vars said.
The law has already been enacted in five states, Vars said: Washington, Virginia, Utah, Delaware and Colorado. 
Additionally only 10% of people who survive a serious suicide attempt go on to die by suicide, Vars said.
“If you can just prevent that one fatal attempt, at the outset, you’re saving a life, not just delaying a suicide,” Vars said. 
Vars also shared that as someone with bipolar disorder, he’d like to have these laws available to sign himself up. 
“An alarming 15% of people with bipolar disorder die by suicide,” Vars said. “If I had easy access to a gun at certain points in my life, I might already be one of them.”
Dr. Brian Stork, a board member for the Michigan State Medical Society, underscored Vars’ story, noting that one of his colleagues had talked about his one bipolar diagnosis and treatment while they were discussing the bill. 
“This is a colleague of mine who’s very functional, who I work with on a regular basis, whose professional skills are to be admired,” Stork said. “I just think it speaks to the fact that all of us suffer, all of us have times of crisis, all of us need times of grace, and all of us sometimes need time. Voluntary do-not-sell-lists empower individuals to protect themselves during moments when they know they may be vulnerable. It is a compassionate, common sense and trauma-informed approach to saving lives.”

Human trafficking legislation moved forward
While members of the committee did not vote on Bayer’s bill, the four Democratic members present at Wednesday’s meeting voted to refer a set of policies put forth by Sen. John Damoose (R-Harbor Springs) and Sen. Sue Shink (D-Northfield Township) to the Senate floor for further consideration. 
In September, Damoose joined state Reps. Kelly Breen (D-Novi) and Carol Glanville (D-Walker), Sen. Michael Webber (R-Rochester Hills) and Attorney General Dana Nessel in announcing a package of bills to address human trafficking and support survivors.
Damoose’s Senate Bill 520 modifies the Michigan Penal Code to increase penalties for human trafficking, making the penalty involving a minor or involving kidnapping, criminal sexual conduct, or death a felony punishable by up to life imprisonment and a maximum fine of $50,000. All other human trafficking violations would be punishable by up to 20 years in prison and a maximum fine of $20,000. 
Senate Bill 521 would bring those changes into the state’s sentencing guidelines.
Shink’s Senate Bill 705 raises the age when a person can be charged with misdemeanor or felony penalties under the state law criminalizing prostitution from 16 to 18. While the bill increases the maximum prison terms and fines for facilitating prostitution, it also allows a person who is found guilty of facilitating prostitution to be placed on probation, requiring them to participate in a mandatory human trafficking awareness program.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC_0265-scaled-e1765394468285-1024x675.jpg,,,2025-12-10 15:57:32.547476

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota’s Republican attorney general is threatening a lawsuit and ordering a national nonprofit to cease and desist “the deceptive advertising of the sale of abortion pills in South Dakota,” but the organization is not signaling that it will stop its advertising campaign.
The ads ask “Pregnant? Don’t want to be?” and provide a link to the website of Mayday Health, a New York-based nonprofit that shares information about abortion pills. The website offers legal and medical support, and links to purchase abortion pills and birth control.
The organization said the campaign started Monday at 30 gas stations across the state and will run for six weeks, but several locations provided by Mayday and checked by South Dakota Searchlight on Tuesday and Wednesday in Fort Pierre, Rapid City, Sioux Falls and Huron did not have the ads.
State pledges investigation as national group launches abortion-pill ads in South Dakota

South Dakota law bans abortions, unless the mother’s life is threatened by a pregnancy. State lawmakers also passed legislation in 2022 banning “medical abortion by telemedicine.”
Attorney General Marty Jackley said Wednesday that Mayday Health’s advertisements do not mention the prohibitions in state law, and his investigation “indicates that the company is misleading the public through deceptive information and advice provided in the advertisements.”
“Your advertisement directs South Dakota consumers to resources that insinuate abortion-inducing pills are legal in South Dakota,” Jackley wrote in a cease-and-desist letter.
Mayday responded to South Dakota Searchlight with a written statement.
“Mayday Health spreads awareness that abortion pills are safe, effective, and have been FDA approved for over 20 years,” said the statement from Executive Director Liv Raisner. “This is First Amendment-protected free speech. Mayday is an education nonprofit. We don’t sell abortion pills, we just believe people should know their options.”
Jackley’s cease-and-desist letter said that if Mayday refuses to comply, he “may bring a lawsuit” against the organization “for violations of the South Dakota Deceptive Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Act.” That could result in “felony criminal consequences” or civil penalties up to $5,000 per violation, Jackley wrote.
He asked Mayday to notify his office of the steps taken to remedy the situation by Dec. 19.
Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden issued a statement Wednesday praising Jackley.
“South Dakota moms and babies deserve to be protected from deceptive advertising,” Rhoden’s statement said.
The American Civil Liberties Union of South Dakota criticized Rhoden and Jackley, calling their actions “a politically motivated attack on free speech.”
“This investigation into Mayday Health’s ads is little more than political theater at the taxpayer’s expense,” said a statement from ACLU-South Dakota Advocacy Manager Samantha Chapman.
In 2023, medication abortions accounted for 63% of abortions in the country, according to data from the Guttmacher Institute. The drugs mifepristone and misoprostol, commonly used in medication abortions, are also listed on the World Health Organizations’ list of essential medicines. Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected an attempt by anti-abortion medical organizations to overturn the Food and Drug Administration’s prescribing guidelines for mifepristone.

The recommendation came from a Connecticut Freedom of Information Commission hearing officer in response to a complaint filed by Eversource last year, which accused PURA of withholding records regarding its internal procedures.
Danielle McGee, the hearing officer assigned to the case, wrote in Tuesday’s draft opinion that the PURA staff attorney assigned to handle the company’s request, Scott Muska, made several errors in his attempts to locate responsive records and that the agency failed to conduct a “reasonable and diligent” search for the records. 
While Gillett did not directly oversee PURA’s response to Eversource’s request, McGee noted that she was ultimately responsible for ensuring that the agency complied with the state’s open records laws and that a fine against her was warranted.
The draft opinion did not recommend any fines against Muska.
Attorney General William Tong’s office, which represented PURA in the dispute, declined to comment. Gillett and Muska did not respond to requests for comment.  
Eversource’s complaint before the FOI Commission is one of a series of disputes between Gillett and the state’s utility companies that have roiled PURA over the last year. Gillett stepped down from her role as the state’s top utilities regulator in October, citing the emotional toll of those disputes on her and her family. 
Gillett’s critics accused her of wielding unilateral control over the authority, violating open records laws and boxing her fellow commissioners out of decision making. Last month, a judge ruled that many of PURA’s actions under her leadership were illegal.
The American Economic Liberties Project, where Gillett now serves as a senior fellow, released a statement on Wednesday criticizing the complaint as part a “coordinated campaign of political intimidation” by Eversource.
“At a time when Connecticut families are struggling with the burden of high utility bills, one of the state’s most prominent public utility companies feels so threatened by the idea that they should prioritize people over profits that they are still targeting a former regulator who dared to challenge their exploitation of ratepayers,” the statement said. 
Last November, Eversource filed a records request with PURA seeking copies of policies and procedures circulated by Gillett and her staff, including any emails directing her fellow commissioners to seek permission from Gillett’s office in order to get assistance from other staff at the authority. In a complaint filed with the FOI Commission the next month, Eversource attorneys said they had reason to believe that such a document existed and that the agency was “stonewalling” to prevent its release.
While Muska did release hundreds of documents in response to Eversource’s request in January and February, the email regarding the alleged directive was not among them. PURA did eventually release copies of that email to The Hartford Courant in September, two days before Gillett announced her resignation.
A spokesman for Eversource also declined to comment on the draft opinion Wednesday. 
The FOI commission has scheduled a hearing on Dec. 17 to hear oral arguments and render its final decision. The commission has handed down seven fines this year ranging in size from $100 to $5,000, the maximum penalty allowed by law.
Muska, the attorney for PURA, was also referred to a disciplinary committee for attorneys last month by New Britain Superior Curt Judge Matthew Budzik to determine whether he misled the court in a separate case involving Gillett’s personal phone records. 
In a brief interview with the Connecticut Mirror following that referral, Muska denied wrongdoing and laid blame for any improper actions with the Attorney General’s Office. In a statement, Tong defended the actions of his staff.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025_0220_SR_PuraHearing_230-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-10 15:57:32.547476

(Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LEXINGTON, Neb. — Across the street from a Tyson beef plant set to close at the end of January, Nebraska U.S. Senate candidate Dan Osborn accused the company of breaking a century-old law aimed at preventing anti-competitive behavior by meatpackers.
Osborn, a registered nonpartisan running against U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., in 2026, pointed to his time as a former labor leader in an Omaha Kellogg’s plant to say he knows “what it feels like” to give a company “complete loyalty” and said workers feel betrayed. He said Tyson’s quarterly earnings report won’t feel the ripple effects that the town will face.

He said Tyson is trying to maximize profits at the expense of producers and customers in violation of the Packers and Stockyards Act, a federal law passed in 1921. That law was meant to promote competitiveness and fair practices in the livestock, meat and poultry industries and ensure payment protection. The law also prohibits deception and fraud in those markets.
Tyson officials had no immediate comment.
Osborn called the move to close the plant and not sell it to a competitor “market manipulation” and said Tyson is “destroying 5 percent of America’s beef processing capacity.” Basel Musharbash, an antitrust lawyer from Texas, also spoke at the press conference, saying the “law is on Lexington’s side.”
“The legal analysis here is pretty straightforward,” Musharbash said. “The Lexington plant accounts for around 5% of the nation’s cattle.  By shutting down a plant that slaughters such a large portion of the cattle in this region and the country, Tyson will single-handedly reshape the nation’s cattle markets from boom to bust.” 
Musharbash said the move would force Nebraska “ranchers to accept lower prices, and Tyson will be able to make higher profits.”
In response to the plant closure, the U.S. Department of Agriculture told the Nebraska Examiner this week that it would “continue to monitor the closure of the plant to ensure compliance with the Packers and Stockyards Act, including ensuring that livestock sellers are issued timely and accurate payments.”

Lexington, a west-central Nebraska city home to more than 10,000 people, has been dealing with the aftermath of Tyson’s decision to close the plant, which will result in the combined layoffs of up to 3,200 workers. Osborn asked where are state federal delegation.
“The people of Lexington need their elected officials to fight now more than ever, they don’t have time for reports to come out and investigations to happen….The law that’s been in the books for over 100 years should be enacted….So pick up the damn phone, call [U.S. Agriculture Secretary] Brooke Rollins and get the USDA to enforce the law,” Osborn said.
Ricketts, in a call Wednesday with reporters, said his team is looking into any allegation of wrongdoing by Tyson. Ricketts said he had talked with Tyson CEO  Johnny King about “making sure that that facility can continue to be used for job creation.”

Gov. Jim Pillen, a Republican whose family runs a hog operation based in Columbus, has said the state got its “butts kicked” by the closure. State agencies have partnered with Lexington nonprofits and other groups to help the workers affected.
But Ricketts’ campaign and several elected Republicans criticized the visit to Nebraska’s 3rd Congressional District, with U.S. Rep. Adrian Smith saying the congressional delegation is working with the governor to help the people of Lexington find new jobs and connect them with available help.  
“Dan Osborn parachuting in for a press conference does nothing to help the Lexington community,” Smith said.
Nebraska 1st District U.S. Rep. Mike Flood, a Republican from Norfolk, has emphasized that the state dealt with a similar Tyson plant closure in 2006 in his hometown. Flood, in a video posted on social media by his office, said it “stripped the plant bare” and the property couldn’t be used as a beef processing facility.

He said the plant still sits empty today. 
Former U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., criticized Osborn during his 2024 Senate race against her for helping drive the Omaha Kellogg’s plant out of business. Its leaders announced the plant would close in 2026, though the union leaders who followed Osborn didn’t blame the concessions he negotiated.
The Ricketts campaign, in a statement Tuesday, said Osborn was “heavy on grandstanding but offered no help or solutions to those impacted in Lexington.” Will Coup, a Ricketts campaign spokesperson, said Ricketts is working with state leaders to keep jobs in the community. He called the closure devastating.
“Senator Ricketts will continue approaching this like a natural disaster, with work carried out locally, directed by the state and supported by the federal government,” Coup said. “Nebraskans will overcome this together.” 
Osborn’s campaign had organized a listening session for Tyson workers at a local restaurant in the middle of the day Tuesday, after the press conference, but no workers showed up. The Osborn campaign said they would reach out to the workers who had expressed interest in the listening session to set meetings with the former labor leader at a later date. 
State Sen. Teresa Ibach of Sumner, in a social media post this week, said the closing of the Tyson plant was heartbreaking news for many families in her district and the community of Lexington. She criticized Osborn for “using this community’s hardship to score campaign points,” calling it  “opportunistic and disappointing.”
Osborn said it was important to him to come to advocate for the workers because in his eyes, no one is advocating for them.

(West Virginia Board of Education livestream screenshot)As West Virginia education officials signed off on another round of school consolidations Wednesday, Board of Education President Paul Hardesty repeated a call to lawmakers that they “fix” the school aid formula he said is to blame for the closures. 
“We continue to hemorrhage enrollment,” Hardesty said. “The last time the school funding formula was addressed was 1982 in the Recht decision, and it’s based solely on population. Somebody, somehow, some way, is going to have to factor in that we have rural counties with large square mileage, but not a lot of kids. That has to become factored in somewhere in that formula.”
The board of education approved the closures of about a dozen schools in Barbour, Logan, Randolph, Roane, Upshur and Wetzel counties. 
Under the current school funding formula, counties receive state funding based on the number of students. 
Schools in nearly every county have lost 2.5% of students in the past year, Superintendent Michelle Blatt told the board in November. School officials have pointed to the state’s ongoing population decline as a major reason for the enrollment drop. 
Students are also opting out of public schools to use the state’s broad school voucher program, the Hope Scholarship. Use of the Hope Scholarship doubled in the 2024 school compared to the year before, according to West Virginia MetroNews. 
According to the state Department of Education, 16 public schools closed in 2024, up from 9 in 2023 and five in 2022. 
“We have to get a legislative fix with regards to the formula, or we’re going to continue to have tough conversations as we’re having today,” Hardesty said. 
Twenty-seven people signed up to speak at Wednesday’s regular board of education meeting. Several people used their two minutes of allotted time to discuss the impacts the school closures will have on their communities. 
Amber Anderson, a special education teacher at Rock Cave Elementary, which is set to close, said the Upshur County school is a family, a safe haven and the heart of the community. 
“First of all, I must ask, what price could ever justify risking a student’s future or tearing out the heart of a community?” Anderson said. “We, the educators at Rock Cave, know our students, their strengths, their challenges, their dreams and what helps them thrive.”
Anderson said her students will go from sharing a classroom with eight students to one with 30 when the school is consolidated at French Creek Elementary School. 
“Small class sizes at Rock Cave allow us to meet [student] needs,” she said. “A larger school will not.”
Jeff Mace, president of the Roane County Board of Education, told board members school closures would lead to an increased rate of special education needs in his county. The county plans to close Geary Elementary Middle School and Walton Elementary Middle School and consolidate students into Spencer Elementary and Spencer Middle School.
“Those that can leave will leave,” he said. “Those that can’t leave have needs, and we have to deal with that in our county. That’s going to drive up the cost per pupil, because we will have a greater percentage of special needs children in our public school system.”
Mace said state lawmakers don’t understand how schools are required to operate. Public schools cannot be competitive because they have a large number of laws and regulations to follow, he said. 
“We implore your help to help us inform legislators so that we can go through and increase the knowledge of what is happening to not just Roane County, but all these counties,” he said.

By early December, enrollment for 2026 exchange plans in the state had reached nearly 125,000 — only 800 fewer than the number of signups for 2025 plans at this time last year — despite likely dramatic cost increases due to the expected expiration of financial assistance, known as “enhanced premium tax credits.”
If the subsidies lapse at the end of December, individual enrollees could see their premiums rise by an average of $2,380 per year — or about $198 a month, according to mid-October estimates provided by Access Health CT. A household of four would see premiums rise by an average of over $10,000 per year.
Access Health CT CEO James Michel said he was surprised by the strong enrollment, but chalked it up to relentless outreach efforts over the last several months by any means necessary, including mail, email and text. 
“We kept on sending notices, like every two weeks, just keeping people informed,” Michel said. “We think that was helpful in prepping people what to expect when they did show up. The sticker shock was somewhat built into their mindset.”
About 143,000 enrollees in Connecticut receive some sort of subsidy to help defray the costs of premiums. Of that number, nearly 32,000 enrollees only qualify for the enhanced subsidy, and would thus completely lose their financial assistance by next year. The remaining 111,000 will still receive financial support, but it will decrease.
Connecticut would have to spend more than $295 million annually to pick up the costs of the enhanced premium tax credits if Congress fails to extend them, according to a spokesperson with Access Health CT.
The subsidies played a central role in the 43-day-long federal government shutdown earlier this year. Even though the standoff ended without an agreement on the tax credits, U.S. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., pledged to hold a vote on renewing them.
That vote is slated to take place on Thursday. Democrats are proposing to extend the subsidies for three years. All 47 Democratic senators are expected to back the bill in a key procedural vote, but they will need some Republicans to get it to clear the 60-vote threshold.
Republicans have floated a number of alternative proposals, and have struggled to unify behind one. One proposal would fund health savings accounts, or HSAs, while another would extend the subsidies with new eligibility restrictions.
But the GOP proposal in the Senate that’ll also get a vote Thursday doesn’t address the lapse in the tax credits and instead focuses on expanding HSAs. Those who earn up to 700% of the federal poverty level would receive up to $1,500 in those accounts depending on an eligible individual’s age. Under this bill, subsidies would expire.
Neither the Republican or Democratic bills are expected to advance in the Senate this week, increasing the odds that the subsidies will sunset at the end of the year.
Still, if Congress passes an extension, Michel said Access Health CT would look to extend open enrollment. They would also send targeted outreach to people who had already signed up for plans, giving them the opportunity to enroll in a different plan.
Open enrollment for plans that take effect at the start of next year began Nov. 1 and runs through Dec. 15. Residents have until Jan. 15 to enroll in plans that begin in February.
U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., isn’t hopeful that Democrats will succeed in getting an extension.
“We’re going to fight as long and hard as we can, but I have no great confidence in my Republican colleagues to do the right thing,” Blumenthal said. 
Republicans have argued the subsidies drive up the cost insurers charge for coverage. And they believe their counterproposal “will get us away from the practice of giving the money all to the insurance companies and put it back in the hands of the patients,” according to Thune.
Democratic lawmakers in Connecticut push back that it completely ignores the issue of rising premiums and could result in Americans signing up for “worse” health plans than they are currently enrolled in.
“Republicans could just do the right thing this week. They could vote for a simple bill to just postpone this disaster and instead, they have spent the last month either ignoring this crisis or arguing amongst themselves,” U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said from the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday.
The enhanced premium subsidies were created under the American Rescue Plan Act, the 2021 federal legislation that congressional Democrats passed to provide relief during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Fayette, Wayne, Taylor, Crawford and Pottawattamie counties are recipients of the grants announced Wednesday by Iowa Rural Development Director Mike Sexton. 
“At Rural Development, we believe our Iowa farms and small towns are part of the bedrock that supports our country,” Sexton said in a statement. “Under the leadership of President Trump and Secretary Rollins, USDA is helping to deliver more reliable water supplies and healthcare facilities to make rural Iowa a better place to live and work.”
The water system grants for Denison Municipal Utilities and the City of Macedonia follow several summers of water shortages, boil orders and water conservation orders in the southwestern municipalities. 
Denison received a $1 million grant to help construct a rock riffle dam to help “recharge” the utility’s well field, according to a news release. A rock riffle dam places rocks in a stream, in this case the East Boyer River, to control the grade of the stream. According to the release, the dam will help provide a more consistent water supply for the community, “especially during drought conditions.” 
Another grant, in the amount of $580,000, was awarded to the City of Macedonia for the construction of a new well into the city’s existing well field. Currently, according to the release, the city has to reduce the pumping rate of the well during dry weather conditions and the supply is often “insufficient” for the city with 267 residents.
The City of Clearfield was awarded a $29,000 grant to help complete an evaluation of the city’s wastewater system. The release said the study is a “necessary first step” to determine the cost of alternative systems and system improvements. 
Two grants, through the Community Facilities grant program, will help to improve health care centers in Wayne County and Fayette County. 
A slightly more than $2 million grant to Wayne County Hospital in Corydon will fund a nearly 5,000-square-foot addition to the hospital for a modern dialysis center. 
Palmer Lutheran Health Center Inc. received $1.1 million to renovate obstetrics facilities at the Gunderson Heath System clinic in West Union. The announcement said the funding will improve delivery and postpartum resources for the area. 
Fayette County, like many rural areas, has few maternal health care options, according to mapping from the federal Health Resources and Services Administration.

The “SD 11 overperformance” referred to the special election in Florida’s Senate District 11 Tuesday night to replace Blaise Ingoglia, who vacated the seat this past summer after being appointed by DeSantis as the state’s chief financial officer.
Republican Ralph Massullo defeated Ash Marwah by 18 percentage points, 59%-41%, in a district encompassing Citrus, Hernando, Sumter and part of Pasco County.
In November, Ingoglia had defeated Democrat Marilyn Holleran, 69%-31%, meaning Tuesday’s result had shifted 20% towards the Democratic candidate.
Fried specifically referred to the results in Hernando, where Ingoglia resides. Massullo won that county by just six percentage points, whereas in November Ingoglia took Hernando by 44 points. “That isn’t because it’s a special election. It’s because people are tired of chaos. They’re tired of elected officials not showing up for them,” she said.
Republican Party of Florida Chair Evan Power said Fried’s excitement wasn’t warranted.
“This is a great Nikki Fried tradition to take one lean-D race and try to turn it into momentum,” he said in a text message. “Everyday Floridians are rejecting the far-left Democrat Party. It’s why we now have a 1.4 million Republican voter advantage.”
Given that disadvantage, Fried has said throughout the year that Democrats will need support from independents and disaffected Republicans to win legislative and congressional seats in 2026. She argued that’s what happened in some parts of Florida Tuesday night.
“Because these coalitions that came together all across the state were Democrats, Republicans, Independents,” she said. “And that’s how we’re going to build a better Florida and make sure that we’re turning the page of 30 years of one-party control of this state, which is why this state is so unaffordable.”
It should be noted that while a Democrat had not been elected mayor of Miami since the late 1990s, there are more registered Democrats than Republicans in the city (Miami-Dade County did flip Republican earlier this year). And while it is accurate that voters there had elected Republicans in every election since 2009, Manny Diaz, an independent who served as Miami mayor from 2001-2009, was a political independent who went on to chair the Florida Democratic Party from 2021 to 2023.
MAGA influencer Laura Loomer, who lost two previous races for Congress in Florida, said on X Tuesday that Higgins’ victory meant that “a bright red city in a bright red state just went blue.”
She went on to predict: “Midterms will be a bloodbath.”
DCCC weighs in
Meanwhile, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) announced Wednesday that it had added Republican Laurel Lee’s 15th Congressional District in the Tampa Bay area to its list of “districts in play” in 2026. The other GOP Florida seats in play, according to the DCCC, are Cory Mills’ District 7, Anna Paulina Luna’s District 13, and Maria Salazar’s District 27.
“Laurel Lee represents the worst of what voters hate about Congress — an out-of-touch politician who cares more about prioritizing the wealthy and well-connected over helping Florida’s working families,” said DCCC Chair Suzan DelBene in a statement.
“As Republicans continue to push their failing agenda that leaves everyday Americans behind in favor of Laurel Lee’s wealthy donors, Democrats will fight to ensure that next November, Florida’s 15th Congressional District will elect a representative that cares about them and their issues.”
Republicans control 20 of the state’s 28 congressional districts and are threatening to take more if they are successful in redrawing Florida’s congressional map sometime before next year’s midterm elections. Fried said she’s not worried if that happens.
“The fact of the matter is people are seeing through their chaos, they’re seeing through their corruption, and regardless of what those seats look like, I do believe that we’re going to be able to hold on to our Democratic seats and flip a whole bunch more,” she said.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/0-1024x586.png,,,2025-12-10 14:57:34.566527

Jeff Irwin (D-Ann Arbor), left, and Ed McBroom (R-Waucedah Township), right, have proposed to create a new oversight committee covering both chambers of the Legislature. Legislation recently introduced by a bipartisan duo in the Michigan Senate would create a new oversight committee covering both chambers of the Legislature, and would include an equal number of representatives and senators from both sides of the political aisle.
Adding to the intrigue is the fact that the senators behind the push want to put the choice before voters, and not just members of the Legislature.
The committee was proposed by state Sen. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann Arbor) and state Sen. Ed McBroom (R-Waucedah Township). It would be authorized to subpoena witnesses and to review reports from the Michigan Office of the Auditor General.
“Oversight is a cornerstone of our democracy, because the people of Michigan need to know that government is working for them,” Irwin said in a statement. “But our current process of legislative oversight is controlled by the majority party in each chamber, leading to inconsistency and perceptions of bias. The work of holding government accountable is too important to leave in partisan hands.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Rosie Jones, spokesperson for Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids), did not say whether Brinks supported the measure, but did say the Senate would review the legislation now that it’s been introduced.
A message seeking comment from House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) was not returned at the time of publication.
For McBroom the committee would be a chance to ensure consistency in oversight matters that would no longer be steered by pure politics.
“When I chaired the Senate Oversight Committee, I saw how lack of consistency and changes in partisan control undermine the Legislature’s ability to protect people when government fails them,” McBroom said. “Our proposal would enable voters to adopt methods that have proven effective in other states and put them to work for the people of Michigan.”
The package includes Senate Joint Resolution G, from Irwin, which would put a proposal on the ballot in a future election to empower Michigan voters by giving them the choice. The move would amend the state Constitution to allow for the committee’s creation. Independent staff support would be baked into the committee to keep it insulated from political pressure from the respective parties.
McBroom’s Senate Bill 734 would codify the committee if the amendment passes, including implementation details and the procedures of appointing members, filling vacancies and removing members, if need be.
The proposed committee would consist of eight members: two each appointed by the House Speaker and the House minority leader; and two each appointed by the respective majority and minority leaders of the Senate. No more than four seats can be held by a single political party.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_1178-1024x572.jpg,,,2025-12-10 14:57:34.566527

Obamacare/Marketplace participation hits record levels — but skyrocketing medical costs, expiring subsidies, and insurer rate hikes threaten affordability; experts say it’s time to consider HSAs and price transparency
WILMINGTON — Delaware is experiencing its highest Affordable Care Act enrollment since the program launched, but the celebration comes with a warning: the state’s health-care costs are rising so sharply that many residents may soon see their premiums double.
More than 53,000 Delawareans are enrolled in the ACA marketplace for 2025 — up from about 23,000 in 2019 — representing a dramatic expansion of coverage and a significant shift in how individuals and families access insurance. Yet behind these record numbers lies a growing affordability crisis driven not by state policy, but by medical inflation, increased utilization of care and structural costs embedded in the health-care system.
For many middle-income Delawareans, the math is simple and sobering: premiums that averaged around $700 a month last year could soon exceed $1,400 when enhanced federal subsidies expire in late 2025. And even with subsidies, Delaware’s underlying premium increases — among the steepest in the country — raise serious questions about whether the system is sustainable.
Enrollment rises, but so do premiums
Delaware’s ACA enrollment trajectory reflects impressive demand:


2019: 23,000 enrollees


2023: 40,000+


2024: 45,000 (including 8,000 paying $10 or less thanks to subsidies)


2025: 53,000


But the same period also brought some of the largest premium hikes Delaware has ever seen. Insurers received approval for increases far above the national average:


Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield: +25%


AmeriHealth Caritas: requested 46%, approved for +34.98%


With inflation cooling in most sectors of the economy, many Delawareans are asking: why are health-care costs going in the opposite direction? And why is Delaware being hit harder than other states?
Why Delaware’s health-care costs are climbing so fast
Rate filings submitted to state regulators offer a candid picture of what insurers say is driving these increases. The pressures fall into several major categories:
1. Medical costs are rising faster than inflation
Hospitals and physicians continue to raise prices, especially in high-cost specialties such as oncology, cardiology, emergency care and surgery. Specialty and biologic drugs — which now account for a significant share of total pharmacy spending — are increasing at double-digit rates.
2. More people are using more care
Since the pandemic, Delawareans have returned to the health-care system in force. Elective procedures are up, chronic conditions are being treated more intensively and demand for mental-health services has surged.
New diagnostic tools and technologies also improve care but come with higher price tags.
3. Labor shortages are driving up hospital expenses
Hospitals across Delaware face workforce shortages, particularly among nurses, technicians and support staff. To maintain staffing, providers are resorting to overtime, bonuses and travel-nurse contracts — all of which significantly increase operating costs.
Those costs are ultimately passed on in the form of higher premiums.
4. Delayed care is becoming more expensive care
Thousands of Delaware residents postponed screenings and treatment during 2020–2021. They are now returning with more advanced conditions, raising average claims costs per patient.
5. Reinsurance and federal formulas are adding cost pressure
Insurers must purchase reinsurance to protect against catastrophic claims — and those protections are becoming more expensive. Federal risk-adjustment formulas also shift money among insurers depending on the health status of their enrollees, adding unpredictability.
6. Medicaid “unwinding” is reshaping the risk pool
As temporary pandemic rules end, many Delawareans are losing automatic Medicaid eligibility and moving back into private plans. This often brings sicker, higher-cost individuals into the marketplace.
7. The healthier you are, the more likely you are to leave
As premiums rise, younger and healthier people disproportionately drop coverage. That leaves insurers with a smaller, sicker, and more expensive population, which forces rates up again — a cycle actuaries call a “death spiral.”
Casscells: Delaware’s cost crisis reflects a deeper structural problem
Retired orthopedic surgeon Dr. Chris Casscells, a policy adviser with A Better Delaware, argues these skyrocketing costs are symptoms of a system that gives patients almost no visibility into prices — and no incentive to shop.
“The Affordable Care Act separated the patient from the actual cost of care,” Casscells says. “Nobody knows what anything costs. Hospitals inflate list prices because reimbursement formulas reward it. Insurers react by raising premiums. And patients are stuck in the middle with no ability to compare or negotiate.”
Casscells believes Delaware’s cost crisis cannot be solved by subsidies alone because subsidies disguise, rather than reduce, the real price of medical care.
“Delaware is drowning in complexity. We need reforms that give patients more control, not more layers of bureaucracy,” he said.
Who really pays for Obamacare in Delaware?
Although enrollment is administered at the state level, the federal government pays:


100% of ACA premium subsidies


90% of Medicaid expansion costs


Delaware pays the remaining 10% of expansion and its regulatory overhead.
This means Delawareans are not facing higher premiums because the state is charging more — but because the cost of care itself is rising far faster than insurers can absorb.
A looming affordability cliff in 2026
The biggest threat on the horizon is the scheduled expiration of enhanced federal subsidies at the end of 2025. These subsidies temporarily discounted premiums for thousands of families.
If Congress does not extend them, the impact could be dramatic:


A family paying $600–$800/month today could face $1,400+/month in 2026


Thousands may drop coverage


Delaware’s uninsured rate could rise for the first time in a decade


The marketplace could destabilize as healthier enrollees exit


For middle-income families — those earning too much for Medicaid but unable to afford unsubsidized coverage — the risk is significant.
Is it time to rethink the model? HSAs and true price transparency
While some lawmakers argue for new rounds of subsidies, Casscells and other center-right policy advocates say Delaware should strengthen consumer-driven health-care tools instead of expanding dependence on federal aid.
Two strategies top the list:
1. Health Savings Accounts (HSAs)
HSAs allow individuals to:


Save tax-free


Spend on health-care expenses they choose


Build long-term savings for future medical needs


Shop for lower-priced providers and services


Supporters argue that HSAs create incentives that the current system lacks: comparison-shopping, cost awareness and personal responsibility. They also offer families an alternative to high premiums by pairing HSAs with lower-cost, high-deductible plans.
2. Real price transparency
Casscells and A Better Delaware say Delaware should require hospitals and providers to publicly post prices for common procedures — MRIs, X-rays, surgeries, tests — allowing patients to compare costs just as they would for any other major purchase.
“Until Delawareans know what care actually costs, affordability will always be an illusion,” Casscells said.

Editor’s Fact Check: Why premiums are doubling
Premiums for many ACA customers are increasing by 100% or more due to:


Expiring federal subsidies


Insurer rate hikes of 25%–35%


Rising medical costs and higher utilization


A shrinking risk pool as healthy enrollees exit


Example: A family paying $700/month in 2024 may pay more than $1,400/month in 2026 without renewed subsidies.
The bottom line
Delaware’s ACA marketplace is larger than ever — but also more expensive than ever to maintain. Enrollment continues to rise, yet premiums are rising even faster, revealing the state’s growing dependence on federal subsidies and a health-care system struggling under its own weight.
As Delaware approaches a potential affordability cliff in 2026, policymakers face a choice: continue relying on temporary subsidies to mask the cost of care, or pursue reforms — like HSAs and true price transparency — that give patients more control and may ultimately slow the relentless rise of health-care costs.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/educatingprovidersGettyImages1374010907.jpg,,,2025-12-10 14:57:34.566527

(Photo by Jim Neuger/Maine Morning Star)A nonpartisan survey has Gov. Janet Mills leading Graham Platner by ten points in the U.S. Senate Democratic primary, though the sizable number of undecided voters coupled with the political novice’s hold on younger Mainers shows the race is still anyone’s game.
The findings were among the results of Portland-based Pan Atlantic Research’s 67th statewide poll, which surveyed 820 likely Maine voters between Nov. 29 and Dec. 7. 
Overall, the two-term governor leads Platner, a veteran and oyster farmer from Sullivan, 47% to 37% among a subset of 318 likely Democratic primary voters, with 1% voicing support for David Costello, another candidate. The pollster notes that the margins of error for specific sub-samples are higher than the ±3.7% margin of sampling error for the entire sample.
In Maine’s more conservative 2nd Congressional District, Mills, widely considered a centrist, leads 54% to 23%, whereas in the 1st District Platner — whose campaign platform includes numerous progressive policy positions — has a slight edge (45% to 43%).
Support for the candidates varies strongly by age and gender, with 56% of women and 66% of Democratic voters above 55 years old preferring Mills. Platner leads by more than 40% among those voters aged 18-34 and for those between 35 and 54 he’s also ahead 53% to 33%.
With the June 9 primary more than half a year away, 14% of likely Democratic voters say they are still undecided. 
The Pan Atlantic survey is the first independent poll to gauge Mainers’ thoughts after the dust settled on revelations that Platner had a tattoo, now covered, that resembled a Nazi symbol, as well as a history of sharing racially insensitive, misogynistic, homophobic and anti-police comments online.
The poll follows an October survey from the University of New Hampshire conducted as Platner’s controversies were first being reported, which had him leading Mills.
National progressive group throws support behind Graham Platner

As for how either candidate would stack up against Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins in the November general election, the poll shows a tight race with Mills and Collins tied at 43% and Platner ahead by one point (43% to 42%). In both match-ups, the number of undecided voters hovers around 15%.
Both Mills and Collins are currently underwater in terms of overall favorability among Maine voters. The survey found the governor has a net favorability rating of -8, compared to Collins’ -17 (comparing the percentage of those who have a positive and negative view of her). Republican President Donald Trump has a net favorability of -19 among Mainers.
Mainers say they are feeling pinched
The survey also asked respondents about their top concerns as well as their thoughts on the overall direction of the state.
When asked about the three most important issues facing the state today, 68% of Mainers mentioned inflation or cost of living, followed by health care (41%) and housing (37%).
Forty-six percent of respondents said that their household is financially “worse off” than they were a year ago, compared to 14% who said their household is “better off.” Sixty-six percent of respondents said they expect their finances to remain the same or get worse next year.
When asked if they think the State of Maine is generally headed in the right direction, or on the wrong track, 32% agreed with the current trajectory compared with 48% who do not. Twenty percent said they aren’t sure.
That answer was skewed a bit by partisan lines, with 55% of Democrats saying that the state is headed in the right direction compared to 20% of independents and 19% of Republicans.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DSC1889-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-10 14:57:34.566527

(Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)Midwest Environmental Advocates filed a lawsuit Tuesday against the Wisconsin Public Service Commission seeking to force the release of unredacted documents showing how much electricity will be used at Meta’s planned data center in Beaver Dam. 
In a news release, MEA said it had sought electrical load projections for data center projects in Beaver Dam and Port Washington in an October open records request. The PSC initially provided the firm with versions that redacted the electrical load information. MEA sent a follow-up request seeking unredacted versions of the document. 
The PSC sent the unredacted version of the Port Washington project but denied the request for the Beaver Dam project, claiming it contained trade secrets. 
Wisconsin’s open records law allows government agencies to deny records requests if the information within the document is a trade secret, however MEA disputes that the amount of energy Meta plans to request for its data center counts. 
“It appears the PSC is unlawfully withholding this information because either Meta or a public utility is claiming the electricity demand for the data center is a trade secret,” MEA legal fellow Michael Greif said in a statement. “We call on Alliant Energy, American Transmission Company and Meta to be forthright with the public about their plans. These companies are asking a lot of the public and the public deserves, at least the very least, basic information about the data center’s massive energy needs.” 
Data center projects across the country are often shrouded in secrecy. A study in Virginia found that at least 80% of local governments involved with data center proposals had signed non-disclosure agreements with the data center companies — though it’s unclear how an NDA would be enforceable against Wisconsin’s public records laws. 
Earlier this year, MEA filed a separate lawsuit to force the city of Racine to release records related to the projected water use at Microsoft’s planned data center in Mount Pleasant.

Josh Hawley is ratcheting up pressure on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to finish a study into medication abortion and to change its prescribing guidelines, sending a letter to Commissioner Marty Makary on Wednesday that the pace of the review is ""totally unacceptable.""The letter came just one day after leading anti-abortion groups called on President Donald Trump to fire Makary, following a report from Bloomberg Law that he planned to delay the agency’s review into mifepristone until past the November midterm elections. Hawley wrote in the two-page letter he posted to social media that it was “unclear” whether the FDA was actually conducting a review of the current prescribing guidelines and the safety of medication abortion. “There are more abortions in America now than when Roe was still law,” Hawley wrote, referring to the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling from the Supreme Court, which established the constitutional right to an abortion. “And this is largely because of the chemical abortion drug and its generics, like the one you approved.”Hawley asked Makary to reply to three questions before Dec. 15, including whether the FDA is “conducting a comprehensive safety review of mifepristone separate from the (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies) process,” if Makary delayed any safety reviews of mifepristone and if the FDA has plans to revert prescribing guidelines to require in-person dispensing. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, which includes the FDA, said that “FDA’s comprehensive scientific reviews take the time necessary to get the science right, and that is what Dr. Makary is ensuring as part of the Department's commitment to gold-standard science and evidence-based reviews.”Second day of pressure on MakaryHawley’s letter continued the public pressure campaign from anti-abortion organizations and lawmakers that began Tuesday when leaders at Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America and Live Action called for Makary to be fired over the Bloomberg Law news story reporting he had delayed the review of mifepristone over political considerations related to the midterm elections.Americans United for Life CEO John Mize released a statement after meeting with Makary, saying it “is glaringly obvious that flawed political calculations” have stalled the FDA’s review of mifepristone, but not calling for him to lose his job over it. Access to mifepristoneMifepristone is one of two pharmaceuticals used in medication abortion. It is approved for up to 10 weeks gestation and can be prescribed via telehealth and shipped to patients. Reducing or eliminating access to mifepristone has become a linchpin of the anti-abortion movement since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the nationwide right to an abortion in 2022. Anti-abortion medical organizations, represented by Alliance Defending Freedom senior counsel Erin Morrow Hawley, tried unsuccessfully to have the Supreme Court revert the prescribing guidelines for mifepristone in 2024. Josh Hawley and Erin Morrow Hawley are married. Numerous medical organizations, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, filed briefs to the justices in that case attesting to the safety and efficacy of medication abortion. “The scientific evidence is overwhelming: major adverse events occur in less than 0.32% of patients,” the groups wrote. “The risk of death is almost non-existent.”",,,,2025-12-10 14:57:34.566527

The tracts include working forests, wetlands, grassland, and other valuable wildlife habitat, ranging in size from 24 to 990 acres, according to a statement by Paula Bellemore, the program’s executive director. The Land and Community Heritage Investment Program also provides funding for conservation of historic buildings including museums and antique buildings that remain in use, such as the “little red” schoolhouse in Croydon and the home of poet Robert Frost, both of which also received funding this cycle.
Grant awards to all 31 projects totaled $3.5 million. 
Eleven of the projects are primarily focused on land conservation. Among these is the planned preservation of 410 acres along Ayers Pond in Barrington, including the “last undeveloped stretch” of shoreline on the pond, according to the statement. The habitat is a home to species including loons and Blanding’s turtles, which are considered endangered in New Hampshire. The property will be placed into conservation with the Southeast Land Trust of New Hampshire.
Also receiving funding was an effort to preserve of 655 acres in the Nelson Highlands Forest in southwestern New Hampshire that will help fill in conservation lands in the Quabbin-to-Cardigan corridor, a stretch of wildlands between the Quabbin Reservoir outside Amherst, Massachusetts, and Cardigan Mountain in Orange, New Hampshire. The tract includes habitat for animals including moose, bobcats and bears, and unique ecosystems including high-elevation spruce forests, according to the release.
Other land conservation projects funded: 28 and 24 acre parcels in and near the Great Bay estuary; 56 acres in Farmington; 101 acres in Kingston; 133 acres in Madbury; 141 acres in Mason; 31 acres in Northumberland; 205 acres in Nottingham; and 990 acres in Springfield.
The Land and Community Heritage Investment Program was created in 2000 and is funded through a $25 surcharge on deeds, mortgages, mortgage discharges, and plans processed at county registries of deeds. The program has so far provided 646 grants for historic building and land conservation, contributing to the conservation of more than 247,000 acres, according to the release. To claim the grants, communities must put forward a portion of funding themselves. 
“Strategic public investment in land and heritage yields lasting benefits in community vitality, environmental health, and economic resilience,” said Bellemore in the statement.

Rounds asked Inspector General of the U.S. Postal Service Tammy Hull to find the “root cause” of mail problems in the state and consider the need for a regional processing facility in South Dakota, according to a news release Wednesday.
Newspaper officials told South Dakota Searchlight in May that it took over a week for some publications to travel less than 100 miles away, and others reported lost deliveries.
Rounds said the postmaster general told him earlier this year that processing facility issues in Chicago, St. Louis and Kansas City caused mail delays in South Dakota, yet according to Rounds, none of those facilities handle South Dakota’s intrastate mail.
Small-town newspapers say mail delays are crippling their business

“I believe these issues are caused by the flawed design of the USPS network,” Rounds wrote in a letter to the Postal Service, “which all but guarantees that mail traveling across or to South Dakota must travel in a circuitous manner through locations around and outside of the state.”
In a September article from the Tri-State Livestock News, the company’s distribution manager Amy Oster said most newspapers being delivered to South Dakotans are sorted to Denver or Omaha. The Denver facility isn’t “equipped or updated to handle the additional mail supply,” Oster said. The newspaper invested in private drop-offs in some South Dakota zip codes for faster service.
The bulk of eastern South Dakota’s outgoing mail distributions were outsourced to Fargo and Omaha, the Dakota Scout reported in 2024.
Rounds added in the letter that, in addition to newspaper subscriptions, the delays are affecting mailed medicine.
Rounds, along with Senate Majority Leader John Thune and Rep. Dusty Johnson, advocated against downsizing or reorganization of USPS processing in South Dakota last year, leading to the Postal Service pausing a controversial plan to downgrade the Huron processing center. Rounds introduced legislation to protect rural mail processing facilities and is carrying legislation to better inform constituents of proposed changes in service.

Alander Rocha/Georgia RecorderPolice escorted demonstrators from a Georgia Public Service Commission meeting on Wednesday morning following the introduction of a surprise agreement between commission staff and Georgia Power, the utility it is charged with regulating.
The commission is set to discuss a request from Georgia Power to increase the state’s energy capacity by nearly 10,000 megawatts, equal to about five Hoover Dams, to meet an expected spike in demand because of new energy-hungry data center growth. Staff initially recommended approving only about one-third of the utility’s request and granting conditional approval to another third but changed their recommendation to agree with Georgia Power to move forward with the full request.

Several people disrupted the start of proceedings with chants of “Rein in Georgia Power” and “Power to the people, not Georgia Power,” and were escorted out. According to law enforcement, no one was arrested, and some people were allowed to return to the hearing.
Georgia Power spokesperson Matthew Kent said in a statement that the company welcomes “all public comment during this important process, but these public hearings are in professional settings that require an amount of decorum.”
In exchange for allowing Georgia Power’s energy buildout of at least $16 billion, with 90% of it intended to power data center growth, Georgia Power promised to lower power bills by about $100 a year in its subsequent rate case proceedings. Because Georgia Power and the commission agreed to a three-year rate freeze, the promised savings wouldn’t be considered by the commission until after 2028.
“This plan means more money stays in your pocket while we power Georgia’s future,” said Georgia Power’s head, Kim Greene, in a statement.
But environmental organizations involved in the proceedings weren’t convinced about Georgia Power’s promise that the deal would lead to “downward pressure” on customers’ power bills. Jennifer Whitfield, a senior attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center, said during lunch break that there is no guarantee the decrease will ever materialize, and it was unclear what the customer got out of the deal.
“It doesn’t mean that in 2029 residential customers will see their bills go down. What it means is that when they do all the various accounting, they promise that if we have a rate case — which we may not — that this class of customers will put downward pressure on the costs otherwise attributed to residential customers, which is just a really long, complicated way of saying, ‘we don’t know what’s going to happen,’” Whitfield said.
At the start of the hearing, Whitfield asked commissioners for additional time to review the agreement, saying they had not had enough time because they became aware of it on their commute to the hearing. PSC Chair Jason Shaw said that, because of the public hearings, lawyers for the advocacy organizations had the morning to review the agreement and could leave the room if they wished.
“There’ll be some more time there. We will probably not even get to the hearing until after lunch,” Shaw said.

Birch Building in Nashville, citing ""threats"" by a Tennessee congressman. (Photo: Brad Freeman, Metropolitan Nashville General Sessions Court)Metro Nashville General Sessions Court judges are asking for heightened security following inflammatory comments by a U.S. representative who excoriated them in connection with the case of a man charged with raping a woman who later died after earlier charges against him were dismissed. 
The judges issued a statement Tuesday saying they directed increased security at the Justice A.A. Birch Courthouse in downtown Nashville in response to remarks by Ogles that “appeared intended to incite violence against elected officials in Davidson County.”
“We stand united in condemning any language or actions that target judges – with threats of violence as a means of expressing political disagreement. In light of the numerous acts of political violence witnessed in recent years, the statements made by Mr. Ogles are unacceptable,” the judges said in a joint statement.
The group of judges also sent a formal request to Gov. Bill Lee seeking “immediate steps” for public safety and security around the courthouse. They made the requests after Ogles posted a comment on social media about Somali migrant Muhammad A. Muhammad who is charged with raping a woman at a Nolensville church. She later died. Ogles said the man had been arrested more than 12 times, mostly on minor charges that were dismissed, according to the post on X, formerly Twitter, initially reported by WSMV.

“Every judge and prosecutor who let him off the hook was a Democrat. As long as local liberals are running things in Middle Tennessee, we are at war. The state should impeach all of the judges. Send the (Tennessee National Guard)guard to Nashville,” Ogles said in the post that included pictures of judges.
The 5th District congressman has followed the lead of President Donald Trump in going after immigrants, including Somalians. The man charged in this case reportedly has legal status.
Ogles previously criticized Metro Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell for his opposition to a federal sweep of South Nashville streets in May for immigrant residents. 
The governor deployed National Guard troops to Memphis in September following a memo by President Donald Trump to reduce crime in the city with a task force of hundreds of local, state and federal officers.
Early Wednesday, Ogles continued to rail against the jurists, saying on Facebook, “If woke Davidson judges want more security in Nashville, they should join me in calling for the National Guard.”
In their letter to Lee, the judges said incidents of political violence have increased in recent years and urged him to boost security.
“The reckless use of violent rhetoric, such as that displayed by Mr. Ogles can embolden the most extreme elements and lead to tragic consequences,” their letter said.
The governor’s office didn’t respond to questions Wednesday about increasing security at the courthouse.

Under these waivers, SNAP benefits cannot be used to purchase items that list sugar, corn syrup, high-fructose corn syrup or similar caloric alternatives as the first ingredient. The waivers also exclude beverages in which carbonated water and sugar, high-fructose corn syrup or similar caloric alternatives are the first two ingredients.
The waivers also allow Tennessee SNAP recipients to purchase hot prepared chicken, including rotisserie chicken and “non-fried, non-breaded items like grilled chicken tenders.”
Gov. Bill Lee requested the waivers from the federal government in August.
Nearly 734,000 Tennesseans received about $1.4 billion in SNAP benefits in fiscal year 2022, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The average monthly benefit in Tennessee is $161 per person.
The waivers, approved by U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins and U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., are part of the administration’s Make America Healthy Again initiative. The USDA has now approved waivers for 18 states, including Hawaii, Missouri, North Dakota, South Carolina, Virginia, Arkansas, Iowa, Utah, Colorado, Louisiana, West Virginia, Florida, Nebraska, Idaho, Oklahoma, Indiana, Texas and Tennessee.
“With these new waivers, we are empowering states to lead, protecting our children from the dangers of highly-processed foods, and moving one step closer to the President’s promise to Make America Healthy Again,” Rollins stated in a news release.

,DC,2025-12-10 18:30:22+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"US House GOP promises vote on reducing health care premiums, but few specifics disclosed",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-gop-promises-vote-reducing-health-care-premiums-few-specifics-disclosed,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson committed Wednesday to hold a vote next week on a package of bills that he said would lower health insurance premiums for hundreds of millions of Americans, not just those enrolled in Affordable Care Act plans. But the Louisiana Republican’s promise didn’t come with any details about which bills would be included in the package or whether the legislation will have the GOP votes needed to pass, amid vastly different views among his members about the federal government’s role in health care. “You're going to see a package come together that will be on the floor next week that will actually reduce premiums for 100% of Americans who are on health insurance,” Johnson said. That will be a challenging task for Johnson and other House Republican leaders since they hold an especially narrow 220-213 majority. Democrats are unlikely to support GOP bills that don’t extend the enhanced tax credits for people who buy their health insurance through the ACA marketplace. Without the tax credit subsidies, costs are expected to rise sharply.House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., said just after a closed-door meeting of House GOP lawmakers on health care that leaders were still finalizing which bills would go into the package. “We showed a list of what the three committees of jurisdiction have been working on for months today. And then encouraged all the members to give their feedback. And they did,” Scalise said. “A lot of members spoke today at the mic, which we want. They gave their feedback. And frankly, a lot of it was very positive about those bills.”Senate votes ThursdayThe House bills are part of a larger debate in Congress and at the White House about the rising cost of living, including health care affordability, that surged to the forefront in October and November after Democrats shut down the government. Senate Democrats throughout the six-week shutdown demanded a vote to extend the enhanced ACA marketplace tax credits, which are set to expire at the end of the year.Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., promised Democrats a floor vote on a health care bill of their choosing in exchange for votes to end the shutdown. The Senate is expected to vote Thursday on a Democratic bill that would extend enhanced ACA marketplace tax credits for three years.The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that proposal would increase the federal deficit by $83 billion during the next decade. That three-year extension would boost the number of people with health insurance by 400,000 in 2026, 3 million in 2027, 4 million in 2028, and 1.1 million in 2029, compared to current law. Senators will also vote Thursday on legislation from Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy and Idaho Sen. Mike Crapo, both Republicans, that would provide up to $1,500 annually for people who buy either bronze or catastrophic health insurance plans from the ACA marketplace.The funding would go directly into a Health Savings Account for people between the ages of 18 and 64 who make up to 700% of the federal poverty level. That would be about $109,550 for one person or $225,050 for a family of four. The funding would last for 2026 and 2027 but end after that. Neither proposal is expected to get the 60 votes needed to advance under the Senate’s legislative filibuster rule. Even if a bill moved through the Senate, it would still need to get a House vote, a prospect that seemed like a long shot now that House GOP leaders are putting out a package of their own. Abortion coverageSouth Carolina Republican Rep. Ralph Norman said after the conference meeting that “the devil’s in the details” of exactly which bills go to the floor but added GOP lawmakers had begun to form a ""consensus.""Maryland Republican Rep. Andy Harris said he doesn’t believe GOP lawmakers are responsible for addressing any aspect of the Affordable Care Act, including the expiring tax credits. “It's not our responsibility to fix Obamacare,” Harris said. “They broke it. They should fix it.”Harris, chairman of the far-right Freedom Caucus, said he wouldn’t support any bill to extend the enhanced ACA marketplace tax credits unless it restricted abortion access in those health insurance plans to only cases of rape, incest, or the life of the pregnant patient. That issue has become a central negotiating point for many GOP lawmakers, even those who are open to extending the tax credits a little while longer. ‘Moment of truth’Democrats argue adding those constraints, often referred to as the Hyde Amendment, is unacceptable and would represent a new restriction on abortion access. “I don't understand when you've had a number of Republicans in the House and the Senate say they get it, this is a disaster to have these premiums double and triple, why they want to mess around right now and put abortion politics into the middle of this,” Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar said. “They know that that's not going to work.”Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the only proposal on the table to extend the enhanced ACA marketplace tax credits, avoiding a surge in premiums next year, is the Democratic bill. “Tomorrow is a moment of truth for the Republicans here in the Senate,” Schumer said. “Are they going to bring health care costs down, or will they sit by and let premiums explode for millions of Americans?”Jacob Fischler contributed to this report.",,,,2025-12-10 13:57:44.698332

A gas company serving one of the most economically distressed areas in Massachusetts is looking to dramatically raise rates, prompting intense backlash and raising scrutiny of its spending habits.
Liberty Utilities, which services a small southeastern pocket of Massachusetts, filed its rate hike request in June and is asking the Department of Public Utilities for permission to raise gas rates by about 55% on average. DPU now has until May 31 to make a decision.
The company delivers gas for heating and cooking to customers in Fall River, the 10th-largest city in Massachusetts with a median household income less than half of the statewide average, along with eight surrounding towns like North Attleboro and Westport.
“No matter how you slice it, for my district, this is exorbitant,” said Rep. Carole Fiola, a Democrat who represents Fall River. “This was a shock to a lot of people. It will be very difficult for many people to afford this increase.”
It’s also a direct shot at Gov. Maura Healey’s affordability push.
Healey has based her energy agenda on a drumbeat of policy steps aimed at addressing high gas and electric costs and reducing or removing charges from utility bills to save ratepayers money. Liberty’s rate increase, if approved, would prompt dramatic sticker shock in a Gateway City and directly fly in the face of Healey’s effort.
DPU declined to comment on the rate case.
Pamela Bellings, a spokesperson for Liberty, which is owned by Canada-based Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp., defended the rate request in a statement, saying that the company has made “substantial investments” to comply with new pipeline safety regulations and enhance system reliability. Liberty serves customers in New Hampshire, Georgia, Iowa, Illinois, and Missouri, in addition to Massachusetts.
“We recognize the financial challenges many in our community are facing and have carefully assessed ways to smooth the impact to customer bills,” Bellings said. “A rate adjustment is necessary to help maintain compliance with all new regulations and continue delivering safe and reliable service to customers.”
The company is now negotiating the rate hike proposal with the state attorney general and other groups. For now, though, Liberty ratepayers are in the lurch.
Liberty’s rate hike request would raise monthly bills anywhere from $33 to $103 a month depending on the customer’s location and income level in order to recover nearly $95 million. The company last raised rates a decade ago, in 2015, it said in its DPU filing, and the majority of this request is to recover costs for pipe replacement and repair that are associated with the state’s Gas System Enhancement Plan, which have ballooned in recent years.
Liberty is also seeking to recover costs for improvements to the company’s customer information system and the relocation of its headquarters in Fall River.
If DPU approves Liberty’s plan, gas bills could rise 90% by 2030 — prompting “rate shock that will significantly burden ratepayers,” Timothy Newhard, a financial analyst in the state attorney general’s office, testified to the DPU in October.
The pure size of the rate hike request is putting a spotlight on Liberty’s gas system infrastructure work to fix leaky old pipes, the main driver of the company’s proposed bill increases. Newhard goes a step further, adding that Liberty is looking to profit from its “budgetary mismanagement” by recovering more than $40 million in a deferred GSEP revenue balance and recommending that DPU limit Liberty’s ability to charge ratepayers for those costs under reforms that the department adopted earlier this year.
The rate request has unsurprisingly attracted a large amount of scrutiny — and pointed criticism.
Sen. Michael Rodrigues, chair of the Senate Ways and Means Committee whose district spans the South Coast, including Fall River, said that “now is not the time” for Liberty’s rate hike.
“This move by Liberty, on the heels of a federal government that continues to shirk its responsibilities in providing food and housing subsidies, is unacceptable,” he said. “The cost of replacing their aging infrastructure should not be entirely borne by the consumer.”
Healey, meanwhile, said in a statement that this proposal “could not come at a worse time for families and businesses in southeastern Mass.”
“My administration will be pushing back in the review process and will oppose additional burdens on ratepayers,” she said.
State officials, including Department of Energy Resources Commissioner Elizabeth Mahony, appeared at an October DPU hearing to oppose Liberty’s request, alongside irate members of the public.
It’s the exact scenario Healey has increasingly tried to fend off. She blasted other more modest rate hike requests from the state’s larger utilities earlier this year, called on DPU to comprehensively review gas and electric rates to find ways to lower costs, and filed landmark energy affordability legislation that has yet to gain traction as the winter season hits. DPU approved gas rate increases for other companies of up to 30% last year, which prompted an outcry from consumers.
“I, too, am concerned about the size of the rate increase proposed by Liberty,” Mahony said in the hearing. “People are struggling every day to afford rising energy bills, and the 55% increase in rates proposed by Liberty is shocking.”
Dan Dolan, president of the New England Power Generators Association, said the rate request highlights the tradeoffs associated with the state’s decarbonization goals. Electrifying homes through heat pumps requires significant upfront capital costs but offers savings down the line. Slow uptake, however, means dealing with the burdensome transmission and supply costs of maintaining the gas distribution system.
“The fact that that is now coinciding with the sharpest political refocus on electric affordability that has happened in decades in Massachusetts and frankly, across the nation, is going to create an extraordinarily politically volatile situation,” Dolan said.
Liberty is also asking regulators to approve a 9.9% return on equity, which is the allowed rate of profit for the utility’s shareholders through capital investments. Though that rate of return isn’t out of the ordinary, it would still be tied for DPU’s highest approved return on equity in the past five years, according to Liberty’s own filings.
The rate hike request has also spawned debates about what kinds of costs utilities should be allowed to recover from customers in the first place. The Energy & Policy Institute, a nonprofit watchdog organization, is pushing legislation in Massachusetts to bar utilities from using ratepayer money for lobbying, investor relations, litigation and DPU cases, and lavish expenses for boards of directors.
Liberty’s rate case includes roughly $675,000 in these expenses, and removing these items would save ratepayers on average roughly $11 per year, according to the Energy & Policy Institute.
Still, that represents a small fraction of the $80 average monthly bill increase that Liberty is seeking for Fall River customers.
The state attorney general’s office said in DPU filings earlier this year regarding the utilities’ GSEP plans that the utilities have “little regard for targeted replacement and prudent cost management” under the Gas System Enhancement Program and that GSEP capital expenditures have increased by about 12% per year over the past decade because the companies have almost exclusively chosen to replace rather than repair leak-prone pipe.
Liberty, like most other gas utilities in the state, did not “demonstrate compliance” with its 2024 GSEP work plan approved by DPU and exceeded its cap by nearly $38 million, according to the attorney general, money that the company is now attempting to recover.
Getting DPU to approve such a large rate hike request will be a tall order, said Christopher Knittel, associate dean for climate and sustainability at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. But the fact that Liberty is requesting the bill increases in the first place cuts both ways.
“It’s certainly possible that they’re trying to play a more complex bargaining game and that they are trying to settle on a number that is close to what they really need,” Knittel said. “The DPU will obviously try to cut costs wherever possible, but the fact that they’re asking for it in this environment might signal that these are actually really legitimate because this is not going to play well.”

The Michigan House Education and Workforce Committee unanimously approved two bills that would let students opt out of the workforce-readiness part of the state’s standardized test, which measures preparedness for skilled trades. 
The bills would also introduce new informational materials for districts to distribute about the importance of the test, which representatives from multiple trade associations noted as a strong positive. 
The bills, House Bill 4836 and Senate Bill 349, were authored by Rep. Brad Paquette (R-Niles) and Sen. Dayna Polehanki (D-Livonia), respectively, both of whom formerly taught high school juniors who had to take the tests in question.  
“They’re designed to give Michigan students and families more flexibility in their educational journey by allowing an opt out,” Polehanki said. “We need to do an even better job to promote the skilled trades as a viable career option for students who are not college bound by still requiring the state to offer and pay for this test for kids who may want to go into the skilled trades.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
She emphasized that the bill requires students and their parents to actively opt out of the test if they choose to do so, meaning that the decision will be “thoughtful and informed.”
Robert Mead, a training coordinator at UA Local 85, a plumbers and pipefitters union out of Saginaw, noted that students often do not take the tests seriously because they do not understand the importance, even if they hope to go into the skilled trades. 
The information distributed to educate students and parents on the ability to opt out, he said, would also play an important role in their understanding of what the tests are used for. 
“This opens the door for many more people, including those who didn’t have the best academic support growing up, to enter the trades and succeed,” he said. “At a time when our state and our country are facing a massive skilled trades shortage, we can’t afford to bring in unprepared workers. We can’t afford to turn away people who can thrive with the right support. Testing helps us solve those problems.”
Polehanki’s Senate version of the bill has already been approved by the state Senate, which voted unanimously in August to approve it. Both bills will now go to the House floor for a full chamber vote.

After nearly 140 years of Lumbee recognition efforts, the pending vote puts the prospect closer than ever before. Should the bill pass, they will become the largest federally recognized tribe east of the Mississippi River at more than 55,000 members.
“For decades, the Lumbee People have sought full federal recognition — and today, we are closer than ever to making it a reality,” Harris said in a statement. “We have used every tool at our disposal to secure recognition in this year’s NDAA. I’m deeply grateful to President Trump for his longstanding championship of the Lumbee Tribe and for working across both chambers of Congress to deliver the full federal recognition and rights our people deserve.”
President Donald Trump has promised recognition since hitting the campaign trail in North Carolina in 2020, and during last year’s race, both he and Vice President Kamala Harris pledged to deliver it. Just three days after his inauguration, he directed the Interior Department to explore all legal pathways for recognition.

“I love the Lumbee Tribe,” Trump said in the Oval Office in January. “So, this is the first big step, right? They were with me all the way, they were great.”
Lumbee recognition has polarized federally recognized tribes across the U.S., with roughly 235 backing their bid and more than 100 opposed. The most vocal opposition has come from the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, who are currently the only recognized tribe based in North Carolina.
In a statement Monday, Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians Principal Chief Michell Hicks said that the Lumbee have failed to meet the historical and legal requirements for recognition.
“We are deeply disappointed and alarmed to see the inclusion of Lumbee recognition language in the National Defense Authorization Act,” Hicks said. “Once recognition is granted without an evidentiary review, the standing of all federally acknowledged tribal nations becomes more vulnerable to political shifts rather than being anchored in history and law.”
The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians maintains that the recognition process must go through the Bureau of Indian Affairs, which has an existing process for vetting claims. The Lumbee argue that because of a 1956 congressional act explicitly denying them federal rights and benefits, only Congress has the power to grant them full recognition.
Wilkins disputed the Cherokee argument, noting that the congressional recognition process long predates the executive branch’s process for vetting claims.
“They’ve gone through the proper route, constitutionally speaking,” he said. “[The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians] have tried out every argument they can muster, and this is their latest one, and it doesn’t bear out in any historical or constitutional way.
Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), a longtime supporter of Lumbee recognition, said in November that “anyone with doubts” should visit Robeson County and see their culture and history firsthand. (Photo: Senate.gov)
Tillis pushed back on skepticism over Lumbee history during a hearing of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs on Nov. 5, pointing to countless Lumbee veterans who have served at Fort Bragg and elsewhere. “They’ve done everything this nation has ever asked of them, and all they ask in return is fairness,” he said.
“I invite anyone with doubts to visit Robeson County, Hope County, or Scotland County, go to the University of North Carolina at Pembroke, founded by and for the Lumbee people,” Tillis said at the hearing. “You’ll see the rich Lumbee culture, their deep roots in North Carolina, and their extraordinary contributions to our state and our nation.”
Lumbee Chairman John Lowery declined to comment ahead of Wednesday’s vote, but in testimony before the committee last month, he called on Congress to grant his people full self-determination.
“Today, I stand before you as a leader of a people who have never been afraid to fight, to stand our ground, and to resist oppression. When we are pushed, we push back,” Lowery said. “Congress must move to ensure the Lumbee Indians are no longer second-class Natives in our own land.”
While the recognition issue has received bipartisan support, a litany of disputes over elements of the full National Defense Authorization Act could hinder Wednesday’s vote. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) vowed to vote against the bill on Tuesday, citing disagreements over foreign policy with the Trump administration, and other Republicans have raised concerns over cryptocurrency and anti-DEI provisions removed from the bill.

She earned about 83% of the vote by sitting justices and district court judges. Justice Jerod Tufte, who also sought the role as chief justice, received about 16% of the vote.
“I will work to the best of my ability to serve all the judiciary,” Fair McEvers said after the ballots were counted by court staff Wednesday morning in the Capitol’s Judicial Wing.
She will start in the role on Jan. 1.
“You’ve served the judiciary in your role for many years, and clearly you’ve earned the respect of our colleagues, and so I look forward to supporting you in your leadership,” Tufte told Fair McEvers after the ballots were counted.
Chief justice candidates share ambitions for North Dakota court system

There are five justices and 54 district court judges, meaning a total of 59 people were eligible to vote. The court received 58 ballots.
One ballot was for former Justice Gerald VandeWalle, which could not be counted. VandeWalle served as chief justice from 1993 to 2019 and retired from the bench in 2023.
North Dakota is the only state where the chief justice is elected by a vote of the sitting justices and district court judges, said State Court Administrator Sally Holewa, who led the ballot count.
Fair McEvers has been a Supreme Court justice since 2014, when she was appointed by former Gov. Jack Dalrymple to fill a position vacated by former Justice Mary Muehlen Maring. 
She was then elected to the court to serve a two-year term in 2016 and a 10-year term in 2018.
Fair McEvers previously ran for the position of chief justice in 2019, losing to Justice Jon Jensen.
She told the North Dakota Monitor earlier this month her plans for chief justice include increasing resources for district court judges and phasing out judicial referee positions in state courts.
Fair McEvers is the fourth woman to serve on the North Dakota Supreme Court.
She previously served as assistant state’s attorney for Cass County and commissioner of the North Dakota Department of Labor. Fair McEvers also served as a judge in the East Central Judicial District in Fargo.
The chief justice serves as the face of North Dakota’s judicial system and handles some court-related administrative duties. The chief has no more voting power on the court than the other justices.
“The description that has been used over the years is, the chief justice is the leader among equals,” Chief Justice Jon Jensen told the North Dakota Monitor previously.
Jensen was first elected chief justice in 2019. He said he decided not seek reelection to spend more time with his family. He will remain on the high court.

The federal […]","Julio Rojas speaks with reporters during a Nov. 5, 2025, video call from El Salvador. Rojas was arrested in August in Olathe, where he had lived for nine years, and deported three weeks later. (Kansas Reflector screen capture)TOPEKA — A roving patrol of federal agents chased Julio Rojas through the Olathe streets in August and, after capturing him, put a knee on his neck while they wrapped him in chains.
Like most of the people detained as part of the Trump administration’s mass deportation blitz, Rojas had no criminal record. The federal agents had no warrant for his arrest.
As the 25-year-old bounced from Kansas City to Oklahoma to Louisiana during 23 days in custody, Rojas never had the chance to talk to an attorney and never appeared before a judge. He was placed on a plane at 2 a.m. one morning and flown to El Salvador, where he remains.
“What has impacted me the most is being separated from my child, and to lose everything I had built in 10 years,” he said through an interpreter during a video call with reporters last month.
Rojas was in custody when his son turned 7. The boy remains here with his mother, who has permanent residency.
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has dramatically escalated efforts to round up immigrants at President Donald Trump’s behest, often with disregard for their civil rights. The Trump administration’s fast-track deportation policies have been challenged at least 362 times in federal district courts, The Conversation reported. It has lost 350 of those cases before 160 different judges. The administration continues to defend the lack of due process in deportation proceedings.
Rojas’ traumatic experience is typical of ICE activity in the region, said Genevra Alberti, an immigration attorney in Kansas City, Missouri.
She described roving patrols in unmarked vehicles, with agents who won’t identify themselves or show ID, and who don’t explain why they are taking someone into custody.
Some agents, she said, “clearly get enjoyment out of arresting, detaining noncitizens, even those who have no criminal history and have families, and those people are just having a ball.”
“In a different time, the subjects of those arrests would have thought they were being kidnapped for real, by actual criminals, because of the way this has been done,” Alberti said. “However, because they know that this is going on now, they just assume it’s ICE, but they don’t know that for sure.”
 
‘Another rat to the count’
Rojas grew up in El Salvador and said he came to the United States at age 16 as an asylum seeker, trying to get away from gangs.
He arrived in the Kansas City area in April 2016 and said he struggled to find adequate legal representation. He missed a key hearing, and a deportation order was issued. But as he determined to work through a bewildering appeals process, he made a home in Olathe, started a family, and went to work for Verizon and AT&T, installing internet, he said.
His life was upended one morning in early August when four trucks approached him in his vehicle at an auto parts store. He said they pursued him for about 10 minutes before they stopped him.
He recalled an agent with a gun in his hand.
“He was repeating, ‘Get the f*** on the ground.’ Like, all the time, just yelling at me,” Rojas said. “So all that I did was that I kneeled. I put my hands up. And in no moment I was resisting. He came by, and he hit me in the back. And then he put his knee on my neck.”
The agents put chains on his waist, feet and hands, he said.
“That’s when this officer started saying, ‘There’s another rat to the count,’ ” Rojas said.
He was one of 32,364 people booked by ICE in August 2025, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a data collection center at Syracuse University. The data shows more than 70% of ICE detainees have no criminal record.
Court records show Rojas’ only interaction with the law was a traffic ticket in 2018 for driving without a license. He paid the $100 fine.
“At the beginning, the administration began to say the only people who would be deported are the people who have crimes in the United States,” Rojas said. “But in this moment, how immigrants’ rights are being violated, all of those people who have a deportation order, it doesn’t matter what the reason is.”
After he was taken into custody, Rojas said he overheard a call from Olathe police. They wanted to know why federal agents were chasing somebody through their jurisdiction.
The federal agent’s response, according to Rojas: “Tell that bitch to not mind our business.”
Olathe police Sgt. John Moncayo said “we don’t know anything about what occurred” with Rojas.
“It appears that Mr. Rojas’ story is embellished quite a bit, as we do not have any information to support his claims,” Moncayo said.
Moncayo didn’t answer a Kansas Reflector question about the police department’s relationship with ICE.
 
‘Making this normal’
Alberti, the immigration attorney, said she has clients who were pulled over by federal agents for “literally no reason other than how they looked.”
Then, she said, they are arrested and detained. Some are no longer here. Some are still in custody. None has a criminal history.
She described ICE enforcement in the Kanas City area as “being on steroids.”
“I have never seen or heard of this many sort of roving patrols happening here in this area before,” she said. “And what I mean by that is just ICE themselves pulling people over while they’re driving for no reason. ICE has no authority to pull people over for traffic infractions or anything like that, so they are literally just pulling them over because they look foreign. So basically, a lot of these people are just being pulled over for driving while brown.”
She said it is easy to run when you don’t know who is chasing you. Rojas described his arrest as the moment he was most afraid in his life.
ICE officers aren’t allowed to arrest someone without a warrant, Alberti said, unless they have probable cause to believe the person is a flight risk. But if someone has a removal order, as Rojas did, no warrant is needed.
“One of the scary things is ICE is making it normal to not identify yourself,” Alberti said. “I mean, on top of everything else, they’re wearing masks. Their faces are covered. They look like paramilitaries or bank robbers, for God’s sakes, and they’re making this normal.”
She urged people to pay attention to what is happening with immigration enforcement. Even people “whose hearts are in the right places” are overwhelmed by bad news and have stopped listening, she said.
“I get that it’s necessary for mental health purposes, maybe, to take a break once in a while from listening to the news and just hearing nothing but bad things all the time,” Alberti said. “But right now is not the time to do that. Take a day off and then go back and listen to what’s going on, because apathy is going to ruin this country.”
 
‘Very harsh here’
Rojas said he wore the same clothes for eight days straight at the ICE detention center in Alexandria, Louisiana. At times he went without a toothbrush or blanket. He had one minute one time to make a phone call.
“At no moment did they ever present me with an arrest warrant, did they ever let me see a judge. They never told me anything,” he said.
One night at 8 p.m., officials took him from his cell, held him somewhere else for a few hours, handcuffed and shackled him with chains, then put him on a plane bound for San Salvador, the capital of El Salvador. There, local authorities held him for eight hours to investigate whether he had any outstanding arrest warrants. Then they took him to a place called “the house of the immigrant,” where he was given clothes and shampoo.
He misses his son, and hopes to return to the United States someday, “in the most legal way possible.”
“In this moment, I have been two months without a job. And with the very, very different way that I was easily employed in Kansas City, it is very harsh here,” Rojas said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-11-05-143644-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-12-10 12:58:12.930429

(Photo courtesy of the USDA)When the current outbreak of the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus was detected in dairy cattle in March 2024, a group of researchers at Iowa State University started to ask questions. 
“If this virus can show up in cow milk, can it show up in other types of milk?” Todd Bell, a professor of veterinary pathology at ISU, recalled asking. 
Bell, Rahul Nelli, a research assistant professor of veterinary diagnostic and production animal medicine at ISU, and more than a dozen other researchers examined the mammary glands of commonly milked livestock to find out. 
Their conclusion: the milk-producing glands of production animals like sheep, goats, beef cattle and alpacas, as well as pigs and humans, have the same sialic acids that the virus was able to attach to in dairy cattle. 
Nelli said in theory, this means there is a potential for the virus to bind to these sialic acids, which serve as receptors for the virus, and to start replicating in those cells. 
“So far, we haven’t seen any such scenario yet, but that doesn’t mean it may not happen, because viruses always mutate,” Nelli said.

The team has other elements to research, like how efficiently the virus replicates in mammary glands and if the virus can infect other parts of the body from mammary glands, to fully understand the risk. 
This information would later help regulating agencies, like the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Department of Agriculture to develop policies to contain the spread of the virus. 
The current outbreak of the H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza began in February 2022 and has since impacted more than 184.2 million commercial and backyard poultry. 
The virus spread to dairy cattle in 2024 and since then has been detected in more than 1,000 cows across 18 states, including Iowa. 
Detections of the virus in dairy have persisted in western states, but Iowa has not reported a detection in dairy cattle since July 2024, according to the USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. 
Containing the bird flu has been a priority of U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins since the start of the Trump administration, largely because egg prices had skyrocketed because of the virus.
Nelli said this is the first time the scientific community has seen an avian influenza infect mammary glands, but he said the “intriguing question” is whether or not these viruses have always infected mammary glands and no one thought to look there, or if this is unique to this strain of bird flu.  
Bird flu viruses are typically known to infect respiratory tracts, but Nelli said now that it has been detected elsewhere, in the mammary glands, he believes researchers will have an “open mind” to look at other regions for infection. 
Bell said while the human risk factor of H5N1 is currently rated by the CDC as low, it’s important for scientists to continue looking at all human-animal interfaces, because the risk can “change very quickly.” 
There hasn’t been substantial research into the transmission of the virus from infected milk, however Bell said some infected dairy samples have shown “exceptionally high” amounts of the virus in raw, or unpasteurized, milk. 
The ISU researchers said the best thing to do is to make sure dairy products – from all animals – have been pasteurized. The CDC holds that pasteurization kills the virus and makes dairy products safe to consume. 
“Having this kind of information strengthens that argument of not having the raw milk, because there’s a chance of virus replicating in those glands, there’s a chance of virus coming out of those secretions from those glands, so there’s a chance of having the virus if you consume or inhale that that product,” Nelli said. 
Bell said a main goal of the study, which was published Nov. 27 in the Journal of Dairy Science, is to help farmers and livestock producers to understand where the virus might show up on their farms. 
Bell said future studies will look at other systems in the body, the respiratory tract, the gastrointestinal tract and neurological systems to see if those same receptors are there. He said that research, would help farmers to know potential areas where the virus could spread from animal to animal. 
“If the virus is in large amounts in a water trough, could that potentially be a source of infection? If there’s large amounts on the ground, could that be a source of infection?” Bell said future studies would help to answer. “A lot of those questions haven’t been answered, and we’re trying to answer some of those because this virus is not behaving the way it normally does.”
In the meantime, the researchers suggested farmers remain vigilant to signs like sick animals and dead birds. 
“Be vigilant that this is a time when the birds are flying through your farm,” Nelli said. “Make sure that they don’t interact with any of these animals we looked at, because they all have these receptors, so hence, all these animals, like the sheep, goat, alpaca, they all have a potential to be infected with this virus.”

Josh Stein announces the reversal of Medicaid cuts Dec. 10, 2025. (Photo: Lynn Bonner/NC Newsline)Two successful lawsuits restoring full Medicaid payments to health providers and more lawsuits in the legal pipeline led to his decision to reverse rate cuts imposed this fall, Democratic Gov. Josh Stein announced Wednesday.
In October, the state Department of Health and Human Services reduced rates for medical services between 3% and 10%, saying the cuts were needed because Republican legislators had not provided enough money to cover increased costs for the entire fiscal year.
Legislative leaders have stepped up their criticism of the cuts in recent weeks, saying they’re unnecessary and accusing Stein of playing politics with health care. Republican budget writers said Medicaid had enough money to last until April without cutting rates.
In the last month, judges in two cases reversed cuts to autism therapy providers and adult care facilities’ personal care services. Three more lawsuits have been filed, Stein said, and more were coming.
“DHHS saw the writing on the wall,” he said. “So the department is restoring all provider rates to where they were before the cuts took place.” Stein did, however, note that the program would run out of money before the end of its fiscal year.
Payments will be restored retroactive to Oct. 1, DHHS Secretary Dev Sangvai said. A spokesman for DHHS told NC Newsline  later that coverage of GLP-1 drugs for weight loss would also resume.
More than 3 million North Carolinians use Medicaid as their health insurance. Rural residents are more likely to rely on Medicaid than their urban counterparts.
Health care providers stood behind Stein and Sangvai as they announced the reversal. Several thanked them for restoring rates.
Medicaid pays for 25% of primary care visits, said Dr. Benjamin Simmons, president of the NC Academy of Family Physicians.
“Without adequate funding, many practices faced the difficult possibility of closing their doors or laying off staff, jeopardizing care for all North Carolinians,” Simmons said.
Before the press conference started, Tim Rogers, president and CEO of the Association for Home & Hospice Care of North Carolina, stepped away for his spot next to other providers to tell NC Newsline, “We were one day away from launching our lawsuit. This helps.”
After Sangvai announced the rate cuts in August, Republicans tried but failed to provide the health insurance program with more money. House and Senate leaders deadlocked over spending provisions unrelated to Medicaid funding that Senate leaders included in their proposal.
In November, Republican leaders rejected Stein’s call for a special session to increase Medicaid funding.
At Wednesday’s event, Stein once again criticized Republicans for failing to fully fund Medicaid or pass a comprehensive state budget. “Legislators have said over and over that they will fund Medicaid,” Stein said. “It’s time to stop talking about funding Medicaid. It’s time to start fund Medicaid. It’s not about politics. It’s about people’s lives.”
Sen. Jim Burgin (R-Harnett), a key Senate health budget writer, was in the audience for the announcement. He said he was disappointed in Stein’s tone and his laying blame on Republican legislators.
“I would rather work with people than attack people,” Burgin said.
The state has faced similar issues with Medicaid funding in past years, Burgin said, and it’s always been resolved.
“The rate cuts were an overreaction,” Burgin said. “People lost their jobs because of rate cuts” he said, and they put providers through anguish.
In a statement, House Republicans slammed the cuts as “disastrous and unnecessary,” casting doubt on the likelihood that the Medicaid program would in fact run out of money, but pledging to quickly provide more funds if it does.
“Gov. Stein manufactured a crisis out of thin air, and regular North Carolinians paid the price for it,” said Rep. Larry Potts, R-Davidson, one of the House’s top DHHS budget writers. “I’m glad he’s finally cleaning up his mess, but it should’ve never gotten this far. People deserve steady leadership, not political games.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stein-medicaid-scaled-e1765386957868-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-10 12:58:12.930429

Asked last week whether he would endorse in contested primaries, Stein said, “Let’s see how filing shakes out, and then we’ll have more announcements to come.” 
But his endorsement of Pierce came more than a week before the filing period ends – an unusual move in North Carolina politics.
Pierce drew a challenger in the early days of candidate filing: former Rep. Michael Wray, the longtime state lawmaker who narrowly lost to Pierce in the 2024 Democratic primary. Wray drew the ire of fellow House Democrats for supporting Republican measures and helping Republicans override vetoes by former Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper.
Wray, as he seeks a return to the House, has said his bipartisan approach helped bring in state funds for one of the lowest-income areas of the state. On Monday, he appealed to Republican voters to change their party affiliation and support him in the primary.
“This race is important in determining the future of our public schools, support for our rural communities and our state’s progress,” wrote Pierce, a social studies teacher, on social media.
Morgan Jackson, a political advisor for Stein, confirmed to NC Newsline that Stein was supporting Pierce.
And in a fundraising message Tuesday evening, Stein said Pierce had been “a staunch and leading voice for rural communities” and praised him for upholding his vetoes during override attempts.
The endorsement signals that Stein will not shy away from backing chosen candidates in contested Democratic primaries in the first election cycle since he won the governor’s office.
Pierce won’t be the only Democratic incumbent in the House facing a challenge. 
Rep. Carla Cunningham (D-Mecklenburg), who made headlines and faced criticism from lawmakers and constituents over a controversial floor speech criticizing immigrants, has drawn an opponent. The Rev. Rodney Sadler has filed paperwork to run against Cunningham, who has held office since 2012.
And Rep. Amanda Cook (D-Guilford), who was appointed to replace the embattled former Rep. Cecil Brockman, will also face a primary against Angie Williams-McMichael, a High Point-based higher education leader.
And Rep. Shelly Willingham (D-Edgecombe), a six-term lawmaker who has broken with Democrats on key votes, including helping Republicans to override Stein’s vetoes, is facing a challenge from Patricia Smith of Williamston.

“Throughout her career, Delegate Mundon King has worked to bring people together to get results for the people of Virginia,” Spanberger said in a statement, praising what she called Mundon King’s “dedication, courage, and a commitment to delivering on the promise of our commonwealth.”
Mundon King, who has represented the 23rd District since 2021, said she was “deeply honored” by the opportunity and planned to bring the same emphasis on accessibility and community engagement she has pressed as a delegate. 
“Throughout my career, I have been committed to improving government accessibility and ensuring our institutions work effectively for every community,” she said. “I will bring that same dedication to managing the critical functions of this office while enhancing the delivery of constituent services.”
Her move into Spanberger’s cabinet marks a rapid rise for a lawmaker who has become a prominent Democratic voice on maternal health, reproductive rights, public safety, utility regulation and local-government issues. 
Mundon King currently chairs the House Committee on Counties, Cities and Towns, serves as vice chair of the body’s Public Safety Committee, and sits on the House Finance and Labor and Commerce committees.
Mundon King’s legislative portfolio has stretched across sectors, with signature wins that include pay raises for teachers, protections for victims of human trafficking, paid sick leave for home health-care workers and stronger safeguards for renters facing unauthorized entry by landlords. 
One of her most closely watched efforts — the Contraceptive Equity Act — was part of a coordinated 2024 push with then-Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, now lieutenant governor-elect. The bill requires insurers to cover all FDA-approved contraceptives without out-of-pocket costs, an attempt to strengthen protections once guaranteed under the Affordable Care Act. It passed but later saw a religious exemption added by Gov. Glenn Youngkin.
That same session, she carried a bill aimed at shielding abortion providers from Board of Medicine discipline when performing legal abortions in Virginia. It cleared the House and Senate but was vetoed as part of a broader reproductive-health package rejected by the governor.
Mundon King helped lead the Virginia “Momnibus” — a multi-bill Democratic initiative targeting racial disparities in maternal outcomes and expanding support for pregnant people and new parents. 
In the past two sessions, Mundon King carried provisions dealing with bias training for health-care providers, data collection and more robust maternal-health programming. She has signaled plans to revive proposals on unconscious-bias training and incentives for businesses that offer childcare after federal maternal-mortality funding expired.
Her advocacy has been deeply personal. In early October, Mundon King lost her 15-year-old daughter, Candis, who died after a long battle with sickle cell disease. The family’s story, shared publicly, brought an outpouring of condolences from lawmakers across the aisle and renewed attention to the disease and the challenges families face.
Mundon King has also pushed to modernize how the state handles public symbols. 
Her bill removing two Robert E. Lee specialty license plates won legislative approval but was slowed when Youngkin proposed requiring a second vote in the following session, delaying the change.
Energy policy has been another focus. Earlier this year, Mundon King sponsored House Bill 2413, a measure seeking more transparency and stronger oversight of long-term utility planning amid unprecedented power-demand growth from data-center development. Youngkin vetoed the bill, arguing the State Corporation Commission already has sufficient authority.
Beyond her legislative role, Mundon King founded the Sickle Cell Caucus and the Black Maternal Health Caucus. She has more than two decades of experience in philanthropy and advocacy, including work at CARE, where she helped advance the Global Food Security Act, and the Gates Foundation, where she supported policy and community-relations efforts.
Born and raised in Portsmouth, she is active in regional community organizations, including Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, and has served on the Virginia Employment Commission and the Commission on Electric Utility Regulation. She lives in Dumfries with her family.
Spanberger said she expects Mundon King to be a key member of her cabinet. “I look forward to the work she will continue to do on behalf of my administration,” she said.

,DC,2025-12-10 17:10:38+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Another judge grants request to unseal Epstein grand jury files,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/another-judge-grants-request-unseal-epstein-grand-jury-files,,"WASHINGTON — A second federal judge in New York on Wednesday granted a U.S. Department of Justice request to unseal grand jury records in the case against Jeffrey Epstein, who died in jail in 2019 awaiting federal trial on sex trafficking charges and whose case files have become a target of Congress and victims in recent months.U.S. District Judge Richard Berman issued the order to unseal the secret grand jury material in the government’s 2019 sex trafficking case against the hedge fund manager and friend to celebrities and politicians. Berman ruled one day after a separate federal judge in New York granted the government’s request to unseal grand jury material in the 2021 federal case against convicted sex offender Ghislaine Maxwell, who worked closely with Epstein to target minors for sex.Berman wrote the Justice Department’s request aligned with a new law, dubbed by lawmakers as the Epstein Files Transparency Act, that requires Attorney General Pam Bondi to release the case files in the Epstein investigation by Dec. 19. Congress overwhelmingly passed the measure and President Donald Trump signed it in mid-December. “The Act requires disclosure of Epstein grand jury materials by requiring the disclosure of ‘all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials.’” Berman wrote. “‘All’ is crystal clear and should be afforded its ‘ordinary, common-sense meaning.”All identifying information of victims must be redacted, Berman emphasized.The order also came days after a Florida federal judge’s decision to release secret grand jury materials from the federal investigation of Epstein from 2005 to 2007. Federal investigators cut a deal with state prosecutors to end the probe after Epstein pleaded guilty to a state charge of soliciting a minor for prostitution.Political pressureThe FBI issued a memo in July stating the administration would not publicly release any further records from the federal Epstein probe. The refusal caused a firestorm among lawmakers from both parties, including some in Trump’s voter base.For months afterward, Trump dismissed pressure to release the Epstein files, calling it a “hoax.” Less than two days before Congress was set to vote on the legislation the president changed his opinion and told his party to support it. A bipartisan group of senators and House members pressed Bondi in a letter on Dec. 3 to brief them on what the Justice Department plans to release later this month.The law has carve-outs allowing the department to withhold information relating to any active investigations. On Nov. 14, the department announced the U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan would begin “new investigations” into any connections between Epstein and former President Bill Clinton, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, and prominent investor Reid Hoffman.Bondi said Nov. 19 during a press conference that “information has come forward, new information, additional information.”A separate bipartisan panel on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform subpoenaed the Justice Department for all Epstein investigation records, and subpoenaed the Clintons and several former attorneys general for interviews.The Justice Department maintains Epstein targeted over 1,000 victims.",,,,2025-12-10 12:58:12.930429

His family announced his death in a statement but did not share the cause. Paige was 92.
Paige’s career in education spanned departments and titles, from teacher to football coach to superintendent of the Houston Independent School District in Texas. In 2001, President George W. Bush tapped Paige to serve as the seventh secretary of education. 
Over the next four years, Paige led the rollout of Bush’s signature No Child Left Behind Act, which mandated standardized testing and sanctions for schools that failed to meet benchmarks, aiming to close the academic gap between students from different backgrounds. The policy was modeled on Paige’s work in Houston. 
“Rod was a leader and a friend,” Bush said in a statement. “Unsatisfied with the status quo, he challenged what we called ‘the soft bigotry of low expectations.’ Rod worked hard to make sure that where a child was born didn’t determine whether they could succeed in school and beyond. He devoted his life to America’s young people and made a difference.”
The son of two educators, Roderick Raynor Paige was born in 1933 in Monticello, a small town in Lawrence County in south Mississippi. He received a bachelor’s degree from Jackson State University, and after a stint in the U.S. Navy and in high school and junior college coaching positions, he returned to the university as head coach.
He moved to Houston in the 1970s to serve as the head football coach and athletic director at Texas Southern University, but pivoted to the classroom in the 1980s. He went on to establish the university’s Center for Excellence in Urban Education and served as dean of the college of education from 1984 to 1994. 
In 1994, he was selected as superintendent of Houston Independent School District, which was then one of the largest school districts in the country. 
His work there — more rigorous standards for student outcomes, teacher incentive pay and an expanded charter school sector — led to higher student test scores and garnered the attention of Bush.

Paige would return to Jackson in 2016 to briefly serve as interim president of Jackson State University.
“I am a Jacksonian, and I am interested in JSU being the greatest it can be,” Paige said at the time. 
The university shared a statement Tuesday mourning Paige’s passing and underscoring his “enduring impact.” 
“Dr. Paige’s leadership, integrity, and belief in the power of learning left a lasting mark on every institution he touched,” said Jackson Mayor John Horhn in a statement. “The City of Jackson extends heartfelt condolences to his devoted wife, Stephanie, and to the Paige family. We are grateful for Dr. Paige’s legacy and for the example he set as a son of Mississippi.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/07072836/IMG_7220.jpg,,,2025-12-10 12:58:12.930429

(Nadav Soroker/Searchlight New Mexico)Mediation between former Western New Mexico University President Joseph Shepard and New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez is scheduled for January — one year after the AG first filed suit against Shepard and university regents for allegedly engaging in a pattern of “greed, self-dealing, and arrogance.”
The mediation talks have the potential to bring an end to the first of several state lawsuits and investigations concerning Shepard, his use of taxpayer dollars and the former regents’ decision to award him nearly $2 million in severance.
“My goal is to get us into a mediation where we can kind of put this situation in the rearview mirror,” John Wertheim, vice chair of the WNMU Board of Regents, told Source NM Monday.
How it began
In late 2023, news reports detailed how Shepard and other university leaders used taxpayer dollars at home and abroad. In New Mexico, Shepard spent nearly $28,000 of university money on furniture from Seret and Sons, a downtown Santa Fe icon, to furnish his on-campus home. Internationally, he and others lodged at upscale resorts in the name of courting international students. At the time, though, WNMU only had 64 international students, more than one-third of which hailed from Mexico.
The New Mexico Higher Education Department and Office of the State Auditor quickly informed Shepard they were opening investigations of their own. In November of 2024, the state auditor released a report that detailed more than $360,000 of “wasteful” and “improper” spending, including on a trip to a Ritz-Carlton resort in Palm Springs, California.
Shepard resigns
A month later, Shepard announced his resignation. At a public meeting, university regents voted to give him a $1.9 million severance payment and a contract to teach business ethics. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham subsequently called on the regents to resign over their “tone-deaf decision to approve a $1.9 million severance package” and their “appalling disconnect from the needs of our state.”
Then, in January, Torrez sued Shepard and the regents in a bid to claw back the severance payment and nullify the teaching contract. Newly appointed regents have since voted to axe that deal and at the time said they hoped it would spark settlement talks.
Much of the litigation and lawmaking surrounding Shepard focused on events that the news media unearthed. But in June, the New Mexico State Ethics Commission sued Shepard following an investigation of its own. The lawsuit accused him of misappropriating “at least” $177,000 meant for an ADA-compliant ramp and walkway and instead spending it to construct a patio near his on-campus house that he later used to host events related to his daughter’s wedding.
Shepard has denied any wrongdoing in each case. He did not respond to a request for comment.
Shepard fights back with new attorneys
When state agencies took action against Shepard, he hired Santa Fe-based lawyer John Anderson, who served as U.S. attorney for New Mexico under the first Trump administration, to defend him. When he decided to file his own lawsuit, though, court filings listed the names of different attorneys.
On Oct. 30, he sued the university as well as several current and former state officials — including Siah Correa Hemphill, a Democrat who formerly represented Silver City in the state Senate; State Auditor Joseph Maestas; Sen. George Muñoz (D-Gallup), who leads the Senate Finance Committee and stood by Torrez during the reform announcement; Senate President Pro Tempore Mimi Stewart (D-Albuquerque); and regents Vice Chair John Wertheim, a lawyer who has worked as an adviser to several New Mexico governors. A lawyer representing the defendants has asked the judge to dismiss the lawsuit, citing “legislative immunity” for the current and former lawmakers. 
Shepard is represented in his suit by A. Blair Dunn — an Albuquerque-based lawyer who unsuccessfully ran for state attorney general as a Libertarian in the 2018 election — and Jared Vander Dussen — who lost the 2020 Republican primary for New Mexico’s first congressional district, which ultimately went to Deb Haaland.
The suit alleges that state lawmakers in 2022 agreed to send $500,000 to WNMU with the understanding that the university would then give it to a struggling charter school on its campus. 
It alleges that lawmakers acted inappropriately in the following legislative session by passing a bill that gave the funding directly to WNMU but did not direct university officials to pass it along to the charter school as they had previously agreed. Since those directions were absent, the suit says Shepard refused to transfer the funds.
He alleges that when he spoke out about it, lawmakers coordinated a “smear campaign” against him.
Dunn in an email to Source NM would not comment on the case.

She is one of thousands on the waiting list (Photo courtesy of Tiffini Gallant). While most people are in the middle of devising a wish-list for Christmas, Tiffini Gallant’s wish-list is a lot shorter — just a kidney.
She’s trying to beat a devastating kidney disease that could claim her life without a transplant and leave her young son, who just began school, without a mother.
Polycystic Kidney Disease, or “PKD,” is a mostly hereditary condition in which the kidneys are overwhelmed by painful cysts that grow on the organs, enlarging them, scarring them, and leaving them dysfunctional. While the disease varies in its intensity, Gallant is hoping for a kidney donor match — the only thing that will likely hold the disease at bay.
She’s a part of a transplant program in Utah, several states away.  Montana has no medical center that operates a kidney transplant program. In the meantime, she’s become a spokesperson for raising awareness about organ donation, putting her face out as a reminder that many of those on the waiting list for an organ are younger than what people may think.
And organ transplant advocates say that the majority of those stuck on waiting lists are for kidneys — mostly because of medical advances that have helped patients with chronic kidney failure or conditions live long enough for a transplant.
Tiffini Gallant, who lives in Montana and is in end-stage renal failure, is hoping for a kidney transplant. She is one of thousands on the waiting list (Photo courtesy of Tiffini Gallant).
Gallant’s endured countless medical procedures. She’s also been worried that she may not make it out of the hospitals as those same cysts that have targeted her kidneys have burst and caused internal bleeding and unbearable pain.
She had originally been told she wouldn’t be able to have kids, but that changed when she became pregnant with Holden, her gregarious and adventurous 6-year-old son who began school in Laurel this year. She hates that sometimes she’s relegated to a walker, hardly able to stand up straight without “sharp, stabbing pains.”
She has fought off sepsis in the hospital four different times.
“I am just glad to be here,” Gallant said.
Some of the cysts have grown to the size of an orange. Breathing is labored because the disease, and its ever expanding mass of cysts, has grown, pushing into her diaphragm.
She’s reminded herself: “This is living. You are alive. You still have a life,” even after personal setbacks ranging from long hospitalization to a marriage that broke up, largely because of the stress of the medical condition.
So far, she’s raised funds to help her relocate for the time she’ll be away, if and when a suitable donor can be found. Of nearly 100,000 U.S. residents on an organ transplant waiting list, roughly 86,000 are there, waiting for a kidney.
Gallant has found herself an unexpected advocate and spokesperson for organ transplantation, reminding people that even though transplants don’t happen here, there are Montanans who need the support.
“People die every day waiting for a kidney,” she said. “You have to face the possibility of dying.”
She told the Daily Montanan that while watching Holden pick out fire trucks in a book he’d checked out from the library.
Gallant describes the odd circumstances of transplants: You have to be sick enough to need an organ, but healthy enough to survive the medical procedures.

Montana is one of four states that does not have a transplant center.
There are 179 Montanans waiting for a life-saving transplant.
Of those 179, 142 are waiting for a kidney.
14 Montanans received a transplant in 2023.
Four Montanans have died while awaiting transplant in 2025




Indeed, during the COVID-19 pandemic, officials with LifeCenter Northwest, an organization that spans several states and oversees coordination of transplanting, most donors dipped. However, unlike other states that still have not seen the number organ donors rebound, officials with LifeCenter say that Montana not only rallied back, but has added to the numbers.
This year, the Treasure State may break a record for numbers of donors who were able to help those on the transplant waiting list. Last year, 60 people contributed. By November, that number was already at 61 and likely to grow.
Though Montana doesn’t have its own transplantation center (others are in places like Denver, Salt Lake City, Seattle or Spokane), Candy Wells, the senior director, Organ Utilization, Recovery and Perfusion at LifeCenter Northwest said that rural places like Montana and Alaska have pushed states to develop a network of commercial and private flights that can assist. LifeCenter Northwest’s geographic footprint covers 25% of the United States’ land mass.
Wells, a critical care nurse by training, said that those waiting for other organs, like heart or liver, may not live as long waiting, so that means more people waiting for transplant there for kidneys.
They hope that familiar faces and stories like Gallant’s will help more people consider becoming organ donors. Organs can come from humans as old as 80, thanks to medical science improvements. And, Wells said, one donor can help as many as 75 people when it comes to donating organs and tissue.
“You can’t forget that all of these people have families,” Wells said. “I would love a day when there was no one on the list. But I don’t see that now.”
There are improvements in medicine, gene therapy, even cultivating organs — but those are still years off viability, “not in the imminent future,” Wells said.
Gallant has also started a chronic illness group where others and their family members can talk about the care, the exhaustion, the uncertainty. She said it’s hard for others to understand — sometimes even harder to know what to say.
And really, her goals of getting a kidney are more about Holden than her.
“I’d love to see him graduate from high school and see what technological advancements we’re making,” Gallant said.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Minnesota students reported being less depressed in 2025 than in recent years, but a majority still say they’d recently felt anxious and on edge, according to the Minnesota Student Survey released Tuesday by the Minnesota Department of Education and other state agencies.
Students also reported stronger connections to their schools and other improvements in overall wellbeing.
The findings offer some hope that the decadeslong decline of teen mental health, especially worsened in the 2022 survey amid the COVID-19 pandemic, could be turning around.
“We can build on this momentum by continuing to foster safe environments that make young people feel included, engaged and like they belong,” said Minnesota Commissioner of Health Dr. Brooke Cunningham in a statement announcing the survey results.
Rates of students who reported being recently bothered by feeling down, depressed or hopeless have gone down significantly from a 2022 high; around 40% of juniors in 2025 said they’d felt down or depressed compared to 54% in 2022 and 47% in 2019.
Students are also less anxious than before. Around 70% of juniors in 2022 said they were recently bothered by feeling anxious or on edge, compared with around 60% in 2025.


The survey’s accuracy may be limited, however. Less than half of Minnesota students in fifth, eighth, ninth and 11th grades — 119,689 of around 266,000 — completed the optional survey, which has been administered every three years since 1989 and includes public school districts and charter schools. The survey has become divisive in recent years for asking students about their drug use, sexual activity and gender orientation, with some school districts choosing to opt out altogether.
The improvement in student wellbeing is not yet mirrored by an improvement in standardized test scores, which have stagnated since the pandemic led to school closures and remote learning in 2020 and 2021.


Students have also stopped vaping so much. Less than 8% of juniors in 2025 reported vaping or using an e-cigarette in the 30 days prior to taking the survey, much lower than 26% in 2019.
New questions in the 2025 survey asked students about their technology usage and exposure to guns: 1 in 10 fifth graders said they’ve “experienced people using guns to threaten or hurt others in person,” compared to around 6% for the other grades surveyed.
About 90% of high school students said they used social media every day, and a large portion of them — 37% of eighth graders and 44% of juniors — suspect they have a social media problem.
From fifth to 11th grade, over half of respondents reported using technology at odd hours at least one school night a week, infringing on sleep. Over 1 in 6 students, including those in fifth grade, said they use technology between midnight and 5am on all five school nights.

The plan was part of the “make America healthy again” initiative that called for states to apply for waivers limiting the use of the government benefits. South Carolina’s waiver was among six signed Wednesday morning, bringing the total list of approved plans to 18, USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins told reporters.
“We all know we’re at the point where we must do something to correct the chronic health problems that Americans face,” Rollins said.
When it will take effect in South Carolina stores is not yet clear.
Energy drinks, candy bars and beverages sweetened with 5 grams or more of added sugar — which includes ready-made lemonade, tea and sweetened coffee — are among the food items prohibited under South Carolina’s plan.
Not included are granola bars, natural fruit or vegetable juice, and sports drinks. Protein bars, cookies, crackers, muffins, pastries and baked goods are also OK, according to the September order.
McMaster’s goal was to give people flexibility in what nearly 550,000 SNAP users could purchase while still restricting “things that most people will agree should be addressed and probably should not be bought with taxpayer money,” he told reporters soon after issuing his order.
The state had a financial incentive for its proposal as well. States with an approved waiver in place will get higher scores on an application for rural health care funding, said Mehmet Oz, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
This is not the first time the proposal has come up. Former Gov. Nikki Haley reversed a similar proposal to restrict what SNAP recipients could buy in 2013 after receiving pushback in public meetings across the state. And the idea came up during this year’s budget debate in the Senate, before ultimately failing to pass.
The waivers have faced pushback from advocates for the poor, who say they should have the opportunity to decide for themselves how to spend their money. Putting restrictions on what people can buy reinforces the stigma SNAP users already face, said Sue Berkowitz, director of policy for the Appleseed Legal Justice Center.
“I think it is very paternalistic for us to think that people who purchase their food with SNAP don’t do it with the utmost dignity and in the best interest of themselves and their family,” Berkowitz said.
Locally owned grocery stores that can’t afford to implement a new system for registering what qualifies for SNAP might decide to stop offering it completely, making it harder for people to get food, Berkowitz said.
“I worry about what that could do to exacerbate hunger and limit the use of SNAP benefits,” she said.

The proposed legislation would require abortion providers to report detailed information about each abortion procedure and the person receiving it, including demographics like age and race as well as the method of payment for the abortion and the patient’s previous pregnancies and abortions.
Michigan had previously published reports annually with detailed statistics on abortions, including demographic data and information on complications, but those ceased after a 2023 law change. 
The bill package, announced at the state’s March for Life rally in early November, was lauded as “common sense laws” by Genevieve Marnon, legislative director for Right to Life of Michigan in her testimony to the House committee in November.

But Dr. Katherine Starr, the chief medical officer of Planned Parenthood of Michigan, warned that the bills would “single out abortion care from all other kinds of health care,” while imposing administrative burdens on health care providers and raising privacy concerns for patients. 
The bills will now go to the full state House of Representatives, where a Republican majority is expected to pass them. However, it would be unlikely for the bills to pass through a Democratic-controlled Senate or be signed by Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who signed the bill removing these reporting requirements in 2023.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-10-at-10.32.45 AM-1024x640.png,,,2025-12-10 11:57:11.326305
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-10 16:26:10+00:00,CT Mirror,Report: Youths face ‘alarming’ isolation in CT’s adult prisons,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/10/ct-prisons-youths-child-advocate-isolation/,"Young men in CT's adult prisons have endured conditions that have caused downward mental health spirals, the Child Advocate reported.","Young men housed in Connecticut’s adult prisons have spent long periods in isolation, receiving almost no programming or mental health services, few visits, little recreation and frequent strip searches — conditions that have caused downward mental health spirals in some of these youths, the state Office of the Child Advocate said Wednesday. 
In a new report, the Child Advocate found that youths between ages 18 and 21 who have been designated “security risks” — a specialized status generally given to young people thought to be gang members — were being held in restrictive housing units for months and sometimes years with little activity and extreme isolation. 
“The degree of isolation and inactivity for the 18- to 21-year-olds on these restrictive statuses is alarming,” the report stated. 
The Child Advocate recommended that all incarcerated young men aged 21 or younger should be housed in Manson Youth Institute, the prison for juvenile boys. They should not be transferred to other adult facilities and should not be held in restrictive housing for lengthy periods — as was often the case at MacDougall-Walker, Corrigan and Garner Correctional Institutions, the report said.
Several of the young men whose cases the Child Advocate reviewed had been in restrictive housing for over a year. For some, it had been over three years. 
A law passed in 2022 requires all incarcerated men and women in Connecticut to spend at least four hours outside their cells. But interviews OCA conducted with staff and incarcerated individuals in 2023 and 2024 showed that requirement often went unmet. Their food was served through a slot in the door. Incarcerated youths were placed in restraints every time they needed to leave the cell and regularly strip-searched. 
“OCA staff observed multiple 18- to 21-year-olds who were not permitted to have pillows, pajamas, or sweatpants. They did not have access to a television, a radio, paper or writing instruments, or even a photo album,” the report read. One boy said he didn’t go outside for recreation because “he did not have a sweater or jacket, and it was cold outside.” 
At MacDougall-Walker Correctional Institution, the recreation area is a chain-link cage “in an area enclosed by tall concrete walls such that only the sky is visible,” and there are no chairs or tables. In Corrigan Correctional Institution, where the young people were on a lower level of restriction, they had more time to socialize and participate in activities like playing cards. 
Youths who are considered “security risks” are supposed to participate in programming encouraging them to disaffiliate from gangs. But in the majority of the cases cited in the report, the young men did not have the opportunity to participate in programming or groups and didn’t receive any visits from family or friends. 
Living under these conditions can push young men, some of whom already had mental health diagnoses when they came into the Department of Correction, into a further state of distress. When that happens, the report states, the young person rarely gets the mental health care that they need, and is often punished when they begin to act out. 
This was the case for Jeremy, a young person whose story was included in the Child Advocate’s report. After three years of living in severe isolation, Jeremy started to report having trouble sleeping. His mood was unstable, he paced the floor of his cell and punched the wall. He told a medical professional that he felt like nothing was helping to calm his spinning thoughts. 
When Jeremy started acting out — including covering his cell window and flooding the cell — department staff responded by taking away his recreational time and visits, placing him in restraints and pepper-spraying him. Jeremy reported suicidal thoughts and threatened to harm himself, but mental health workers did not change his mental health classification to indicate greater severity. He was hospitalized twice for self-harm but did not receive immediate mental health care upon returning to DOC.
At one point, Jeremy was placed in restrictive housing as punishment for 21 days straight, even though Connecticut law limits solitary confinement to 15 consecutive days. 
The report also found that young men reported not receiving access to education. Schedules from MacDougall-Walker and Corrigan Correctional Institutions called for two hours of education each day, but the Child Advocate found that schedule wasn’t followed. 
“Many [late adolescent boys] reported receiving no educational services for weeks at a time, without explanation,” the report stated. 
Special education services were also significantly cut back in many cases, since adult facilities only offer a GED program rather than a traditional diploma. In some cases, young men consented to “exit” special education altogether because of the prospect of strip-searches and restrictions of movement that would come with leaving their cells.
Andrius Banevicius, spokesperson for the Department of Correction, told CT Mirror in a statement that the department’s leaders were reviewing the Child Advocate’s report “in order to determine the appropriate next steps and course of action.”
“The administration thanks the Child Advocate for her diligent work, as well as her shared commitment to protecting the best interest of the adolescents under the supervision of the DOC,” Banevicius said. 
The report acknowledged that the Department of Correction had made some improvements, including changing the schedules at MacDougall-Walker, Corrigan and Garner to allow four hours of out-of-cell time for incarcerated young men, creating a vegetable garden and outdoor visiting space at Garner and adding a space for education at MacDougall. The department also commissioned a study in 2023 to look at restrictive housing use in the department and make recommendations. 
More needs to be done, the Child Advocate’s Office says. That includes clear restrictions on transfers to adult facilities and limits on restraints and strip searches. 
The report also suggested the creation of a working group to make recommendations to the state legislature about limiting the use of restrictive housing.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Manson-Exterior-e1625765290544.jpg,,,2025-12-10 11:57:11.326305

(Photo courtesy of the Stevenson-Carson School District)After letting funding lapse for nearly two years, Congress voted to renew crucial federal funding that rural counties and schools have counted on for a quarter century.
The U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday evening voted 399-5 to reauthorize the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act through September 2026, and to provide lapsed payments for the 2024 and 2025 fiscal years. The vote came after a year-long campaign led by bipartisan federal lawmakers from the West, including Idaho’s U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo.
The U.S. Senate in June unanimously voted to reauthorize the act. It now goes to the president to be signed into law.
“The Secure Rural Schools program has been a lifeline for rural communities across Oregon since I originally authored the program back in 2000,” Oregon’s U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat, said in a statement. “I’m relieved the House has finally done its job with the long-overdue passage of my bill to return the safety net for critical services to communities that need it the most.”
Wyden co-authored the original law that provided tens of millions each year for rural schools and communities that previously benefited from revenue generated by natural resource industries on public lands. Since then, it has provided $7 billion in payments to more than 700 counties and 4,400 school districts across 40 states and Puerto Rico that have large swaths of federal land within their borders.
In Idaho, $22.8 million was distributed across 34 counties to help pay for educational programs, emergency response systems and other services in Fiscal Year 2023, according to a press release from Crapo’s office.
“The SRS program is vital to maintaining schools, roads and emergency response services in rural, forested counties,” Crapo said in the press release. “We have a responsibility to these communities who house large swaths of untaxable federal land. The passage of this legislation will provide retroactive pay to counties that faced deep cuts since the program’s expiration at the end of Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 and restore funding levels for FY 2026. I continue to press for a long-term solution to provide Idaho’s county governments with more certainty.”

Oregon, where more than half of the state consists of federal land, has experienced the biggest loss of any state since the funding lapsed in 2023: nearly $48.7 million in money for rural roads, public services and schools, according to a September report from the D.C.-based Center for American Progress, a liberal public policy and think tank. Idaho has missed out on $21.3 million, Alaska more than $12.6 million and Washington more than $14.7 million.
Overall, states have lost out on more than $207 million in the two years since the act expired, the Center for American Progress found.
 U.S. House hasn’t voted on Secure Rural Schools funding after bill passed the Senate

Twice since December 2024, the Senate has voted to renew the act in an effort led by Wyden and Idaho’s senior U.S. Sen. Crapo, a Republican.
But each time the Senate approved it, the House failed to take a vote. The bill lapsed in 2023 and counties haven’t gotten payments since early 2024. House Republicans most recently failed to reauthorize the act in the tax and spending cut megalaw they passed in July, known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.
With just weeks before the House is due to wrap its work for the year, Wyden, Crapo and 83 bipartisan lawmakers from the Senate and the House sent a letter to U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat from New York, urging them to take a vote on the act before they recessed.
Just 12 hours after receiving the letter, the House announced it would fast-track consideration and a vote on the bill.
Washington’s U.S. Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, a Democrat representing southwest Washington’s 3rd Congressional District, led the passage of the bill in the House.
“The Secure Rural Schools program is absolutely critical, and the passage of this legislation is beyond overdue,” she said in a statement. “Candidly, the only reason it took this long is because way too many folks in D.C. have been blissfully ignorant about how disastrous the lapse of SRS has been for timber communities in Southwest Washington and across the West. Schools have closed up, teachers have been laid off, and our kids have been left footing the bill for Congress’s neglect.”
Since the funding lapsed, schools in Skamania County in her district have laid off staff and a middle school was forced to close.
In Alaska, the failure to reauthorize the program caused rural school districts to cut their budgets, particularly in southeast Alaska, home to the vast Tongass National Forest.
Rep. Nick Begich, R-Alaska, voted for the bill on Friday, and both of the state’s senators — Republicans Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan — supported it as well.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska State Sen. Dan McKeon of Amherst’s arraignment was postponed for a week after he tried to file a no contest plea without showing up, using a waiver which isn’t allowed, according to the judge.
The Nebraska State Patrol cited McKeon for misdemeanor public indecency in late October after investigating an allegation by a legislative staffer attending an end-of-session party this spring in Lincoln.

Lancaster County Attorney Pat Condon downgraded his charge to misdemeanor disturbing the peace, with his first court date set for Lancaster County Court on Wednesday morning.
The trial stems from a September report the Patrol received that alleges McKeon “made inappropriate contact with [the staffer’s] buttocks with his hand, over the top of her clothing,” Patrol spokesman Cody Thomas said at the time.
The Examiner is aware of the alleged victim’s name but is not publishing it because it is the policy of States Newsroom and the Examiner not to identify people who say they have been abused unless they wish to talk publicly.
McKeon’s attorney Perry Pirsch said Tuesday that McKeon would likely plead no contest to the charge, which would allow him to accept any coming penalties without admitting guilt, and would waive his right to a trial.
However, at Wednesday’s arraignment, Lancaster County Court Judge Matthew Acton said you can’t file a no contest plea through a waiver. On the request of the prosecutor Delaney Baumgartner, Acton postponed McKeon’s arraignment to Dec. 17.
In response to the delay, Pirsch said he doesn’t believe it should matter whether McKeon attends the arraignment because he’s shown he’s willing to plead no contest.
“I don’t know why anyone would care,” Pirsch said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
McKeon is a registered Republican who was elected to the officially nonpartisan Legislature in 2024, replacing former State Sen. Fred Meyer of St. Paul.
Since news broke about McKeon’s citation, state officials — including Gov. Jim Pillen — have called for McKeon’s resignation, but McKeon has said he will not resign. Pirsch said filing a no contest waiver would help McKeon “put the matter behind him and to focus on the upcoming legislative session.”
McKeon is also facing a potential civil lawsuit from the staffer making the allegation, and an internal investigation within the Nebraska Legislature. The Executive Board, which is in charge of handling disciplinary procedures within the Legislature, is expected to meet as early as Saturday on the situation.
Pirsch has said the downgraded charge more accurately reflects McKeon’s perspective of the incident. Pirsch said McKeon is guilty of nothing but an “off-color joke” and a “pat on the back.”
The change from a public indecency charge to disturbing the peace cuts the maximum possible penalties McKeon would face in half. Disturbing the peace, a Class III misdemeanor, comes with a maximum sentence of three months behind bars, a $500 fine, or both.
Pirsch said he expects McKeon will be asked to pay a small fine, “and the matter will be forgotten.”

Mississippi Supreme Court Justices Robert Chamberlin and James Maxwell will fill vacant federal judgeships in northern Mississippi. On Wednesday, the U.S. Senate voted 51-46 to confirm Chamberlin, of Hernando, and Maxwell, of Oxford, to the federal judiciary.
Mississippi Sens. Roger Wicker and Cindy Hyde-Smith applauded the confirmations.
“Bobby Chamberlin and Jimmy Maxwell are dedicated public servants who have served Mississippi well for decades,” Wicker said in a statement. “… They have upheld the Constitution, exercised sound judgement and lived with integrity.”
Hyde-Smith praised both jurists’ records on the state high court and said she believes they will serve the federal Northern District of Mississippi well.
Mississippi Supreme Court Justice Robert Chamberlin Credit: Special to Mississippi Today
Trump nominated Chamberlin and Maxwell to the federal posts in August, but their initial confirmation by the Senate Judiciary Committee was held up for months by a North Carolina senator over a dispute over federal recognition of an indigenous group in his state as a tribe.
Republican Sen. Thom Tillis had said he was blocking a committee vote on Mississippi nominations by Trump over negotiations with Wicker to recognize the Lumbee people as a Native American tribe in legislation before the Senate Armed Services Committee, of which Wicker is chairman.
The Lumbee is a group of indigenous people in North Carolina that has been seeking federal recognition as a tribe for over a century. But other federally recognized tribes have opposed this effort.
Language granting federal recognition of the tribe had been added to the House version of the Pentagon’s annual spending bill, but was not included in the Senate’s version, which Wicker oversees.
In November, the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs held a hearing on the Lumbee Fairness Act, legislation now being pushed by Tillis and other North Carolina lawmakers, and Tillis dropped his blockage of a committee vote on Chamberlin and Maxwell. Trump has also endorsed recognition of the Lumbee as a tribe.
Maxwell earned his undergraduate and law degrees from the University of Mississippi. Former Gov. Haley Barbour in February of 2009 appointed Maxwell to the state Court of Appeals. 
Maxwell was elected to the post in 2010 and reelected in 2014. 
Former Gov. Phil Bryant appointed him to the state Supreme Court in January 2016. He was later elected to an eight-year term in November of 2016 and reelected in 2024.
Maxwell said his prior experience as a federal prosecutor and growing up with an attorney for a father helped make him qualified to become a federal judge. 
Chamberlin earned his undergraduate and law degrees from the University of Mississippi. He first served as a state circuit court judge for 12 years in the 17th Circuit District. In 2016, he was elected to an open seat on the state Supreme Court and reelected in 2024. 
Before becoming a judge, Chamberlin was a member of the state Senate for five years, representing DeSoto County. 
Chamberlin, at the hearing, said his role as a state circuit court judge has prepared him to preside over a federal courtroom because he’s previously had to “run a docket” in a state court. 
Chamberlin and Maxwell will replace U.S. District Judges Michael Mills and Sharion Aycock, both of whom decided to take senior status in recent years.

Evan Worrell, R-Cabell, questions West Virginia Department of Human Services leaders Tuesday, Dec. 9, 2025, during a meeting of the Legislative Oversight Commission on Health and Human Resources Accountability in Charleston, West Virginia. (Photo by Will Price/West Virginia Legislative Photography)State lawmakers are questioning how the Department of Human Services is trying to get a handle on the foster care crisis, raising concerns about delayed payments and a more than $300 million dollars foster care technology platform that doesn’t fully work. 
Lawmakers are supposed to provide oversight of state agencies, and they’re trying to push for changes in the state’s troubled foster care system of nearly 6,000 children. 
On Tuesday, some members of the Legislative Oversight Commission on Health and Human Resources Accountability were particularly troubled to learn that DoHS is still struggling to pay foster care providers on time, including agencies that drive foster children to see their family members and run group homes. 
“Are you trying to put them out of business? Where would the department be if they can’t do business?” asked Del. Evan Worrell, R-Cabell, who chairs the committee. “It goes across every service line … I hear this all the time, I get phone calls all the time. What is the department going to do to change this? I’m trying to see a change for the better, and I feel like I’m seeing a change for the worse.”
The state doesn’t have enough foster homes for children — or some children need acute services in hospital-like settings — so residential treatment facilities are critical in West Virginia child welfare.

Mia Johnson is CEO of Burlington United Methodist Family Services, which operates 82 residential beds for children, group foster homes and more. 
“Unfortunately, our ability to continue this work is at risk,” Johnson told lawmakers. “The greatest threat to our agency is the persistent failure of payment and reconciliation systems in our partnership with DoHS.”
Earlier this year, Johnson told lawmakers that some DoHS grants were seven months late. She said that, now, there are continued delays in grants that threaten programs for families and retaining staff. The payment delays are threatening the company’s cash reserves. 
The delay in payments, according to Johnson, was one of the reasons Burlington hasn’t been able to commit to taking on certain higher-need child populations, “such as sex offenders and sexually reactive children.”
“We can’t afford the insurance,” she said. 
There are 543 foster children in out-of-state group homes, typically older kids who need high levels of care for behavioral or mental health issues. 
DoHS Secretary Alex Mayer told lawmakers that DoHS is now looking for out-of-state providers to come into West Virginia to open beds for high-needs foster kids so they can bring children back in state. 
“I want to be clear that since arriving in West Virginia, I’ve been meeting with providers in groups and individually to discuss the opportunity to specialize in levels of care that are requiring us to send children out of state, and we have not received interest from any providers,” Mayer said. 
Sen. Eric Tarr, R-Putnam
In response, Sen. Eric Tarr, R-Putnam, didn’t understand why the state would be looking out of state when they haven’t been properly paying their in-state providers.
“They’re testifying they’re about to be run out of business in West Virginia, so why in the world would we not shore up existing providers before we ask other providers to come in?”
Employees from Children First and Home Base, two socially necessary services providers in West Virginia, outlined multiple issues to lawmakers, including delayed state payments. Socially necessary services providers transport foster children to see their biological family members; providers have asked Gov. Patrick Morrisey to stop a new mileage documentation policy they said is excessive, redundant and “forcing some providers to discontinue services.”
“Our concerns reflect real challenges affecting real families and the real front line staff who serve them every day … We’re asking for solutions that allow us to spend time serving children, not compensating for broken administrative processes,” said Caroline McMillen, chief personnel officer for Home Base. 
Commissioner of the Bureau for Social Services Lori Bragg said that the department, in an effort to improve its finances, has conducted audits on residential providers and socially necessary services providers. 
One audit showed $5.4 million in over payment to residential providers, according to Bragg. Another audit showed over-billing for mileage from socially necessary service providers, she said. 
DoHS is now requiring additional verification from providers in an effort to prevent future overpayments, and some of those new steps have led to payment delays. Payments are still going out, she said, but noted there are sometimes one-week delays.
“We had to make sure we’re spending the money where we should be spending it,” Bragg said. “I do not believe we’re being unreasonable.”
Worrell wasn’t satisfied with the situation, saying, “I’ve got to ask this question, are you trying to bankrupt them?”
He continued, “Policies are being changed and enacted that are basically going to bankrupt providers and we’re not going to have any left in the state.”
Foster care providers’ issues tied to failing PATH system
Many of foster care providers’ issues with late payments were tied to the state’s PATH database system, a technology implementation under Gov. Jim Justice that was meant to more seamlessly manage child welfare cases, emergency food assistance applications and more.
The state contracted with Optum in 2017 for the more than $300 million development of a new Integrated Eligibility System to manage its programs, but the rollout has been a series of delays — some due to the COVID-19 pandemic — and problems. 
Johnson said that, in one case, a foster child couldn’t be found in the PATH database, so no payment was issued.
The state uses a separate company, Acentra, to do preauthorization for some foster care services like socially necessary services providers’ mileage.
“Since October of 2022, socially necessary services providers have experienced significant and ongoing operational disruptions with the PATH and Acentra systems. The issues begin with severe delays in reimbursement, jeopardizing the stability of agencies and the ability to pay staff,” McMillen said. 
Tarr said the PATH system was a disaster, telling DoHS leaders he wanted to know how it was being fixed.
“It’s a hundreds of millions of dollars debacle and we’re laying it on providers’ shoulders. We’re losing child care providers, we’re listing foster care providers, we’re losing behavioral health providers. Why do we continue to pay out hundreds of millions of dollars for this?” he asked. 
Mayer, who inherited the PATH contract, said he is working to pursue serious change to the system.
“It’s a failure,” Mayer told lawmakers. “We’re navigating the constraint of what we’re working within because of changes that were made to the contractual structure prior to me getting here. And that’s made it even more difficult for me to take action to hold feet to the fire to really create change.”
He continued, “I’m not content with where it’s at … I think we are headed towards a path of getting things better.”

Mayer outlined to lawmakers his plan for improving child welfare following a new federal audit show that the state’s CPS workers failed to properly investigate the bulk of child abuse and neglect referrals in a time period spanning from 2023 to 2024.
The state wasn’t in compliance with the federal Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, which provides funds to states to improve Child Protective Services and child abuse prevention.
Mayer, who was appointed to lead DoHS after the audit was conducted, said he wasn’t surprised by the findings and had already began working to address long-standing issues with CPS and following up on child abuse referrals. 
“I want to begin with this: We take the (Office of Inspector General’s) findings seriously,” Mayer told lawmakers. “These are children’s lives, families’ futures, and the credibility of state government. What the audit did do was validate the steps we were already taking, the issues we identified, and the approaches to address what was outlined in the report. Simply, this was a deep, sustained, system-level reform that was needed, and we’ve already begun that work.”
He laid out eight pillars of foster care reform that included implementing a statewide practice model to ensure CPS decisions are consistent and trauma-informed. The department wants CPS workers to spend more time with families they’re serving.
Other initiatives include redesigning the state’s electronic child referral placement, and DoHS wants to support foster families and kinship caregivers through specialized training if they’re caring for children with high mental or behavioral health needs. 
A group of House and Senate Republicans are pushing for foster care reform to take precedent during the upcoming legislative session, which begins next month. This week, they unveiled 16 bills for foster care reform, including a measure that would mandate that CPS workers wear body cameras while conducting child abuse investigations.

Satya Kokonda, the founder of CompetifyHub, is a Delaware-based nonprofit providing free STEM competition preparation to tens of thousands of students worldwide.
What began as a Delaware teenager’s simple effort to make competition-level math problems accessible to his friends has grown into an international learning community. Satya Kokonda, a sophomore at the Charter School of Wilmington, is the founder of CompetifyHub, a Delaware based nonprofit that now provides free STEM competition preparation to tens of thousands of students around the world.
CompetifyHub’s story started in 2024, when Kokonda created a small Discord study group and began uploading practice problems for classmates who wanted more rigorous material. Those early posts quickly drew interest from other students who lacked access to high-level prep services, many of which can cost families hundreds of dollars. What began as a quiet exchange between friends soon evolved into a thriving space where ambitious students gathered to challenge themselves. Within two years, that informal chat transformed into a global platform offering free, peer-reviewed practice sets written by award-winning competitors and students with national olympiad experience.
The community’s rapid growth has also translated into large-scale events. CompetifyHub recently hosted its Fall International Math Championship, drawing more than two hundred sixty students from across multiple continents. Participants competed in timed rounds, individual tests, and a high-stakes final that brought together top-scoring students. Delaware students joined competitors from the United States, Europe, and Asia, demonstrating how far the nonprofit’s reach has expanded.
Today CompetifyHub’s free learning materials have been used by more than fifty thousand students. The organization has been featured by outlets including Spotlight Delaware and Dover News Today, and it has launched a science equipment lending library funded by the Delaware Foundation for Science and Mathematics Education. The library allows students to borrow sensors, lab tools, and technology that might otherwise be unaffordable, giving Delaware classrooms and families greater access to hands-on STEM experiences.
Kokonda’s driving mission stems from what he witnessed among his peers. Many students wanted to train for competitions like MathCounts, Science Olympiad, and the American Mathematics Competitions, but the cost of professional prep programs created a barrier. He remembers facing those hurdles himself. “I started CompetifyHub because I grew up facing the exact barriers it now tries to remove. In middle school, I wanted to prepare for competitions, but the prep courses were too expensive. I relied on old PDFs, outdated textbooks, and whatever free resources I could find online. After hearing Assistant Secretary of State Michele J. Sison speak at NAIMUN 2024, I left with a clear conviction: when you’re given an opportunity to start something meaningful, you shouldn’t wait.”
That motivation carried into the group’s earliest days. “That mindset carried into something my friends and I were already doing, sharing free competition math notes in a small Discord server. We thought it would stay a small study group, but then students from other states, and eventually other countries, started asking for access. That’s when I realized the need was much bigger than our circle.”
Much of CompetifyHub’s expansion has come directly from student-to-student sharing. “Almost all of our early growth happened through students themselves. They shared our textbooks in Discord servers, online math communities, and group chats. We didn’t spend anything on marketing, students essentially did it for us.”
The organization’s international competitions accelerated that momentum. “Once we launched our free international math competitions, participation expanded even faster. Because everything was virtual, no one had to pay fees or travel or have special proctoring. Students from countries like India, Nigeria, Romania, and Brazil joined because it was one of the only high-quality competitions they could access for free. Once those communities joined, more followed.”
As CompetifyHub continues to attract volunteers who write problems, run events, and support new learners, Kokonda is already looking ahead. “In 2026 and beyond, we’re expanding our international math competitions, adding new STEM divisions, releasing new free textbooks, and scaling the Study Guide Drive so students can earn verified volunteer hours for helping their peers. We’re also planning mentorship cohorts that pair students with volunteer research mentors. We plan to have more resources for chemistry and physics in the near future. Long-term, we want to make high-quality STEM preparation something every student can access, no matter their background, location, or ability to pay.”",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/thumbnail_SatyaKokonda2-e1765381147306.jpg,,,2025-12-10 10:58:32.517486

Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham) speaks during a virtual press conference to announce that she has introduced articles of impeachment against U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Dec. 10, 2025 | ScreenshotA second member of Congress representing Michigan has filed articles of impeachment against a member of President Donald Trump’s White House cabinet, this time in the form of U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens, who said Wednesday that she would soon issue an impeachment resolution against U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
The Birmingham Democrat announced her intentions to do so in September, and was following through on Wednesday, she said during a virtual press call. Stevens added that Kennedy has turned his back on science, on public health, and on the American people.
“Secretary Kennedy is driving up costs, endangering lives, undermining public health, betraying public trust, and threatening Michigan families and our world class research institutions. These are violations of his oath of office,” Stevens said in a virtual press conference. “We are in a public health emergency. It is time to protect science, protect lives and to hold him accountable. RFK Jr’s dangerous misinformation campaign is undermining public trust in doctors, researchers and life saving medicine. We’ve seen him fire vaccine experts and replace them with conspiracy theorists who are making Americans, specifically children, more vulnerable to deadly diseases.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Stevens said the most recent example of Kennedy violating his oath was the agency’s guidance on Hepatitis B vaccines, with a recommendation against infants receiving early vaccination. That guidance, coupled with Kennedy’s “outlandish claims” about Tylenol causing Autism and his cuts to cancer research programs, was a line in the sand for Stevens that Kennedy squarely crossed.
“Michigan is home to world class research institutions. Our universities … save lives and create good paying jobs,” Stevens said. “I’ve heard from Michigan researchers, doctors who are doing cutting edge pediatric cancer research in my state, that their funding is being slashed. RFK’s cuts are preventing Michigan’s best and brightest from fighting childhood cancer. It’s cruel.”
Stevens added that “enough was enough.”
“This is about protecting the health and safety of Michigan families and every American,” she said. “I will always stand up for science, truth and the health of every family. And that is what this is about. This is what leadership looks like, and this is what Michigan deserves.”
Last week, U.S. Rep. Shri Thanedar (D-Detroit) introduced articles of impeachment against Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, charging him with murder and conspiracy to murder, and for reckless and unlawful mishandling of classified information.

In light of Thanedar’s resolution against Hegseth and now hers aimed at Kennedy, Stevens was asked what the reaction was on Capitol Hill from her fellow Democrats and their leadership in Democratic U.S. House Minority Leader Hakim Jeffries.
Stevens said she was eager to have her colleagues stand alongside her, but wasn’t going to speak for Jeffries and other members of House Democratic leadership.
“I worked very closely with the House Energy and Commerce Committee staff on the Democratic side, Democratic ranking member Frankfurt Malone, and I am very eager to have our Democratic leader, Hakeem Jeffries, stand alongside me as this moves forward,” Stevens said. “This is obviously a very serious moment in our country and for public health. I was also very pleased to work with an organization called to stand with science, comprised of scientists and medical researchers and advocates who want to see this action go forward.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-10-at-9.20.05 AM-1024x666.png,,,2025-12-10 10:58:32.517486
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-10 15:11:49+00:00,CT Mirror,HUD withdraws homelessness care funding notice right before hearing on two lawsuits,Christopher Shea | Rhode Island Current,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/10/hud-homelessness-care-funding-notice/,The Trump administration had planned to slash the amount of grant funds for permanent housing and instead focus on transitional housing.,"An hour before a scheduled court hearing on two federal lawsuits over recent changes to a key federal homelessness and housing funding program, the Trump administration withdrew the funding notice that prompted the litigation.The move came as a surprise to the attorneys for plaintiffs who were initially scheduled to make their case for a temporary restraining order before Rhode Island Judge Mary S. McElroy. “It feels like intentional chaos,” McElroy said.In a message to Continuum of Care networks, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced Monday afternoon that officials rescinded its Nov. 13 Notice of Funding Opportunity for federal fiscal 2025 grants to “make appropriate revisions.” The notice had set Jan. 14 as the deadline for applications for Continuum of Care funds, which address homelessness.Rhode Island’s Continuum of Care gave the state’s homeless care a deadline of Dec. 12 to get their applications done to give to HUD, according to one of the lawsuits.“We received notice first through our providers and [electronic filing], not through opposing counsel,” Zane Muller, assistant attorney general for the state of Washington, said during the 25-minute virtual hearing that began at 3:30 p.m.HUD’s policy rescission too was news for McElroy, who called it a “haphazard approach to administrative law.” “There’s a process and procedure that’s laid out,” said McElroy, a first-term Trump appointee. “It’s not by tweets or by last-minute orders or last-minute withdrawals.”Pardis Gheibi, a U.S. Department of Justice attorney representing HUD, told McElroy the notice was filed with the court as soon as it was published. She did not have the answer when McElroy wanted to know who at HUD made the decision to rescind the funding notice and when.“We didn’t have the chance to confer with plaintiffs’ counsel — but the rescission happened this afternoon,” Gheibi said.The Trump administration had planned to slash the amount of grant funds that can be spent on permanent housing — subsidized units that provide a stable residence for formerly homeless people, often those who have experienced mental illness or spent years on the streets — and instead focus on transitional housing.Grant rules also would have eliminated funding for diversity and inclusion efforts, support of transgender clients and use of “harm reduction” strategies that seek to reduce overdose deaths by helping people in active addiction use drugs more safely.HUD wrote in its update that it still intends to make changes to the policy for awarding funds for addressing homelessness.A coalition of states co-led by Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha filed suit over HUD’s latest Notice of Funding Opportunity on Nov. 25. On Dec. 1, a group of cities and nonprofits led by the National Alliance to End Homelessness and the National Low Income Housing Coalition filed a separate 85-page lawsuit.Both complaints had similar requests for the court to declare the new conditions unlawful and reinstate language from prior funding notices, which is why McElroy opted to combine them into one hearing.But with the funding notice now withdrawn, Gheibi argued there was no need for immediate relief.Kristin Bateman, an attorney representing local communities and nonprofits and a senior counsel with Democracy Forward, argued court action is still needed. She said HUD’s rescission still leaves a critical funding gap for homeless services starting early next year since most federal fiscal 2024 grants start to expire in January.“Those gaps in funding mean that they will not have the money to continue supporting the permanent housing that they fund for people to live in,” Bateman said. “People are going to be displaced, put back into homelessness in the middle of winter and face all the harms that come with that.”McElroy scheduled the next hearing for 10 a.m. Friday, Dec. 19. She also tasked HUD with producing the administrative record on the grant funding policy, ideally within a week — though Gheibi had asked if it could wait until after the holidays.McElroy said if the administration could work quickly to rescind the funding notice, they can work quickly to give the court the documents she requested.“People can work overtime if they need to,” McElroy said. “I do, they do, I’m sure you do.”This story was originally produced by Rhode Island Current, which is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network which includes Stateline, and is supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

The family uses a program called self-directed services to pay care staff for Lilly (Photo submitted).Families of Missourians with developmental disabilities are urging legislators to protect a Medicaid program that allows them to manage their loved ones’ care as the state faces billions of dollars in federal cuts over the next decade.
The program, self-directed services, lets people with disabilities or their family members hire, train and manage their own care staff, tailored to their needs. Missourians who use the program say it helps people with disabilities live more independently at home instead of going into costly institutional care. 
And they say that’s a net win for people with disabilities, their families and the state.
“We are the state’s most vulnerable citizens,” said Larry Opinsky, a disability advocate and steering committee member of the Missouri SDS Support Group, an advocacy organization that represents families who use the program. “Without this support, the only way for our loved ones to receive the level of care they need in order to be healthy and safe would be in an institutional setting, and those costs are astronomically high.”
With the state poised to limit spending in anticipation of federal cuts to safety net programs, the group argued in a Nov. 11 online meeting with state lawmakers that the program is more economical and humane than state-operated treatment facilities.
Contributing to the state’s budget woes are over $900 billion in anticipated cuts to federal Medicaid funding in the next decade — part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Congress passed in July. Missouri could lose 14% of its federal Medicaid funding, somewhere between $11 and $18 billion over 10 years, according to KFF.
Self-directed services are an optional part of state Medicaid programs, which members of the group fear clouds the program’s future.
But Opinsky and Victoria McMullen, the group’s steering committee chair, said self-directed services aren’t optional for families who use them.
Opinsky said his 26-year-old daughter, who is non-ambulatory and nonverbal, can be active in her community because the self-directed services program enables the family to hire care staff for her.
McMullen said the program allows her husband to be compensated when care staff aren’t available for their 46-year-old son, who has cerebral palsy and autism.

“Our point is to make legislators know, ‘This is not the service to cut, because it will cost you more in the end,” McMullen said.
Data from the Missouri Department of Mental Health, which oversees self-directed services and institutional care, bears this out. The department reported that in fiscal year 2025, self-directed services cost an average $48,534 per person, while care in state-operated facilities for developmentally disabled Missourians cost over $600,000 per person.
Family members on the call said their worries stemmed partly from measures other states have already taken to reduce Medicaid costs and national conversations trending toward institutional care.
Idaho ended a service in July allowing family members to be compensated as caregivers for individuals with disabilities. Arizona added restrictions to a similar program in their state. U.S. lawmakers introduced a measure this summer that would reverse earlier incentives for states to invest in home- and community-based care over institutionalization.
“If community supports aren’t funded,” Opinsky said, “our population, the people that are on this call today, receiving self directed services, we’re the ones that are going to be added to that [institutionalization] conversation.”
 Budget questions

Lawmakers attending the group’s Nov. 11 virtual meeting expressed support for continued funding of self-directed services. But the uncertain condition of the state’s finances loomed over the discussion.
“I am in rooms constantly where the language that people are using is, how do we cut from the state budget, not how do we make more investments,” said state Rep. Betsy Fogle, a Democrat from Springfield and ranking member of the House Budget Committee, in an interview with The Independent.
During the meeting, Fogle said self-directed services could feature in tough budget conversations in the coming legislative session.
“If you’re talking about an optional program, I think that it is wise and prudent to understand that might be a place where the administration decides to cut,” Fogle said. 
State Rep. George Hruza, a Republican from St. Louis County on the House Health and Mental Health Committee, told The Independent that while he doesn’t anticipate that Missourians who use self-directed services will lose funding, higher state costs for programs like Medicaid could drive lawmakers to limit additional spending.
In fiscal year 2025, Missourians applying for new self-directed services waivers were placed on a waitlist due to budgetary constraints in the mental health department.
“My concern is that over the next two, three years, we may see a return of a waitlist for services,” Hruza said. 
“I’ll be pushing to make sure that disabled individuals are not left out in the cold,” Hruza said. “I think we can actually do it by encouraging more people to use those less costly and more humane ways to take care of disabled individuals.”
Lawmakers during the meeting encouraged families to tell their elected leaders about the importance of the program.
Opinsky said the group is trying to identify a family in each county to help in efforts to approach each elected state official. But he’s not convinced it will help.
“We knew darn well what we were going to get, and we got it,” he said, “which was, ‘No, you should tell your stories, and we don’t have a plan.”
 A meaningful life

McMullen said she worries about decisions her family would have to make if her son’s self-directed services budget is reduced.
Currently, he attends physical therapy twice a week. Even though he still needs care staff, it allows him to do more for himself.
If there’s a reduction, McMullen said, “we’ll have to make a decision. Maybe it’s physical therapy every other week.”
Opinsky said self-directed services allow him and his wife to work. With a personal care assistant, his daughter goes to the gym, volunteers at a preschool and takes music therapy and horseback riding classes. 
“My daughter lives a beautiful life right now because of these programs,” Opinsky said. “She’s active in her community. She volunteers. She knows more people around St. Louis than I do. She’s healthy, she’s safe, she has a community to be a part of.
“In the end,” Opinsky said, “as a Missourian, as a U.S. taxpayer, that’s what I want my public resources to do, is help provide people a meaningful life.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/opinskys-1024x614.jpeg,,,2025-12-10 10:58:32.517486

Jesse Bjorkman, R-Nikiski, speaks Wednesday, April 23, 2025, on the floor of the Alaska Senate. (Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)In a Friday hearing, members of the Alaska Senate spoke critically about a proposed new ferry terminal in Juneau, questioning why the project would be worth its multimillion-dollar cost.
Earlier this year, state legislators planned to divert $62 million from a variety of transportation projects in order to pay for the state share of federal transportation grants worth between $500 million and $600 million.
Lawmakers included the diversion in their budget for the year, but Dunleavy vetoed the maneuver, saying that the “funding is either still obligated in the original project or has been fully expended and is unavailable for reappropriation.”
That left legislators’ spending plan partially unfunded.
One of lawmakers’ biggest targets this past spring was DOT’s plan to build a new ferry terminal in Juneau, roughly 30 miles north of the existing terminal in Auke Bay, in Juneau at a place called Cascade Point, which would shorten ferry runs to Haines and Skagway.
Legislators sought to divert $37 million from an account intended to fund that new terminal, but Dunleavy vetoed the transfer and the Department of Transportation subsequently signed a $28.5 million contract for work on the terminal.
In October, the state’s ferry advisory board concluded that the project likely did not make economic sense. 
“Do you agree with that study?” asked Sen. Jesse Bjorkman, R-Nikiski, during Friday’s hearing of the Senate Transportation Committee.
“Can you please make the case to the Alaska people why you think investing this money … in the Cascade Point project makes fiscal sense for Alaskans?”
Anderson responded that “as a public agency, we’re more than economics. In this case, there’s this idea of saving people time with a much shorter run, saving money, the cost of operating that ship, we’re saving fuel. It’s less carbon emissions. I mean, there’s a lot of good benefits to shorter ferry runs.”
Lawmakers don’t have the votes to override the governor’s vetoes, which means that when they reconvene in January, they’ll have to come up with a new way to fund construction work this summer.
According to documents presented to the committee on Friday, the Alaska Department of Transportation has “deferred” about 25 projects 1-3 years “to remain within available match.”
Without new money, “fewer projects will move to contract award, limiting construction activity.”
Ryan Anderson, commissioner of the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities, told the transportation committee that his agency is prioritizing “shovel ready” projects, those that are about to go to construction.
“As we go and prioritize projects through this year, we’ll continue that action, and we’ll be ready. That’s really how we’re looking at this program,” he said.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/250423-Bjorkman-copy-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-10 09:57:40.708628

An hour before a court hearing on two federal lawsuits challenging the changes to a federal housing program, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced that it was rescinding the new policy, prompting a federal judge to say, “It feels like intentional chaos.” 
Adrienne Bush, executive director of the Homeless and Housing Coalition of Kentucky
Adrienne Bush, executive director of the Homeless and Housing Coalition of Kentucky, said Kentucky organizations welcomed the notice of rescission that HUD posted on its website Monday but still face uncertainty.
She said it’s “unclear how HUD intends to ensure that 2026 project renewals that currently house Kentuckians do not run out of funding.”
Bush said the federal government “should continue to fund projects that bridge the gap between high rents, low incomes, and permanent disabling conditions, like permanent supportive housing, not create more homelessness through instability and uncertainty.”
On Nov. 13 HUD issued a notice of an abrupt shift in funding priorities from permanent to transitional housing. The change threatened to return formerly homeless Kentuckians, many of them disabled, to the streets, warned leaders of nonprofits that provide housing and other aid.
The change would have put more than 2,000 Kentucky households at risk of becoming homeless again, according to an analysis by the Corporation for Supportive Housing.
HUD’s about-face came as a surprise to U.S. District Judge Mary S. McElroy of Rhode Island, who was set to hear arguments Monday in a request for a temporary restraining order to pause the earlier HUD decision, reports the Rhode Island Current.
“There’s a process and procedure that’s laid out,” said McElroy, a Trump appointee. “It’s not by tweets or by last-minute orders or last-minute withdrawals.”
An attorney for the plaintiffs,  Zane Muller, assistant attorney general for the state of Washington, said during the virtual hearing that he learned of the rescission “through our providers and [electronic filing], not through opposing counsel.”
Pardis Gheibi, a U.S. Department of Justice attorney representing HUD, told McElroy the notice was filed with the court as soon as it was published. She did not have the answer when McElroy wanted to know who at HUD made the decision to rescind the funding notice and when.
“We didn’t have the chance to confer with plaintiffs’ counsel — but the rescission happened this afternoon,” Gheibi told the judge.
McElroy scheduled the next hearing for Dec. 19. She also tasked HUD with producing the administrative record on the grant funding policy, ideally within a week — though Gheibi had asked if it could wait until after the holidays.
McElroy said if the administration could work quickly to rescind the funding notice, they can work quickly to give the court the documents she requested.
“People can work overtime if they need to,” McElroy said. “I do, they do, I’m sure you do.”

(Photo provided by Gettys Brannon)Anglers this year had two days to fish for red snapper. Next year, they want more than 60.
The Department of Natural Resources, with support from anglers, boaters and conservationists, is asking the federal government to extend the recreational fishing season for the recovering species in 2026 as part of a pilot program that could help determine how many red snapper are really swimming off the Atlantic coast.
Concern about Atlantic red snappers dates back to 2008, when a federal population survey found the number of fish dwindling. The federal government then shut down anglers’ access to the game fish, allowing only a few days a year to fish for them and severely limiting how many they can bring home: one snapper per person per day.
In recent years, however, fishers are coming back to land with stories about seeing more red snappers on the ends of their lines than ever before, suggesting the population has rebounded significantly, said Robert Boyles, who oversees policy for the Coastal Conservation League since retiring as director of DNR.
At the same time, federal limitations require anglers to toss back all the red snappers they catch outside the brief window. And the actual number of snappers living off the Southeastern coast remains unclear, since the federal data has a significant rate of error, according to DNR’s application to the federal government last month.
Expanding that window from the most recent period of two days to as many as 62 days could relieve some of the pressure on anglers to catch as many fish as possible in a short period of time, the agency wrote in its application. An added requirement that fishers report every snapper they catch could help improve data on the number of fish swimming off the coast, agency officials said in a news release.
Florida, North Carolina and Georgia made similar proposals, which a regional council will hear Wednesday morning before deciding whether to advance them to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for further approval.
DNR plans to make the same request every year for the next three years, according to its submission. If approved, the data collected by anglers over those years will inform how to move forward.
A brief season
Red snappers can get up to 40 inches long and live up to 50 years, according to NOAA.
They “are delicious,” said Sen. Stephen Goldfinch.
“They’re fun to fight, and they’re abundant,” the Murrells Inlet Republican said. “So, what do fishermen want? They want to go catch them.”
But after years of going out in punishing weather to take advantage of the brief fishing seasons, Goldfinch has opted during recent seasons to stay home and skip catching red snappers altogether, he said.
“I just don’t need the hassle of going and beating myself up and beating a boat up anymore,” he said.
Every year, the few days anglers have to bring home red snapper fall during hurricane season, meaning unpredictable weather. That was the case this year, when the two days in July anglers could bring their fish back to land brought a forecast of high severe winds and large waves.
In a letter to NOAA sent one day ahead of the two-day window, a bipartisan group of coastal legislators asked for an extension to the season so fishermen didn’t have to risk themselves and their boats to bring in the fish. NOAA denied the request.
“The least NOAA can do is ensure that the two days of access it has granted are actually fishable,” reads the letter by Rep. Lee Hewitt, a Murrells Inlet Republican, and 16 other legislators.
For Tommy Hancock, an abbreviated season means less business for his company, Sportsman Boats Manufacturing. He can’t put a number on how much money he loses each year, but he’s certain the Summerville manufacturer loses out when people don’t want to go out in choppy waters to fish for red snapper, he said.
“It’s a pretty bad obstacle for us, because people say, ‘Well, maybe I don’t need a boat. I can’t go catch fish anyway,’” Hancock said.
That’s bad news for a state with three of the largest tackle brands in the country and more than two dozen boat manufacturers, said Gettys Brannon, CEO of the South Carolina Boating and Fishing Alliance.
If the expansion is approved, “when folks come here, they’ll be able to take more charter trips,” Brannon said. “They’ll be able to spend more in tackle shops. They’ll put more hours on their motor. They’ll spend more days on their boats.”
“There’s a wide impact that a seemingly small decision, or a lack of good decisions, has an impact on from an economic perspective,” he said.
Dead discards
Most of the red snappers that anglers catch are dying anyway, according to DNR data included in its application.
Anglers who get a red snapper on their line while fishing outside the two-day window must throw them back into the ocean. But red snappers are more prone to dying than other fish after being pulled from the ocean’s depths.
If anglers are catching the fish anyway, and if those fish are dying once released back into the ocean, then the people catching them might as well keep them, said Martha Guyas, director of policy for the American Sportfishing Association’s southeastern offices.
“This has been a frustration point for anglers, because they’re seeing a lot of fish out there, and they’re catching them, but they’re not allowed to keep them,” Guyas said.
Conservation
Fishers want a hardy red snapper supply, since overfishing would mean the end of their hobby or livelihood, Brannon said. At the same time, they feel the need to balance the conservation of the species with the ability to continue fishing, he said.
“The ability for us to be able to balance the economy and ecology and come up with sound policy that actually creates a healthier fishery, it also creates a sound workforce and the ability for our industry to be sustainable here in the state,” Brannon said.
The Coastal Conservation League is on board with the proposal, since it will likely mean better data to get conservationists, scientists and anglers on the same page about what is necessary to keep the population booming, Boyles said.
“At the end of the day, we’re going to get better data out of this and hopefully get a better handle on the status of the stock,” Boyles said.
NOAA understands anglers’ frustration, southeast regional administrator Andy Strelcheck said in a news release. At the same time, the number of fish dying is too much, Strelcheck said.
“We as managers are also frustrated and see the need for new, innovative management strategies to reduce snapper-grouper dead discards, including red snapper,” Strelcheck said. “We also need to better realize the social and economic benefits for the snapper-grouper fishery, and provide additional fishing opportunities as we recover fish stocks.”
Continuing to overfish can further stunt the population of red snapper, causing more problems down the line, wrote Catherine Bruger, a fish conservation manager for national nonprofit Ocean Conservancy.
“If allowed to mature, these fish could usher in a golden era of red snapper fishing in the South Atlantic,” Bruger wrote. “But raising catch limits too high, or losing our ability to monitor catch, will wipe out these young fish and cause our best chance in years for a huge, healthy fishery to slip away for today’s fishermen and for future generations.”
That’s far from what South Carolina’s community of anglers and boaters want, advocates for the proposal said. The change is not permanent, Boyles added, and it includes safeguards to continue preventing overfishing.
Each angler would be allowed to take home only one fish, and it would have to be at least 20 inches long. With that in mind, expanding the season for a few years would be worth getting better information on how many snappers are swimming off the coast, he said.
“We want these resources available,” Boyles said.
He evoked a saying he used to hear his dad say: “Fish for you, fish for me. Fish for today, fish for tomorrow.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GBRT483483218_10227296266567672_8871798048061472051_n-1536x1152-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-10 09:57:40.708628

It was almost a year ago, in her annual State of the Commonwealth address, that Gov. Maura Healey made that declaration while boasting about the strides made in fixing the long beleaguered MBTA under Phil Eng, the man she brought on as general manager to run the system. 
This fall, Healey doubled down on her faith in Eng, tapping him to serve simultaneously as interim transportation secretary while retaining his GM job. All indications suggest he could continue to hold both roles for an extended period.  
The clearest sign of that may be what hasn’t happened: Eight weeks after his appointment, the governor’s office has not even started to search for a permanent secretary. Eng himself has begun signaling an openness to staying in the Cabinet for a longer stretch. Meanwhile, most of those watching developments across the state’s transportation policy landscape appear perfectly content with the setup, even while acknowledging that it’s put a lot of work on the shoulders of one man. 
“If anybody can do this, it’s him,” said Kate Dineen, president of the business-backed group A Better City, voicing a sentiment that seems to be widely shared. 
Healey asked Eng to take on the second role in mid-October, naming him interim transportation secretary after the abrupt resignation of Monica Tibbits-Nutt. She also named longtime highway administrator Jonathan Gulliver as transportation undersecretary, and, like Eng, asked him to do that new job in addition to his existing one. 
At the time, officials were coy about how long Eng would wear two hats. Healey said she was “taking it day by day.” 
Nearly two months later, little has changed. Healey’s office told CommonWealth Beacon that the administration has not started to search for a permanent transportation secretary, and the governor isn’t putting any specifics on when that will change. 
One transportation watchdog, with an eye on Healey’s 2026 reelection run, thinks Eng could continue to work both jobs for nearly all of next year. 
“I expect that Phil will serve in both roles through the election. He’s the safest pair of hands in transportation,” said Brian Kane, executive director of the MBTA Advisory Board, which represents cities and towns that help fund the T. “I think from [the governor’s] perspective, with an election coming up, they just want to make sure everything is steady.” 
For his part, Eng is open to remaining secretary however long Healey wants.  
“If it means staying interim for a longer period of time, indefinitely, I’m fine with that,” Eng told CommonWealth Beacon in an interview wedged in between a Massachusetts Department of Transportation board meeting and a bill-signing event with the governor. “If it means an opportunity to discuss a permanent role, I’m fine with that as well.” 
He just has one condition: Eng wants to keep his job at the T, even if he were to drop the “interim” title from the transportation secretary role. 
“We have a lot more to do there,” he said. “We’ve made a lot of headway, and I want to see that through.” 
He’s not earning any more money for the added responsibility managing the sprawling entity responsible for highways, the Registry of Motor Vehicles, aeronautics, and more. Eng continues to be paid only for the job of MBTA general manager, which at $546,684 last year made him one of the best-compensated employees in the state’s massive public sector. 
(Transportation secretaries are typically paid at a far lower rate than T chiefs. Tibbits-Nutt made $196,249 last year, according to state payroll data.) 
It’s not as if Eng was itching for another project before the secretary job opened. For the prior two and a half years, he’d been working one of the most demanding roles in the state. The T itself once advertised the general manager job as requiring work “up to twenty-four (24) hours per day, seven (7) days per week,” as the State House News Service reported.

Take it from Rich Davey, who worked as MBTA general manager and then transportation secretary — but never both jobs at the same time — under Gov. Deval Patrick. 
Davey, who now leads the Massachusetts Port Authority, recalled one particularly grueling stretch early in his tenure atop the T. He had been fighting a head cold, and so after a full day of work, he took NyQuill and turned in early for the night. 
Then he got a call that a major power outage at Downtown Crossing had shut down the Red and Orange lines, and that trains might not resume running by the following morning’s rush hour. 
“From there, even with the NyQuill, I don’t think I slept for almost 48 straight hours as we were working through those problems,” Davey said. “You don’t want those days, but those do come up.” 
Eng has unquestionably overseen a slew of accomplishments. A repair blitz eradicated most of the slow zones that had plagued riders for years. The 16-year wait for anti-collision technology on the Green Line is almost over. Last year was the first since 2009 in which the T had collective bargaining agreements in place with all 28 of its worker unions at once. 
But the MBTA is still the oldest public transit system in the country, a superlative that shows in much of its track, signal, and vehicle infrastructure. The last official calculation in 2023 estimated the cost of fixing everything that was not in a state of good repair to be $24.5 billion. And the system shows its age regularly —  just last week, Red Line commuters faced a sudden shift to shuttle buses for a few hours due to a “track problem.”
With all of those problems to solve, plus everything else transportation-related now on his plate, Eng continues to earn glowing praise from most power players in and around Beacon Hill for his no-nonsense, confident approach to improvements, his accessible, communicative demeanor, and the sense that tangible progress is finally visible. 
Tom McGee, who chairs the MBTA’s board of directors and also sits on the MassDOT board of directors, said Eng’s “work speaks for itself.” Rep. James Arciero, the House’s point person on transportation, described Eng’s tenure as “positive from the floorboards up.” And Sen. Brendan Crighton, Arciero’s counterpart in the Senate, said Eng has remained just as communicative with lawmakers as he was when he held only one job. 
“He’s one of the few people that answers every time I call,” Crighton said. “His entire team has been just as accessible. Nothing really has changed, other than a bigger scope of issues.” 
Meanwhile, the deification of Eng rolls along, with the divine subtext of “in Phil we trust” last week made explicit. Bill Bernardino, vice president of the Boston Carmen’s Union Local 589 that represents thousands of T workers, took to the microphone at a bill-signing and dubbed Eng “a gift from God,” as MASSterList noted. 
There have been a handful of rumblings, though, about the longer-term wisdom of asking Eng to work two immensely demanding jobs, no matter how good his reviews are. The editorial board of The Boston Globe called it a “bad idea.” Kane said he does not have any doubts about the quality of Eng’s work, but worries he will be pulled in too many directions. 
The job of MBTA general manager and state transportation secretary, he said, are separate and distinct because the T and MassDOT are “two large and complex organizations doing two different things.” 
“If the Legislature wanted one super transportation chief, they would have put that structure in place,” Kane said. “That’s not the structure we have.”

Though it’s hard to imagine feeling this way about responsibilities that have been piled on top of what can be a 24/7 job, Eng says he’s actually enjoying the additional work.
Before his more well-known tenure stewarding the New York City Transit system and leading the Long Island Rail Road, Eng spent decades in the New York state Department of Transportation, starting as a junior engineer and working his way up to key roles on projects such as construction of the Mario M. Cuomo Bridge. 
The interim secretary job, he said, has given him a chance to brush off some of those non-transit skills. 
“All the experience you learn over the course of 40-plus years in public transportation is stored away in this mind of mine,” Eng said. “It allows me to actually go back to different experiences, both in a dense, urban setting like New York City, but also in the rural upstate parts of New York.” 
Several insiders pointed to that mix of state-level transportation work and public transit expertise as a key asset. 
Dineen, the leader of A Better City, recalled meeting Eng in the 2010s when they both worked in the administration of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. At the time, she said, Eng was “the governor’s go-to project manager for the big roads and bridges projects that were super important and high profile.” 
“He’s gotten a lot of, I think, rightful accolades about the work he’s done to get the MBTA system back on track,” Dineen said. “From my perspective, really knowing Phil as first a roads and bridges expert, knowing that side of the infrastructure, I think he’s perhaps uniquely qualified to wear both of these hats at this time.” 
Another mitigating factor several people identified is the stable of qualified deputies at work. Gulliver regularly earns praise from transportation policy wonks, and multiple officials pointed specifically to MBTA chief engineer Sam Zhou and chief operating officer Ryan Coholan as key figures in recent successes. 
With enough capable hands taking care of the day-to-day demands in both the transportation department and MBTA, insiders said, Eng’s balancing act becomes a little bit easier. 
Davey credited Eng for his style of setting goals, then trusting employees to achieve them without micromanagement. 
“If he didn’t have a good team around him at either MassDOT or the T, I think he’d be cooked, but because he’s got a really strong leadership team, he can do both jobs,” Davey said. 
Davey said he had already been in regular contact with Eng, but didn’t feel much of a need to offer “been there, done that” suggestions about what it’s like to step up from MBTA general manager to transportation secretary. 
Eng, he said, is the kind of person who would consider any sound advice but does not actually need much of it.
“He worked for Andrew Cuomo, for God’s sake, and got promoted,” Davey said of the famously hot-headed former New York governor. “You’re talking about someone who has seen some tough projects and some tough leadership.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/10_16-GM_Eng_1-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-10 09:57:40.708628

Photo by Rilyn Eischens/Minnesota ReformerThe U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against Minneapolis Public Schools on Tuesday, alleging a provision in the district’s union contract shielding teachers of color from seniority-based layoffs is discriminatory and violates the Civil Rights Act.
The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Minnesota, marks the latest move in the Trump administration’s campaign to stamp out diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives across education, business and government.
The policy at issue requires the district to skip over teachers from “underrepresented populations” during seniority-based layoffs or involuntary reassignments. If the district calls back laid-off teachers, it must first reinstate teachers from those “underrepresented populations.”
A spokeswoman for Minneapolis Public Schools said the district does not comment on active litigation.
The district adopted the policy in 2022 in its labor contract with the Minneapolis Federation of Teachers as part of a deal to end a 14-day strike.
The teachers union pushed for the protections because teachers of color tend to be younger, and traditional “last-in, first-out” layoffs work against the district’s goal of recruiting and retaining a more diverse teaching force.
Around 20% of Minneapolis teachers are people of color, while roughly two-thirds of their students are. Studies have shown that a diverse teaching corps improves outcomes for students of all races.
The union contract says the purpose of the policy is to “remedy the continuing effects of past discrimination by the district,” but the Department of Justice argues there isn’t evidence of past discrimination. It also quotes Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, writing in a case over school desegregation programs, “The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.”
The Minneapolis policy doesn’t explicitly mention race — a deliberate feature aimed at helping it withstand legal challenges — and could apply to teachers from other underrepresented groups, such as LGBTQ and multilingual teachers. But the Department of Justice contends that “underrepresented populations” is just a proxy for race, color or national origin.
The lawsuit also takes aim at memorandum of agreement in the union contract under which the district partners with Black Men Teach, a nonprofit devoted to expanding the number of Black male teachers. The agreement gives Black Men Teach fellows a “concurrent” hiring process for positions at Nellie Stone Johnson Community School and exempts them from layoffs.
The Department of Justice argues the arrangement is discriminatory because female and non-Black teachers are not eligible to be Black Men Teach fellows.
Minneapolis Public Schools previously defended the policy in a separate lawsuit brought soon after its adoption by a city resident, Deborah Clapp, with backing from the conservative legal foundation Judicial Watch. Clapp argued she was harmed as a taxpayer having to fund a discriminatory policy.
In January, the Minnesota Supreme Court tossed out her case, finding she didn’t have standing, and her attorney vowed to appeal to President Donald Trump to investigate the “blatant civil rights violation,” Sahan Journal reported at the time.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/IMG_9592-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-12-10 09:57:40.708628

A state audit examining how California prisons handle complaints about its staff members found flaws with how the majority of cases were handled, and some facilities were slow to deal with sex assault cases filed against officers.
As CalMatters’ Nigel Duara explains, the state prisons’ inspector general released its latest audit last week, scrutinizing the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation’s disciplinary and criminal caseload involving prison staff. The report found that:

At least 279 women have sued the department, and at least 83 prison employees have been accused of sexual misconduct.
86% of the prison system’s caseload was considered “inadequate” or “needs improvement,” with “inadequate” to mean that there were significant problems with the investigation, which compromised its final outcome.
The corrections department’s legal staff took an average of nine months to send cases to internal investigators.

Delayed investigations for sexual assault cases, the audit argued, “significantly impairs the integrity and effectiveness of the investigative process.” In one case involving a dozen women who accused a lieutenant of sexual assault, internal investigators took so long to review the allegations that the lieutenant was able to retire before facing discipline.
The audit, which is released twice a year, rounds out a year that began with the high-profile conviction of a former guard at a Chowchilla women’s facility. In January Gregory Rodriguez was found guilty of 64 counts of sexual abuse. He worked at the prison until 2022 but the earliest report against him dated as early as 2014. Rodriguez was sentenced to 224 years in prison.

Could LGBTQ+ hotline return?

Assemblymember Mark González, a Los Angeles Democrat, introduced a bill Tuesday that would create a pilot program restoring the 988 suicide and crisis hotline for LGBTQ+ callers in L.A. County.
In July the federal administration under President Donald Trump ended specialized LGBTQ+ counseling for the hotline, which was accessible to callers after dialing 988 and pressing 3. This prompted the state to partner with The Trevor Project to train counselors at California’s 988 call centers to better address LGBTQ+ youth.
If González’s bill passes, the pilot program would enable callers in L.A. County to access a “988 press 3” option, serving as the initial de facto rollout to establish the option across the state. 

González, in a statement: “Before this reckless (federal) cut, 1.5 million contacts were made to Press 3. That doesn’t happen by accident — that happens because LGBTQ+ youth trust this lifeline and rely on it in their darkest moments.”

The proposal comes at a time when California’s own peer-run phone service — which provides free 24/7 non-emergency, mental health support to California residents — faced layoffs and limited services due to state budget cuts. 



CA congressmember faces ethics accusation

From CalMatters politics reporter Maya C. Miller:
A Democratic political action committee is accusing U.S. Rep. Young Kim, an Orange County Republican, of failing to disclose nearly $50,000 of privately funded travel in violation of federal financial reporting requirements. 
The group, End Citizens United, has asked the Office of Congressional Conduct, an independent and nonpartisan entity, to launch a formal investigation into why the congressmember didn’t include several privately funded trips — some of which were international and cost five figures — in mandatory federal financial filings.
Members of Congress and staff are allowed to accept trips if they receive approval from the House Ethics Committee. But they must also report any of those trips that cost more than $480. 
Kim’s team has described the discrepancy as an administrative error and said the congresswoman corrected it as soon as it was brought to her attention. They also noted she had approval from the House Ethics Committee to go on the trips.
Kim is currently locked in a tight race against fellow incumbent Rep. Ken Calvert, the state’s longest serving Republican, for the chance to represent one of California’s last remaining safe GOP seats. 
The Office of Congressional Conduct, created in 2008, reviews allegations of misconduct against members and staff and can choose to refer any investigations to the ethics committee for additional review.

The new ruling against the Trump administration’s use of the National Guard in Los Angeles comes as courts are considering other challenges to his deployment of troops to liberal cities, such as Portland and Chicago.


A federal judge has ordered the National Guard to leave Los Angeles and return to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s control in a stern rebuke of the Trump administration’s contention that it can leave troops in the city indefinitely. 
The order handed down today goes into effect at noon on Monday. 
“It is profoundly un-American to suggest that people peacefully exercising their fundamental right to protest constitute a risk justifying the federalization of military forces,” U.S. District Court Judge Charles Breyer wrote in the opinion.
The Los Angeles case is one of several challenging Trump’s deployment of the National Guard in liberal cities, including Chicago and Portland. The U.S. Supreme Court is weighing a case on Trump’s call-up of troops to Chicago, which could further determine whether the domestic mobilizations are constitutional.
Breyer in June issued a separate decision against Trump’s Los Angeles deployment, but the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals blocked the ruling from taking effect and allowed the troops to stay. 
“Today’s ruling is abundantly clear – the federalization of the National Guard in California is illegal and must end,” Newsom said in a written statement. “The president deployed these brave men and women against their own communities, removing them from essential public safety operations. We look forward to all National Guard servicemembers being returned to state service.” 
The Trump administration used Section 12406 of the U.S. Code to justify sending National Guard troops to Los Angeles in early June, when aggressive immigration enforcement operations led to protests. The administration issued similar orders in August and again in October, each time citing the clause that permits Trump to federalize National Guard troops if “the President is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.” 
In each case, the Trump administration argued that the conditions in Los Angeles in early June justified sending in the National Guard. Trump mobilized 4,000 of the state’s National Guard troops in response to two days of occasionally volatile protests against federal immigration raids in Southern California. Almost all of them have returned home.
Before Trump’s federalization of those troops, at no time in U.S. history was the law invoked without the consent of the state governor. Use of the law is exceedingly rare: It was used just once before June by President Richard Nixon to mobilize troops during a postal worker strike in 1970.
“It defies the record — and common sense — to conclude that risks stemming from protests — in August, October, or even present day — could not have been sufficiently managed without resorting to the National Guard,” wrote Breyer, the brother of retired Supreme Court justice Stephen Breyer.
There are three conditions that presidents can use to invoke Section 12406: If the country is invaded or in danger of invasion; if there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the U.S. government; or if the president cannot enforce the nation’s laws with regular forces. 
The Trump administration focused on the last one, arguing that previous court rulings found that the president need only be “significantly impeded” from executing the country’s laws, rather than being completely “unable” to execute them, to comply with Section 12406, and argued that the existing risk of further protests justified the continued presence of the National Guard. 
Breyer rejected that argument, saying that the mere threat of protests or uprisings compromising the president’s ability to execute the country’s laws is not enough to justify federalization of the National Guard. 
“if federalization justified federalization, it would become a positive feedback loop that perpetually rationalized federal control of state troops,” Breyer wrote. 
The Trump administration, in its briefings, argued both that the federal mission had succeeded and conditions in Los Angeles had improved, but said the situation still required the presence of National Guard troops.
“Their assertion that ‘[t]here remains an inability to execute the laws . . . in California’ is not only unsupported, but actually borders on a misrepresentation,” Breyer wrote.
Breyer also warned that the Trump administration’s justification for federalizing National Guard troops, if allowed to proceed, would set a dangerous precedent. 
The Trump administration “confirmed their position that, after an initial federalization, all extensions of federalization orders are utterly unreviewable, forever,” Breyer wrote. 
“That is shocking. Adopting Defendants’ interpretation of Section 12406 would permit a president to create a perpetual police force comprised of state troops, so long as they were first federalized lawfully.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/060825-SEIU-ICE-Protest-TS-29.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-10 14:57:34.566527

The Alabama State Board of Education has delayed a vote on new textbooks after at least two members raised concerns about the content in social studies textbooks. (Todd Van Emst for Alabama Reflector)The Alabama State Board of Education will not vote on recommended social studies and arts education textbooks at its monthly meeting Thursday, and it’s unclear when the vote will take place. 
At least two members of the board have criticized the content of the social studies textbooks, which pushed a vote on the textbooks off the November agenda.
“I want to make sure that board members get all of their questions answered before we bring something to the board for a vote,” Alabama Schools State Superintendent Eric Mackey said after the Nov. 13 meeting.

Board member and President Pro Tem Kelly Mooney said in an interview Monday the social studies textbooks did not “reflect the values of the people of Alabama,” but said she did not have specific concerns with the books.
“I didn’t feel that it was as strong as it could be, and we’re having these books for a long time, and you know they’re for all grades, so I just felt like we need to cast a wider net in a way to get better selection and options,” Mooney said.
District 1 Board Member Jackie Zeigler said that while she had concerns about the social studies textbooks, she was unsure if they could be addressed in totality due to the timeframe board members and the public had to view the textbooks.
“There were some concerns, but I just felt I didn’t have enough time to actually delve deep enough into them to either see if this is a concern that would give me one thought process, or did it work itself out,” Zeigler said.
Zeigler did not say what specific concerns she had with the social studies textbooks.
Wayne Reynolds, a board member representing District 8, said in an interview last Thursday that fellow board member Allen Long had objections to the books. A message seeking comment from Long was left Tuesday.
State Board of Education members were given scores granted to textbooks by the Alabama State Textbook Committee.
The two committees, one for social studies and one for arts education were appointed in April to review and recommend textbooks to the State Board of Education. After the committees were done reviewing the materials, the scores were sealed and given to board members.
Board members Tracie West from District 2; Tonya Chestnut from District 5 and Marie Manning from District 6 all said last week they had no concerns regarding the textbooks.
“If my fellow board members have questions, certainly that’s their prerogative and their role,” West said in an interview last week. “But I have had no discussions with anyone in my district. I’ve had no calls from parents, from teachers, or grandparents. It’s been very quiet, not a single call about textbooks from District 2.”
Board members and the public were given a one month time-frame to view the textbooks at select libraries across the state. Public viewings of the library closed Nov. 12.
No board member had any concerns with the arts education textbooks.
A message seeking comment from board member Yvette Richardson was left Tuesday.
Mackey said after the Nov. 13 meeting that the textbook vote could happen “sometime in 2026.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/01-txtbook-tve-1-1024x519.jpg,,,2025-12-10 08:58:00.555448
,California,2025-12-10 13:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,Cap and trade gets a new name and a new mission beyond cutting carbon pollution,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/12/cap-and-trade-new-mission/,"Revenues from the state's carbon emissions auction will be used for high speed rail, wildfire suppression and legislators' discretionary spending.","Nineteen years ago, during actor Arnold Schwarzenegger’s governorship, he and the Legislature created a program that would, in theory, reduce California’s emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases deemed to affect the planet’s climate. 
The plan, dubbed cap and trade, authorizes the California Air Resources Board to conduct quarterly auctions of emissions allowances which refineries, electric power generators and other industrial facilities purchase to offset their emissions. It’s an alternative to actually reducing emissions or financing other projects to cut them.
Once purchased, the allowances can be sold and traded back and forth. As the auction prices increase over time, emitting facilities would, in theory, be motivated to make reductions.
Proceeds from the auctions have steadily increased and today run about $5 billion a year, which  the state is spending on climate-related projects, officials boast.
“The program’s proceeds have funded nearly $33 billion in investments across the state and cut carbon pollution equivalent to taking 1.3 million gas-powered cars off the road,” Gov. Gavin Newsom’s proposed 2025-26 budget declared.
The program is due to expire in 2030, and Newsom wanted the Legislature to extend it to 2045, the date when California is supposed to achieve carbon emission neutrality. Legislators balked at a simple extension and, instead, insisted on making some changes that tightened the number of emission allowances and gave lawmakers more authority over spending the revenues.
The program gained a new name, cap-and-invest, which implies that, as the auction proceeds have reached multi-billion-dollar levels, politicians’ chief focus for how the money is spent has changed from emissions reduction.
As a new report on the revisions from the Legislative Analyst’s Office points out, cap-and-invest funds “can continue to be viewed as akin to tax revenues and be legally available to expend for any purpose.” In other words, while the program is touted as financing emission-reducing programs, its billions in revenue can be spent on anything a governor and legislators want to finance.
The state’s woebegone bullet train project has been receiving a quarter of auction revenues, roughly $1 billion a year. But in the new version it will be guaranteed a flat $1 billion a year to keep it alive — barely — as state officials try to scare up the many billions of dollars more needed for the bullet train to become a reality.
While supporters ballyhoo the bullet train as something that would have a major impact on emissions by reducing auto traffic, the High Speed Rail Authority’s own projections indicate that, were it to be fully completed, it would reduce automobile emissions by scarcely 1%. Meanwhile construction actually increases emissions.
At Newsom’s behest, the revised program will also channel $1.25 billion into supporting wildfire suppression, thereby relieving pressure on the state’s deficit-ridden budget.
Legislators, in turn, have set aside another $1 billion as “discretionary” spending — meaning it can be spent on anything legislative leaders want.
Those three things will consume most of the money, while having minimal impact on greenhouse gas emissions.
When the Legislative Analyst’s Office was describing auction proceeds as “akin to tax revenues,” it was putting on paper something that’s been apparent for years — that cap and trade is a backdoor tax on consumers, because industrial purchasers fold auction payments into the prices of what they produce.
An obvious example is gasoline. It’s widely accepted that California’s gas prices, the highest in the nation, include about 30 cents a gallon in cap-and-trade costs incurred by refiners. That $4 billion annual hit on motorists, moreover, is not being spent on improving roadways, but on a bunch of other things politicians fancy.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091225-High-Speed-Rail_LV_CM_03.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-10 08:58:00.555448

A prominent political organization committed to electing Democratic pro-choice women has weighed in on one of Michigan’s most competitive House races headed into the new year, making good on an earlier promise to target sitting U.S. Rep. Tom Barrett, a Republican from Charlotte. 
On Wednesday, EMILYs List gave its endorsement to former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink running in Michigan’s 7th  Congressional District. 
Brink, who resigned from the position in April, citing President Donald Trump’s prioritization of Russia over Ukraine in peace talks between the two nations, is one of five Democrats seeking to unseat Barrett, with Navy SEAL veteran Matt Maasdam, Lansing activist William Lawrence, family medicine doctor Muhammad Salman Rais, Elyon Badger and Alexandra Prieditis also seeking the Democratic nomination.
Earlier this year, EMILYs list announced it would target Barrett’s seat in 2026 in an effort to deliver the district for Democrats. Michigan’s 7th congressional has been called one of the most competitive districts in the nation, with the nonpartisan Cook Political Report rating the district as a “toss-up.”
While Republicans have criticized Brink as a carpetbagger, EMILYs List President Jessica Mackler noted that Brink is a sixth-generation Michigander and the first woman U.S. ambassador in a war zone, with a “proven track record of standing up to Donald Trump.”
“We need battle-tested leaders, like Bridget, who have the experience to take on tough fights,” Mackler said. “In Congress, she will work to lower costs for working families, stand up to extremism, and tap her national security background to keep Michigan communities safe. EMILYs List is proud to support Bridget Brink in the fight to flip Michigan’s 7th Congressional District.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-18-114601-1024x634.png,,,2025-12-10 08:58:00.555448

Kypreos is refusing to discuss the suit that alleges his brokerage conspired with Zillow to inflate the price of homes, garner hidden fees, and steer prospective buyers to costly mortgage loans that were not in their interest.  
Kypreos refused to resign following the six to five vote, according to several sources who asked not be named out of fear of retaliation. 
LVR is regrouping after alleged election rigging that consumed the organization a year ago and resulted in the resignation of its president just days into his term. 
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) lawsuit, reported by the Current last month, alleges Kypreos’ brokerage, GK Properties, colluded to redirect prospective buyers who click on the blue button on Zillow listings, expecting to be connected with the listing agent. Instead, the buyers were contacted by Kypreos’ agents, who closed escrow, collected commissions, and paid a 40% back end cut to Zillow, leaving the listing agent without the opportunity to negotiate with both parties, the lawsuit alleges. 
The alleged practice increases the price of homes, the suit contends. “If buyers were directed to sellers’ agents, they would be better positioned to negotiate a lower purchase price, because the seller would not have to pay commissions to the seller’s agent and the buyer’s agent.”

After reading the Current’s story, Las Vegas real estate agent Cindy Lowman says out of curiosity she clicked on the Zillow ad for her own property, which she has listed for sale. Lowman says she “very quickly” received a request from Cheryl Kypreos of Signature Real Estate to show the property. 
George Kypreos and LVR have refused to comment. 
In October, Gov. Joe Lombardo joined Kypreos to celebrate his new partnership in Signature Real Estate. Kypreos is a regular contributor to Lombardo’s campaigns. 
 Wild ride

Meanwhile, existing single-family homes in Southern Nevada hit a record median sales price of $488,995 in November, even as Southern Nevada’s new and existing home markets have cooled since the post-pandemic buying frenzy in which properties for sale routinely garnered multiple offers. 
“Local home sales have been on a roller coaster ride in recent years,” says Tuesday’s news release from LVR, which reports the median price of a home sold in November increased 1.9% over last year, topping the previous record of $485,000. 
“Even with this new record for our median home price, overall trends have been shifting more in favor of home buyers,” Kypreos said in the news release. “We’re selling fewer homes. We have more homes available for sale. And we saw a nice dip in mortgage interest rates last week. All of this benefits people who are prepared and can afford to buy.” 
As of Tuesday, the average 30-year mortgage rate in the U.S. was 6.39%.
LVR reported 7,033 single-family homes for sale had no offer in November, up 26% from a year ago. Additionally, 2,613 condos and townhomes had no offers in November, up 41% from last year. 
LVR reported 1,918 single-family homes, condos and townhomes sold last month. 
Sales were down 6.6% for homes, compared with November 2024, and down 20% for condos and townhomes.
In November, 71% of existing homes and 67% of condos and townhomes sold within 60 days.  That’s down from a year ago when close to 80% of homes and 78% of condos and townhomes sold within 60 days. 
On the new home front, Southern Nevada builders sold 536 homes in November, the second lowest month of the year behind September, when builders sold 509 homes, according to Home Builders Research. 
Ten builders in Southern Nevada had some 664 homes in standing inventory as of the end of November.

According to data presented by Alabama Chief Justice Sarah Stewart to the Judicial Resources Allocation Commission Tuesday, Alabama has had on average 7.79 fewer circuit court judges than legally required over the last three fiscal years. In fiscal year 2025, which ended on Sept. 30, there were 12.38 fewer circuit judges than needed based on the total workload minutes for each circuit judge. 
“Constitutionally, there has to be a district judge in every county,” Stewart said. “Some of these little tiny counties, they still need one, but they don’t have as many cases.”

According to the Alabama Access to Justice Commission, district courts handle criminal misdemeanor offenses and preliminary hearings in felony prosecutions, and civil cases where the fines are between $3,000 and $10,000. Circuit courts handle all felony, criminal cases and civil cases where the money in dispute is more than $10,000.
Based on case filings and the number of judges in each court, the state needs 162.38 circuit judges, according to the data.
The data showed the opposite for district court judges. Over the last three fiscal years, there has been a 28.96 surplus of district judges throughout the state. Some counties like Madison, Shelby and Tuscaloosa have deficits, but 80% of Alabama counties had a surplus over the last three years. 
There are 109 district court judges in the state, but based on workload measured in the data, only 80.04 are needed.
In the data, Jefferson County is split by Jefferson-Birmingham and Jefferson-Bessemer. Jefferson-Birmingham had the highest surplus over the last three years at 4.19 additional judges, according to the data.
The commission cannot reallocate any current judges until 2027 under a 2023 law that added 13 additional district and circuit judges to address deficits. Stewart said in an interview after the meeting that moving judges between jurisdictions would not fix the problem.
“As long as we show statewide need for certain judgeships, moving them around is not going to do anything,” Stewart said. “This commission can recommend all day long, but the Legislature has to do it.”

Catherine Cortez Masto. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)“No United States currency may feature the likeness of a living or sitting President.”
That, in its entirety, is the text of a bill introduced by Nevada U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto and her Democratic colleague, Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon.
Last month, the U.S. Mint published draft designs of a proposed $1 coin to commemorate next year’s 250th anniversary of the Second Continental Congress approving the Declaration of Independence.
Whether to to the nation’s surprise, expectation, approval, revulsion, or resignation, those designs — to borrow phrasing from the Cortez Masto-Merkley bill — feature the likeness of a living and sitting President, i.e., Donald Trump.
The U.S Mint’s draft designs of a potential Trump-themed coin to commemorate, ironically, some might say, the 250th anniversary of the American colonies declaring independence from a king.
“While monarchs put their faces on coins, America has never had and never will have a king,” said Cortez Masto, perhaps optimistically, in a release Monday announcing the legislation.
Trump’s “self-celebrating maneuvers are authoritarian actions worthy of dictators like North Korea’s Kim Jong Un, not the United States of America,” added Merkley.
Trump’s visage has yet to occupy U.S. currency, but it has long adorned multiple souvenir coins available for purchase at a broad range of price points.
While his face isn’t on them, because they don’t exist in the physical world, Trump, along with his family and associates, has also created billions of dollars worth of a variety of meme coins and other cryptocurrency ventures. Those Trump digital assets have been purchased or deployed in transactions by personages and interests the world over since Trump was inaugurated, propelling Trump and his family to fabulous levels of wealth like they have never seen before.
Earlier this year Congress was debating legislation to legitimize and prop up stablecoin, one of the forms of crypto by which Trump and his family have profited significantly since Trump took office. Complaining of “rubberstamping Trump’s crytpo corruption” and Trump “selling access to the government for personal profit,” Merkley was among a majority of Senate Democrats who wanted the legislation to include language prohibiting a sitting president from personally profiting from digital assets.
The prohibition did not make it into the bill, and Merkley and a majority of Senate Democrats voted against the stablecoin legislation.
However, the legislation passed thanks to a minority of Senate Democrats, including Cortez Masto and Nevada Sen. Jacky Rosen, who voted with Senate Republicans to approve the measure.

Andy Beshear and his wife, Britainy, on Tuesday, Dec. 9, in Hopkinsville. (Governor’s office photo)Two years after local and state leaders gathered at the James E. Bruce Convention Center to break ground on a major new manufacturing facility, Toyota Boshoku America has officially opened its $225 million plant in Hopkinsville. The project — announced in early 2023 and under construction since that summer — is bringing 157 full-time jobs to Christian County as production ramps up.
Gov. Andy Beshear joined company officials and local leaders Tuesday to cut the ribbon on the 365,400-square-foot facility, located on roughly 50 acres in South Park, a few miles north of Interstate 24. The plant is Toyota Boshoku’s first designated “smart facility” in North America, incorporating advanced robotics, automation and digital systems designed to reduce waste and streamline production, according to a news release from the governor’s office. 
The Hopkinsville plant began producing seat frame mechanism parts last month, including tracks, recliners and motors used by several major automakers. The company, a global supplier of automotive interior systems, now operates five facilities in Kentucky and employs more than 1,100 people statewide.
The state approved an incentive package early in the project requiring an average hourly wage of $40, including benefits, across the 157 full-time positions. Several job openings are posted on the company’s website.
 Local leaders laud opening, job growth

Hopkinsville Mayor James Knight said the community is “proud to be the New Kentucky Home for Toyota Boshoku,” adding that the company joins a growing base of 75 industries and 24 international firms already operating in the city.
Christian County Judge-Executive Jerry Gilliam, who in 2023 praised the concept of a “smart facility” aligning with what he called a “smart community,” said the project has continued to reflect Toyota Boshoku’s commitment to being a good neighbor. The new jobs, he added, represent “phenomenal growth” for the region.
Carter Hendricks, executive director of the South Western Kentucky Economic Development Council, said Tuesday’s ceremony marks a milestone not only for Toyota Boshoku, but for South Park and the manufacturers clustered along Fort Campbell Boulevard.
“With their state-of-the-art investment and significant job creation, the company’s newest location is adding to the region’s growing manufacturing economy and creating transformational opportunities for regional residents and small businesses,” he said.
 Manufacturing, EV projects gain momentum across Christian County

Hopkinsville has seen a surge of industrial investment in recent years, much of it tied to the electric-vehicle supply chain. Ascend Elements’ battery-materials plant in Commerce Park II — once projected as a $1 billion project — has scaled back part of its planned production and temporarily paused construction, but the company still intends to make precursor cathode materials and lithium carbonate starting in 2026.
Despite Ascend’s slowdown, related projects continue to move forward. Cinis Fertilizer is building a $109.2 million facility nearby that will recycle a byproduct of Ascend’s process, and ExxonMobil acquired Superior Graphite’s long-running Hopkinsville plant to support its entry into synthetic graphite for EV batteries.
The region is also diversifying beyond automotive and energy. Kitchen Food Co. plans to open a $69 million prepared-foods plant in Commerce Park I, bringing an expected 925 jobs — the county’s largest job announcement in more than two decades.

We urge South Carolinians to ask what this effort is really accomplishing and at what cost.
Deploying the National Guard may play well in headlines, but it doesn’t build safer neighborhoods.
In Washington, D.C., we’ve lived through the first phase of this federal surge. What we saw was a dramatic spike in low-level arrests and swarms of federal agents in public spaces, all under the banner of a so-called “crime emergency.”
What followed was increased burdens on young people, overwhelmed courts, the cancellation of vital community activities and, most troubling of all, polling that showed the majority of residents felt less safe than before.

Deploying the military is not a sustainable strategy for public safety.
The presence of a badge or a uniform alone doesn’t guarantee justice, and we can use federal tax dollars more effectively.
When Congress slashes funding for violence interruption, youth programs, housing, and mental health services and then turns around and floods the streets with militarized agents, they’re not offering a solution.
They’re creating a short-term spectacle that ignores long-term needs.
This year, major cities across the country saw encouraging reductions in violent crime. That happened because of years of investment in prevention, community-based support, and early intervention strategies.
In Washington, we’ve seen the evidence: hospital-based violence intervention programs, youth engagement, behavioral health resources, and mentorship initiatives work. They create real, measurable safety by keeping people connected and supported.

We are not naïve. We know public safety is a serious concern for many communities, including in South Carolina.
But sustainable safety cannot be imposed from the outside in. It must be built from the ground up in close partnership with residents, local officials, and community organizations who understand what’s happening on the ground.
That’s why it’s so alarming to see this deployment move forward with no local consultation and no clear strategy.
Policymakers should stop ignoring the data and start funding what works.
Militarized “solutions” may be good for soundbites, but they do nothing to address the root causes of violence.
Our community deserves more than posturing.
Washington residents deserve the right to govern ourselves, including determining how best to achieve long-term safety. Washington’s voters overwhelmingly support public safety solutions built on trust and meaningful investment.

We need to move away from the archaic practice of using property taxes to pay for schools and shift the burden to income taxes.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Steven Gaarder: Moving Vermont school taxes into the modern era.","Dear Editor,



The latest Education Finance Update from the Joint Fiscal Office projects a school property tax hike of nearly 12% that is, for many, unwelcome, but unsurprising given that costs are going up for everything. So it’s been proposed that we move money from the general fund into the education fund, which we did last year and have done in some previous years as well. I say: good plan.
The use of property taxes to pay for education made good sense when most of people’s income came from their house and lands. But that’s not true anymore. There are plenty of people who are “house poor” — they own a valuable house (just about any house is valuable these days) but don’t have much income. These people pay a big chunk of their income in school taxes. People better off, who may own a house worth five times as much but have an income 20 times greater, pay a small fraction of their income to support the schools.

We need to move away from the archaic practice of using property taxes to pay for schools and shift the burden to income taxes. We could do this in one bold stroke — see a bill proposed by Sen. Vyhovsky, P/D-Chittenden Central. But a more gradual approach is probably better, and that’s what moving money from the general fund will accomplish. So let’s do that, and allow ourselves to increase it each year, so we can move to a more fair and equitable way to fund the schools that are so important to our future.

Port KC is planning to take the property tax exemption to a vote on Dec. 15 (Josh Merchant/The Beacon).The Country Club Plaza isn’t what it used to be.
On the outside, its Spanish-style architecture and intricate facades have inspired many residents to call the Plaza the “crown jewel” of Kansas City.
But look a little closer. In recent years, storefronts have hollowed out, sales have slumped and the aging landmark has flipped from owner to owner struggling to revive the once-vibrant shopping district.
Under the new ownership of Dallas-based Gillon Property Group, a rescue plan is underway. Now, city officials and community leaders are facing a massive tax incentive request that they worry could hurt Kansas City Public Schools and other government services.
“A lot of people told us not to” buy the Plaza, said Dustin Bullard, the vice president of partnerships and place at Gillon Property Group, at a Dec. 3 meeting at Kansas City Hall. People said “it seemed tired, it’s unsafe. There’s deferred maintenance. It’ll never be the same as it once was. We didn’t believe that. We believed that the Plaza had meaningful history, very unique architecture. It has great walkability and extremely strong community touch.”
The developers behind the project are seeking a $309 million tax incentive through the Port Authority of Kansas City (Port KC) that would cap the Plaza’s property tax bill for three decades. That would particularly impact Kansas City Public Schools, which receives the majority of the Plaza’s property tax revenue.
Kansas City also is in the process of creating a tax-increment financing district for the Plaza renovation. That kind of tax incentive would essentially take most of the new sales taxes paid at Plaza shops created or bolstered by redevelopment and, instead of spending it on city services, divert it for infrastructure upgrades in the Plaza for the next 23 years. That incentive would be worth about $110 million over the life of the plan.
 Port KC tax breaks

The majority of tax incentives for the Plaza redevelopment would come from Port KC in the form of property tax breaks.
Under the plan, Port KC will technically own the land in the Plaza and lease that land to the Gillon Property Group for a small price.
But because government agencies like Port KC don’t pay property taxes, that gives them the freedom to collect what’s called a “payment in lieu of taxes” — essentially a custom tax rate that’s much lower than what Gillon would owe if it owned the property directly.
The proposal has not been finalized. But the developer sent a document to Kansas City’s taxing jurisdictions on Nov. 6 showing that Port KC intended to give the project a 100% tax exemption on all improvements for the next 30 years.
That means that the assessed property value will be capped for the next 30 years, with a 2% increase on every odd-numbered year. The Gillon Property Group will continue to pay its current property tax bill for that period — roughly $4 million per year until 2054.
But that’s a fraction of what the ownership group would otherwise owe. Over those three decades, the Plaza’s owners will get a break on 72% of their total estimated property taxes they would otherwise pay without the tax incentive, or about $309 million. That’s about $10 million per year.
By comparison, the KC Current received a 90–95% tax break on its riverfront stadium district for 10 years — a similar tax break to the Plaza, but for a much shorter period of time.
And this is where things get tense.
Economic development agencies give tax incentives to developers based on a “but-for” argument.
Basically, developers say that the project would not be possible “but for” a break on their taxes. If Kansas City is willing to sacrifice some property tax revenue for a few years, the developer can break even and construct new buildings that, in the long run, will generate more property taxes further down the line.
But if you give up too much future property tax revenue, you’ll miss out on all of the benefits that you would otherwise get from these kinds of projects.
Taxing jurisdictions, which are the bodies of government that rely on property tax revenue to pay for their budgets, will lose out on a potential $309 million over the next 30 years. Taxing jurisdictions include schools, libraries, fire districts, the city and county and smaller agencies like the Jackson County Community Mental Health Fund.
In this case, Kansas City Public Schools will lose out on the most money. The school district receives about 61% of all property taxes generated by the Plaza.
So if this proposal is approved by the Port KC Board of Commissioners, KCPS is estimated to miss out on $188 million by 2054 — an average of $6 million per year. In 2025, that’s equivalent to about 2% of the school district’s local revenue.
 ‘I feel pretty underinformed’

When Port KC announced that it would consider this proposal at its Nov. 17 meeting, KCPS fought back.
The Port KC board meeting kicked off on that Monday afternoon with about two dozen KCPS parents in the Zoom virtual meeting room, ready to give public comment to the board in opposition to the proposal.
“I want to live in a city that can provide a quality, free public education to every student,” said Laura Wittmer, a parent of a KCPS preschooler, “not a dog-eat-dog situation where you’re sitting there trying to figure out, do you need to flee to a new community altogether? Do you need to find a way to shell out $20,000 a year for private school?”
Ultimately, leaders at Port KC decided before the Nov. 17 meeting began to postpone a decision on the tax incentives for the Plaza. In the meantime, Port KC CEO Jon Stephens said the agency would engage in further discussions with the school district.
“The leadership at Kansas City Public Schools appreciates the Port KC board not rushing this project through in line with the District’s request for increased participation and transparency,” said KCPS spokesperson Shain Bergan in an email. “KCPS Superintendent Dr. Jennifer Collier looks forward to negotiations that lead to Kansas City’s kids and teachers benefiting from this investment in our region’s future.”
Other parents were frustrated that it was impossible to find public information about the proposal and that they were only given three days of notice that Port KC intended to make such an impactful decision.
That’s partly because Port KC chose not to present this proposal at a development committee meeting, which is the standard for most other projects. At that meeting, members of the public would have seen more information about what the project would look like and more financial information about the developer and the scale of the tax incentive.
Meredith Hoenes, a spokesperson for Port KC, told The Beacon that the agency skipped the development committee due to “timing.” But she said the full approval process will take a month after the developer makes a presentation to the board. Over the course of that month, the public will be welcome to provide more feedback before the final approval.
At the Nov. 17 meeting, even some members of the Port KC Board of Commissioners did not know any information about what was being proposed.
During the public comment period, Port KC Commissioner Morgan Said asked Stephens to provide some background on the proposal that staff had presented to the school district.
“I feel pretty underinformed about exactly what it is that we’re talking about,” Said said, “outside of just, in general, the Plaza may receive incentives someday, administered by Port KC.”
But Stephens declined, saying that he didn’t want to present the full proposal before certain details were nailed down by City Hall.
The Beacon confirmed the details of the tax incentive package by obtaining the document that was shared with the taxing jurisdictions. A spokesperson for Port KC declined to provide the details directly.
To approve the incentives, the Port KC board will need to vote “yes” on two separate measures over the next couple of months. Port KC expects the board to take the first of the two votes on Dec. 15.
 Public-sector pushback

Kansas City Councilmember Wes Rogers, who also serves on the Port KC Board of Commissioners, will be one of the seven people who ultimately make the final decision on tax incentives for the Plaza.
(Port KC is a state-sanctioned agency that operates independently from the Kansas City Council, so the taxation deal will never come before the City Council for a decision.)
Rogers believes that the Plaza redevelopment has the potential to boost KCPS revenues. And he said he’ll only vote for the incentives if they ultimately leave the school district better off than it is now.
“We have to do something to make sure the Plaza’s future is as bright as its past,” Rogers said. “We cannot do that in such a way that it hurts KCPS. And in fact, we can’t do that in a way that even keeps KCPS where it is now. This deal needs to be something that both improves the Plaza and puts money into the kids who go to public schools.”
That might sound like an oxymoron — by definition, a property tax break will divert money that would otherwise go to schools.
But the purpose of tax incentives is to make new development possible by getting a project across the finish line. If development agencies are strategic, they can sacrifice some property taxes in hopes that it will pay off later with higher property values and therefore more property tax revenue down the line.
Rogers said the city needs to move quickly on the Plaza. But not so fast that the public can’t keep up.
“We’ve got to incentivize stuff to get good projects done,” he said. “But we shouldn’t hide that from the public. We should be open about what we’re doing because I think it’d be a lot more buy-in if we were showing people what the trade-offs are.”
And that’s one of the big concerns for Bruce Eddy, the executive director of the Jackson County Community Mental Health Fund. He runs one of the taxing jurisdictions that’s set to lose out on potential property tax revenue if the Port KC incentives move forward.
Eddy gets the sense that the Port KC incentives are being pushed through without much careful consideration for the real financial consequences.
He compared it to the Power and Light District, where Kansas City ended up being on the hook for debt payments for years because the developments didn’t generate as much revenue as anticipated.
“Here’s a developer that’s making a lot of lovely promises, and we hope that they are able to do that,” he said. “But that was the same desperation that fueled developments like Kansas City Live, and it turned out that the promises were wildly unrealistic.”
Last month, Eddy was notified, along with the other leaders of taxing jurisdictions, that Port KC was considering tax incentives for the Plaza.
Port KC leaders have been confused why, if they had concerns, it took two weeks after seeing the proposal for them to speak up.
But over the years, Eddy has become cynical about whether the developers and Port KC are actually interested in what he and others have to say.
“Port KC does receive public comments,” he said. “But they have a very poor record of responding to them. You basically have to have a sit-down strike in their lobby to get their attention.”
Eddy has raised concerns with Port KC for years about the way it handles tax incentives. Those concerns include whether it’s doing a rigorous enough financial analysis to make sure that developers aren’t embarking on risky projects cushioned by handouts that they don’t need.
“Gosh, there’s a lot that we’re not seeing,” he said. “And if they don’t follow through, isn’t the public at risk? And we won’t know that for 10 years or more. And by then, all these politicians will have served their terms.”

This argument not only ignores the law but also ignores how representation has worked since our nation’s founding.
It’s important that we address the false claim that noncitizens are skewing political representation or that noncitizen voting is influencing the outcome of our elections.
This harmful narrative has been used to justify discriminatory citizenship checks in Indiana’s voter registration laws. These citizenship laws run counter to the purpose of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 meant to protect eligible voters’ participation in our elections and ensure accurate voter registration rolls. These citizenship check requirements are never imposed on individuals born as U.S. citizens, unfairly target naturalized citizens, and risk disenfranchising eligible voters because of reliance on stale data. BMV data regarding individuals who have a temporary credential, a form of identification obtained in the past when individuals were noncitizens, are not an accurate or reliable way to identify Indiana residents who may currently be noncitizens.
Only U.S citizens may vote in state and federal elections and verified instances of noncitizen voting are incredibly rare.
This narrative of unfounded suspicion against noncitizens extends beyond elections to the U.S. Census. The U.S. Constitution clearly mandates a census every 10 years to count and apportion “the whole number of persons in each State.” When public officials imply that noncitizens should not be counted in the Census, they are not only disregarding the Constitution, but also risk harming Indiana and our state’s ability to receive appropriate federal resources if we fail to count all residents.
Census data determines critical federal funding for schools, hospitals, infrastructure, and other resources for ALL our communities. Undercounting our communities means less resources for all Hoosiers. It also undermines trust in one of the country’s most important civic processes, increasing fear and vulnerability among historically marginalized communities that are already undercounted in the census to begin with.
Some leaders are invoking these myths as an excuse to redistrict Indiana before the next census. The rush to redraw maps mid-cycle lacks meaningful community input and threatens to dilute voters’ power for years to come. Voters should decide the outcome of our elections and pick our elected officials, not the other way around. We must prevent this harm before the damage is done. The right to vote should be cherished, and we cannot allow voters’ voices to be silenced in this manner.
Hoosiers do not benefit from narratives built on fear. Indiana’s leaders and communities must reject this attempt to undermine the census and redraw maps mid-cycle, both of which threaten our democracy.
Indiana is stronger when everyone counts and is fairly represented.

Liz Brown, R-Fort Wayne, speaks with reporters on Tuesday, Dec. 9, 2025. (Photo by Tom Davies/Indiana Capital Chronicle)A key state senator and Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita are facing off again over what steps the state should take in cracking down on illegal immigration.
At issue is Senate Bill 76 — authored by Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Liz Brown, R-Fort Wayne, after she blocked a bill with some similar provisions during the last legislative session. That move resulted in Rokita claiming she did so because she has an “illegal alien” in her family. 
Her current proposal includes language allowing state agencies and Rokita’s office to investigate the “employment of an unauthorized alien” and report possible violations to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Indiana Department of Labor.
Rokita, however, is backing a differing proposal in Senate Bill 122, which would give the attorney general’s office authority to seek court orders suspending an “employer’s operating authorizations” over such suspected violations.
Rokita, a Republican, blasted Brown on social media over her bill, saying she had “introduced a watered-down, bizarro world version … that takes all the enforcement teeth out of the bill. That makes her bill meaningless.”
Brown countered that she has worked with entities from the Trump administration to county sheriffs in order to find effective ways to help enforce federal immigration laws.
“The biggest thing is making sure that we didn’t grow government and that the power isn’t centered in one agency or individual,” Brown told reporters.
Hiring practices in question
Erin Tuttle, the attorney general office’s legislative director, criticized Brown’s bill during a Judiciary Committee hearing Tuesday as an “inadequate response” to prevent businesses from hiring people who are in the country illegally.
“The Supreme Court has confirmed that states may sanction the license of employers who knowingly hire unauthorized workers,” Tuttle said. “If Indiana refuses to adopt the one enforcement mechanism available under federal law, it cannot credibly claim to be a leader in combating illegal immigration.”
Carolina Castoreno, co-founder of the Indianapolis-based Alliance for Latino Migrant Advocacy, speaks during a state Senate committee hearing on Tuesday, Dec. 9, 2025. (Photo by Tom Davies/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
Immigrant advocates, however, raised concerns about the impact of the legislation.
Carolina Castoreno, co-founder of the Indianapolis-based Alliance for Latino Migrant Advocacy, told committee members that the proposal encourages racial profiling by businesses.
“It pushes them toward discriminatory hiring practices, meaning someone who fits a certain look or has a certain name or has an accent may be discriminated against, just out of precaution,” Castoreno said. “We know who is harmed, people with brown skin, people with accents, people with names that sound unfamiliar to an HR manager.”
Committee members voted 6-2 along party lines to advance the bill to the full Senate, which could take up the proposal in early January.
Rokita-Brown conflict continues
The dispute between Rokita and Brown over the legislation grows out of their conflict over an immigration-enforcement bill from the legislative session earlier this year.
House members approved House Bill 1531 in February, but Brown did not hold a Senate committee hearing on the bill and it died when the legislative session ended in April.
Rokita then claimed Brown had blocked the legislation because she had a “family member who’s an illegal alien.” 
Brown called that claim “blatantly false.” She also filed an attorney misconduct grievance over Rokita’s comments with the Indiana Supreme Court Disciplinary Commission that she said Tuesday was still pending.
Rokita and U.S. Sen. Jim Banks have repeatedly criticized Brown on social media over last session’s bill.
They also are backing Darren Vogt, who works on Banks’ Senate staff and is a Northwest Allen County Schools board member, in a Republican primary challenge to Brown’s 2026 reelection bid.
Following the committee vote, Rokita posted to X that the bill “would actively shield sanctuary jurisdictions and directly undermines our ongoing lawsuits to end sanctuary policies in Monroe and St. Joseph counties. We need to stop illegal immigration—not protect the counties and officials who defy state law and put Hoosier families last.”

Minnesota utility regulators will meet Thursday to decide by how much and for how long.
In October, Xcel asked the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission for permission to raise gas rates for the average residential customer by about $85 per year while significantly increasing its authorized return on equity — essentially, the profit state regulators allow utilities to earn for their shareholders.
It’s the type of request that often prompts a contested case proceeding, a drawn-out period of haggling between utilities, the commission and other stakeholders. In the interim, Xcel asked to raise the average residential customer’s rates by about $70 per year, subject to a refund if the contested case proceeding ends with the commission approving a lower final rate.
That’s all fairly typical of the horse-trading inherent in the regulatory compact between state regulators and monopoly utilities. Less typical is the alternative, seemingly more customer-friendly “stay-out petition” Xcel filed at the same time. It offers a take-it-or-leave-it rate hike of about $32 per year for the average residential customer and a promise not to ask for another increase until late next year. If the commission accepts the proposal, Xcel would drop its other rate request.
“Recognizing that reasonable minds may differ, our stay-out alternative provides a less costly option for our customers and continues to provide us with a reasonable opportunity to recover our costs,” Xcel spokesperson Kevin Coss said in an email.
Coss added that Xcel customers’ gas bills have increased slower than the overall rate of inflation over the last 12 years and said even its higher rate-hike request would keep bills below the national average.
LIUNA Minnesota and North Dakota, an influential union whose members help build and operate Xcel’s energy infrastructure, said last month that the stay-out petition “deserves the Commission’s consideration” but stopped short of endorsing it outright.
The Minnesota Department of Commerce and Attorney General Keith Ellison beg to differ. In separate filings questioning the petition’s legality and urging the commission to reject it, they accused Xcel of trying to avoid the scrutiny of a contested case proceeding while securing similar financial benefits — including more than $25 million to cover capital investments they said the commission or state Legislature would first need to approve.
The Citizens Utility Board of Minnesota, a ratepayer advocate, noted in its own filing that the stay-out petition is written to allow Xcel to recover even more from ratepayers if its capital expenses end up higher than forecast.
In 2019, the commission approved a stay-out petition for Xcel’s Minnesota electric utility prohibiting recovery of excess capital expenses and requiring Xcel to refund ratepayers if those expenses were lower than expected, the Department of Commerce said.
The Citizens Utility Board also noted that in Xcel’s two most recent contested rate proceedings, the commission ended up approving rate increases significantly smaller than the utility’s original ask, suggesting Xcel could come out ahead if the commission approves the stay-out petition rather than initiating a contested case proceeding.
The stay-out request “isn’t necessarily less than the increase that would result from a full rate case…if the rate case goes forward, the final approved increase will be considerably lower,” Annie Levenson-Falk, executive director of the Citizens Utility Board of Minnesota, said in an email.
Levenson-Falk’s group, the Department of Commerce and the Attorney General’s Office joined the Public Utilities Commission’s own staff in recommending the commission move forward with the rate case.
The three outside groups went further, asking the commission to find that the “exigent circumstances” created by this fall’s federal government shutdown, expiring Affordable Care Act health insurance subsidies and broader economic uncertainty warranted interim rates as much as 50% lower than state law requires.
By law, interim rates “are basically determined by formula” based on how much the utility requests in the first place, Levenson-Falk said.
In a formal response to the Citizens Utility Board and the state agencies, Xcel said it’s fine with a contested case proceeding but “strongly opposes” a reduction in interim rates. If the commission instead approves the stay-out petition, Xcel will provide a detailed accounting of its actual expenses next year, it said in a separate filing.
Xcel’s rate increase requests come as rising natural gas exports, demand from data centers reliant on power from natural gas and expectations for severe winter weather across the northern U.S. and Canada push heating fuel prices higher. But any increase would also support the sorts of gas distribution system investments analysts say are pushing bills up nationwide. Construction spending by natural gas companies has risen nearly 50% this decade, according to the American Gas Association.
Environmental groups like St. Paul-based Fresh Energy warn those investments may prove unnecessary amid a slow but steady shift toward high-efficiency electric heating in new and existing homes. The U.S. Energy Information Administration expects residential natural gas use to peak later this decade and slowly decline through 2050.
“Fresh Energy believes utilities should focus on prudent, targeted safety work and avoid over-investing in new gas infrastructure that could increase long-term customer costs or lock in future emissions,” Caitlin Eichten, the group’s director of building energy transition, said in an email.
Under Minnesota’s 2040 net-zero law, most of the gas burned in homes, factories or power plants at midcentury would need to qualify as renewable natural gas from sources like landfills and agricultural digesters, rather than the geologic deposits that supply the bulk of the gas used today.
Xcel plans — cautiously — to invest in renewable natural gas infrastructure, along with a host of other initiatives to clean up its operations. It’s also pursuing an “electrification first” strategy that Coss said “focuses primarily on evaluating the all-electric options for new buildings when it makes sense for both customers and the system.” Additionally, Xcel offers financial incentives to customers who switch from gas to electric appliances or upgrade their electrical service to enable future fuel-switching.
More than 8,000 customers have taken advantage of those incentives, far exceeding expectations, an Xcel executive told the Public Utilities Commission in October.
Coss said the company’s electrification strategy could limit the amount of infrastructure Xcel needs to build in the future, keeping customer bills in check. But Xcel has not yet joined gas utilities like New York’s Con Edison in actively shrinking its gas distribution system to reduce costs.
“We know many customers will still depend on natural gas in the future, so we will continue to invest in and maintain the gas system and work to reduce emissions from this system,” Coss said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gas-meter-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-12-10 07:56:56.419845

(J Studios/Getty Images)Federal agencies that count jobs, measure incomes, track health information and provide countless other forms of data are under unprecedented strain, according to a new report — compounding years of neglect by Congress and the federal government.
The report, released Wednesday by the American Statistical Association, calls on the federal government to reverse course, bolstering support for the national statistics infrastructure with staff, expertise and resources. It’s part of an ongoing project by the association to monitor the work of federal statistics agencies.


Federal fallout

	
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and
whether to make up the difference.
Read the latest > 


“In combination, we are seeing the system approach a crisis point unless immediate action is taken by Congress and the Executive Branch to reform the current trajectory,” the report states.
It’s a call that state and local officials say matters to them as well.
“It  might make people’s eyes glaze over, but for 235 years, we’ve understood the value of using federal data in particular,” said Zach Brandon, president of the Greater Madison Area Chamber of Commerce. “This has been an underpinning of how this country has been built and the resources we use to understand not only where we’ve been but where we’re headed.”
Federal data informed a 2019 think tank report that found Wisconsin was uniquely poised to become a national hub for biomedical research and development, Brandon said. That conclusion culminated in the state’s selection for a biohealth technology hub under a program included in the 2022 federal CHIPS and Science Act.
He considers accurate data not just a record of the past, but an assist to forecasting the future — “a flashlight that helps you see the challenges and the opportunities before they just become anecdotes.”
Brandon is skeptical that the private sector can provide an adequate substitute. “Even if it could be as robust, we likely couldn’t afford it,” he said.
Resources needed, report finds
The statistical association’s report states that for federal agencies to produce accurate data promptly that can be trusted, they need expert staff and enough resources for now and the future.
Instead, however, federal budgets have shortchanged them for years, it states. The Trump administration is proposing more of the same in its 2026 budget, with cuts to all 13 of the federal statistical agencies, the report warns.
“Immediate action must be taken to halt the severe decline in the federal statistical agencies’ ability to meet their basic mission and be positioned to keep up with increasing information needs and to address uncertainty in the trustworthiness of federal statistics,” the report states.

The 43-day federal shutdown that began Oct. 1 and ended Nov. 12 was an especially dramatic gap in data collection — among other things, for the monthly national and state jobs reports.
“People rely on reliable, consistent and timely data from the federal government when they make decisions,” said Haley McCoy, communications director for the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development, which produces Wisconsin’s reports drawing on surveys conducted by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Whether a business owner is considering opening a new plant or shutting one down, “they need to have the most robust information that they can have to make a solid decision,” McCoy said. “It’s like taking the boat out on the water without looking at the weather forecast.”
That data was missing for the month of September because the shutdown began before the federal report could be completed, and the October data was never collected. DWD will post the state’s September numbers Wednesday — two months behind schedule.
“Those are the last statewide numbers that will come out this year,” McCoy said. “The most recent data we have are three months old.”
The next releases will come in January — November jobs numbers early in the month and December numbers later. But the October numbers are unlikely to be produced or posted ever, she said.
Long funding decline
The statistical association report documents declining fiscal support for federal statistical agencies over the last 15 years — suffering losses of 16% or more in real dollars since 2019, while facing new mandates from Congress.
Most agencies have also lost 20% to 30% of their staff, the report finds — from senior managers with important statistical knowledge to specialized data scientists and experts in methods that ensure greater accuracy.
The report finds that the Trump administration’s actions that have weakened the statistical agencies outweigh actions that would support them.
The administration has left leadership positions vacant, disrupted operations by relocating or attempting to relocate agencies, and eliminated some data collection projects unilaterally without consulting Congress, the public or stakeholders.
That’s coupled with deteriorating safeguards for the integrity of federal data. “In several cases, delays in releasing key data and administration officials’ statements questioning agencies’ neutrality have raised concerns about the protections for credible, objective statistics,” the report states.
Public trust of federal statistics has plummeted, according to the report. A University of Chicago survey found that among U.S. adults, trust in federal statistics fell from 57% in June to 52% in September.
Increased support recommended
The report makes a series of recommendations — for increased staffing, support for innovation, stable and sufficient funding for statistical agencies to fulfill their mission under federal law and systematic management of the agencies and their work, as well as other changes.
It also calls on the administration and Congress to strengthen public trust, including ensuring the data collected for statistical purposes isn’t used for law enforcement or to impose regulations.
At DWD, according to McCoy, there have not yet been concerns about the accuracy or reliability of the federal data it relies on, such as for state job reports.
“We trust how the data is collected,” she said. “It goes through rigorous checks for accuracy.”
But concerns remain about gaps in the data as some collection projects — such as  a report on food security — get turned off, McCoy said.
Steve Pierson, the statistical association’s director of science policy, told the Wisconsin Examiner Tuesday that so far data from the government has continued to be trustworthy.
“We believe that the federal statistics being issued are absolutely still objective and credible,” Pierson said. “What would really help, though, is comments to that effect from the administration.”
Pierson said he believes there are reasons for hope even in the face of grave concerns about the nation’s statistical resources.
Congressional budget writers have rejected the Trump administration’s proposals to cut budgets for the BLS and the National Center for Education Statistics — the latter of which the administration proposed virtually eliminating, he observed.
Key staffers in Congress “hear our concerns, and they share that they’re also concerned,” Pierson said. “That is encouraging.”

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)I found myself greatly disturbed by the despicable act of vandalism to the new monument in downtown Oklahoma City designed to celebrate our city’s historic role in our nation’s sit-in movement.
As photos in The Oklahoman revealed, less than a month after the monument’s unveiling, someone used “a key or a small pocket knife” to scratch nearly every bronze sculpture in Clare Luper National Sit-in Plaza, which commemorates the first peaceful protest of Clara Luper, an Oklahoma City Public Schools teacher, and 13 Black students.
Over the years, I’ve had the privilege of speaking with many of the participants of those sit-ins. I learned first hand from them about the struggles they faced while exercising their right to protest against disparate treatment based solely on race.
I’ve long felt a monument commemorating those peaceful protests was the least we could do so that we never forget that past where we judged people solely by the color of their skin.
After all, for decades, Greensboro, N.C., has been falsely credited as the birthplace of our nation’s first nonviolent sit-in movements. In reality, the first sit-ins that pressed for the desegregation of white-owned businesses began in 1958 in Oklahoma City. Oklahoma City’s sit-ins began nearly two years prior to the Greensboro ones.
It’s one reason why over a half a century later, I was one of a diverse crowd of thousands that attended the dedication of the Sit-in Plaza in downtown Oklahoma City to celebrate the inspiring history of the Katz Drug Store sit-ins. The life-sized sculpture of Luper, the 13 students and a drug store employee, also contains an empty mahogany stool that people can sit on. The artist designed it to encourage people to sit on it and shape a personal connection to the history that helped shape Oklahoma City’s role in the Civil Rights movement.
The nation’s sit-in movement began after Luper and her daughter, Marilyn Luper Hildreth, returned from visiting a more integrated New York where they were allowed to eat with white people. When they returned home to a still segregated Oklahoma City, they unsuccessfully tried to persuade business owners to integrate restaurants.
Luper, a 10-year-old Marilyn and 12 other kids launched a peaceful protest at Katz. Because it was located in a busy part of downtown, with a bus stop out front, Katz was a great site for grabbing public attention.
Even Marilyn, their enthusiastic leader, recognized the danger they were taking on.
The children politely asked the Katz waiters to serve them soft drinks. When their requests were denied, their sit-in continued for three days before the restaurant chain relented. Katz desegregated all 38 of its lunch counters in its five-state region.
Afterward, every Saturday, a growing number of kids would sit-in at different stores and restaurants. In all, Luper was arrested 26 times in connection with her civil rights protests. Their efforts inspired sit-ins across the nation.
Hildreth later said that the hardest thing for her to understand was how to accept that adults would spit on children, call them names and push them solely because of the color of their skin.
A child myself at the time, I remember coming across one of those sit-ins. I’ll never forget my father’s reaction to it.  
Our family had gone to a restaurant that had two rooms. The one in the front was designated for “regular” white people. The second, in the back, was a more expensive room for more affluent whites. The owner said we could eat in the elite room for the same price as the regular room, so we wouldn’t have to sit with “N——” in the front room.  
Deeply offended, my siblings and I repeatedly asked my father why the restaurant owner had used that racial slur.
Our questions kept making our dad, a former boxer, more upset. Finally, our dad blew up, shouting “there’s not a g—d—– reason!” It took multiple cops to pull him off the restaurant owner.  Being a white man, my father was not arrested. 
Years later, I interviewed Luper several times. When she took the time to speak to my high school class, a student asked her about a lesson I had taught which compared and contrasted Booker T. Washington to Malcolm X and the Harlem Renaissance to Martin Luther King Jr. traditions. My students were thrilled when Ms. Luper challenged our lesson. She argued that Booker T. Washington and Malcolm X deserved respect, but not as much as the tradition of nonviolent desegregation that Martin Luther King led.
So, for me, the event commemorating Oklahoma City’s new Sit-in Plaza wasn’t merely about an extremely important historical turning point. 
It was a call and a reminder that we can all fight for a better future.
Mayor David Holt proclaimed that the opening celebrated the love, unity and the incredibly diverse crowd that reflects Oklahoma City. He said it is “a celebration of something really important that happened in our history, but we also make history by making a statement about the city we want to be.”
But the vandalism of the 4-ton bronze sculpture at North Robinson Avenue and West Main Street is unfortunate proof that their work still isn’t done. 
Public response to the vandalism was swift. My favorite was, “The work she (Luper) led is clearly not finished.”
As William Faulkner once said, “The past is never dead. It’s not even past.” 
The Clara Luper National Sit-in Plaza celebrates those who fought to make the future better for us all. But it and the vandalism serves as a reminder to us all that we can’t let our guard down, that Luper’s work isn’t finished, and we must all continue fighting for the just society we need and deserve.

Members of the Michigan Senate on Tuesday passed Senate Bill 213 and Senate Bill 214, sponsored by state Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak) and state Sen. John Damoose (R-Harbor Springs).
McMorrow’s bill would assess the diverse needs of the state by region, including those regions’ challenges with infrastructure, transportation, housing and other amenities needed for economic growth. Development strategies would be hammered out from those region-based assessments.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“We’ve spent years talking with residents, business owners, and economic developers across Michigan, and here’s what we’ve learned: our current approach to economic development just isn’t cutting it,” said McMorrow, chair of the Senate Economic and Community Development Committee, in a statement. “Real economic growth requires vision and measurable metrics. My legislation gets at the heart of what actually makes communities thrive — it sets out a clear, long-term roadmap to make sure every corner of our state has the tools and resources to succeed, not just today, but for generations to come.”
The bills come as lawmakers consider new approaches to Michigan’s economic development strategy, one that isn’t so focused on the Michigan Economic Development Authority to attract businesses and jobs to the state.
Senate Bill 214 would create a Strategic Advisory Board tasked with creating the 10-year plan.

(Getty Images)Indiana lawmakers are weighing a new “bell to bell” proposal that would tighten cellphone restrictions in K-12 schools by requiring Hoosier students to securely store their devices on campus — or leave them at home for the entire school day.
Senate Bill 78 received an hourlong hearing on Tuesday in the Senate Education Committee that was largely dedicated to public testimony. 
Committee Chair Sen. Jeff Raatz, R-Richmond, who authored the bill with Sen. Greg Goode, R-Terre Haute, said possible amendments and a vote to send the bill to the full chamber is expected in early January.
“From a very high level, the (bill requires) cellphones to be left at the entrance of the class,” Raatz said. “I think it’s pretty onerous on a teacher to pay attention and make sure they’re doing the best job they can to educate kids — and have to get after (students) on cellphones.”
A similar, nearly identical measure was also filed by Republican Rep. Jake Teshka for consideration in the 2026 session. It’s not yet clear what action the opposing chamber might take on his House Bill 1034.
Left at home — or ‘locked up’
Indiana already enacted a statewide cellphone restriction law in 2024, which prohibits students from using phones, tablets, laptops and gaming devices during instructional time, with exemptions for education, emergencies, health-care needs or disability-related accommodations. 
But that law does not dictate how schools must enforce the bans, nor does it restrict phones during lunch or passing periods.

“We ran into a few instances out in the districts where it’s being applied differently than the intention,” Raatz said. “We felt like it’d be wise to come together and tighten it up so that we can see results … increasing success in educational outcomes is what we’re really after.”
Under Senate Bill 78, school corporations and charter schools would be required to adopt a wireless communication device ban that prohibits students from using or possessing a wireless communication device during the school day and requires that any teacher-directed use of a device “for educational purposes” occur only on school-supplied devices.
It also mandates that each district choose between two enforcement models: a “no device policy,” in which students may not bring phones to school at all; or a “secure storage policy,” in which students may bring phones but must store them so they are “inaccessible throughout the school day” and returned only after dismissal.
The bill also expands the definition of “wireless communication device” to include smartwatches connected to a phone, cell tower or the Internet.
Exceptions are carved out for students with disabilities under an Individualized Education Program or Section 504 plan; students managing a documented medical condition; emergencies where the superintendent or a designee authorizes access; and cases where language-translation tools are needed for multi-lingual learners, with preference for school-managed devices.
Raatz said during the hearing that the emergency exemptions were designed to let school officials manage communication during critical incidents. 
“Someone has to be an adult in the room to set up so kids can communicate with their parents, should there be an incident,” he said. 
“There are instances where kids probably don’t need their cellphone and (should) let the adults handle the situation,” Raatz added. He said that once a situation is “locked down,” school officials can then communicate with students’ parents.
Indiana is weighing the policy amid a national shift. 
Late last year, the U.S. Department of Education publicly called on every state, school and district to adopt strong cellphone-use policies, citing academic, behavioral and mental-health concerns. Federal officials urged “away-for-the-day” models and pointed to increasing research showing reduced classroom distraction and improved peer interaction when phones are inaccessible.
While the Hoosier State’s 2024 law placed it among the early adopters, Raatz’ latest measure would make Indiana’s law one of the more stringent.
How enforcement would work
Districts selecting a “secure storage” model could choose their own methods. 
Some Indiana schools already use locked pouches — like the Yondr Pouch — that students seal at the start of the day and unlock when leaving the building.
That process typically requires students to turn off or place their phone on airplane mode, secure it in the pouch under staff supervision, store it in a backpack or locker during the day, and unlock it at dismissal.
Multiple parents and advocacy groups testified in support.










We need to take the phones out of the hands of young people, at least for the hours during school, and help them recapture their ability to be attentive and form more meaningful relationships.


– LaToya Hale-Tahirou, a Hoosier mom of three


“We moved away from in-person connection and turned our attention to a screen,” said LaToya Hale-Tahirou, a Hoosier mom of three. “We need to take the phones out of the hands of young people, at least for the hours during school, and help them recapture their ability to be attentive and form more meaningful relationships.”
Evan Eagleson, a legislative director with ExcelinEd in Action, said rapid smartphone adoption has outpaced school policy, causing major consequences for student well-being and learning.
“We’ve all seen the rise of smartphone usage and have experienced how distracting they can be for ourselves,” Eagleson told lawmakers. “Most students spend seven to nine hours a day on their phones, which we know has very real implications, both inside the classroom and outside the classroom.”
An initial nonpartisan fiscal analysis estimates only minor administrative work for schools that must update their policies. Districts implementing secure-storage systems could see additional costs, however, if they provide pouches or other locking devices, with estimated prices ranging from $15 to $30 per device.
Ahead of Tuesday’s hearing, education advocacy organization Stand for Children Indiana released new survey data indicating broad support for stronger smartphone limits.
School cellphone bans spread across states, though enforcement could be tricky

In an internal survey of 138 supporters and advocates, more than 60% favored an “away for the day” policy. Nearly 23% preferred Indiana’s current policy that allows phone use outside class time, and 17% said they needed more information.
The group additionally pointed to a separate poll conducted in October of Indianapolis residents, which found 69% of respondents support a “bell-to-bell” policy in which phones remain secured until the end of the school day. Backing was consistent across political affiliations, with Democrats, Republicans and Independents each showing support above 63%.
Kristin Casper, government affairs director for Stand for Children Indiana, testified in favor of Senate Bill 78 on Tuesday. 
“We now know consistent device usage harms attention, mental health and socialization,” she told the committee. “Physical distance from your phone creates a psychological distance from temptation.”
Casper pointed to Fort Wayne schools as proof that strict “bell-to-bell” phone policies lead to fewer behavioral issues and better grades. After implementing stricter policies, the district’s middle school behavior violations dropped by 11%, cellphone infractions fell by 64%, and average high school GPA increased by 0.18 points.
Potential bill changes to come
Questions from the committee mostly focused on medical exemptions and enforcement logistics. 
Raatz said schools would manage implementation locally, particularly for students using devices to monitor conditions like diabetes. 
“It would be pretty easy to monitor that,” he said, noting modern technology allows parents to track blood sugar without constant phone access.
Other senators raised concerns about policy flexibility for extracurricular activities. 
Justin Swanson, representing the Indiana Urban Schools Association, suggested providing civil immunity for school corporations and potential funding assistance. 
“If they are taking cellphones from students, that would just be helpful with some of the heartaches that may come with it,” he said.

Fishers resident Connor Haynes, of Smartphone Free Childhood U.S., additionally urged the committee to extend the ban to headphones and earbuds as well, citing research showing that even the mere presence of phones reduces cognitive capacity.
Susan Harris, a nurse practitioner representing Indiana’s Coalition of Advanced Practice Nurses, also endorsed the bill, citing cellphone use’s impact on youth health, but asked for a small amendment to ensure student medical needs are accommodated.
Raatz maintained that the bill seeks to create uniform policies statewide without micromanaging schools.
But he said the bill is likely to be amended to broaden the list of licensed medical professionals — beyond just physicians — who can allow exemptions for students with valid medical needs.
“We’ve had that conversation … to try and broaden it out, just a tad, but not go too far,” Raatz said.
Still, he said that schools will retain authority to set up the process for medical exemptions, rather than detailing it fully in legislation. 
“I don’t think we want to get that granular in this legislation to say a student’s going have to go through a doctor with a slip, or through the parent, or a phone call from the doctor to the principal or superintendent … to tell them that they have this exemption,” Raatz said. “It’ll have to be monitored in the classroom more closely for students that fall in that category.”

(Wisconsin Examiner photo)A Wisconsin Senate Committee held a public hearing Tuesday on a bill that would allow private companies to construct small solar projects on underutilized farmland and commercial rooftops across the state. 
The bill, which would encroach on the monopoly the state’s existing utility companies are allowed to maintain under state law, is being considered while people across the country worry about rising energy costs amid a boom in the construction of data centers and the increased use of electric vehicles and appliances. 
Environmental groups in the state have also regularly complained that the utility companies aren’t constructing enough renewable energy projects or sunsetting existing coal and natural gas power plants quickly enough. 
The bill, authored by Sen. Patrick Testin (R-Stevens Point) and Rep. Scott Krug (R-Nekoosa), would allow people in Wisconsin to subscribe to get some of their power from a local “community solar” installation. The subscribers would receive credits they can put toward their utility bill. Because the power developed at the local solar installation will still need to travel through the utility company’s infrastructure, the bill includes a provision that all subscribers to the program would have to pay at least $20 per month on their electric bill. 
In the hearing of the Senate Committee on Transportation and Local Government, the bill’s authors said allowing community solar projects would increase people’s energy choices while allowing the expansion of solar power in the state that avoids the objections from local residents that often come with large, utility-scale solar projects. 
“This change will open a new market sector in a high energy industry, attract economic investments in Wisconsin, create local jobs, drive innovation and competition, and ultimately save consumers and small businesses money on their energy bills,” Testin said. 
But the authors also acknowledged there is still a lot of disagreement over the details and the bill is not yet in its final form. 
“We’re not exactly there yet. We’re not all agreeing on this being the best way forward just yet, but this public hearing is a really important step to vet that out a little bit more to get us closer to that answer,” Krug said. “So yes, there are still some kinks to work out between the utilities and individuals who want a more market-based approach to solar. I hope we can work through those issues here.”
Over the hearing’s three and a half hours, the testimony split among two groups — the utility companies who are opposed to the bill and a coalition of solar companies, economists, farmers and employers who are in favor. 
The utility companies accused the bill of creating a “shell game” that would lower the costs for the subscribers of a given project while raising electric bills for everyone else. Zack Hill, testifying on behalf of Alliant Energy, said the utility estimated that community solar would result in an additional $8.75 billion in costs for ratepayers over the next 25 years. 
“How does [the bill] pay for subscribers 10 to 20% energy savings? The short answer: It will shift costs to your other constituents,” Hill said. “Some have said this sounds like community solar voodoo economics, but all you have to remember is this, when a company promises you a discount, someone else has to pay for it.”
People in favor of the bill argued that the generation of more energy could only help lower energy costs while disputing the utility companies’ claims. Will Flanders, the research director at the conservative Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty, also said the utilities’ estimates undervalue the benefits that community solar can add. 
“This is a model that expands energy choice without large subsidies, without mandates, without turning more power over to monopoly utilities,” Flanders said. “In fact, it introduces competition at a time when Wisconsin needs it the most.” 
“We argue that community solar can deliver net savings to the entire system,” he continued. “When we talk about a shell game, what we’re really saying is there’s no real additional resources being put into the system, but obviously there is additional resources being put in when we have these with these programs in place.” 
Karl Rabago, a Denver-based energy consultant who testified with Flanders, said that the Alliant $8.75 billion estimate amounted to a threat that if the utilities don’t get to sell the energy, they’ll charge consumers for that loss. 
“No one knows where this number comes from, but having seen how utilities make their case in other states, I am 99.9% confident they are basically saying, ‘If we don’t get to make the electricity and sell it, we could potentially lose $8.75 billion and and if we don’t make that money, we’re going to charge you for it anyway,’ and that’s how customer costs could go up,” Rabago said. “That’s the most likely explanation for a histrionic number. The utility position, to summarize, seems to sound a bit like ‘let us do it all and no one gets hurt.’ We’ve heard those kinds of exhortations. Monopolies do it particularly well.” 
Toward the end of the hearing, a number of Wisconsin property owners testified, touting the benefits they’ll receive if they’re able to allow solar projects to be constructed on their land. 
Duane Hinchley, a Cambridge dairy farmer, said community solar is an “innovative solution” that can give farmers a stable income to hedge against the risks in the agriculture business. Plus, he said, allowing farmers to participate will prevent land that has been farmed for generations from being developed into subdivisions. 
“With the right policies in place, our state’s proud agricultural heritage can be a cornerstone of Wisconsin’s clean energy future,” Hinchley said. 
But throughout the day, lawmakers from both parties appeared skeptical of the bill’s benefits. 
Sen. Van Wanggaard (R-Racine) said repeatedly he didn’t understand how the program would work for the utility companies. 
“It sounds like a shell game to me,” he said. “I just, I’m really having a challenge with trying to figure out how that would work, because it would seem to me that the energy company, the regulated company, is the one that’s going to be footing the bill for this.” 
Sen. Mark Spreitzer (D-Beloit) questioned how the program wouldn’t eventually raise energy costs for non-participants, but said one selling point for the bill was that it would encourage the increased development of renewable energy. 
“I heard you say this is going to force more solar to be built, whether or not you need it,” Spreitzer said to a utility company representative. “And I guess that, to me, is the one selling point of the bill. Is that I look at where we’ve been in the landscape lately, where we have, unfortunately, federal incentives for solar that are going away. We have increasing demand for power from data centers. We’re seeing new natural gas plants get built. We’re seeing coal plants not being retired, when we hoped they would. To me, there’s plenty of need for solar.” 
If the utility companies won’t support a community solar proposal, Spreitzer wondered, what do they need from the Legislature to encourage more solar development? 
“And so if we’re not going to go down this route, what are the incentives that you all need to make sure that we can continue to drive solar development without increasing rates for customers and without saying, ‘let’s go build a natural gas plant instead?” he asked. 
Anti-rights of nature bill 
Also on Tuesday, the committee heard testimony on a bill from Sen. Steve Nass (R-Whitewater) that would prohibit local governments in Wisconsin from enacting “rights of nature” ordinances, which grant natural elements legal rights that can be protected in court. 
Nass said in his testimony that the idea is anti-American and is contrary to the values of the U.S. Constitution.
“This is a radical departure from our current law. Rights are something that human beings have,” Nass said. “This concept of granting nature rights is something that has been done primarily in foreign countries … and many of these countries lean dramatically towards socialism and communism, and their attitude is not compatible with private property rights in our country.”
But proponents of rights of nature resolutions frequently point to the fact that corporations are granted rights under U.S. law. Communities including Green Bay and Milwaukee have passed or begun drafting rights of nature ordinances and some Democratic lawmakers have introduced a bill that would grant Devil’s Lake State Park some rights that can be protected in court. 
In a statement after the hearing, Rep. Vincent Miresse (D-Stevens Point), one of the co-authors of the Democratic proposal, wrote, “As we heard from advocates today, Rights of Nature is one of the strongest tools local governments have to protect clean air, clean water and healthy soil for future generations — so that our grandchildren, and their children after them, can drink our waters, eat food grown in our soils, and hunt in our forests.”

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)I am an American and a member of the Minnesota Somali community.
President Donald Trump called me and my 221,000 fellow Somali Americans “garbage.” The secretary of defense, who is Minnesota born, eagerly and immediately endorsed the “garbage” remark and Trump’s conclusion that we are unwanted in this country and should be sent away.
The secretary of state, the vice president and the rest of the cabinet cheered and banged on the table and applauded this hateful and profoundly ignorant assault on my community.
Profoundly ignorant and profoundly ironic — because the Somali community I know is everything that conservatives and Republicans claim to want in America.
We are people of deep and unwavering faith. We pray five times a day, no matter where we are, no matter who’s looking.
We are generous people who give freely and without hesitation to our neighbors, regardless of where they’re from or who they vote for.
We are so damn funny. We love so deeply. We proudly live our values. We do not cower.
We are as American as apple pie and as Minnesotan as ranch dressing, and we have invested in our communities, our state and our nation.
We are among the doctors and nurses who led our state through the COVID-19 pandemic.
We are among the small business owners who make our communities great places to live and make a living.
We are among the students preparing to help Minnesota thrive for another generation.
Yet despite all that, just ask any Somali person in your life if the president’s hateful attacks came as a shock to them, and they’ll tell you “no.”
This year, right-wing influencers and YouTubers showed up in our communities to make videos about “Little Mogadishu.” These videos, meant only to dehumanize us and incite violence and hatred against us, pulled millions of views. Right-wing trolls spread bizarre, disgusting conspiracies about our genetics and our IQ levels.
They questioned U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar’s loyalty to America and called for her to be denaturalized and deported. They came up with one wildly racist and false smear campaign after another against Senator Omar Fateh—demonizing him, darkening his image, and weaponizing similar rhetoric we are seeing today.
Hateful, Proud Boy-esque vandalism has spread across our communities, calling for us to be deported and leaving threats on Somali candidates’ campaign offices.
And that’s just this year.
So no, it is not surprising that our president — needing a distraction from rising prices, broken campaign promises and a crumbling coalition — hopped on the bandwagon to scapegoat our community. It is sad that the president is choosing racism and fearmongering rather than simply doing the job he was elected to do, but sadder still that, given the state of our society and country, this is what the vast majority of us expected. 
Trump will always be on the lookout for the next fearmongering sideshow to distract and divide us from the harm that his administration is inflicting. But he will learn a hard lesson about the communities he perceives to be weak. The Minnesota Somali community, like others he has chosen to bully and attack, is full of tough leaders who have been facing scary, hateful people for their whole careers and probably still will be, long after Trump has once again faded into memory.
Unfortunately, in the immediate term, the full weight of the federal government is barreling down on my community. Families are being separated. People are making contingency plans in anticipation of the unthinkable and unacceptable. I would never wish upon anyone to have to tell their parents, who have been citizens for nearly 30 years, what documents to carry, how to move, what to be ready for, in the very country they call home. But that is my reality now. That is our reality now.
So please continue telling the stories of the impact the Somali American community has had on you and your loved ones; support our businesses; donate to the boots-on-the-ground organizations that are helping the community. If you do nothing else, please shut down this dehumanizing rhetoric everywhere you hear it — from family, friends, strangers on social media, anywhere you see it. It is on all of us to do our part in stopping this cycle of dehumanization of immigrant communities.
To my Somali brothers and sisters. “Iskaashato Ma Kufto.” If we lean on each other, we won’t fall. We did not survive civil war, famine and exile just to be intimidated into silence. We have left behind and buried too many, rebuilt too often, and prayed too many times through the darkest hours, to let this break us.
Minnesota is our home. America is our home. And our community will not be pushed out.

Developers of the project at Seminoe Reservoir want seasonal wildlife restrictions lifted for construction. Opponents say protections are necessary for bighorn sheep, in particular.
The post Seminoe ‘pumped water storage’ project draws concern over threats to fisheries, wildlife in central Wyoming appeared first on WyoFile .","Anglers, hunters and wildlife activists are organizing against a proposed pumped-water-storage hydroelectric project at Seminoe Reservoir in Carbon County. They object to the developer’s request to be exempted from seasonal wildlife restrictions during the project’s three-to-five year construction.
Officials in Carbon and Natrona counties have also added to a chorus of concern that the massive $3 billion to $5 billion construction project threatens wildlife and recreational opportunities that support the local economies, including world-famous fisheries, important elk, mule deer habitat and sage grouse, as well as a vital bighorn sheep herd.
“I’m all for energy development. I just think this is a really poor project that puts so many things at risk,” said Blake Jackson, a fishing guide and co-owner of Casper’s Ugly Bug Fly Shop. 
Jackson helps organize the Friends of the North Platte group, which was formed to oppose the project.
“They’re asking for all of those [seasonal wildlife stipulations] to be waived and we’re basically saying, ‘No,'” Jackson added. “Those are there for a good reason, and different people shouldn’t have to play by different rules. You need to make this safe before it’s considered a viable project.”

For its part, rPlus Hydro and its subsidiary Black Canyon Hydro say the facility will generate millions in local tax revenue and help “balance” intermittent renewable energy to provide more reliable power delivery on the grid. They propose building a 10,000-acre-foot reservoir in the Bennett Mountains overlooking Seminoe Reservoir near the dam — one of several large reservoirs on the North Platte River.
Hydroelectric offset, county concerns
“Pumped water storage” involves pumping water uphill during daytime “off-peak demand” hours when wind and solar power are plentiful and wholesale electricity is cheapest. The water is released to generate hydroelectricity during higher-demand hours in the evening.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC, is accepting comments on its draft environmental impact statement for the project through Jan. 2. Aspects of the project, according to some observers, may also undergo review and permitting by the Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Reclamation and, potentially, some state agencies.
The Natrona County Board of Commissioners recently joined its counterparts in Carbon County in asking FERC to modify or deny the developer’s plan as proposed.
“This project will have a substantial impact on the health, safety, welfare, custom, culture and socio-economic viability of not just Carbon County, but also Natrona County,” Commission Chair Dave North wrote in a Dec. 2 letter to FERC. “Hunting and fishing is a very important industry in the State of Wyoming and it is important to consider the impact this project will have on this industry.”
This graphic depicts a pumped water storage system. (rPlus Hydro)
Though elected officials in Wyoming are familiar with federal permitting processes, they rarely work with FERC, said Carbon County Board of Commissioners Vice Chair Sue Jones. She worries the agency might “fast-track” the approval process, which she believes would require an amendment to the Bureau of Land Management’s Rawlins Resource Management Plan.
“We see $7 [million] to $9 million annually just from fishing at Seminoe,” Jones told WyoFile. “I have not encountered one person who has told me they’re for this. It’s an incredibly huge project with some serious environmental implications.”
 rPlus Hydro and Black Canyon Hydro did not respond to WyoFile’s inquiries before press time.
Game and fish officials push back
Though it is still formulating its feedback to FERC regarding the draft environmental impact statement, the Wyoming Game and Fish Department, in earlier comments to the federal agency, has opposed the developer’s request for a long list of seasonal wildlife restriction variances.

“We have recommended adherence to our timing stipulations [particularly for big game species], and they [rPlus Hydro] have been asking, for two years, for a variance,” Game and Fish Habitat Protection Program Supervisor Will Schultz told WyoFile. 
“Something of that magnitude — [construction] for five years or greater — a blanket [variance] for the entire winter, that is not something that we support,” Schultz continued. “Especially given the importance of this particular bighorn sheep herd. But it would also apply to where there is overlap with crucial mule deer range.”
The construction project, according to federal documents, includes blasting and a lot of hauling of dirt and rubble, which concerns Wyoming Wild Sheep Foundation Executive Director Katie Cheesbrough.
“All of that is happening within crucial bighorn sheep habitat — their winter-range habitat,” Cheesbrough told WyoFile. “This is at a time during the winter when these sheep are conserving energy, and they’re in kind of a vulnerable position.
This map depicts a proposed pumped water storage energy project at Seminoe Reservoir. (rPlus Hydro)
“Bighorn sheep are susceptible to respiratory diseases,” she added. “If the air quality is also bad, that doesn’t help.”
The Ferris-Seminoe bighorn sheep are the only herd in the state that has not tested positive for the respiratory pathogen mycoplasma ovipneumoniae, according to Cheesbrough, which is why the state has relied on the herd to supplement other bighorn sheep populations.
“So it’s really important that we protect this herd, because it’s the only viable source herd in the state,” she said.
Even when construction is complete, the continual transfer of water through the hydroelectric system threatens to increase turbidity and water temperatures — a significant threat to fish, particularly trout, said Jackson, the fishing guide.
“We’re often near dangerous water temperature levels currently,” Jackson said, noting that trout are a cold-water species. “Then you also add sediment to the water, and the water warms up faster. It becomes a really big issue.”
On its website, rPlus Hydro committed “to developing the project responsibly, including minimizing and mitigating impacts,” and acknowledged “the project is subject to stringent permitting and licensing requirements under the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.”Go to this FERC website to review and comment on the draft environmental impact statement for the project.

Is columnist Rod Miller's mythical tax-free town out in the Red Desert utopian or dystopian? You decide. 
The post Livin’ free in New Lexington, Wyoming appeared first on WyoFile .","Ours is a quaint little settlement in the Red Desert. Wamsutter is the nearest big city, a good day’s ride horseback away. On a bad day, you just can’t get there. We don’t have any passable roads, but we are free.

Opinion

We named our enclave after that other Lexington in an eastern state that has since turned Marxist. Those other Lexingtonians fought to be free of one oppressive government, but then turned around and submitted to another one. Here in New Lexington, we avoid government like a screw worm epidemic because we are free.
Of all the unalienable rights, we cherish liberty above life and the pursuit of happiness. That’s why people sometimes die here, and folks are grumpy. But we’re willing to put up with all of that so that nobody can tax us or tell us what to do
The surviving kids in New Lexington are taught at home by Mom and Dad, not in some godless, Bolshevik government school. They are homeschooled in important life skills like how to make homespun clothes, to shoe horses and to make fire by rubbing sticks together. That’s all the education they need to join us in the Ivermectin mine.
Lots of other places are worried about voter fraud and are turning to government for help. Here in New Lexington, we don’t have that problem because we don’t have elections. Elections just lead to more government and, like I said, screw worms.
No government means no taxes, and we consider taxes to be a cussword. It is an East Coast, deep-state lie that taxes are necessary for survival. Here in New Lexington, we don’t pay ‘em and we get along just fine. Our motto is “Taxation is Theft.”
We don’t pay paper-shufflin’ parasitic bureaucrats in a fancy courthouse to protect our property rights by recording meaningless deeds and titles. Who needs that nonsense when we have guns and the Ten Commandments? That’s why we don’t have police or a sheriff either. Think about it!

Columnist Rod Miller.(Mike Vanata)

If someone wants to violate the Ten Commandments and steal somebody else’s house, they’ll have to contend with an armed homeowner who has other ideas. What if the thief has a bigger gun and can pull off the heist? Well, that’s just a natural law and we respect the laws of nature. Natural laws don’t lead to taxes.
Planning and zoning Trotskyites? Maoist property taxers? Screw ‘em! We live in New Lexington, and we build our houses where we goddam well please. Because … guns.
Since we don’t tax ourselves or issue bonds for infrastructure, we pitch in and do the work ourselves. Take our water system, for instance. We all got together and dug a community well in a dry playa. When we finally hit water, it tasted of alkali, so we distill it with cheatgrass and antelope turds and make New Lexington whiskey. You can hardly taste the alkali, and it doubles as a natural laxative. We sell it to the tourists in Wamsutter for a little bit of hard currency, tax-free, of course.
Chemtrails are no problem here, since we didn’t tax ourselves to build an airport. We don’t want to reach into our own pockets to make it easy for globalist elites to spray us with toxic goo that makes people gay. Call us backward if you want, but we are free.
Healthcare? We don’t have to shell out good money for an expensive hospital in New Lexington. If someone comes down with Smallpox, Ebola, COVID or other cooties, we treat ‘em at home with sheep dip elixir, gutpile poultices or whiskey. We don’t want to subsidize snowflake doctors’ condos with our hard-earned tax dollars.
Weaker folks in other parts of the country tend to overestimate the costs of the blessings of liberty. But our ancestors didn’t fight and die face down in the mud so that we would have to tax ourselves to pay for the things we want.
Maybe over-educated university eggheads in the big city want to call life in New Lexington, Wyoming solitary, nasty, brutish and short. If so, let ‘em. At least we are free.

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)Dozens of people filled a room in Milwaukee’s courthouse complex Tuesday morning, listening as representatives from the sheriff’s office pushed for adopting facial recognition technology and answered questions about the Flock camera system. The Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Office hopes to equip its booking room cameras with facial recognition software from the company Biometrica, a move that was not well received by some county residents.
For over an hour, Chief Deputy Brian Barkow and other sheriff’s office staff attempted to quell residents’ fears. During the Tuesday meeting of the Committee on Judiciary, Law Enforcement and General Services, board members listened to a lengthy presentation from the sheriff’s office differentiating various camera systems, and highlighting aspects of a proposed policy governing facial recognition technology. 
The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
In June, the county board unanimously voted to call on the sheriff’s office  to work with community members to create such a policy. Residents had increasingly expressed concern after the Milwaukee Police Department signaled that it was exploring an agreement with Biomentrica to provide 2.5 million images, booking records and other information in exchange for access to facial recognition software. As concerns mounted about  the police department contract, the public learned that the county sheriff’s office  was also exploring a similar agreement with Biometrica. 
During the Tuesday committee meeting, Barkow ran through the various camera systems the sheriff’s office uses. From Genetec, a video management platform that can detect motion and loitering, to general purpose security cameras used from the zoo to the courthouse, cameras installed in police vehicles, camera trailers, body cameras, and AI-powered Flock cameras used to identify vehicle license plates. 
A sprawling network of Flock cameras has been erected by over 5,000 law enforcement agencies nationwide, including at least 221 in Wisconsin. The cameras perpetually photograph and identify vehicles using license plates, storing that data for a period of time and allowing law enforcement to search Flock’s network for that data. The cameras can be set up to notify officers of when specific vehicles are spotted, sending more notifications as they pass Flock cameras installed in one neighborhood or another.
Barkow and Sheriff Denita Ball said that saying that this practice amounts to “tracking” is a misrepresentation. “When you say ‘tracking’,” Barkow told the Wisconsin Examiner, “most people think of I’m like, live tracking you. And so an alert occurs, right, but it occurs after that vehicle has already been someplace.” Ball underscored the point. “What it says is the car is here at this time,” said Ball. “Now because it has alerted the police officer, the deputy sheriff, what they’re going to do now is follow that car.” Barkow added in such situations a deputy could “respond to that area to attempt to locate the vehicle.” It may then pass in front of another Flock camera at some point, or it may not, Barkow added. 
None of these systems use facial recognition software, Barkow and other sheriff’s office  staff said. Rather, the sheriff’s office sees its booking room cameras — used to photograph people during the intake process at the jail — as good candidates for Biometrica’s software. A PowerPoint presentation produced by the sheriff’s office states that these cameras can capture high-quality images of scars, marks, tattoos, and other distinctive characteristics.

The presentation states that the sheriff’s office  is evaluating how facial recognition could be used to compare booking images against law enforcement databases. No biometric information or data would be accessed, stored, or transmitted, the PowerPoint stated, and all searches would be both private and logged, nor would the data be sold to third parties. 
Facial recognition software could be used to identify people linked to active investigations, missing persons, witnesses, victims, mitigating “imminent threats” like terrorism and violence, and assisting forensic processes. Sheriff’s office staff would be prohibited from using it for mass surveillance or indiscriminate tracking, automated real-time identification without human oversight, targeting people based on race, gender, religion, or other protected traits, or relying on facial recognition as the sole reason for an arrest or for pursuing a search warrant. 
Committee members peppered Barkow and company with a variety of questions. They raised concerns about the adoption of surveillance technologies in the current political climate, particularly when it comes to actions by the Trump administration. There were questions about whether agencies like immigration enforcement could access the accumulated data of Flock or facial recognition cameras, and who exactly in the sheriff’s  chain of command would be making decisions about how the technology is used and who accesses it. Some expressed concerns that facial recognition has been shown to have higher failure rates for non-white faces. Sheriff’s office staff  and representatives from Biometrica countered that although early models of the technology did have those issues, advancements have all but eliminated those concerns, though no specific improved detection rates were provided.

Sup. Justin Bielinski, who chairs the committee, set a strict two-minute limit on speaking time because of the large volume of people waiting to comment
Calling Sheriff Ball a “liar” who had failed to respond to community concerns about the jail, Ron Jansen, the first member of the public to speak, said, “this department cannot be given additional power, period.” Jansen said that sheriff’s office  staff could run screenshots through facial recognition software applications, or request other law enforcement agencies to do it for them. Jansen pushed back against the sheriff’s claims that running a photo through facial recognition technology is similar to putting a picture out in the news. “Great!” Said Jansen. “I would encourage them not to waste our money on [facial recognition] technology and instead to continue running photos in the news, and asking for public support. It’s cheaper and probably a lot more effective.” 
One person after another  expressed doubts about the Milwaukee sheriff’s  push to adopt facial recognition technology, and also questioned the use of Flock cameras. Several referred to a recent scandal involving the Greenfield police chief, who is facing felony charges after having a department-owned pole camera installed at his home to monitor his wife during a messy divorce. Others compared the capabilities of Flock and facial recognition technology to World War II-era European countries where secret police photographed and identified targeted individuals. 
Many, including members of the committee, echoed fears about federal agencies accessing the data collected by the Milwaukee sheriff’s tools. “I haven’t heard one community member today say that they support this,” said Angela Lang, executive director of Black Leaders Organizing Communities (BLOC). “All of the folks that we have been talking to in the community say if we actually want to get to the root causes of crime, we invest in things like mental health and health care and affordable housing.”

More than 60% of Idaho is federal public land. (Clark Corbin/Idaho Capital Sun)Idaho U.S. Rep. Russ Fulcher said he is convening meetings statewide to explore transferring management and ownership of the Gem State’s vast federal public lands to state and local governments. 
The Republican congressman on Monday sent a letter to Idaho statewide elected officials, legislators, and county commissioners, calling the eventual shift to local control of the land “imminent.” 
U.S. Rep. Russ Fulcher, R-Idaho, speaks with Republican supporters at the Idaho GOP election night watch party at the Grove Hotel in Boise, Idaho, on Nov. 8, 2022. (Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)
“If this issue is left unaddressed, we will have a real problem on our hands that will likely put unsustainable pressure on local property taxes,” Fulcher wrote. 
Nearly two-thirds of Idaho’s landmass is federally owned and managed. Fulcher wrote that the “extensive federal government footprint in our state poses significant challenges to our autonomy in issuing leases for timber, grazing, and mining.” 
He also pointed to a lack of support from non-Western states for congressional funding of programs for local governments to offset the lost property tax revenue of federal lands, such as Payments in Lieu of Taxes, PILT, or Secure Rural Schools, SRS. 
Fulcher said he recognized the value of lands being publicly accessible, but said the federal government hadn’t been properly managing them. 
A Conservation Voters of Idaho poll conducted in July found 96% of Idaho registered voters believe public lands should remain in public hands. 
 Concerns that transfer of Idaho public lands would take them out of the public’s hands  

Those who oppose a transfer of ownership of federal lands question if access would remain open to the public. 
“Over the history of the state of Idaho, about a third of Idaho’s state endowment lands have been sold off,” said John Robison, Idaho Conservation League public lands and wildlife director. 
Robison underscored the recent sale of state lands near the Teton mountains in eastern Idaho, which had been leased for grazing by a local rancher through 2032, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported.    
 State endowment land is typically publicly accessible but is required to be used to generate the most revenue possible for its beneficiaries, which include public schools. 
Fellow Idaho Republican Congressman Mike Simpson couldn’t be reached for comment on this story, but told the Idaho Press in May that a past analysis on the cost for the state to manage all of its federal lands found it wasn’t very feasible. 
“The Legislature looked at that at that time and said, ‘Wow, we can’t afford that,’” Simpson said. “It would come at a huge cost to the state of Idaho.”
Simpson co-sponsored bipartisan legislation that would prohibit large parcels of federal land from sales or transfers, with some narrow exemptions. 
Simpson’s bill was introduced amid a proposal led by U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, to sell thousands of acres of public federal lands. Fulcher voted in favor of the amendment to approve the sale. 
 Conservationists, Fulcher agree federal land management needs improvement 

Robison agreed with Fulcher’s assertion that federal land managers have not done enough to reduce wildfire risk. 
“Last year, federal land mismanagement was a major factor in nearly one million acres of our beautiful Idaho going up in flames, a level of devastation that puts significant financial strain on our local economies,” Fulcher wrote. 
Idaho recently signed a new agreement with the U.S. Forest Service to partner with the federal agency to ramp up management and targeted logging activity in Idaho national forests. 
Robison agreed there was more to be done to mitigate wildfire risk in Idaho’s forests. 
“It is true that agencies that manage American public lands on our behalf are on a starvation diet,” Robison said. “They are underfunded, they are understaffed, and our public lands are suffering as a result. Notably, it is Congress that holds the power of the purse to properly fund these agencies. “
Gov. Brad Little has in the past bemoaned federal management of public lands, but said recently he is more satisfied with what’s being done under the current presidential administration. 
Little’s office could not be reached for comment.

Sign up for Chalkbeat Detroit’s free newsletter to keep up with the city’s public school system and Michigan education policy.
As four students seeking asylum in the U.S. remained in federal immigration custody Tuesday night, dozens of community members asked Detroit school officials to do more to protect newcomers.
All four of the students went to Western International High School in Southwest Detroit.
Before public comment began at the Detroit Public Schools Community District board meeting, Superintendent Nikolai Vitti said the district and the board would release a statement calling for the students’ release.
“These continue to be troubling times for the district and our immigrant population,” Vitti said. “We do advocate for our federal government to find better uses of its time and resources to attack the real problems in our society and not immigrant populations.”
Vitti said the district will continue to work with advocacy groups to support the students and will distribute information to students about their rights.
He said immigration officials have not attempted to enter district property.
Many at the meeting said the letter wasn’t enough. They want the district to take a harder stance against immigration enforcement. Among their demands were mandatory staff training, safer transportation, and counseling for students with immigration concerns.
“It’s time to stop being scared,” Heidi West, a teacher at Academy of the Americas, said to the board. “Speak up strongly and publicly.”
There have been at least five DPSCD students detained by ICE in the months since federal immigration enforcement ramped up in the second Trump administration.
 ‘Shattered dreams’ for students detained by ICE

All four students had pending court dates in asylum cases, said Christine Sauvé, manager of policy and communication at the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center.
Mor Ba, a 19-year-old who came to the U.S. without any family from Senegal in April, graduated from Western International last month.
The night before his detention, Ba filled out college applications, Adja Ndoye of the Detroit-based African Bureau for Immigrants and Social Affairs said. Ba planned to study mechanical engineering.
“He was already going around and asking about apprenticeships,” said Ndoye. “He had his goals set on how to make a new life. I think he was thriving. He was the embodiment of the American dream.”
On Nov. 26, police stopped Ba and blocked his vehicle in search of another person, Ndoye said. The teen, who was on his way to work, provided the officers his identification to confirm he was not the person they were looking for, but was still taken into custody, she said.
Ba is being held at the Northlake Correctional Facility in Baldwin about three and half hours north of Detroit, ICE records show. He had a pending asylum case with a court date scheduled for early next year, Ndoye said.
On Sunday, Santiago Jesus Zamora Perez, a 17-year-old in 11th grade from Venezuela, was taken into ICE custody, according to Kristen Schoettle, one of his Western International teachers.
The teen and his mother were reportedly pulled over by police in Fraser for driving under the speed limit, Sauvé said.
Zamora Perez is a star baseball player with good grades and aspirations of playing in college, according to his teachers.
Kerly Mariangel Sosa Rivero and Antony Janier Peña Sosa, 16-year-old cousins who came to the U.S. in 2023 from Venezuela were taken into immigration custody on Nov. 20. with two of their parents. Federal agents raided their home on the eastside of Detroit while the family slept, attorney George Washington said at a recent protest outside of Western International. The agents were searching for another person.

Sosa Rivero, an 11th grader, plays volleyball, shared alternative indie rock music with her teacher, and looked forward to attending college.
Peña Sosa, in 10th grade, plays the violin, excelled in Advanced Placement art class, and was quickly learning English, according to his teachers.
The three students under 18 were sent to facilities in Texas, Sauvé said.
Maykol Bogoya-Duarte, an 18-year-old who attended Western International, was detained by ICE in May. He was deported to Colombia, where he was born, in June.
Boyoga-Duarte, who arrived in the U.S. at 16, was only 3.5 credits away from graduating. He was working to get the travel documents he needed to return to Colombia before his arrest.
 Teachers want for more resources, training

Educators and advocates have been vocal in recent months demanding the district offer know-your-rights training, more counseling, and safer transportation options for students with immigration concerns.
Last month, dozens of people asked the board to update its 2019 “Sanctuary District” policy and train all of its staff in protocols around interacting with ICE. The board did not take any action.
Alexander Cintron, director of the newcomer program at Western International, told Chalkbeat that attendance is being impacted by fears of ICE. “It’s also affecting students’ grades and mental health,” he said.
There is “an undercurrent of despair and anxiety” in students who are immigrants, a teacher of one of the detained students said. The teacher asked for anonymity out of concern about retribution from the district.
“How do you teach someone who had family members yanked from them?” the educator said. “How can I address their constant worries about being stopped at a park by immigration while trying to meet their educational needs?”
Schoettle said she lost around 20 students this year due to immigration issues.
“I had about eight more tell me they wanted to leave today,” she said during Tuesday’s meeting.
Sauvé said schools can play a pivotal role in sharing information. The nonprofit released best practices for schools in February.
“We get so many calls from teachers who say they’re not hearing information from their leadership,” she said.
Seydi Sarr, founder of ABISA, asked district officials to meet with parents of English learners and use their resources to help them advocate to state lawmakers.
“We want you to wield the power that you have to make sure we have a real impact,” she said.
Other speakers asked for the board to meet with English language teachers, a legal support hotline, make it clear educators can give out “Know Your Rights” cards to students, more public condemnation of immigration enforcement from board members, and for the district to support students’ right to protest.
Board members did not address the speakers when public comment ended.
Once the meeting adjourned, some attendees yelled at the board for not responding to their concerns.
“What if it was your kids?” one said.
Corletta Vaughn, chair of the board, said after the meeting that the letter in support of the students would be posted publicly by the end of the week.
There were more than 7,400 English learners in the Detroit district last school year, making up more than 15% of all students.
Around 1,200 students were newcomers in DPSCD last year, meaning they have been in the U.S. for less than three years and are not fluent English speakers.
Western International serves more than half of the district’s high school newcomers.

Between January and June, about 750 abortions each month were obtained by Tennessee residents relying on virtual visits and mailed-out or picked up abortion pills, according to data released Tuesday by the Society for Family Planning. 
It’s a trend that began in July 2023 after more Democrat-led states enacted so-called shield laws that protect healthcare providers from legal action taken by authorities in states such as Tennessee, which has outlawed telehealth for abortions and criminalized the mailing of abortion pills — laws that apply only to clinicians, not those seeking abortions. Tennessee has had a near total abortion ban in place since 2022. 
Signaling skepticism that exceptions to TN abortion ban are adequate, judges rule against state

Nearly all abortions obtained in Tennessee and 12 states with abortion bans in the first half of 2025 have been provided through telehealth visits with providers in states that have enacted shield law, the #WeCount report released Tuesday said. 
“Telehealth has become a lifeline for people accessing abortion care, especially those in states with abortion bans,” said Ushma Upadhyay, co-chair of the report and a professor at the University of California.
The report found that between January and June, licensed healthcare providers performed more than half a million abortions nationally, including in-person clinic visits and medication abortions. The percentage of telehealth abortions during the same time period rose 25% from the end of 2024. 
In total, 99,000 abortions were performed each month in the United States in the first half of 2025, up from 95,000 in 2024, the report found.

(Photo by U.S. Department of Agriculture)Governors and attorneys general from Pennsylvania and 21 other jurisdictions say they want explicit safeguards related to immigration enforcement, artificial intelligence and more before getting involved in the federal government’s push for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) data.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture says the project will help mitigate SNAP fraud, waste and abuse. Opponents fear the resulting database will lack appropriate safeguards and support other endeavors — including immigration enforcement, as with some of the Trump administration’s other data expansion efforts. 
Listen to the audio recap here: 

https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/09EPsnapupdateWEB.mp3
 
In a 16-page letter provided to the Pennsylvania Capital-Star, lawyers for the states laid out dozens of questions about and aspects of the initiative – including cost-sharing, privacy, security and bureaucratic redundancy – that they want the USDA to address. 
The document comes as part of a lawsuit filed earlier this year as 21 states and Washington, D.C., declined to share the information as requested by USDA. That includes SNAP applicant and recipients’ names, addresses, social security numbers and immigration and marital statuses dating back to Jan. 1, 2020.
Twenty-eight states and Guam have since started sharing the data, according to the USDA. 
Recently, the Trump administration told the other states and D.C. that they could lose federal funding to help pay to administer SNAP if they don’t opt into the data collection initiative before Christmas Eve, and asked for detailed justifications by Monday for continuing to abstain. 
window.addEventListener(“message”,function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[“datawrapper-height”]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(“iframe”);for(var t in a.data[“datawrapper-height”])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[“datawrapper-height”][t]+”px”;r.style.height=d}}});
But the federal government can’t yank SNAP funding due to the preliminary injunction in the case, attorneys for the plaintiff jurisdictions argue in their Dec. 8 letter. 
They also made demands and raised questions they say need responses – preferably, by Dec. 15 – before they can move forward. 
The plaintiffs want the USDA to detail its artificial intelligence policy and  confirm restrictions on data access by other federal agencies – in particular, that Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) won’t use it for immigration enforcement. 
And they want to know what will be achieved by the new data sharing initiative that isn’t already happening through existing SNAP oversight and data-sharing and analysis. That includes:  

the National Accuracy Clearinghouse (NAC) to identify duplicate SNAP enrollment
Electronic Disqualified Recipient Systems to flag applicants previously disqualified for fraud 
SNAP quality control systems that (among other things) establish error rates 
Electronic benefits transfer (EBT) fraud monitoring that entails providing daily transaction data to USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service
SAVE (Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements) program to verify immigration status 

They also say protocols for those existing programs are more detailed and stringent than the new one and could serve as models. That includes:  

Restricting who can access data and permissible uses to directly related to SNAP administration and enforcement
Initially sharing redacted and/or aggregated data and then providing individual-level case details as warranted in response to requests from federal officials –and purging it from federal records shortly thereafter.  

And they’ve asked USDA to explain how artificial intelligence will be utilized and related privacy safeguards. 
An agency spokesperson said in an email USDA doesn’t comment on ongoing litigation. 
It costs more than $500 million per year to administer SNAP benefits in Pennsylvania. The state and federal government have been splitting the bill. But that’s set to change next year, when the commonwealth will cover 75 percent – leaving $130 million in federal funding for administration hanging in the balance. 
About two million people in Pennsylvania and 40 million others nationally receive SNAP benefits, according to the latest data available from USDA.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/54392971083_6a04f0b70f_6k-1024x6831761681275-1.jpg,,,2025-12-10 06:56:15.885438

Tom Tiffany has said his campaign is aiming to raise $40 million for the 2026 gubernatorial race. Tiffany delivers a speech at his launch event in Wausau in September. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany, the current frontrunner in the GOP gubernatorial primary, criticized the “billionaire loophole” that has led to record spending in statewide races in Wisconsin, even though he voted for the legislation that helped expand spending in 2015.
Tiffany has said his campaign is aiming to raise $40 million for the 2026 gubernatorial race. “We’ll see if we get there,” Tiffany said in an interview with PBS Wisconsin last week. “But, you know, Wisconsin, because of that pass-through loophole, I call it the billionaire loophole, there’s just so much money that comes into Wisconsin. But, you know, you can cry about it or you can compete. We choose to compete… We’re hoping to raise $40 million.”
Spending on Wisconsin statewide elections has grown substantially over the last decade in part because of an overhaul of the state’s campaign finance laws adopted in 2015 under the leadership of former Gov. Scott Walker and the Republican-led Legislature. 
Republican lawmakers at the time argued that the changes to the campaign finance laws were necessary to align state law with U.S. Supreme Court decisions, including Citizens United v. FEC, which in 2010 struck down a nationwide ban on political donations from corporations, and McCutcheon v. FEC, which in 2014 found that annual caps on total political donations from one person are unconstitutional.
Under 2015 Wisconsin Act 117, Wisconsin lawmakers eliminated a state law that capped individual donations to all candidates and political committees in a single year at $10,000. Limits on contributions for each state and local office were increased and limits on contributions to party and legislative campaign committees were eliminated, creating a loophole that allowed unlimited money to flow through parties and committees into individual campaigns. The law eliminated restrictions on coordination between political parties and candidates and allowed for political parties and legislative campaign committees to make unlimited contributions to candidate committees.
The state law has become a topic of conversation again as the U.S. Supreme Court heard a case Tuesday challenging a federal law limiting the amount of money that political parties can spend in coordination with a candidate for office.
Tiffany has represented Wisconsin’s 7th Congressional District since 2020, but prior to that he served in the state Senate. As a state senator, Tiffany voted for AB 387, which later became Act 117, along with the other Senate Republicans. Only one Republican, former state Sen. Rob Cowles, voted against the measure.
Tiffany’s campaign has not responded to a request for comment about the vote and whether he wants to see changes to state campaign finance law.
At the time, advocacy groups and Democratic lawmakers warned the legislation would lead to obscene spending in Wisconsin elections. The Wisconsin Democracy Campaign warned in written testimony that the legislation would mean “billionaires and multimillionaires will have an outsized influence over who gets elected” and that political contests would “be less between candidates and more between tycoons.”
Spending in governors’ races was already growing following the U.S. Supreme Court decision and before the state law was adopted. In 2010, $37.37 million was spent on the governor’s race; in 2014, spending increased to $81.78 million. The increase in spending ballooned dramatically  after the passage of the 2015 law.
A record-breaking $164 million was spent in 2022 on Wisconsin’s gubernatorial race. According to the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, the cost represented a 77% increase from the previous $93.06 million record that was set in the 2018 governor’s race.
Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Mandela Barnes, who served in the Assembly in 2015, did not vote on the campaign spending bill, joining the rest of his Democratic Assembly colleagues who said it was a conflict of interest for lawmakers to rewrite the laws that govern their campaigns. He is the only Democratic candidate in the current crowded primary field who was in the Legislature at the time.
Barnes said in a press release in 2015 that he opposed the bill because Republicans rejected an amendment that would have delayed implementation until after the 2016 election cycle. He said Republicans “acted in blatant self-interest for their campaign committees by voting down my effort,” so he “recused myself from voting on ultimate passage of this outrageous proposal.” 
Barnes also said then that with the legislation Republicans had “fully embraced the darkness of corruption by voting to rig the rules to line their own campaign pockets with shady special interest money and allow for more corruption to go undetected and unprosecuted.”
Barnes, a former lieutenant governor and U.S. Senate candidate, recently said he is aiming to raise $50 million over the course of the race, but at the same time criticized the escalation in campaign spending.
“It’s not a good sign for things. I wish that were not the case,” Barnes told reporters Monday. “The goal is to get big money out of politics. The goal is for campaign and ethics reform… We should be taking more steps to reduce the impact of money in politics.”
Other Democratic candidates include Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez, Milwaukee Co. Exec. David Crowley, state Sen. Kelda Roys, state Rep. Francesca Hong, Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. CEO Missy Hughes and former state Rep. Brett Hulsey.
Washington County Executive Josh Schoemann is the only other Republican candidate currently in the race.
Barnes and Tiffany have not had to file campaign finance reports yet as they entered after the last deadline. Candidates’ next campaign finance filing deadline is Jan. 15, 2026. Those reports will cover July 1, 2025 through Dec. 31, 2025.

(Photo by Ronda Churchill/Nevada Current)Corporate landlords aren’t exactly popular in the public eye. Headlines often take them to be synonymous with rising rents, unanswered emails, and a dogged focus on maximizing profit and portfolio size. 
According to MIT’s Henry Gomory, landlords with 15 or more units “file evictions at two to three times the rates of small landlords, and this disparity is not driven by the characteristics of the tenants they rent to.” The Urban Institute cites the ownership structure of large scale investment as the driver behind these increased filing rates. Corporate landlords also raise rents higher and more rapidly than smaller landlords. Public distaste is often accentuated when corporations are from out of state. 
The Mountain West has seen an increase in corporate investment as the region’s population continues to grow. The story goes: As coastal Westerners and remote workers move in, large investors from outside the Mountain West are buying up property to capitalize on their former neighbors’ relocation.
However, while this is certainly taking place, this narrative can overlook corporate landlords from within the Mountain West that are uniquely problematic locally and in neighboring states. 
This is the case in Boise, where Utah-based landlords have become major obstacles to homelessness prevention efforts. 
According to a 2025 report from Jesse Tree, Utah landlords account for 94% of the instances in which out-of-state corporate landlords refused rental assistance in favor of evicting their tenant. This striking number is largely the result of two companies based in the Salt Lake Valley. 
Landlords often cite the time burden of rental assistance paperwork as the reason for not assisting. However, Jesse Tree landlord data shows that the paperwork takes, on average, 5 minutes to complete. Another significant contributor is that a Utah company with 948 units in and around Boise has adopted an assistance refusal policy after nonprofits raised concerns about the legality of their business practices.
This comes at a grave cost to Idaho tenants. Katie Amidan with Jesse Tree has observed that “tenants who would otherwise be able to stay housed are often pushed closer to homelessness or may experience homelessness. These tenants typically meet rental requirements and are able to pay rent consistently in normal circumstances.” 
While there has been an increase in corporations citing these policies, issues with Utah based landlords are not new. According to Evan Stewart, Jesse Tree’s executive director, “there have been cases where tenants were given fake eviction court dates, tactics to kick people out and pushing vulnerable families closer to homelessness. We are really only seeing this kind of behavior from some Utah-based companies.” 
There are two additional reasons why these issues are concentrated in Utah. First, landlords in Mountain West states like Idaho and Utah are not required to accept rent payments from a third party. This is not the case in places like California, where cities often have protections for tenants receiving rental assistance. Because of this, companies focused in the Mountain West have an easier time adopting assistance refusal policies. Secondly, the Salt Lake City metro area has become a major regional investment hub. Out of the 50 largest residential property owners in the country, 50% of those based in the Mountain West are from the Salt Lake Valley. 
While this issue highlights a tension within the region, it also shows how necessary solidarity is among neighboring cities and states. While communities organize to combat rising costs, it is essential that Mountain Westerners are assets and allies to each other. There are regional solutions to be pursued, but nothing substantial can be done if we block local community efforts.

The tariff war with China forced Stafslien to store more of his soybeans this harvest season. (Photo: Gabrielle Nelson/Buffalo’s Fire)RYDER, N.D. — Tyler Stafslien is a fourth-generation farmer who’s worked his family’s land in central North Dakota for about 20 years. Roughly half of his 2,500 acres are typically dedicated to soybeans, a major crop in the state and in the Mississippi River Basin. But growing soybeans has become less profitable over the last decade as input costs rose and the Trump administration’s tariff negotiations in 2018 and 2025 destabilized trade and strained farmers’ incomes. 
This year, wary of the precarious export market, Stafslien decreased his soybean acres by half.
“We’ve been experiencing in ag, the last couple of years, a downturn in commodity prices, a lot of that related to just a large supply across the globe of major commodities, but then you add this trade war on top of it, and it’s like the icing on the cake,” Stafslien said.
The administration announced Monday a $12 billion fund for one-time payments to row crop farmers to offset a portion of their inflation- and trade-related losses in the 2025 crop year.
Farmers were asking for the federal relief funds and are happy the administration is finally answering, said Stafslien. But he’s still facing uncertainty. The administration has yet to announce how much money per acre eligible growers will be receiving, and the funds will not be distributed until February, further stressing farmers like him with large debt and growing interest.
“Payments announced this week must be followed by additional and expedient efforts to keep farmers on the land and to improve the farm safety net, leaving annual bailouts as cautionary historical context rather than ongoing policy,” David Howard, policy development director of the National Young Farmers Coalition, wrote in a statement Tuesday. 
Farmers and farming associations are looking for longer term solutions: to diversify trade partners and increase domestic uses for soybeans as export revenues become less certain. Some, like Stafslien, are shifting to other crops, like corn and wheat.
Soybeans are the largest agricultural export in the U.S. The legume covers more than 81 million acres — or 10% — of all U.S. farmland, the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported in September, and more than 40% of the nation’s soybeans are exported to other countries. 
U.S. farmers received $24.5 billion from soybean exports in 2024, with Chinese purchases accounting for $12.6 billion – roughly twice the amount purchased by the next five largest export partners combined, according to USDA data.
But this year, China stopped purchasing U.S. soybeans during tariff negotiations with the Trump administration, instead falling back on its relationships with Brazil and other South American countries to meet its soybean needs. For U.S. soybean farmers, this growing season ends with low prices, unsold harvests, big financial losses and uncertainty going into the next season despite a tentative new deal with China. 
“We learned firsthand that being heavily reliant on China for export sales is only good when things are good,” University of Tennessee Professor of Agricultural and Resource Economics Andrew Muhammad said.
How did we get here?
Soybeans brought by traders and missionaries from Asia first took root in North America in small quantities in the 1700s, but the USDA did not begin tracking soybeans as a crop until the early 1920s. 
Around that time, the USDA, land grant university extension agents and farm groups started to promote the soybean to farmers as a soil-fertilizing crop that yielded high-protein meal for animal feed, oil, and even meat replacements for human consumption.The Mississippi River Basin’s flat plains and intermittent rain proved to be ideal conditions for the crop. 
Soybeans gained a foothold on U.S. farms in “fits and starts” over several decades, author Matthew Roth writes in his book, “Magic Bean: The Rise of Soy in America,” but really took off  as a cash crop after World War I. Its success was later buoyed by the Agricultural Adjustment Act that allowed soy plantings while restricting other commodities as a way to stabilize crop prices during the Great Depression, policies limiting foreign oils, and the growing need for animal feed and oil during World War II, according to Roth.
The crop helped diversify farming in the south and midwest. By the 1960s, Roth writes, “the soybean had insinuated itself thoroughly into the American diet,” but indirectly – as feed for the country’s livestock, oils for salads and derivatives in processed foods.

At the same time, soybeans proved to be a desirable product for international trade partners. In 1989, U.S. soybean exports totaled around $4 billion, about a fifth of which went to Japan. The Freedom to Farm Act in 1996 allowed farmers to plant single-crop fields, and with rising export demand from China starting in the early 1990s, many farmers chose to plant soybeans, Roth wrote.
In 2001, China joined the World Trade Organization and gained better access to globalized trade with the organization’s members, including the U.S., according to Muhammad and the Council on Foreign Relations. From there, growth in China’s tourism economy and middle class spurred increased demand for meat protein, Muhammad said, heightening the country’s need for animal feed in the form of U.S. soybeans. 
By 2000, the crop was planted on more than 74 million U.S. acres, according to the National Agricultural Statistics Service.
“Over time, China has grown, and it seems to be the case that our total export sales have grown with our exports to China,” Muhammad explained. “They’ve sort of driven that rise over the last two decades.”
Brazil’s soybean industry has competed with American exports since the 1970s, but since 2017 has consistently exported more than the U.S. 
When Trump first upped tariffs on Chinese goods in 2018, China retaliated, Muhammad said, and began investing more heavily in purchases and transportation infrastructure in Brazil. Their turn toward Brazil as a primary provider during trade negotiations in 2025 “represents a return on that investment (for China),” he said.
Farmers in the U.S. are reckoning with the fallout. 
Farming pains and changing plans
Justin Sherlock farms 2,400 acres of corn and soybeans in eastern North Dakota. His dad started farming in the early 2000s and he took over the farm in 2012.
“The last, you know, 13 years that I’ve been going, the last decade, has been pretty tough to really try and get established,” he said. 
For Sherlock, China coming to market very late in the 2025 harvest season was a blow to profits. Nearly one-quarter of the state’s agricultural exports hinge on soybeans, with China serving as the largest market for U.S. grain.
Sherlock was able to sell most of his soybean crop early to North Dakota soybean elevators — facilities that store the beans — which then found domestic processors in Nebraska and Kansas to sell to. But those domestic markets were also absorbing the supply that would typically be exported to China, so prices — around $8.65 per bushel — dropped significantly below Sherlock’s cost of production. He said he will lose “several hundred thousands of dollars” this year, on top of similar losses last year. 
“We just have to find a way to hopefully make it to next year,” he said. “That’s the struggle right now for a lot of producers.” 
Especially for young or beginning producers, said Sherlock, farmers will likely be having “tough financial discussions with their bankers and lenders.” Or, worst case scenario, these losses could mean losing their farms.
“You cannot have a successful agriculture industry in North Dakota without trade,” he said. “It’s so important that we fix these trade relationships and get back to doing business with other countries.” 
Trade uncertainty was keenly felt by soybean farmers in several Mississippi River Basin states, many of which lead the nation in soybean production and exports. 
Illinois accounts for 16% of the country’s total soybean exports, followed by Iowa with 13%, according to the most recent data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Economic Research Service. North Dakota comprises 5% of national exports.
Even in states that aren’t among the country’s top producers, soybeans can make up a significant portion of the state farm economy. Tennessee ranks 16th in the nation for soybean exports, for example, but soybeans were the highest-ranked agricultural commodity produced in the state in 2023, bringing in more than $990 million in cash receipts. In 2025, soybeans covered nearly 1.5 million acres of Tennessee farmland – the most of any crop in the state – according to the University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture.
The USDA’s Economic Research Service reported in July that more soybeans are being processed domestically. Most of the soybeans that stay in the U.S. are crushed into oil and meal, and a majority of that meal goes toward feeding livestock. The oil is used in biofuels, for industrial uses, and in food. New crush facilities that separate the beans into oil and meal are under construction in North Dakota, Nebraska, Wisconsin, Iowa, Kansas and Ohio — states that previously shipped soybeans to other countries to be processed. Biofuel has increased domestic demand for soybeans — and crush facilities — since around 2010, providing an alternative for farmers facing lower demand from traditional export partners.
April Hemmes, a fourth-generation farmer in north-central Iowa, said in September that she is fortunate to have nearby options for her beans: there is an ethanol plant and a crush facility that makes soybean meal, biodiesel and food-grade oil, about 10 miles away from her farm. Farmers who don’t have those options will have a harder time adapting to changing export markets, she wrote in an email.
The lack of money in farmers’ pockets is trickling down to other sectors in farming communities, too, said John Bartman, a regenerative farmer working about 850 acres in northern Illinois. He pointed to farm equipment dealers and factories in Illinois and Iowa that are shuttering well-paying jobs because business has been so slow. 
“So it’s more than just farmers who have been affected by this,” Bartman said. 
What comes next?
In October, China and the U.S. hammered out a trade agreement. China agreed to purchase at least 12 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans by the end of the year, according to the White House, and will purchase at least 25 million metric tons each year through 2028. USDA export sales data from Oct. 2 through Dec. 8 shows China made soybean purchases from the U.S. totaling about 2.8 million metric tons.
For comparison, China purchased an annual average of 29 million metric tons of soybeans from the United States between 2020 and 2024, according to The Center for Strategic and International Studies, an international public policy think tank.
The deal “really isn’t much of a trade deal at all,” Bartman said.
“We’ve just gone through this tariff war, which we’re still going through right now, and what did we get out of it? China agreed to buy less soybeans than what we had last year, and we as farmers have suffered the collateral damage from this,” Bartman said.
With low trade prices and higher input costs, he warned, “we have not improved our economic situation for next year.”
Bartman is among farmers who are promoting investment in domestic uses for soybeans, including biofuels and plastics, though he acknowledges that a market the size of China’s will be “very difficult” to replace.
Muhammad said the turbulence in the soybean exports market shows that disruption of stable trade policy has consequences, which can hurt some sectors more than others.
The U.S. agriculture sector is often a political target in trade disputes, he said, because other countries understand the agricultural community’s significance in U.S. politics.
“It’s not a major export in the context of all exports, but it’s a politically viable community, and it carries a lot of heft in the context of trade agreements and trade policy because of the national security nature of food,” Muhammad said.
Farmers who are eligible for the Trump administration’s $12 billion Farmer Bridge Assistance program should expect the USDA to announce payment rates for crops the week of Dec. 22, according to the department. Payments are limited to up to $155,000 per person or legal entity.
The program appears similar to a $10 billion aid package offered to farmers impacted by trade retaliation in 2018. Those subsidies did not cover all of farmers’ losses.

For many farmers like Sherlock, these subsidies are a necessity for short-term survival. He said any farming subsidies he receives go straight to paying his bills and paying off loans.
“There will be a lot of producers, especially young, beginning producers, who won’t be able to make it and farm next year if we don’t do something to help them pay their bills from this year,” he said.
Even established producers are worried. Stafslien works land that’s been in his family since 1912, but the tough years are piling up. 
“This is my future. This is my retirement. I don’t have a 401k plan. I have a farm,” said Stafslien, who lives on the farm with his wife, Shannon, and their two kids. “If I have to keep burning through this equity, that’s very, very scary for my future and my family’s future.”

(Getty Images)Indiana utility customer advocacy groups on Tuesday released a slate of ambitious reforms they say would promote affordability for struggling residential and small-business ratepayers.
The document calls for policies benefiting low-income customers, like discounts and a summertime shutoff ban, along with changes to state oversight and regulations.
“Hoosier families are stretched thin, and they need relief now from monopoly utilities who’ve pushed policies for years that led to this crisis,” said Megan Robertson, the executive director of Indiana Conservation Voters, a clean environment and energy group.

“This plan gives state leaders a clear, practical path to lower bills that will protect Hoosiers most in need and build a more affordable, reliable energy future for every community in our state,” she said.
About 87% of Hoosiers were at least “somewhat” concerned about rising energy costs — with 59% “very” concerned — in a Bellwether Research poll conducted for Indiana Conservation Voters.
The survey of 800 registered voters statewide was performed Oct. 29-30 and Nov. 1, over call and text, and carried an error margin of plus or minus 3.5%.
Robertson’s organization was joined by Citizens Action Coalition, a utility ratepayer watchdog.
“For too long, Hoosiers have been footing the bill for decisions they didn’t make and policies they didn’t ask for,” said Kerwin Olson, the coalition’s executive director.
“Indiana’s regulatory system should be built to protect consumers, but that goal can only be achieved if lawmakers give regulators the tools and authority it needs,” Olson said. “The solutions have been ready for years. The need is now incredibly urgent, and we hope lawmakers will do their part.”
The Indiana Energy Association, which represents the state’s largest electric and natural gas utilities, said the industry is “listening closely to customers, stakeholders, policymakers, and state leaders” as regular legislative work approaches.
“We recognize that many policy proposals will be considered this legislative session, and we share the concern for how the current landscape is affecting the people we serve,” association President Danielle McGrath said in a statement to the Capital Chronicle. “We remain committed to keeping energy reliable and affordable for our customers.”
She noted utilities already have some options for cash-strapped consumers.

“Beyond providing power, the industry plays a critical role in supporting our customers and communities. We offer a range of assistance and affordability tools that help manage costs and consumption, such as bill payment assistance, notifications and alerts, and flexible payment options,” McGrath said.
She added that Indiana’s residential energy prices are below the U.S. average and rank the lowest in the Earth North Central region — Indiana, Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan and Ohio — according to the federal Energy Information Administration.
The plan, however, indicated residents are still hard-hit.
“Hoosiers are paying some of the highest energy bills in the Midwest,” it read. “… Families, seniors, renters, small business owners — everyone is feeling the pain.”
White paper’s suggestions
Recommendations in the “Help Hoosiers Now Ratepayer Relief Plan” are ordered by “how quickly they will affect Hoosiers,” according to the document.
It centers on a pair of policies targeting low-income households.
Under the first, lawmakers would establish a discount rate for each of the state’s investor-owned utility companies, applicable to ratepayers who qualify as low-income. The Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission would set the rate, which the plan suggests could be based on a 3% or 4% income burden threshold. The concept is similar to the 30% of income standard often used for housing affordability.
The second would prohibit shutoffs during high summer temperatures for participants in Indiana’s low-income home energy assistance program. State law already bans shutoffs for such households during the winter, from Dec. 1 through March 15, according to the plan.
The organizations also aim to shake up the regulatory space. They recommended reforming IURC’s jurisdiction in mergers or acquisitions involving utilities or their parent firms.

Under other suggestions, lawmakers would require IURC to cap utility profit rates at the cost of capital and ban the commission from letting utilities include “political influence campaigns” in customer bills.
That would include activities related to lobbying, charitable giving, trade association expenses, litigation, investor relations and more. Utilities would file annual reports related to those activities, and the IURC would make them public.
Another proposal includes repealing or reducing cost trackers. Utilities can currently use them to adjust rates for certain expenses and recover those costs from customers on an ongoing basis.
Shrinking or getting rid of some trackers would “provide more stability in monthly bills and require utilities to go through the rate case process to pass along these costs,” the plan reads.
Other recommendations are longer-term endeavors.
That includes a revival of distributed energy generation policies, review of the state’s approach to controversial data centers and a requirement that big industrial energy-users participate in utility-led energy efficiency programs. They’d also help pay for the initiatives.
The plan additionally envisions a legislative confirmation process for IURC commissioners. The five members are appointed by the governor without lawmakers’ involvement.
And it delves into a contentious debate over utility-scale infrastructure siting. Indiana doesn’t have standards statewide, so it’s up to each of the 92 counties. Previous legislative attempts have failed amid pushback from local officials and residents.

Andy Beshear signed an executive order banning the practice of conversion therapy on minors in Kentucky. (Governor's office photo)After 40 years as a member of the National Association of Social Work and 10 years as the executive director of Kentucky’s chapter, Brenda Rosen was let go in November in a process that is drawing sharp criticism from social workers throughout the state. 
Her board of directors resigned in protest, and advocates say on the eve of the 2026 legislative session, and at a time when many communities face tenuous futures, a key voice is now missing. 
Rosen is left with questions about how and why the organization made the decision to restructure — and how they chose who to lay off in the process — and what that means for Kentucky’s social workers and legislative advocacy. 
The Kansas Reflector reported in late November that the national association is combining 14 state chapters into pairs that will be overseen by one director. 
Kentucky’s chapter, Rosen said, is being consolidated with the Ohio chapter, a move several social workers and advocates said would dilute the advocacy and support that the chapter has historically provided for both social workers and community members. 
“We want accountability. We want our members to understand how hard we fought, how hard the chapters have fought to maintain executive directors in every chapter, because every member deserves to have that,” Rosen said. “Everybody pays the same amount of money, depending on their category of membership. Everybody deserves to have that equal presence. How we pass important policies happens at the state level, not at the national level.” 
An NASW spokesperson told the Lantern that “the decision to consolidate the Kentucky chapter was the result of a thorough assessment of the chapter’s year-over-year membership and revenue growth. While we are grateful for the local leadership, the efforts were not enough to sustain a full-time executive director role.”
“The National Association of Social Workers (NASW) is undergoing a national, internal realignment to strengthen operational efficiency and support for social workers,” the spokesperson said. “As costs within nonprofit organizations have increased, it has become necessary to continue transitioning to a dual-chapter executive director model in states with fewer members or that are heavily dependent on financial and administrative support from the national office.”
With ‘no confidence’ a board of 13 resigns 
During a leadership management meeting in September, Rosen said, there was “no mention whatsoever of moving to shared chapters” or “people being terminated.” 
‘Confused and frustrated’: Kansas social work advocate loses job in national group’s restructure

On Halloween, national leadership called a meeting and informed chapter executives that “no one is safe,” Rosen said. During that meeting, she learned chapters would begin merging sometime in the near future. 
Rosen then learned during a virtual meeting on Nov. 10 that she was being laid off, she said. 
On Nov. 21, Rosen’s last day as executive director, the 13 members of the Kentucky chapter board of directors issued a statement signed by former president Angela Anderson saying that the board had “deep concerns about the health of NASW in general and leadership specifically.” 
That statement, shared with the Lantern, said the board members “do not agree with the plan to be led by the Ohio chapter as the best way to serve Kentucky members of NASW, nor being part of the North Central Region.” 
Rosen’s termination, the board wrote, “will make serving the unique needs of Kentucky members untenable, just as her having to lead Ohio would be a disservice to its members.” 
The statement ended conclusively: “The NASW-KY Board of Directors has no confidence in a dialogue achieving any meaningful conclusions, especially following the termination of our executive director … who proudly served our Kentucky chapter for 9.5 years. We stand in solidarity with other NASW chapters that are speaking up and calling for action and accountability. We are officially resigning from the Board of Directors of NASW-KY effective immediately.”

Anderson told the Lantern that consolidating chapters violated the “core values and ethics” that she and other social workers live by professionally, namely the focus on competency. Anderson was the board president from Sept. 2024 until her resignation last month. 
“If we can’t have a person here in Kentucky who is a Kentuckian who can spend their time when (legislators are) in session, advocating for our people, where is the competency?” Anderson, of Northern Kentucky, said. “How is somebody from another state going to be competent to their state and to a state (where) they have no skin in that game and they can’t spend the time and build the relationship? Where’s the competency?”
Anderson says she attempted to initiate dialogue with national officials and requested minutes from a national-level meeting that she hoped would shed light on the situation. 
“When they ignored our request for an audience with them, not just to voice our feelings, but to seek to understand, from their point of view, the changes that were occurring — we did not get responses,” Anderson said. “So then the approach was … not to encourage them to change. It was saying: ‘We as … a Kentucky collective are coming forward to say that we no longer feel like we align and we are done.’” 
Anderson said the national restructuring of finances also lacked transparency. Rosen said the chapter’s financial accounts closed with the consolidation. 
Student membership dues are about $60 and professionals pay closer to $230 per year. These fees historically helped pay for executive director salaries.
“Kentucky and Ohio will maintain their own chapter identities and leadership councils — following guidance established by their chapter charters — with the support of one full-time executive director,” the NASW spokesperson said. “Each state’s membership dues will remain in their state and invested in critical areas, including local advocacy and organizing.”
Anderson is excited about new ways to advocate outside of the NASW board of directors. 
“None of us on the board resigned without heartache … without this feeling of loss,” she said. But, at the same time, she said: “There’s so much hope in the ideal of starting fresh, of focusing here on Kentucky.” 
‘An incredible uphill climb’ in Frankfort 
Sheila Schuster
Sheila Schuster, who has been advocating in Frankfort for mental health and more for nearly five decades and leads the Kentucky Mental Health Coalition, said she’s never seen anything like this. 
Professional organizations, especially those involved in advocacy work, “really want to create an esprit de corps, if you will, among the professionals at all levels,” Schuster said, which is harder to accomplish if the work isn’t led at the local level. 
“I can’t imagine how that works if it’s no longer housed in the state, even if it’s a contiguous state,” she said. It leaves social workers and NASW members in Kentucky “homeless,” she said. 
The change comes about a month ahead of Kentucky’s 2026 legislative session, a time when advocates flock to Frankfort and try to sway lawmakers’ votes on important-to-them issues. 
Without established relationships with lawmakers, Schuster said, anyone with the Ohio chapter seeking to effect change in Kentucky faces “an incredible uphill climb.”  
“If there’s going to be any legislative advocacy, I don’t know how you get that organized quickly,” Schuster said. 
The NASW spokesperson said that “we are confident the chapter will thrive in the dual-chapter executive director model, as NASW has successfully implemented it in some states over the last several years. By partnering neighboring chapters and providing them with full-time employee support, on-the-ground engagement, collaboration, and the ability to pass legislation on behalf of social workers, members feel more supported.”
Meanwhile, Schuster described Rosen as an “enthusiastic advocate” and “ready partner” who has brought “energy and focus” to Kentucky, in Frankfort advocacy and beyond. 
“I can’t imagine the behavioral health advocacy in Frankfort not involving Brenda, quite frankly,” Schuster said. “She’s been just that active.”

Sally Rhoads, a licensed clinical social worker who runs a private practice in Lexington, said that without Rosen’s advocacy in Frankfort “people will suffer and the people that suffer will be the people that (are) not in a position to really advocate effectively for themselves.” 
Rhoads, 77, a second generation social worker and former member of the Kentucky board of directors, has worked around Rosen’s orbit for about a decade, she said. 
She’s been a member of NASW for the past six years, she said, though she had intermittent membership throughout her career. With artificial intelligence concerns in mental health treatment and “discriminatory legislation” in Kentucky and beyond, said Rhoads, advocacy is more important than ever. 
Her membership renewal notice just came in, Rhoads said, and: “I’m very seriously thinking about resigning as a result of this.” 
‘Batten down the hatches’ 
The organizational change within the organization comes at a time that Rosen said is vital for social workers to “batten down the hatches” between “(President Donald) Trump coming into office” and his administration’s crackdown on immigration — including a directive allowing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to arrest at courthouses, which wasn’t permitted under the Biden administration. 
Her organization has always been “very human rights” focused and keen on “ensuring that everybody has a voice and pushing back on a lot of the hateful things that are happening,” she said. “This is a time when we really need to mobilize, and really need to ensure that social work voices are being heard so we can work together to protect our people — all people — right?” 
Several other social workers echoed this concern, saying social workers are key to fighting for safety net programs. Among those, Anderson said federal policy changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) make it a crucial time for people to be boots on the ground in Frankfort. 
Rosen testified against several bills in recent years, including one to shield conversion therapy, a discredited practice that attempts to alter gender expression and sexual attraction that diverges from heterosexual normativity “with the specific aim to promote heterosexuality as a preferable outcome,” according to the The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.” 
House Bill 495 became law in 2025. While it was in committee, Rosen urged lawmakers to work together to help minors with the mental health challenges they face through an approach based on “acceptance and support.”

‘I need my voice.’ 
Rosen is declining a severance package on her way out the door because, she said, she felt that would silence her. 
“I don’t need severance,” Rosen said. “I need my voice.”
Now, she’s launching an LLC and hopes to start up a new nonprofit organization dedicated to social work advocacy. 
Her new organization, she said, is “for Kentucky social workers, by Kentucky social workers.”  
“This new LLC will be … the vehicle that I drive with all the good people that have worked hard to put stuff together” in the past, she said. “I can do advocacy. I can still get out and do some of the same things, because we have some pretty good relationships that we’re building into the next legislative session.”

For decades, growing polarization in Congress has made it harder to pass legislation through both chambers. This has led to a shift in governance: When Congress cannot or will not act, presidents increasingly turn to executive orders to move policy on their own. 
Presidents aren’t issuing more executive orders than before — actually, they’re signing fewer. The difference now is that executive orders are carrying the weight of major policy decisions that Congress would ordinarily debate and enact. It’s not the number of executive orders that has grown, but rather the power behind them.

In his first 100 days, Trump issued 147 executive orders, a record for any president in that period, while Congress passed only five bills into law, a record low. It seems rational that when Congress becomes paralyzed, the president takes action to implement the administration’s policy agenda. 
But consider the flip side: Allowing the executive to both make and enforce policy leads to a collapse in the separation of powers. Unilateral action may work around polarization, but it concentrates decision-making authority in one office.
The Trump administration has repeatedly seen executive orders end up in court. This shines a light on the strain that polarization has placed on the system of checks and balances: in a functioning system, Congress would negotiate and shape these policies; in actuality, the courts increasingly step in to review their legality.
Polarization at the federal level has grown so extreme that Congress now struggles to perform its basic governing functions. But the federal experience isn’t unique; states are grappling with their own versions of polarization.
Colorado is no exception. Our legislature is among the most polarized in the country. 
Take the state Legislature’s 2024 election results.
In the Colorado Senate, Democrats hold about 65% of the seats while winning 56% of the total votes. Republicans hold about 35% of the seats after winning 41% of the votes.
The Colorado House is more lopsided: Democrats hold about 71% of the seats even though they received 54% of the statewide vote. Republicans hold about 29% of the seats after receiving 45% of the vote.
This is a symptom of geographic sorting and winner-takes-all elections. Colorado’s urban districts are overwhelmingly Democratic, and its rural districts are overwhelmingly Republican. Even with fair maps, there simply aren’t enough competitive seats to make the overall legislature mirror the statewide electorate.
Colorado often leads the nation in democratic reforms, but if we want a legislature that reflects our electorate, we have to confront how winner-takes-all elections distort representation. With gridlock now the norm at the federal level, states need to take an honest look at their own governance.
States have long been laboratories of democracy, places where reforms can be tested before they scale nationally. If polarization weakens Congress’s ability to govern and leaves states like Colorado with legislatures that don’t accurately reflect the electorate, then the long-term fix starts with how we elect lawmakers — and with electoral rules that let a wider range of voter voices be represented.
One reform is proportional representation, in which parties win seats in proportion to the share of votes they receive, aligning seats with the actual statewide vote and giving all voters a meaningful share of representation.
Under our current winner-takes-all elections, political competition is squeezed into a rigid two-party system, failing to capture the full range of voters’ views. These systems worked reasonably well when polarization was lower, and the Democratic and Republican parties overlapped. But those conditions no longer exist.
In winner-takes-all systems, parties focus on firing up their base rather than appealing to the middle, because that’s how they win. That dynamic encourages polarization, weakens the political center, and makes compromise feel like party betrayal.
Proportional representation changes those incentives. Because every vote can contribute to a seat, parties must appeal to a wider set of voters, not just swing districts or partisan bases. That change could bring historically overlooked communities into the political process and produce policies that more closely match the diversity of public opinion.
Proportional representation strengthens accountability by giving voters real alternatives, so they’re not forced to stick with an underperforming incumbent simply because the other major party feels worse. And in a highly polarized society, proportional representation also reduces the impact of gerrymandering and encourages coalition-building and consensus. 
In an era where extreme polarization has weakened Congress and strengthened the presidency, proportional representation offers a way to rebuild representative government — and reduce the pressures pushing us toward executive dominance.

The outcome of the lawsuit could affect how all school divisions that receive federal funds must protect students’ civil rights. Loudoun schools declined to comment due to the pending litigation. 
The agency alleges that LCPS applied its Policy 8040, which requires students and faculty to accept and promote gender inclusivity, to two students the department identified as male Christians. The male students had said they felt “uncomfortable” in March after a student assigned female at birth changed clothes in a boys’ locker room and recorded the event.
LCPS suspended the boys for 10 days and ordered them to submit to a “Comprehensive Student Support Plan,” which the agency says further violates the boys’ right to free exercise of religion at school. The penalty was suspended after a federal judge granted a preliminary injunction in favor of the students, blocking the school division from enforcing the suspension while the court case proceeds and preventing the harassment finding from going on the students’ records.
“Students do not shed their First Amendment rights at the schoolhouse gate,” Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon said in a statement. “Loudoun County’s decision to advance and promote gender ideology tramples on the rights of religious students who cannot embrace ideas that deny biological reality.”
The case was a centerpiece of Republican gubernatorial candidate Winsome Earle-Sears’ campaign this year, after Gov. Glenn Youngkin directed the Office of the Attorney General to investigate the school system’s claims against the students in May.
Va. AG launches investigation into Loudoun schools after ‘uncomfortable’ boys’ locker room incident

By June, Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares announced that his office’s investigation had been referred to the U.S. Departments of Education and Justice for further review. His office described the school system’s actions as a “retaliatory Title IX investigation” targeting the three Stone Bridge High School students.
The U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights found that LCPS violated Title IX and retaliated against the male students by not handling sexual-harassment complaints equally.
Loudoun’s transgender-access policy, or Policy 8040, has been a source of contention since a 2021 bathroom assault case involving a male student who was found guilty of attacking two female students at different schools over six months. In the first incident, the male student was wearing a skirt when he assaulted a female student in a girls’ bathroom, although there’s no evidence that he identified as female.
Stone Bridge High School, one of the schools where the assaults took place, is where the latest locker room incident occurred. 
In 2023, Loudoun County Public Schools launched a pilot program to improve restroom privacy and safety. The initiative was designed to increase accessibility and provide students with the option of using multi-fixture, gender-specific restrooms or single-occupancy restrooms across all LCPS facilities. Stone Bridge was not included in the pilot.
Loudoun County Public Schools declined to comment due to pending litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.
 High-risk status

The school system’s prospect of losing federal funds can also be connected to a change the Department of Education made in August to how Loudoun County and four other school divisions would receive federal funds.
On Aug. 19, the Office of Civil Rights determined that five Virginia school divisions — Alexandria City, Arlington, Fairfax County, Loudoun County and Prince William County Public Schools — violated Title IX by allowing students to access sex-segregated facilities based on “gender identity” rather than biological sex through their respective transgender policies.
The Youngkin administration overhauled the transgender student model policies for all schools in Virginia, however, some like those in Northern Virginia opted not to accept them.
Since the school divisions rejected signing an agreement with the U.S. Department of Education to resolve the violations and rescind the policies, they were placed on “high-risk” status, with the condition that all federal funding they would receive be done by reimbursement only.
In August, the agency halted giving money for financial assistance to the districts.

(Courtesy Photo)Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger on Tuesday tapped transportation expert Nick Donohue as Virginia’s next transportation secretary, selecting the VCU graduate to help steer her administration’s policies over the next four years.
Spanberger’s pick comes as she pushes an agenda focused on improving affordability, expanding opportunity and growing Virginia’s economy — work unfolding amid new federal policy shifts that have created uncertainty in long-term transportation funding.
The former deputy transportation secretary was recently heavily involved in developing a funding plan to create a new revenue stream to stabilize Metro service in Northern Virginia, support long-term investments and give jurisdictions, including Virginia, greater budget certainty.
“To strengthen our economy long into the future, we need to make sure Virginia has efficient infrastructure that allows families to get to work and school, businesses to transport their goods, and travelers to see all that the commonwealth has to offer,” Spanberger said in a statement. 
In announcing Donohue, she added that “Virginians deserve a visionary leader who understands the vital role that our transportation network plays in building a stronger, safer, and more prosperous commonwealth.” She said his range of experience will help Virginia tackle transit challenges,  improve network reliability and prepare for new opportunities ahead.
Donohue, a Richmond native and Virginia Commonwealth University graduate, said he’s honored by the nomination. He has worked with state lawmakers and three former governors on transportation policy, including Interstate 81 and the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority.
He also helped modernize and expand mobility options such as Amtrak and Virginia Railway Express, and developed the SMART SCALE funding prioritization process for localities across the state.
“Transportation is ultimately about opportunity, connecting people to jobs, education, and the communities they call home,” Donohue said. “I am committed to ensuring every investment we make strengthens those connections.”
Spanberger’s inauguration will take place in Richmond on Jan. 17, just days after the start of the 2026 General Assembly Session. She will replace Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who is prohibited by law from seeking a second consecutive term.

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)The Maryland State Board of Education is considering changes to its current school rating system, that critics say does not show student growth — but a rollout may not happen for another two years.
The board reviewed a report Tuesday from the Accountability Advisory Committee that recommends eliminating the current star system. School leaders have also said the system, which give schools from one to four stars, does not adequately describe the quality of a school and shortchanges schools with a large number of low-income students, which don’t earn as many stars as schools with students from higher-income families.
The discussion comes as the state’s annual report card, released last month, showed a third straight year of slight improvements, with 43% of schools earning four or five stars in the 2024-25 school year. That’s up from 41% in 2023-24.
“We’re taking a very deliberate approach on this,” school board President Joshua Michael said during a meeting Tuesday, who said a roll out of a new system may not happen until the 2027-28 school year.
Several recommendations were offered in the committee’s report that include rating schools with a common 1-4 scale that most states use, said Scott Marion, with the National Center for the Improvement of Educational Assessment. An example of a chart shows indicator scores would be converted into performance levels.

“Instead of you trying to figure out a student average, you could look and say, ‘Oh, one [student’s] a level three. One’s a level two,” Marion said. “Whenever you draw a line, somebody’s just over the line and somebody’s just below the line, but it does help in communication.”
Another recommendation is to show student achievement in the lower-performing schools to be called an “opportunity measure,” which would evaluate students who received the lowest test scores one year but showed growth in the following year.
“If you incentivize this in certain ways, schools will get points for it,” Marion said.
Several board members accentuated that point.
“I would always think about two things: What is the performance of the system itself versus the performance of the student in that system?” Board member James C. Bell Jr. said. “Being able to address both of those things at the same time I think will make a great accountability system.”
Another recommendation is to create a standing advisory committee to address ongoing implementation and continuous improvement decisions. Board member Xiomara Medina said stakeholders such as those from student services and special education would be a part of that committee.
Paul Lemle, president of the Maryland State Education Association, said the state should switch from the star system to the “descriptive model” used in Massachusetts. He said that model reduces stigma and supports targeted interventions aligned with continuous improvement.
“The current star system lends itself to oversimplification and indeed weaponization, perpetuating segregation and disinvestment in our communities,” Lemle said to the board. “These labels distort public perception and they place pressure on schools to focus on boosting ratings rather than meeting student needs.”
A final report is expected to be presented next month.
No school on MLK Day
The board unanimously voted to reject requests from Garrett and Queen Anne’s counties to have their public school students attend classes on Jan. 19, Martin Luther King Jr. Day, a recognized state and federal holiday when schools and government offices are closed.

The superintendents from those two counties made the request after their schools were closed due to inclement weather, on Dec. 2 in Garrett County and Dec. 5 in Queen Anne’s.
According to letters from both jurisdictions, 2025-26 school year calendars were approved earlier this year for two other make-up weather days on Feb. 16 (Presidents Day) and April 6.
“This provides an opportunity to recover instructional time prior to state assessments and national assessments, such as AP exams. This day will be beneficial for our students and teachers,” Garrett County Superintendent Brenda E. McCartney wrote in a Dec. 2 letter.
Teresa Dantzler, the state Department of Education’s ombudsman, said the last time Maryland students went to school on the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday was during the 2011-12 school year.
“So, this would be the first time in over 10 years that students in Maryland would attend school on Martin Luther King Day? I have great concern with that,” Michael said.
Board Vice President Monica Goldson, a former CEO of Prince George’s County Public Schools, said make-up days usually begin in February. She said the state board did approve a waiver to let Queen Anne’s County schools remain open on Presidents Day this year, after schools closed there due to inclement weather.
“I’m trying to put my former superintendent’s hat on and not cut them off at the knees,” she said. “I just think it was extremely too early to begin to start to take days away and then to set a precedent that has not been done in more than 10 years.”
The board also voted to invite local school leaders who want to request and schedule make-up days during this school year to attend the board’s Jan. 27 meeting.
The board also directed Superintendent Carey Wright to inform local superintendents that the state board’s “strong preference” is to not schedule any make-up days for this school year and beyond on the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday.

Rising utility prices are increasingly drawing scrutiny from state regulators and lawmakers. (Photo by AnnMarie Hilton/Maine Morning Star)The last time the Maine Public Utilities Commission considered an electricity price hike, the proposal received fewer than 90 comments from the public.
Three years later, amid skyrocketing energy prices, more than 800 people weighed in on the plan, showing up to public hearings and even protesting outside.
The commission last month ultimately rejected the proposal that would have raised bills by about $35 per month for customers of Central Maine Power, the state’s largest electricity provider. In explaining the denial, Commission Chair Philip Bartlett cited growing energy costs.
“There’s no question that affordability is increasingly an issue, not just with respect to electricity prices, but across the entire economy,” Bartlett told Stateline. “And people are feeling enormous pressure.”
Rising utility prices are increasingly drawing scrutiny from state regulators and lawmakers nationwide. Given the public outcry, many state leaders are considering rate freezes, additional energy assistance funds or new rates targeting large energy users such as data centers. But states only have so much control; regulators say they can’t change the fundamental market dynamics that will likely continue to push prices up.
Between January and September of this year, average home electricity rates increased 11.7% — more than triple the rate of inflation, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, which represents state employees administering federal energy assistance programs. Average electric bills increased nearly 30% between 2021 and 2025, climbing from $121 to $156 per month.
Many low-income households have long struggled to cover utility bills. Now, advocates say, high prices are affecting a growing swath of the middle class.
Utility prices played a major role in recent Democratic gubernatorial wins in New Jersey and Virginia. And in Georgia, Democrats flipped two seats on the board that regulates public utilities —  the first time Democrats won statewide constitutional office in nearly two decades.
Most consumers get their electricity from utilities that must seek state consent for rate changes, with appointed or elected state boards approving price structures.
In Washington state, Ann Rendahl, one of three members of the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission, said state utility regulators always consider affordability when making rate decisions. Now those deliberations have attracted much more public and political scrutiny.
“We’re hearing from more and more people,” she said. “I think it’s becoming more of a concern politically as well as legislatures and governors hear about this.”
Prices have been affected by a multitude of factors: Russia’s war in Ukraine, which has disrupted global oil and gas supplies; extreme weather events; and rising demand driven by the artificial intelligence boom and energy-intensive data centers have all played a role.
Major utility providers say they are focused on keeping electricity affordable and reliable. They point to massive upgrades to the grid as a primary driver of rising prices.
While state attention on the issue is growing, experts see no immediate relief in sight for consumers.
In Maine, a separate rate increase request will likely come before regulators soon. And the Maine Public Utilities Commission recently approved a supply price increase estimated to raise customer bills by $13 to $17 a month.
In Florida, regulators just approved a $6.9 billion rate increase for the state’s largest utility, which opponents said was the largest hike in state history. The typical bill will rise by $2.50 per month to $136.64 next year. But because of other recent rate increases, the average customer will pay hundreds of dollars more each year than they did in 2021, when the typical monthly bill was $101.70, The Associated Press reported.
Amid rising demand, the consultant firm ICF predicts U.S. residential customers could see electricity rates increase 15% to 40% by 2030, with some rates doubling by 2050.
“Like everything else, I think [utility] costs are not going down,” said Rendahl, who is also president of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, which represents state public service commissioners.
‘We can’t take it anymore’
While running her successful campaign for governor of New Jersey, Democrat Mikie Sherrill, then a U.S. House member, pledged she would declare a state of emergency on her first day to freeze utility rates.
“My priority is relief to New Jersey consumers, and I will bring everyone to the table to deliver it,” she said in September. Sherrill takes office in January, but many experts question how much she can do to lower prices.
Regulators there had already issued $100 utility bill credits to provide relief for all customers, the New Jersey Monitor reported.
“This should be helpful for people, but in no way solves the problem,” Zenon Christodoulou, a member of the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities, said in August.
President Donald Trump has dismissed broader affordability concerns as “a con job” by Democrats. But Republican state officials have underscored the growing strain of electric bills.

Months before Democrats in Georgia attracted national attention for winning election to the utility board, GOP lawmakers there were raising concerns about the growing data center industry and had proposed legislation to protect ratepayers.
In September, Indiana Republican Gov. Mike Braun directed his newly appointed consumer advocate to dive into rising electricity bills, specifically targeting utility profits. The governor said utility investors, not ratepayers, should bear more of the pain of rising prices.
“We can’t take it anymore,” Braun said in a news release.
Infrastructure updates increase costs
In justifying rising prices, utility companies have pointed to a wave of massive investments in the electric grid. Utilities are on track to spend $208 billion this year, according to the Edison Electric Institute, which represents the nation’s investor-owned electric utilities.
Members of that group, which provide power to 250 million Americans, are projected to make capital expenditures of more than $1.1 trillion between 2025 and 2029.
Drew Maloney, president and CEO of the institute, told Stateline in a statement that the nation’s electric companies are focused on keeping electricity as “reliable and as affordable as possible” by “making essential investments to lower costs and protect America’s most important machine—the U.S. electric grid.”
But utility companies have “perverse incentives” to drive up capital expenses, said David Pomerantz, executive director of the nonprofit Energy and Policy Institute, a watchdog group tracking fossil fuel and utility industries.










What they're allowed to charge customers is usually set by a group of three or five people.


– David Pomerantz, executive director of the nonprofit Energy and Policy Institute


Utilities are ensured a certain return on their capital investments, which he said can push them to spend heavily on projects that provide questionable benefits. State commissions set a rate of return for energy projects aimed at ensuring utilities can attract investors. That gives states an enormous amount of influence over prices, Pomerantz said.
“At the risk of sounding a little flip about this, it’s actually a lot easier for utilities than it is for, say, grocery prices,” he said. “What they’re allowed to charge customers is usually set by a group of three or five people.”
While politicians increasingly acknowledge the strain of rising utility costs, Pomerantz said it’s unclear whether state leaders will actually lower utility profits to provide relief for customers.
“Democrats and Republicans suddenly realize they have a crisis on their hands, and so the rhetoric has changed a lot in just the last few months,” he said. “It’s good rhetoric, but is anything different going to happen?”
More households struggle with bills
As bills have increased, many residents have fallen behind.
An analysis of consumer credit data from the left-leaning groups Century Foundation and Protect Borrowers found about 1 in 20 households — some 14 million Americans — had utility bills at least 90 days past due in June.
Between March 2022 and June 2025, the report found average overdue balances climbed from $597 to $789.
“It’s a real source of financial anxiety for working people who are trying to figure out how to stay warm in Wisconsin or not die from heat stroke in Arizona,” said Mike Pierce, executive director of Protect Borrowers, an organization originally founded to advocate for student loan borrowers.
Pierce said the growing utility debt speaks to wider financial concerns across the country, as overall household debt balloons.
“Our theory of the case here is that Americans are struggling, which is the same thing Americans will tell you when you talk to them,” he said.
Trump has crushed offshore wind plans, but states haven’t quite given up hope

The federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, commonly known as LIHEAP, has faced multiple threats from the Trump administration, which sought to eliminate its funding, fired top agency staff and withheld pledged funds. But amid rising political pressure, the federal government did release those funds last month.
While that’s good news for many households, the buying power of the program has significantly decreased because of rising energy prices, said Mark Wolfe, an energy economist and executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, which represents state LIHEAP directors.
Many liberal-led states have their own supplementary energy assistance programs, Wolfe noted. Lawmakers in some states have sought to boost those programs. Oregon, for instance, this year doubled its assistance fund from $20 to $40 million.
“It happened pretty quickly,” Wolfe said of the rising prices. “So it’s not just poor families who are struggling to pay their electric bill.”

(Photo by HUD Office of Public Affairs)Weeks after releasing guidelines restricting the use of federal funds addressing homelessness, the Trump administration is pulling back.
On Monday, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development said it was withdrawing its controversial November guidance around “Continuum of Care” grants, after organizations distributing the funding said it would cause a funding cut and 20 states filed a lawsuit. The federal government told a federal court it is revising those guidelines to address that lawsuit and that it will reissue them soon. 
Now, the New Hampshire organizations that receive that funding say they are again facing uncertainty. 
“We’re just remaining in limbo, waiting for information,” said Jennifer Chisholm, executive director of the New Hampshire Coalition to End Homelessness. 
The move by HUD Monday paused what has been a turbulent process. 
Federal Continuum of Care grants have been allocated to help shelter and house homeless people since 2009, though an earlier version of the program dates to the 1987 McKinney-Venti Homeless Assistance Act. 
New Hampshire has three Continuum of Care organizations that distribute that funding; one covering Manchester, one covering Nashua, and a third covering the rest of the state run by the Department of Health and Human Services. 
In January, under President Joe Biden, HUD allocated $14.1 million to New Hampshire. The program allows organizations to use the money to acquire, rehabilitate, construct, and lease homes to those who need housing, and can provide rental assistance and supportive services to prevent homelessness. 
Typically, HUD issues an annual “notice of funding opportunity” that details the criteria for how the grants may be spent and how to apply.
But on Nov. 13, HUD released that guidance with major changes. It said it would end the practice under the Biden administration of guaranteeing 90% of the funding to existing Continuum of Care organizations and opening the remaining 10% to competitive bids. Instead, HUD said just 30% of the funding would go to those organizations and the other 70% would be sent out to bid.
The agency also said it would prioritize funding for temporary, transitional housing for homeless people, and would discourage the permanent supported housing for which recipients have traditionally used the money.
For the organizations distributing the funding, the November rules threatened many existing programs. 
Before this year’s proposed changes, Nashua’s Continuum of Care received part of the 90% guaranteed portion of the total funding and spent most of it on long-term housing. That has allowed Harbor Care, the organization that runs the Continuum of Care, to support permanent housing for 65 people, said Henry Och, the organization’s CEO.
But by dropping the share of guaranteed funding from 90% to 30%, the proposed HUD guidance would have meant Harbor Care could keep only 15 of those 65 in permanent housing. 
To get federal funding for the other 50 people, Harbor Care would have needed to apply for a portion of the 70% competitively bid share, Och said. And to have a chance of winning such a bid, the organization would have needed to designate that housing as temporary, not permanent, he added. 
Under that approach, those 50 people would lose that housing within two years, Och said. 
“Then we’d have to figure something out with other community partners to find another housing solution for them, because then that transitional housing period for them would expire, meaning that that slot would open up for somebody else to come in and fill it up,” he said. 
In announcing the November changes, HUD officials said the policy shift was meant to decrease long-term reliance on the federal government for housing. The new administration criticized the Biden administration’s approach, known as “Housing First” calling the program a “self-sustaining slush fund.” 
“Roughly 90% of the last four years CoC awards funneled funding to support the failed ‘Housing First’ ideology, which encourages dependence on endless government handouts while neglecting to address the root causes of homelessness, including illicit drugs and mental illness,” read the HUD announcement.
But Och said the Housing First method was meant to address people’s homelessness directly before starting other interventions.
“The basic premise is that the primary step in getting people up on their feet is to put a roof over their head and then work from there,” he said. “And I think that’s at the root of some of these changes.” 
In response to the new guidance, attorneys general in 20 Democratic-led states sued HUD, claiming that it was placing unlawful conditions on funds already allocated by Congress. 
New Hampshire Gov. Kelly Ayotte publicly opposed the homelessness funding changes. But she declined to request Attorney General John Formella to join the Democrats’ lawsuit, saying at a press conference last week that she preferred to use political channels over legal channels to influence the Trump administration. 
On Tuesday, Ayotte praised the withdrawal of the guidelines and touted her advocacy. “I expressed my deep concerns to HUD about the impact their proposed changes would have on New Hampshire, and I’m glad to hear they withdrew their notice so these concerns can be addressed,” she said in a statement. “We will continue to advocate for the organizations working to reduce homelessness in our state.”
It is not clear when the new guidelines will appear. The earlier HUD guidelines had established a mid-January application deadline. HUD announced Monday it would release the updated notice of funding opportunity before that deadline. 
And New Hampshire organizations are wondering how much the guidelines might change. 
“We’re still trying to figure out what all of this means,” Och said. 
Chisholm said the uncertainty is especially acute in New Hampshire, which has fewer state-led funding backstops than other states.
“I am carrying the torch of hope,” she said. “We’re hoping that they will take this opportunity to address the concerns that have been very strongly voiced across the nation.”
Lauren Bombardier, vice president of community relations at Families In Transition, which runs the Continuum of Care for Manchester, said the organization is “closely monitoring the situation and awaiting further direction on the next steps.”
Jake Leon, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services, referred questions about the state’s approach to the changes to the governor’s office. 
To Chisholm, the waiting is nothing new. 
“This has kind of been the conversation for a while now. People will pose us a question about, like, ‘Well, what does this mean?’ We’re not sure.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/HUD-building-1024x621.jpg,,,2025-12-10 05:57:21.260519

EDITOR’S NOTE — This story includes discussion of suicide. If you or someone you know needs help, the national suicide and crisis lifeline in the U.S. is available by calling or texting 988. There is also an online chat at 988lifeline.org
As farmers face historic headwinds and market hardships, calls to the national Farm Aid hotline and the Iowa Concern hotline — where farmers can get support in times of mental health crisis or need — are increasing.
This fall the Iowa Concern hotline saw four to five times the number of calls it had in the same months last year, said Tammy Jacobs, the hotline’s manager.
The Farm Aid hotline is also seeing a change in the urgency of calls.
“We’re seeing more established farmers calling in — people who know how to play the game and how to access programs. They’re calling more often now, because even with all that institutional knowledge, they’re still running into issues for the first time that are more complex and difficult to solve,” said Lori Mercer, a Farm Aid hotline operator. “The system that’s in place is simply letting them down. There’s just no further safety net.” 
Research shows farmers die by suicide at least twice as often as people in the general population, so there’s urgency to address the uptick in need. 
“It’s a huge issue. I mean, we’ve known at least three families this year whose loved ones died by suicide,” said Emma Yerkey, who’s part of the Ag Chapter of Gray Matters, a monthly meetup for ag producers around the Quad Cities to talk about their struggles.
Farmers experience a lot of stressors and uncertainty that they can’t control — isolation, weather changes, and financial pressures — along with low access to mental health care in rural areas and stigma that may make them keep their pain to themselves. Market conditions made worse by a trade war and inflation are adding to the stress. Mental health professionals are thinking outside the box to get producers care. 
Understanding the stress
Yerkey’s family farms corn, soybeans, and hay in Geneseo, Illinois on land they’ve owned since the Civil War. The farm is filled with memories, especially of her dad, Tim Yerkey. 
She played baseball with him in their driveway, the family ate meals together in the home, and, one year, her father helped her raise a ribbon-winning calf. 
“That was a really good memory that I have with him,” said Yerkey.
But the farm could be stressful, too. Tim Yerkey worked the land with his family, but at times had to take outside jobs to make ends meet. In 2011, he’d been struggling for about a year when spring floods left fields underwater. He’d reached out to friends and visited the emergency room seeking help, only to be told there were no beds, Yerkey said. He died by suicide in June 2011. 
“I miss my dad, and I don’t want anybody else—or any other family—to go through that,” Yerkey said.

But many farming families experience similar pain. Between 2003 and 2017, more than 1600 farmers died by suicide, the majority older white men.  
Experts say factors that contribute to stress and higher suicide rates among farmers include isolation, easy access to guns, a cultural expectation of toughness, stigma around seeking mental health care, worries about who will take over the farm, and a lack of recognition for their hard work.
Financial losses and stress are also significant risks for depressive symptoms. And right now, times are tough for farmers. 
Producers have endured high inflation and growing input costs on farms since at least 2020. The spread of COVID and, more recently, policy decisions like President Trump’s tariffs and increases in immigration enforcement have all increased operating costs. At the same time, prices for major commodities are low — lower than the cost to grow them. Corn prices are about $0.85 below the break even point and soybeans are about $2 below. 
This year, many states are expecting a record corn crop, but farmers aren’t celebrating.
“It’s very discouraging for farmers to think that they’ve done all the things right in their fields and have put innovations in place and made good decisions, but yet, even with strong yields, they’re gonna be facing a loss on what they’re producing,” said Aaron Lehman, president of the Iowa Farmers Union.
In 2024, the U.S. exported about 42% of its soybeans, most of it to China. With China not buying in the midst of the trade war some farmers who usually send their crop abroad have struggled to find new markets. The U.S. in November struck a new deal with China, potentially extending a lifeline to producers still scrambling to move their harvest, but it remains to be seen what China will actually buy.
Some programs that helped connect farmers to domestic markets, like the Local Food Purchase Assistance initiative, have also been cut by the USDA. 
“Since the beginning of the year, the farmers have just been thrown into a different level of uncertainty with policy things like losing access to some markets through tariffs, losing access to staff and programming with the government shutdown, and the funding freezes. A big one we’re hearing about is losing access to labor with the ICE raids, etcetera,” said Mercer, with Farm Aid. “I was just speaking to a farmer the other day who was basically watching his crops rot on the vines because his usual labor support was just too afraid to show up this year.” 
In addition to all of the financial stress, farmers say they feel the work can be thankless. 
“This work is incredibly hard, and nobody understands where their food comes from. Nobody knows that [farmers] work 20 hours a day so that they can have a strawberry,” said Anna Scheyett, a retired professor of social work who studied farmer stress and suicide at the University of Georgia.

Meeting farmers where they’re at
Despite the many struggles, some families are finding hope and community in turbulent times. To honor her dad, Yerkey joined the new Ag Chapter of Gray Matters, a Quad Cities nonprofit that provides mental health resources, education, and safe spaces 
Gray Matters hosts monthly Barn Talks, where participants can share what’s weighing on them, whether it’s stress, depression, anxiety, or other struggles, and receive support from others. The organizers hope to build a sense of community and normalize talking about mental health. 
“Feeling comfortable and safe to say that — ‘Hey, I am stressed out, or I am really hurting right now. Maybe I am depressed, maybe I have some anxiety,’ — whatever it might be,” said Heather Gritton, one of the group leaders.
Offering spaces where farmers can meet and take some of that load off their shoulders can help break down the stigma around getting help, said Sara Kohlbeck, assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral medicine at the Medical College of Wisconsin. 
It’s key for those spaces to be easily accessible to farmers. 
“Bringing that support to the farmers—or to the rural communities—rather than expecting those folks to come and get those resources for themselves is really important,” said Kohlbeck. “Otherwise, you know, we’ve got folks that are kind of suffering in silence because they just don’t have the time. Sometimes there’s stigma, and there’s kind of that pride issue.” 
There are also practical barriers. Telehealth isn’t a viable option for many farmers, as cell and internet reception in rural areas are limited. Driving long distances to see a counselor can also be impractical, especially during the busy harvest season. 
Another approach to reaching farmers has been to train people who farmers trust and regularly interact with — such as suppliers, lenders, large animal veterinarians, and spouses — to recognize when someone may be dealing with mental health challenges and teach them how to support them and direct them to resources. 
For example, Scheyett has trained agricultural lenders to recognize warning signs of suicide ideation and taught them how to respond. She’s also trained extension agents to take a few minutes at the beginning of agricultural production meetings to talk about stress and offer resources, something she says can make a real difference for farmers.
In one study, Scheyett and her co-authors found that farmers who were present at meetings where about 10 minutes were dedicated to talking about stress management walked away with new ideas for managing stress and a higher level of commitment to doing it. 
Sometimes, offering practical and logistical solutions to big problems can be a part of mental health services, too. 
“If a farmer has not really looked and done a deep dive into their farm financial system, we have a program that’s called farm financial associates, and they’ll come out to the farm, do a big evaluation over the farming operation to see where the hard points are and is there a way to switch things around, diversify, in order to help offset some of the farming losses and costs,” Jacobs, with the Iowa Concern hotline, said.
For farmers facing grain storage challenges, Jacobs suggested partnering with other farmers as an alternative to traditional co-op arrangements.
Scheyett suggests everybody can help by thanking farmers the same way we do with the military.
“Every time I see a farmer, I say thank you — thank you for your service, because what you do keeps us healthy, fed, and clothed,” said Scheyett.
It’s all in the hopes of providing care and saving lives.
“Even if you can save one life, I mean, that’s so worth it,” said Yerkey. “I feel very passionate about it.” 
Farmers can reach out to the 988 Lifeline or 1-800-FARM-AID for help. Help is also available in Spanish.
The Iowa Concern hotline is available 24/7 via chat, email, call, or text at 800-447-1985.

(Photo via NOAA)Years of underfunding and new delays in federal grantmaking threaten buoys and ocean monitoring assets run by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) that protect fishermen, cargo ships and endangered species across the country. With key grant deadlines now passed and new awards still pending, regional operators warn that some of those services could go dark at the peak of hurricane season.

This article originally appeared on Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment. Sign up for their newsletter here.

	In the Northeast Channel, where warm, salty Gulf Stream waters collide with frigid meltwater from the Arctic, sensors that hung from a buoy like ornaments on a tree were stationed at the entrance to the Gulf of Maine. The sensors fed scientists and forecasters rare data from one of the Atlantic’s strangest crossroads.
But in 2022, the buoy’s operator, the Northeast Regional Association of Coastal Ocean Observing Systems (NERACOOS), was forced to pull it from the water as stagnant federal funding made routine servicing impossible. Faced with hard choices, the group prioritized buoys closer to shore that are more critical for marine safety over the Northeast Channel buoy, which primarily supported research.
Unlike many NOAA programs, the Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS)—“the eyes of our ocean,” a network of regional associations that collect and track ocean data—enjoys bipartisan support in Congress. But year after year, federal appropriations have fallen short of what the program needs to properly service and maintain its buoys, sensors, gliders and other equipment.
After the program was authorized by the congress in 2009, an independent study found that the program would need about $715 million to deliver on lawmakers’ vision. Since that study, the most the program has received is $42.5 million—a level it has effectively been stuck at for years.
That number was always ambitious and would require slow, steady growth, according to Kristen Yarincik, executive director of the IOOS Association, a nonprofit organization that represents the 11 regional IOOS associations. But flat funding in recent years, combined with inflation and rising equipment costs, has made routine servicing and upgrades increasingly difficult.
This year, federal appropriations may offer some relief, matching the IOSS Association’s $56 million request—but only if the money actually moves on time. IOOS regions operate on five-year cooperative agreements with NOAA; the current agreements, covering 2021–2026, end on June 30 for most regions.
IOOS sources say the next round of funding may be delayed by new layers of federal review within the Department of Commerce and the Office of Management and Budget. The situation is further complicated by the fact that Congress has not passed a full-year appropriations package, leaving agencies to operate under the president’s budget proposal, which zeroes out IOOS.
“It’s so important that Congress finalize a full-year appropriations package for 2026 as soon as possible,” said U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree (D-Maine), a member of the House Committee on Appropriations. “Both the House and the Senate have proposed a funding increase for IOOS Regional Observations, and it’s my sincere hope that both chambers will push the Administration to adopt these spending levels.”
Regional associations say they need to submit proposals by the end of January. Because Notice of Funding Opportunities (NOFOs) to federal contractors are legally required to stay open for about 60 days, they need to have been published by the end of November to avoid problems next summer, according to Yarincik. “After that, the timeline, and therefore continuity of data collection, becomes at risk,” she said.
As of early December, those NOFOs still have not been released. The question now is how long awards will be delayed, and how long a funding gap may persist come July.
Once proposals are submitted, NOAA must still review, negotiate, and approve awards—a process that has been slowing under new rules requiring the secretary of commerce, Howard Lutnick, to personally sign off on grants over $100,000.
“They are a ways behind on this,” said Jake Kritzer, executive director of NERACOOS. According to Kritzer and Yarincik, NOFOs are typically published a year before the start date, making this round more than six months late. If a funding gap arises because of the delay, it would only exacerbate problems IOOS regional associations are already struggling with.
In the Northeast, buoys lobstermen and cargo ships rely on are starting to show their age, Kritzer said. “Think of it like a car,” he said. “It may last ten or twenty years, but over time the maintenance becomes more and more expensive.” And replacing an old buoy requires even more money up front.
While the Gulf of Maine has lost a number of buoys, those that remain aren’t being serviced frequently enough. Buoys that should be serviced five times a year may see only a single visit, according to Kritzer. As sensors float at different depths, salt and biofouling buildup can degrade data quality, and sometimes the instruments go dark for hours or even days.

“If one of our buoys goes offline, I hear about it from fishermen before our data guys or sensor technicians,” Kritzer said. “What that tells me is that even a short outage really affects people.”
Fishermen use subsurface temperature data to find the most cost-effective places to fish and rely even more on IOOS data to decide whether it’s safe to leave the dock at all.
“Maine lobstermen monitor the buoy readings and NERACOOS data products daily to understand sea conditions, make informed decisions about when it is safe to leave the dock, and be prepared for the conditions they will face at sea,” the Maine Lobstermen’s Association (MLA) said in a statement. “It directly impacts their ability to determine whether or not it is safe to go fishing.”
The association also noted that NERACOOS data helps protect lobster populations and other sea life, including endangered whales, from human impacts. Sensors that monitor algal blooms and zooplankton help ensure lobsters have enough prey to feed on. Water-quality monitoring tracks pollution that can harm marine life. And acoustic monitoring systems help keep ships away from migrating whales.
Cargo ships depend on that same real-time wave and wind data to plan safe transit in and out of port, avoid dangerous seas and reduce costly delays. “Congress and NOAA should continue to fund and efficiently administer the IOOS and other navigation programs for the safe and efficient operations of our maritime industry,” said a representative from the American Association of Port Authorities.
IOOS data supplements the National Weather Service’s own observation networks, sharpening coastal forecasts for local communities. The National Weather Service can still draw on its radars, satellites and other federal, military and private data, but IOOS-backed tide gauges and wave buoys help monitor flood risk and storm surge—data that allows emergency management to make more informed decisions.
IOOS officials warn that if regional systems go dark, many coastal forecasts would become less precise and less locally tuned.
But the work that allows lobstermen to empty their traps, cargo ships to safely reach port, and coastal communities to get accurate flood warnings depends on steady funding.
Supplementary funding sources can help keep IOOS regions afloat if a funding gap is realized, but IOOS leaders warn even a one- to two-month lapse in federal support could delay maintenance and force key services to go dark.
If that happens, Yarincik said, “the availability of real-time data and accuracy of data products will be reduced, at a minimum, and this will impact navigational safety for commercial shipping, fishermen and recreational boaters; local flood monitoring for coastal communities; and weather forecasting, especially for hurricane intensity forecasts.”
IOOS helps supply the water-temperature data forecasters use to gauge how intense hurricanes may become. A funding gap next summer could hit just as hurricane season reaches its height, leaving lives and entire coastal communities vulnerable.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/NOAA-buoy-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-10 05:57:21.260519

Grubb and Francisco Valle (from left to right) during cross examination at a Georgia Public Service Commission hearing in Atlanta on Oct. 22, 2025. Alander RochaThe Georgia Public Service Commission is set to hold final hearings this week on Georgia Power’s request to approve nearly 10,000 megawatts of new energy capacity.
The request, which the utility argues is needed for reliability and economic growth, will likely come to a final vote later this month after commissioners hear from several groups, including environmental advocates, Georgia Power and commission staff, which is recommending the panel sign off on a smaller increase. Critics said the utility’s plan could burden ratepayers with future bill increases to pay for projected data center growth that may not materialize.
Georgia Power and environmental groups have clashed over who should bear the risk associated with the unprecedented energy demand forecast, which is heavily influenced by an explosion of proposed data centers across the state.
Matthew Kent, spokesperson for Georgia Power, defended the utility’s proposal, arguing that the full 9,900 megawatts are not just needed to support energy-hungry data centers. Kent said the added capacity would also help fill the gap left by expiring contracts while having backup power.

“Staff’s recommendation would significantly inhibit Georgia Power’s ability to contract with new large load customers, stifle economic development growth in Georgia, compromise the efforts the Company and Commission have taken to ensure industry-leading reliability, and reduce the opportunity to place downward pressure on rates for all customers,” Kent said in a statement.
Kent said the utility’s forecast is already materializing, citing contracts representing nearly 2,000 megawatts of energy that he said have been signed in the last six months. 
But critics of the plan, including PSC staff and advocates, warn that approving the full request, which is about five Hoover Dams’ worth of power according to the Southern Environmental Law Center, would expose customers to more potential bill increases, especially if the expected surge in data centers fizzles. If approved in its entirety, Georgia Power customers’ energy bills could increase by $20 per month, according to PSC staff tasked with representing utility consumers.
The staff recommended the commission certify about one-third of Georgia Power’s request, just over 3,000 megawatts of power. This is based on the capacity needed to serve existing contracts and would provide a 305-megawatt cushion for additional data center growth. 
The staff also recommends conditional approval for another 4,298 megawatts of resources, which includes two proposed natural gas plants. The condition would require Georgia Power to secure signed contracts with new data center customers before the commission approves the buildout costs, which could then be passed on to residential customers.
Bob Sherrier, a lawyer with the Southern Environmental Law Center representing environmental groups, said the compromise proposed by commission staff could help limit the risk that costs associated with building energy infrastructure are passed on to customers if demand from data centers doesn’t fully materialize.
“We’re not going to certify them, guarantee they show up on bills, until Georgia Power signs a contract for a data center customer, to show there’s a real need for that power,” Sherrier said.

The upcoming vote comes after a consequential election in which two incumbent commissioners lost their seats to Democrats who campaigned on energy affordability, blasting the commission’s approval of a series of Georgia Power rate increases. A petition by environmental groups to delay this month’s vote until the two new commissioners are seated in January was denied by the current commission, which is composed of five Republicans.
Environmental advocates are also pushing back against allowing new natural gas plants, which typically have long lifespans.
Isabella Ariza, an attorney with the Sierra Club, said that the cost of building these plants could be passed on to customers for decades. Ariza said the Sierra Club is highly critical of this long-term commitment because it’s based on “a speculative and inflated load forecast” and that the gas plants are “not cost-effective.”
“Our expert found that McIntosh is the most expensive gas plant that’s being built in the United States,” Ariza said, referring to a facility near Savannah.
Interveners argue that Georgia Power should prioritize lower-risk, cleaner, and more flexible resources, such as battery storage and solar-plus-storage projects that store excess daytime energy for use at night.
Ariza said that battery storage is “more cost-effective” and has a “much shorter lifespan.” This shorter 20-year lifespan is preferred because if “all of these data centers decide to leave the state in 10 or 15 years at best, then the ratepayers won’t get stuck with the bill for an additional couple of decades.”
Stephen Smith, executive director of Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, argued Georgia Power is prioritizing shareholder profits over consumer interests by not pursuing renewable, cost-effective energy, likely because he argued the utility stands to benefit financially from natural gas rather than green energy.
“Solar and storage are not only the most cost-effective, but they’re also ones that can be deployed usually quicker than the fossil gas generation,” Smith said.
Doha Medani, organizing director for Georgia Conservation Voters Education Fund, framed the massive build-out proposal in terms of kitchen-table economics.
“The decisions that are made today are going to impact people for years and years to come, and so it’s our hope that the commissioners will listen to what people have put forth,” Medani said, pointing to Georgia’s recent election.

Some advocates are citing families' fears of immigration enforcement.,"For the first time in over a decade, the number of English language learners enrolled in Connecticut public schools fell this October, and some advocates are attributing the decline to families’ fears of immigration enforcement tactics.
Since 2014, English language learners have been one of the only groups with increasing enrollment, even as the number of total students across the state fell. And aside from 2020, when there was a dip from 2019 enrollment, the number of English language learners enrolling in Connecticut schools has increased by thousands of students each year.
But this year, districts saw major drops, totaling more than 2,000 students statewide, according to preliminary enrollment numbers. Hartford alone saw 365 fewer English language learners enroll, with Danbury and New Haven experiencing similar drops. Seymour saw the largest increase in English language learner enrollment out of all public districts — but it was only 21 more students compared to last year.
Michael Morton, the deputy executive director for communications and operations at the School and State Finance Project, a nonprofit nonpartisan policy organization in Connecticut, said these preliminary numbers are concerning.
“[It’s] a very significant drop,” Morton said. “For a population that has continuously increased, and for a lot of districts been the only demographic increasing, to see a decline is … impactful because presumably those students are just not going to school for a variety of reasons, fear being one of them.”
Some families are scared, community organizations say
Tabitha Sookdeo is the executive director of Connecticut Students for a Dream, a grassroots community of immigrants and undocumented people. She said some of her members, who range from ages 14 to 25, and their families are fearful.
“I’ve heard stories of their younger siblings or much younger siblings not being sent to school,” Sookdeo said. “At least a high schooler has the ability to think through what solutions might be, how to act quickly on their feet if there’s an ICE presence.”
Parents may be hesitant to be away from younger kids, Sookdeo said.
“When it comes to very young children, I think many families are terrified of what that might look like to be separated from them, and in a worst case scenario, their children having to wait forever at a facility,” Sookdeo said.
Sookdeo said she’s heard from many people in the state that enrollment has decreased in schools because “folks are just really scared.” And along with public school enrollment, Sookdeo said, she has seen a decrease in the number of students interested in attending college, with fewer sudents participating in the organization’s college access program.
This could be due to a number of factors, said Sookdeo, including increased immigration enforcement. 
“If I can’t even walk down the street and feel safe, why would I even think to go to college? I think we have some of those sentiments,” Sookdeo said. “I think there’s also just a general decline of this generation of students wanting to go to college and to think through alternative means, because it’s so expensive.”
In the public school system, some districts have had to readjust their learning environments to accommodate the change. Madeline Negrón, the superintendent of New Haven public schools, said the drop is “atypical.” 
“Often as we’re getting ready to begin the academic year, we would find ourselves with a lot of students and families coming in from other countries, which meant that we would have to either open a seat or open up classrooms, particularly in our new arrivals program,” Negrón said. “This year we did not have to open a seat … I actually had to close down a classroom.”

Overall, New Haven saw English learner enrollment drop by 331 students, down 7.3% from last October’s preliminary numbers, the second highest drop in the state. Hartford saw the highest drop.
Schools do not collect data on immigration status, and FERPA prevents data sharing of student information with outside agencies including ICE and police departments. Districts across the state have been working to reach families, assuring them that school is a safe place for students. But the numbers worry Negrón. 
“My biggest fear is exactly that,” Negrón said, “that the fear will eventually take over families where they’re no longer going to send their children to school.”
A community well-being survey conducted by DataHaven, a nonprofit organization producing data for the state, found that 31% percent of Connecticut residents worried a lot or some about either their own immigration status or someone close to them. 10% worried “not much.” Of those who worried about immigration status, 19% of those surveyed either have avoided work, school or community activities themselves, or know someone who has.
Other questions in the survey, which was conducted from August to October of this year, found that some Connecticut residents are avoiding the doctor, and some are having trouble eating and sleeping. Overall, these worries and actions were heightened for Latino residents.
However, not all districts believe the drop in English learner enrollment could influenced by fear. Hartford superintendent Andraé Townsel said he has not heard that that Hartford families are scared to send their children to school. 
“I’ll say the main reasons for the drop, we hypothesize to be,” Townsel said. “No. 1, there are fewer newcomer students due to the immigration-related concerns with policies at the federal government level and shifting migration patterns.”
But Townsel also attributed the drop to issues like housing availability that influenced some families to move out of state, a district-wide enrollment drop due to school choice and the repeal of the religious immunization exception. 
The Connecticut Department of Education acknowledged that the preliminary figures suggest a decline in the number of students identified as English language learners and multilingual learners but stated that the number of these students remains at a little over 11% of the state’s population, consistent with last year.
The overall population of students in Connecticut schools continued to decline this year, following the trend of past years.
So, what are districts doing?
In New Haven, Negrón said the district and city did extensive work to reach vulnerable families and gain their trust in preparation for the Trump administration’s immigration crackdowns. 
“It has been a lot of communicating with the community at large to reiterate the importance of students being in school every day, because it is through gaining in education that, often, kids are going to be better off and families are going to be better off,” Negrón said. “I continue to reiterate to my families all the different protocols that we have established to ensure that we still have safe learning environments.”
Negrón said there are requirements before New Haven schools open their doors to anyone, and the district has established protocols in the case of ICE presence. And in Hartford, Townsel said, school leaders receive training to review all protocols regarding immigration enforcement.
“I think all we can do is provide the best education system possible, and then as different variables in society happen, we respond to it,” Townsel said.
Hartford has established guiding principles, emphasizing that immigration status of a student is irrelevant to their right to a public education.
The state recently adopted a new framework regarding English language learners and multilingual learners, reinforcing Connecticut’s stance that schools are safe, welcoming and “culturally responsive learning environments.” The framework, which has been in the works for four years and will be distributed to districts, lays out initiatives to implement evidence-based practices for instruction, teacher training and school-family relationships.
Negrón said she is “proud” of her district work and is “extremely grateful” that families are trusting the district with their children. And it seems this trust could be showing up in attendance numbers.
Across the state, chronic absenteeism, which spiked among English language learners in January and February after Trump took office, fell in March and continued to fall into the current school year. The state has been working to keep these numbers down after they rose during the pandemic. 
Being “chronically absent” means a student is not in attendance for 10% or more school days. And while districts are happy the number of chronically absent students is falling, some have concerns. 

Sandra Faioes is the assistant superintendent of business and operations for Norwalk public schools. She said the rate of chronically absent English language learner students in her district dropped by 3%. 
“With chronic absenteeism … three percentage points is a really big deal,” Faioes said. “Our daily attendance rates, those are higher, obviously, because they’re absent less. What we’re suspecting is that we may have fewer families.”
Norwalk saw a 6.58% drop in English language learner enrollment this year compared to last year, or 176 fewer students. And compared to October of last year, chronic absenteeism among English language learners fell from 21.7% to 18.9% — nearly 3 percentage points.
Despite the significant drop in chronically absent students, Faioes is worried that the district’s attendance is improving because there are fewer students with more complex needs.
“It begs the question, is your attendance better?” Faioes said. 
Since English language learner enrollment dropped, Faioes wondered if the fall in chronic absenteeism was, in part, because a higher percentage of English language learners in the district are documented.
“When they are documented, they have different tools in their toolbox,” Faioes said. “Because an undocumented family already comes with some disadvantages.” 
However, since immigration status data is never collected by schools, it is impossible to determine which students are attending school and which aren’t enrolled.
Morton had similar concerns as Faioes about the statewide data.
“Are more students attending class who are multilingual learners?” Morton said. “And how does that compare to the number of students who are multilingual learners that we think are just not enrolled in school at all?”
What could this mean in the long-run?
This decline, if it continues, could impact school funding — and in more ways than one, Morton said. 
While a decline in population generally impacts the amount of funding a district receives, fear surrounding data sharing could also have some influence over funding.
Based on how many low-income students a school has, measured partially through the number of students eligible for free and reduced lunch, a school may qualify for the Community Eligibility Provision. The federal program provides free lunches for all students in high-needs schools, among other things. But Morton is worried that families may not sign up for the program and schools may lose their qualifications.
“If parents are fearful of sharing any data with a district about their needs, and [not] filling out forms for free or reduced price lunch, then those numbers could go down for a district, which impacts funding, particularly at a time where your district’s eligibility for the Community Eligibility Provision may be up in the air because of changes to SNAP eligibility,” Morton said. “All these things are connected, and I don’t think people always fully understand how they always connect back to school funding.” 
Morton is also worried about the future of districts, as total student population continues to decline. He said a low enrollment rate could affect the operations of districts and schools.
“If we continue on the pace that we are for enrollment, which could present a number of challenges for districts that need to potentially consolidate or regionalize,” Morton said, “that could mean closing schools because they’re underutilized. It could mean combining with another town to form a regional school district.”
A continuing loss of English language learners could make things worse.
“If you have a continuing declining population of multilingual learners, and that’s been your primary driver of increases in enrollment and nothing else changes, that’s something for districts to be aware of,” Morton said. “Particularly when you’re doing their enrollment projections.”
Preliminary numbers, which do not include pre-K students, show a proportional decline in English learners, said the state Department of Education. Official enrollment numbers will be released on EdSight in mid-February.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2024_0923_SR_BroadviewMiddleSchool_623-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-10 05:57:21.260519

(Photo by U.S. Department of Agriculture)Governors and attorneys general from Pennsylvania and 21 other jurisdictions say they want explicit safeguards related to immigration enforcement, artificial intelligence and more before getting involved in the federal government’s push for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) data.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture says the project will help mitigate SNAP fraud, waste and abuse. Opponents fear the resulting database will lack appropriate safeguards and support other endeavors — including immigration enforcement, as with some of the Trump administration’s other data expansion efforts. 
Listen to the audio recap here: 

https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/09EPsnapupdateWEB.mp3
 
In a 16-page letter provided to the Pennsylvania Capital-Star, lawyers for the states laid out dozens of questions about and aspects of the initiative – including cost-sharing, privacy, security and bureaucratic redundancy – that they want the USDA to address. 
The document comes as part of a lawsuit filed earlier this year as 21 states and Washington, D.C., declined to share the information as requested by USDA. That includes SNAP applicant and recipients’ names, addresses, social security numbers and immigration and marital statuses dating back to Jan. 1, 2020.
Twenty-eight states and Guam have since started sharing the data, according to the USDA. 
Recently, the Trump administration told the other states and D.C. that they could lose federal funding to help pay to administer SNAP if they don’t opt into the data collection initiative before Christmas Eve, and asked for detailed justifications by Monday for continuing to abstain. 
window.addEventListener(“message”,function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[“datawrapper-height”]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(“iframe”);for(var t in a.data[“datawrapper-height”])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[“datawrapper-height”][t]+”px”;r.style.height=d}}});
But the federal government can’t yank SNAP funding due to the preliminary injunction in the case, attorneys for the plaintiff jurisdictions argue in their Dec. 8 letter. 
They also made demands and raised questions they say need responses – preferably, by Dec. 15 – before they can move forward. 
The plaintiffs want the USDA to detail its artificial intelligence policy and  confirm restrictions on data access by other federal agencies – in particular, that Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) won’t use it for immigration enforcement. 
And they want to know what will be achieved by the new data sharing initiative that isn’t already happening through existing SNAP oversight and data-sharing and analysis. That includes:  

the National Accuracy Clearinghouse (NAC) to identify duplicate SNAP enrollment
Electronic Disqualified Recipient Systems to flag applicants previously disqualified for fraud 
SNAP quality control systems that (among other things) establish error rates 
Electronic benefits transfer (EBT) fraud monitoring that entails providing daily transaction data to USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service
SAVE (Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements) program to verify immigration status 

They also say protocols for those existing programs are more detailed and stringent than the new one and could serve as models. That includes:  

Restricting who can access data and permissible uses to directly related to SNAP administration and enforcement
Initially sharing redacted and/or aggregated data and then providing individual-level case details as warranted in response to requests from federal officials –and purging it from federal records shortly thereafter.  

And they’ve asked USDA to explain how artificial intelligence will be utilized and related privacy safeguards. 
An agency spokesperson said in an email USDA doesn’t comment on ongoing litigation. 
It costs more than $500 million per year to administer SNAP benefits in Pennsylvania. The state and federal government have been splitting the bill. But that’s set to change next year, when the commonwealth will cover 75 percent – leaving $130 million in federal funding for administration hanging in the balance. 
About two million people in Pennsylvania and 40 million others nationally receive SNAP benefits, according to the latest data available from USDA.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/54392971083_6a04f0b70f_6k-1024x6831761681275-1.jpg,,,2025-12-10 07:56:56.419845

The AI-data center boom is putting strong upward pressure on utility prices in Ohio. Even so, disconnections are down, according to the state’s consumer representative.
That’s because other factors are at play, said J.P. Blackwood, spokesman for the Office of the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel.
Data from the office show that electricity disconnections were down almost 12% for the year ending June 31 compared to a year earlier. The 272,817 disconnections were the least in four years.
That’s not to say power prices aren’t going up — they’re 26% higher now than they were at the beginning of the year, according to data from the Ohio Public Utilities Commission. And increasing demand from data centers is a major factor.
But there were upward pressures on prices — and downward pressures on family income — prior to the data center boom. 
One was the economic dislocation caused by the coronavirus pandemic that started in 2020 and the mass layoffs it prompted. Another was the cessation of many covid-related income subsidies in 2023.
Possibly illustrating that is a 44% drop in natural gas disconnections by mid-year compared to the 12 months ending three years earlier, according to consumers’ counsel data.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Also feeding earlier high energy prices were oil and gas supply disruptions sparked by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine at the start of 2022.
“There were huge spikes,” Blackwood said of electricity prices.
But power prices remain high — and are expected to go higher. 
They’re 87% higher now than they were just before the pandemic started, according to public utilities commission data.
Blackwood said he expects that’s going to mean many Ohioans will need help paying their bills. 
That’s especially true when you consider that utility costs are far from the only ones that have been rising.
“Inflation’s been pretty bad,” Blackwood said. “Even when you put energy costs aside, when your grocery costs and your rent costs and your gasoline costs and whatever other costs are going up, more people are going to struggle with their utility bills and more people are going to get disconnected.” 
Help is available, but few struggling customers appear to be aware. According to the National Energy and Utility Affordability Commission, just 20% of eligible families in Ohio took advantage of such help in 2023.
For more information on how to get help, go to the consumers’ counsel’s Consumer Utility Assistance page.
Blackwood said they’re the most essential services and people need them.
“Electricity and natural gas are a matter of life and death,” he said. “They’re essential. People have died in Ohio because they were cut off.”

Only a small portion may go to Kansas wheat farmers. Predictably, political dances followed the announcement, with various farm groups issuing statements supporting release of this money.
It’s pathetic.
It’s especially so when the Republican sycophants who represent Kansas farmers fall all over themselves to pay homage to Trump. How about some honest conversations about what this regime has done to American farmers via a patchwork of actions that show little understanding of international trade and so many other issues?
Is there any Republican “representative” from Kansas who will speak the truth about this folly from Washington, D.C.?
How about the damage being done to rural hospitals via the disruptive policies of this administration? How about the fact that people are going hungry because of Trump policies? The list is long.
Farmers are receiving just a few breadcrumbs. The fundamental challenges of trade policy remain unsolved, and our competitors are gleeful as they take market share from U.S. farmers.
The peril in farm country is real. In less than 12 months, damage done to Kansas farmers and their peers across the nation is only just beginning to be felt. This latest bailout completely fails to address the underlying issues. Again, I will ask Kansas politicians: When are you going to do your job for the people who voted for you?
But that’s not the only political obfuscation going on these days in Kansas.
 
Chiefs stadium questions
Over the past few months, I have been following efforts by certain Kansas officials to woo the Kansas City Chiefs to move to a new stadium on the other side of the state line with Missouri.
These kinds of projects are promoted as adding “entertainment districts” to the development. These districts supposedly provide significant economic benefits to the area, beyond a single sports venue. The same is true of the University of Kansas’ ongoing project to spend several hundred million dollars to build an entertainment district around its newly renovated football stadium.
Promises, promises.
I’ve wondered just how many “entertainment districts” we need. And I have taken off my rose-colored glasses to read some of the objective and thoughtful studies done concerning the true consequences of these kinds of projects.
Let’s not kid ourselves. Regardless of whether these deals are funded with grants, contributions from donors, tax incentives or other methods, there are adverse economic and social consequences often overlooked. The promises and the realities often do not match.
These large sums of money could be better spent. How about fixing crumbling infrastructure? How about encouraging companies to bring good-paying manufacturing jobs to the area? In the case of KU, how about big money donors helping students afford the high cost of an education, instead of being so focused on having one’s name on a sports venue?
Our society has some strange priorities. Maybe it’s time to focus on taking care of what we have instead of pouring enormous sums into brand new, shiny buildings.

Last March during the hearings on Ohio House Bill 15, I was the only representative of an environmental organization in Ohio to testify against it.
The reason? Among the good things this legislation did was also something very bad: It gave the Ohio Power Siting Board just 45 days – six weeks – to consider a major utility facility – defined as 50 MW or more – to serve a large energy user – often a data center – on property owned by the applicant. Usually this process takes one to three years.
Data centers use prodigious amounts of energy – often as much as an entire city. If they are to be directly served by an energy generation facility, it needs to be well over 50 MW.
It was clear from the language of H.B. 15 that any such major utility facility would be run by gas. 
Wind turbines have too large of a setback requirement to go on most land next to a large energy user, and the footprint of utility scale solar projects is too large.
According to Data Center Map, there are now 215 data centers in Ohio, of which 133 are in Central Ohio. Many are in residential areas. 
I know because there’s an Amazon data center campus across the street from my house, and 32 data centers within 10 miles.
A gas-powered fuel cell
For a few weeks after H.B. 15 went into effect, I breathed easier thinking it would be a while before a gas plant could be built at any of the data centers near me. 
Gas turbines are in short supply, resulting in lead times of four to seven years to build a gas plant.
What I didn’t know about was the existence of a gas-powered fuel cell. 
Rather than combustion, gas fuel cells use methane gas to create electricity through a chemical reaction inside the cell. It results in a lot less particulate pollution but still emits large amounts of carbon dioxide.
In July I learned that AEP plans to install a 73 MW fuel cell at the Amazon data center on Scioto Darby Creek Road in Hilliard. 
It is to be the largest fuel cell in North America, second only to an 80 MW fuel cell in Korea. It will emit up to 1.45 million pounds of carbon dioxide every day – the equivalent of 66,000 gasoline vehicles.
This data center is directly next door to the large Darby Glen subdivision as well as Darby Glen Park and Beacon Elementary School. 
Within a mile lies Columbus Humane, Highpoint-Glen subdivision, and Mill Run Shopping Center. 
Just 1.5 miles away is Quarry Trails Metro Park.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
An expedited process
By the time I learned about the fuel cell project, the power siting board had already fast-tracked it. 
There was no public notice, no public information session, and no public hearing. The city had been told, but the people had no idea, including those who live next door.
On Sept. 15, siting board staff issued a report recommending automatic approval of the fuel cell – meaning no formal vote by the Public Utilities Commission. Approval occurred September 23.
On Oct. 9, Amazon brought the fuel cell to the Hilliard Planning and Zoning Commission, calling it a “minor change” to the site layout. Minutes show the commission had a lengthy debate, then postponed the decision to their November meeting.
On Oct. 20, AEP delivered a letter to the city withdrawing the application to Planning and Zoning on the grounds that state approval was all they needed, and that the state process had been expedited thanks to Ohio House Bill 15.
This turn of events came as a shock to the city and its residents. 
Immediately a citizens group launched a petition that received over 1,000 signatures, and dozens of concerned citizens showed up at the City Council meeting on Oct. 27.
At that meeting, council voted to appeal the air permit that had already been granted by Ohio EPA. 
Such permits consider particulate pollution but do not look at carbon dioxide or any other greenhouse gas, despite the obvious threat of these gases to a stable climate.
Two citizens who live near the data center also appealed the air permit. The preliminary hearing for all three plaintiffs is today, Wednesday, Dec. 10, at 10 a.m.
No precedent
The fight against the fuel cell is an uphill battle for the city of Hilliard and its residents. But it shouldn’t be that way. 
Imagine a major polluting facility moving in next door to you – and not only did you have no say in the matter, you didn’t even find out until it was too late.
Even worse, no one knows what will happen when a fuel cell this large goes directly next to thousands of homes, businesses, parks, and nonprofits. 
There’s no precedent for this anywhere in North America.
Will 1.45 million pounds of CO2 emitted daily at ground level simply dissipate? 
Or will the CO2 – the most common greenhouse gas in the world – warm the air in the vicinity to unprecedented levels? 
What are the health effects of chronic exposure to heightened levels of CO2? 
And what are the climate effects of putting this much CO2 into the atmosphere during a climate crisis?
People who live in the area feel like this fuel cell is an experiment with them and their children as unwilling test subjects. 
At the very least, baseline CO2 measurements must be established and monitored, and a dispersion / inversion study needs to be done.
All I can say to the Ohio politicians who pushed through H.B. 15 is, I told you this would happen, and now it is happening. 
Now you owe it to the people of Hilliard to listen to them and address their concerns. 
That’s who has to deal with the consequences of your actions.

During Tuesday’s special session, the Legislature passed a series of bills aimed at creating a window of time to allow for a different congressional map to be put in place ahead of the 2026 elections if they’re able to successfully appeal the case to the Utah Supreme Court in coming months. 
In addition to approving legislation to delay congressional candidate filing deadlines and change court rules to ensure lawmakers’ appeal goes directly and quickly to the Utah Supreme Court, the Legislature also passed a scathing resolution that strongly condemned the courts’ actions in the redistricting case. 
The resolution’s sponsor, House Majority Leader Casey Snider, R-Paradise, said on the House floor that the court’s handling of the case has damaged trust in the institution. 
“I am afraid that I cannot look my constituents in the eye and tell them they can trust this judiciary any longer,” Snider said. “The court has done this to themselves. The reputation that they have lost and now tarnished they have done and lost by themselves.”

The resolution — which isn’t a binding law but rather a legislative measure to send a message — says the Legislature “rejects the court-ordered, special interest groups’ map and any map that does not reflect the will of the people through their elected legislators.” It adds that the Legislature “urges the judicial branch to safeguard and follow the text of the Utah Constitution.” 
In their ongoing redistricting fight, Republican Utah lawmakers have accused 3rd District Judge Dianna Gibson of violating the Utah Constitution when she picked a map that was drawn by the plaintiffs in the lawsuit and not adopted by the Legislature, which they argue has the sole authority to redistrict under the Utah Constitution. 
In Utah redistricting case, judge explains why she ruled against Legislature

But Gibson, in a legal analysis filed Friday, addressed those criticisms, writing the remedial process she ordered and the court’s authority in the matter “is firmly rooted in both federal and state court precedent.” 
“While a state court’s role in redistricting is new to Utah, this judicial function is neither new nor novel,” Gibson wrote. “It is well settled that when the political branches fail to enact lawful electoral maps, the judiciary’s duty to provide an effective remedy is not discretionary.”
Instead, Gibson wrote the courts have a “fundamental obligation to uphold constitutional rights and to ensure a lawful electoral map is in place, including by adopting one proposed by a party in the proceedings.” 
How we got here
While Republican Utah lawmakers continue to fight the redistricting rulings and accuse the judiciary of violating separation of powers, Gibson’s court-ordered map was the result of a yearslong court battle over not only gerrymandering, but also Utahns’ constitutional rights to alter and reform their government through ballot initiative. 
Utah’s redistricting lawsuit started years ago — after pro-democracy groups including the League of Women Voters of Utah and Mormon Women for Ethical Government and a handful of Salt Lake County voters sued. They alleged the Utah Legislature violated their constitutional rights after the Legislature repealed and replaced Proposition 4, a 2018 ballot initiative that voters narrowly approved to create an independent redistricting process with neutral map-drawing criteria.

The case wound its way through the courts for years before the Utah Supreme Court last year handed the plaintiffs a major win in a unanimous decision that sent the case back to Gibson’s courtroom after she initially dismissed it. That ruling made clear the Legislature’s power has limits when it comes to repealing or changing “government reform” ballot initiatives. 
The Utah Supreme Court’s decision incensed Republican lawmakers, who said it created “super laws” that lawmakers can’t change, and top legislative leaders characterized it as a “blow” to the “very fabric of our republic.” 
That decision set the stage for the rest of the redistricting case and Gibson’s most recent rulings. In recent months, the debate over Utah’s redistricting process has reached a boiling point — culminating in lawmakers’ heated clash with the judiciary. 
Special session debate
In addition to the resolution condemning the courts, lawmakers passed the following bills to facilitate their appeal to the Utah Supreme Court:

SB2001: A bill sponsored by Sen. Scott Sandall, R-Tremonton, and Rep. Karen Petersen, R-Clinton. For 2026 congressional candidates only, the bill delays the candidate filing period by about two months, to March 9-13. For congressional candidates gathering signatures to qualify for the ballot, the bill also allows those candidates to gather signatures statewide — not just in the district they’re running for, as they’re required under current law. It would also set a window of time to file a notice of intent to gather signatures from Jan. 2 to March 13, with signature thresholds staying the same. 
SJR201 and SB2002: A resolution and bill sponsored by Sen. Brady Brammer, R-Provo, and Rep. Jefferson Burton, R-Salem, meant to change court procedures to ensure the state’s redistricting case appeal — and other future cases relating to elections or redistricting — don’t get hung up on a dispute over attorney fees before the Utah Supreme Court can consider issues at the heart of the appeal. They also make clear the Utah Supreme Court has “exclusive and original appellate jurisdiction” on election and redistricting cases, meaning they can’t defer the case to the Court of Appeals. 

Democrats in the House and Senate argued against the resolution condemning the courts and the other bills. 
After Gibson voided the state’s 2021 congressional map as the result of an unconstitutional process and ordered a new map to be put in place in time for the 2026 elections, Rep. Doug Owens, D-Millcreek, said “the court gave us an ample chance to follow the law” by allowing the Legislature to submit a preferred map to the court for consideration.

But the court found Legislature’s map, known as map C (which was supported by the Utah Republican Party as the least damaging option) did not follow Proposition 4’s neutral map-drawing criteria to the greatest extent practicable — and was drawn in violation of Proposition 4 because lawmakers’ retained redistricting expert drew it with an application that had partisan data on display. 
“And so she chose a map that followed neutral criteria, and it happens that it has a (district) with a Democratic majority,” Owens said. “The reality is that if you have a neutral map, it produces a Democratic-leaning district.” 
But Republicans pointed out Gibson’s map selection resulted in congressional districts that are highly partisan and uncompetitive, which they argued wasn’t the intention of Proposition 4. 
“We didn’t create more competitive districts,” said Rep. Stephanie Gricius, R-Eagle Mountain. “We created four districts where there’s one party that will always win them.”
‘Hear our voice’
While GOP lawmakers focused on protecting their representative form of government from what they viewed as an “activist” attack from the judicial branch, the rally outside their chamber doors had a different message — that lawmakers need to stop fighting and listen to Utahns who have been calling for “fair maps” and independent redistricting for years. 
“The very people who are supposed to be representing us have chosen to fight us,” said Sarah Buck, an activist with the progressive group Salt Lake Indivisible. “There’s something so wrong with what’s happening in this moment.”

Elizabeth Rasmussen, executive director of Better Boundaries — the anti-gerrymandering group that successfully sought Proposition 4 in 2018 — said Tuesday’s special session made it “very clear that the Legislature is pretty incapable of being told ‘no’ or following anyone’s rules but their own.” 
“They don’t want to follow what the Constitution says. They don’t want to follow what the courts say. They don’t want to follow what the people have said through a ballot initiative process,” Rasmussen said. 
The fact that the governor and lawmakers felt this matter was so important it required a special session “is very telling how they feel about their power currently,” she said. 
“So it’s not a shock that this happened today, but it is disappointing that after eight years they continue to push back against everyone and everything that’s saying, ‘No, we don’t want you to do this,’” she said. “But they’re just going ahead anyway.” 
Rasmussen said legislators should end the fighting and accept Gibson’s court-ordered map so candidates and voters can have certainty ahead of the 2026 elections. 
“At the end of the day, Utah is still a pretty red state,” she said. “We just want to make sure that everyone has equal footing. I mean, isn’t that the point of our country, so that people can have an equal say in how their government’s run? That’s all we’ve been fighting for this whole time.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)A campaign to repeal a controversial law banning collective bargaining in public sector unions was fruitful — but not at the polls, the way many Utahns expected. During a special session Tuesday evening, the Utah Legislature voted to repeal it with lawmakers arguing that the division surrounding the bill faded its real intent.
Some Republicans rejected the proposal to repeal HB267, a law the Legislature approved this year that would have prohibited public sector unions from negotiating terms of employment with their employers. But ultimately, the House voted 60-9 and the Senate 26-1 to annul the legislation.

Gov. Spencer Cox is expected to sign the repeal bill as he already expressed support for it in a social media post ahead of the special session. 
Unions celebrate Utah Legislature’s planned vote to repeal anti-collective bargaining bill

During the special session, Rep. Jordan Teuscher, R-South Jordan, who sponsored both HB267 and the action to repeal it, said he believed the original legislation was good policy, but was “overshadowed by misinformation and unnecessary division.”
“Repealing HB267 doesn’t mean that we’re abandoning the principles behind it,” Teuscher said. “It means that we’re choosing clarity over confusion, collaboration over conflict and long term stability over short term noise.”
The law was controversial from its inception and led to packed hallways and galleries during the last general session. It also awoke a massive signature-gathering effort in which over 5,000 volunteers collected about 320,000 signatures to qualify for a referendum to nullify the law.

That overwhelming public input, leaders from a coalition of public and private unions that organized the referendum efforts said, gave them leverage in the negotiations they held with lawmakers over the past month and a half to reach this conclusion.  
After the House vote, Renée Pinkney, president of the Utah Education Association, the state’s largest teachers’ union, said that if the repeal hadn’t been successful at the Legislature, it would have had a good chance of going through at the ballot box.
“We know that we have the people’s support behind us, and we are going to continue working forward and adhering to the work group,” Pinkney said. “We said that we would enter into talks with the Legislature and try and lower the temperature, and we will adhere to that agreement.”



Let us know what you think...


 


Overall, she said, their fight was about their students.
“We want our students to be successful. We want them to thrive. We want them to reach their full potential, and we know that we can do that through collective bargaining with our employers,” Pinkney said. 
Rep. Carol Spackman Moss, D-Holladay, a retired high school teacher, described the repeal as “a tribute to nearly 300,000 Utah teachers” who have done collective bargaining in the state for 15 years, and other public sector unions that stood by them. 
“This is a very timely bill now, because this is a time when many teachers are not feeling valued by the Legislature and activist groups who are banning books and making scurrilous attacks on teachers and school librarians,” she said.
‘Gatekeepers rather than advocates’
While many celebrated the repeal, House Majority Whip Candice Pierucci, R-Herriman, lamented the repeal, which also deleted a provision that offered professional liability insurance for teachers, which in most cases is offered through unions. 
“I just would like to caution that I think today, modern unions so often act as gatekeepers rather than advocates,” Pierucci said, encouraging educators to reach legislators directly to come up with policy solutions for their challenges.

“I would still say to the teachers and the firefighters and policemen, we want to hear directly from you, not through your union leaders,” Pierucci said, “because they’re not always representing you in the best way, nor they have your best interest at heart.”
After hearing those remarks Teuscher said he felt compelled to share a story he heard in a town hall months ago. 
“We had a teacher raise their hand and essentially say, ‘every time the legislature goes into session, I’m on suicide watch,’” Teuscher said.
But, he said, that feeling doesn’t stem from the Legislature’s actions.
“Try to figure out who is telling you this, who is adding to this chaos and stress in your life, because it isn’t the Legislature,” he said.
Repealing the law, Teuscher said, would ultimately allow “something stronger to grow,” and the state is committed to finding a solution that protects all public employees across the state.

The lunch line is bustling with conversation, while other students remain silent in the corner, sitting with no lunch, hoping no one notices they cannot afford the meals. A few miles away, on my college campus, friends debate skipping lunch since their meal swipes and dining dollars have run out. Different settings, but the same problem: students attempting to learn on an empty stomach.
Thousands of students in Connecticut experience hunger on a regular basis. The National School Lunch Program (NSLP) provides nutritionally balanced, low-cost or free lunches to children during the school day. Eligibility for free or reduced-price meals is based on family income, and during COVID-19, federal waivers allowed students to receive meals for free regardless of income, removing stigma and ensuring no child went hungry. When that pandemic-era support expired, Connecticut chose not to continue universal meals, leaving families to navigate outdated eligibility rules and logistical barriers such as transportation or limited pickup times. 



As a result, over 12,000 children have recently lost access to free school meals in the K-12 system due to funding and eligibility changes, leaving families scrambling to cover unaffordable costs. Robin Lamott Sparks, executive director of End Hunger CT!, stated that the pandemic exposed flaws in state agencies’ coordination, leaving families behind. Lawmakers have described it as “a real failure of the state“. Daniel Fitzmaurice, director of advocacy at United Way of Connecticut, said, “For these families, the return of meal charges is not just an inconvenience; it is a serious financial hit.”
The inability to eat continues even after graduating from high school. It follows students to college, including mine at Sacred Heart University, where meal plans are so expensive that many people struggle to eat daily. In fact, research shows that about one in three college students nationwide face food insecurity, regularly skipping meals or lacking access to balanced nutrition. Nelly Birmingham, an undergraduate student at Southern Connecticut State University, shared, “I had to divide my rations to survive the day. I was scared to ask for help, but I couldn’t focus on school if I didn’t eat”.

While low-income students are most at risk, lower-middle-income students also face challenges, as they may not qualify for government aid but still struggle to afford regular meals. Hunger is not always obvious. It is quiet, lonely, painful, and directly affects students’ ability to focus, study, and succeed academically. 
Lawmakers attempted to resolve the issue during the 2025 legislative session. House Bill 7273 suggested funding a universal free school lunch program with a tax on sweetened beverages, syrups, and powders. Although it did not pass, its introduction pointed out the importance of a structural solution to ensure all children have access to meals at school. Meanwhile, cuts to the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) represent an additional threat to children’s ability to eat, as families who previously relied on this support may now face increased food insecurity. 
With the next legislative session beginning in February, it is a timely opportunity for lawmakers to reconsider providing a universal free school lunch program. I call on Connecticut legislators to bring this bill back and pass universal free school meals, treating food as an educational necessity rather than an optional support.
This is more than just compassion. It is about equal treatment in education. Hunger affects concentration, engagement, mental health, attendance, and even graduation. If Connecticut truly wants its students to succeed, every child should have access to nutritious meals at school.
Every child in Connecticut has access to textbooks and learning materials at school, regardless of family income, because these are recognized as essential tools for learning. Food should be treated the same way. Connecticut must eliminate eligibility requirements and provide universal free school lunches, ensuring that every student has consistent access to nutritious meals as a fundamental part of their education, not a privilege.
Every student, from kindergarten cafeterias to college dining halls, deserves access to nutritious food. A full stomach should not be a privilege. Connecticut has the opportunity to make school meals universal and accessible, giving every child the nutrition they need to grow and succeed.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-10 05:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,How to fix our broken healthcare system,Martin H. Klein,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/10/fixing-our-broken-healthcare-system-beyond-bipartisan-smoke-and-mirrors-martin/,"If you analyze the various plans, it will quickly become apparent that Access Health CT is basically nothing more than a broken single-payer system.","Healthcare in the United States is in crisis and requires immediate action. Compared to other wealthy countries, we are an extreme outlier in terms of costs, outcomes, and service quality.
We spend more than double the amount on healthcare than other countries, five times more on administrative costs alone, and healthcare spending represents 18% of our Gross Domestic Product (GDP), versus 10-12% in other wealthy nations.
We live in a country where millions are uninsured, and many more are underinsured. Compared to other wealthy countries, we have the highest rate of preventable deaths, and our life expectancy is lower by more than four years. While it is true that the United States’ quality of care is world-class, the current barriers to entry in our healthcare system prevent many from receiving the care they deserve. We often hear stories in the media of people, especially seniors, skipping medical care and medication because of its high cost.
Two areas of healthcare that are most in trouble in terms of accessibility and cost are the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and Medicare. The ACA plans are unaffordable, and Medicare is on the verge of insolvency beginning in 2033.
While there is intense debate between the two political parties over who should pay the ACA premiums — the individual member or the taxpayer — neither party appears to be addressing the real problem. The ACA is in crisis and dysfunctional. The services it offers are limited in terms of quality and accessibility, and its costs are out of control. For example, Access Health CT, the Affordable Care exchange in our state, is neither affordable nor accessible.
President Barack Obama’s declaration, “If you like your doctors, you can continue seeing them,” turned out to be a false promise. The ACA is not affordable, and its quality of care and provider network are limited. In our state, you cannot go to an out-of-state hospital, and many of the top providers inside the state do not accept ACA insurance plans. For example, the highly recognized Connecticut-based Hospital for Special Care (HfSC) does not accept Access Health CT insurance.
To understand the problem with the ACA, let’s dig a little deeper and examine our own state’s ACA exchange in more detail. Picking an insurance plan on the Access Health CT website is like shopping for a mattress sold at different stores under different names and model numbers, with slightly different bells and whistles. Wherever you shop, the mattress is basically the same, and the minor feature tweaks at different locations are seemingly designed to make it difficult for customers to compare between stores. 
While there are two managed care companies (MCOs) — Anthem and ConnectiCare — and 20 plans to choose from on the exchange, the plans offered by each MCO are almost identical, and the different plan options, except for some minor tweaks, are basically the same. If you analyze the various plans, it will quickly become apparent that, by its very design, Access Health CT is basically nothing more than a broken single-payer system. The options on the exchange are like 20 variations of the same lumpy mattress, with minor variations in pricing and covered services.
On the Access Health CT Exchange, you genuinely have only two options— you either pay more in premiums and have a lower deductible, or pay less in premiums and have a higher deductible. Whichever plan you choose, the bare-bones provider networks, the limited quality and accessibility of care, and the overinflated costs are practically the same. While each plan might have different copayments and deductibles, whichever plan you ultimately choose, they are basically the same in terms of their restricted in-state-only provider networks, limited quality and accessibility of care, and unaffordable costs. For the most part, it all boils down to a simple equation: the higher the premium, the lower the out-of-pocket cost; the lower the premium, the higher the out-of-pocket cost.
To illustrate my point, let’s look at the ConnectiCare plan options for a family of four residing in Fairfield, with parents ages 63 and 60, and kids ages 21 and 24, with an Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) of 130,000. The most affordable plan is the “Value Bronze HSA plan.” The annual premium for this plan is $54,272.52, the family deductible is $13,000, and the max out-of-pocket is $14,450. In this scenario, the member is responsible for a total out-of-pocket expense of $68,722.52 before reaching 100 percent reimbursement.
The other option is the “Value Gold Standard POS.” The annual premium for this plan is $83,272.92, the family deductible is $2,400, and the max out-of-pocket is $14,750. In total, the member is responsible for an out-of-pocket expense of $98,023.88 before the insurance provides 100 percent reimbursement. 
Looking at these numbers, it is pretty confusing as to which plan is better: the Bronze or the Gold. One would expect the Gold plan to provide superior coverage to the Bronze plan. Yet, when you analyze the data, which is perplexing and challenging to understand, the opposite of what one would expect turns out to be true: the Bronze plan is less costly for practically the same benefits.
With the Gold plan, you’ll end up paying over $29,000 more for the same coverage provided by the Bronze plan.  For this family of four, with an AGI of 130,000, even if they choose the more affordable Bronze plan, once they have met their out-of-pocket cost, at least 53 percent of their total income will have gone toward healthcare expenses.
It is not a secret why the ACA is broken — these plans are run by large for-profit corporations that are more concerned with their stock price than with accessibility and the quality of care.
For years, managed care companies have squeezed providers on reimbursement rates and restricted care under the guise of “medical necessity” to increase their own profits. What has made matters worse is the rise of large Integrated Delivery Networks (IDN). These are hospitals and providers that have formed large provider companies to combat the financial pressures of the managed care industry.
In Connecticut, there are also only two large Integrated Delivery Networks (IDNs) — Yale New Haven Health System and Hartford Healthcare. These two systems, over the past several years, have aggressively expanded, buying up hospitals and medical practices to gain leverage in negotiations with managed care organizations. With the IDNs’ newfound negotiation clout, the MCOs’ only remaining means to increase revenue is to raise member premiums substantially.
This year, the state of Connecticut approved a 25% premium rate increase for ConnectiCare. Since the start of AccessHealth CT in 2014, the average premium cost has increased by almost 300 percent. Yet the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which tracks overall inflation in Connecticut, has increased by only 35–45% since 2014, a fraction of the rise of ACA premiums.
Unlike ACA enrollees, Medicare beneficiaries do not have problems with premium costs, accessibility, or the quality of care. Eighty-six percent of Medicare participants say they are happy with their plans. In my practice, I often hear seniors’ joke: “The only benefit of getting old is my Medicare.” 
The problem with Medicare is that its fiscal foundation is on the verge of collapse. According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Medicare trustees’ data, if Congress does not figure out how to increase funding, Medicare will become insolvent by 2036.

While many people believe that a nonprofit single-payer system is the way we need to go, how we get there is rarely discussed by politicians on either side of the aisle. The debate between who should pay these outrageous ransom-like fees —we the individual or we the taxpayer — is nothing more than bipartisan smoke and mirrors spun by politicians who are in bed with insurance lobbyists.
There are clear steps our government can take to begin to heal our sick healthcare system. What I propose in this article is a plan that would significantly reduce healthcare costs and keep Medicare solvent for another 20 years. What I am suggesting is the addition of a new tax bracket for married couples earning more than $1 million per year. If the top 0.5 percent of the population (approximately 65,000 households) were to pay a tax rate of 47.7 percent, rather than the current marginal rate of 37 percent, on earnings above $1 million, not only would Medicare be solvent for another 20 years, but we could lower the age of Medicare eligibility to 50. 
Lowering the Medicare eligibility age to 50 would be financially beneficial for almost everyone —the government, corporations, healthcare providers, and individuals of all ages. It would also improve the quality of care and accessibility for the entire United States population.  The only ones who would lose in this scenario would be the managed care industry and the politicians who accept lobbyist funding. 
ACA premiums would decrease significantly because members aged 50-64 are the highest cost enrollees in these plans. If the Medicare eligibility age were lowered to 50, it is estimated that over 25 million would exit the ACA. The ACA risk pool would become younger and healthier,and claim volatility and costs would decrease significantly, becoming more stable and predictable.
Since members ages 50-64 have the highest premiums and out-of-pocket costs under the ACA, adopting this program would eliminate the financial catastrophic risk for millions. The government would save billions in subsidies, since approximately 25 percent of subsidy recipients are in this older age group. Hospitals would see modest increases in volume from newly eligible adults. They would also benefit from more predictable Medicare rates and from reduced burden of absorbing the cost of treating patients without insurance coverage. Most importantly, rural hospitals, which are currently facing financial ruin, will be able to stay open because of the stability and increased percentage of insured patients. 
Such a change in our healthcare system does not have to be done all at once; it can be done gradually. For example, if the Medicare eligibility age were lowered at first to 60 rather than 50, the required surtax for married couples earning more than $1 million could drop from 47.7% to 45.6%. This would significantly reduce overall healthcare costs and allow Medicare to remain solvent for another 20 years.
The problems in our healthcare system didn’t happen by accident —they’re the result of policies that put insurance companies and corporate profits ahead of patients. The ACA has become expensive, restrictive, and unreliable, and Medicare —one of the few programs people actually trust— is heading toward insolvency if nothing changes.
But there is a realistic way forward. By slightly increasing taxes on households making over a million dollars and lowering the Medicare eligibility age, we could stabilize Medicare for decades, dramatically lower ACA premiums, improve access to care, and reduce financial strain on families, hospitals, and the government.
This isn’t a partisan solution; it’s a practical one. We can either stay with the current broken system —sky-high premiums, limited networks, and growing instability— or we can make targeted, sensible changes that strengthen Medicare and make healthcare more accessible and affordable for everyone.
The path is obvious. What we need now is the will to take it.

(File photo by Bruce DePuyt/Maryland Matters)Maryland lawmakers will return to Annapolis next week for a special session to elect a new House speaker, but they will also take up veto overrides in a session that could veer into other business.
Gov. Wes Moore (D) on Tuesday afternoon issued an executive order for the legislative session that said the session is being called to “elect a new House Speaker following Adrienne A. Jones’s announcement last week that she would step down following six historic years in service to the speakership.”
Moore called for the session to begin Dec. 16 – the same day the House Democratic Caucus is scheduled to meet in the morning to pick a replacement for Jones from its ranks. The presumptive front-runner is House Health and Government Operations Chair Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel), who emerged as the top candidate over the weekend after three competitors withdrew from consideration and pledged their support to her.
Left open is the potential to consider other legislation.
By law, the House and Senate also have to take up veto overrides during the special session. Moore in May vetoed 30 bills, including one that would have created a commission to study reparations. He also vetoed a bill that called for studying the financial impacts of climate change in Maryland and the potential effects of data center development, as well as a bill to create a planning office focused on the state’s energy needs.
Field of hopefuls in speaker’s race clears for Peña-Melnyk

All three are likely targets for overrides, but the reparations bill, in particular, is expected to draw a sharp rebuke from lawmakers, who passed the measure by veto-proof majorities in the House and Senate. Moore said in his veto message that the state does not need another study on “the legacy of slavery in our state,” saying it is time to act. But many critics were like then-Speaker Jones, who said “our past is not some distant chapter” but that “reconciling the pain and injustice of the past is our moral obligation and essential to progress.”
The House and Senate are not limited in other legislation they could consider. Traditionally, the House and Senate have limited their work in special sessions. Other bills typically are banished to the Rules Committee.
This year could be different.
First, Moore has left on the table the possibility of using a special session to pass midcycle congressional redistricting. The Governor’s Redistricting Advisory Commission has met three times to take public testimony, and has a fourth hearing Friday, but so far has not produced any recommendations or any proposed redistricting maps.
The redistricting push was sparked by Texas’ decision, at the urging of President Donald Trump, to redraw boundaries of its congressional districts ahead of the 2026 elections to give Republicans a chance to pick up five more seats in the state. Since then, other states have followed suit, with blue states like Maryland being pressured to act to offset the Texas changes.
The Maryland House has appeared poised to move on a bill. The fate of the legislation in the Senate is less certain. Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) is opposed to midcycle redistricting, which he said could backfire on Democrats who currently hold seven of the state’s eight U.S. House seats. Ferguson appears to have the backing of his caucus and is unlikely to allow such a bill to reach the floor.
The House and Senate could also consider legislation next week directed at federal policies, including bills on 287(g) agreements — which allow sheriff’s departments to act in conjunction with federal immigration authorities — as well as prohibitions on the use of masks by federal agents and other legislation.
The calling of a special session will also mean that not only will lawmakers likely have to revise any personal travel plans they may have had, but they will also have to cancel any scheduled fundraising events while the legislature is meeting.
Lawmakers and the state’s constitutional officers including the governor, comptroller, attorney general and treasurer, are barred from soliciting or accepting donations during any session of the Maryland General Assembly.

Gov. Josh Shapiro and Utah Gov. Spencer Cox talk with moderator Savannah Guthrie at the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C. on Tuesday, Dec. 9. (Screen capture)Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Republican Gov. Spencer Cox of Utah belong to different parties. 
But the two sat down for a conversation moderated by NBC News anchor Savannah Guthrie at the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C. Tuesday to discuss partisanship, political violence, and how to respectfully engage with political opponents.
Both agreed that Americans need to find ways to recognize one another’s humanity, and disagree civilly. And both agreed the stakes were high.
“We’re passing all the checkpoints towards ultimately failed states and civil wars,” Cox said. “I hate using that phrase, but if we don’t make a course correction, that’s where this leads.”
Both, however, were hopeful.
“The answers to so much of the darkness that we see in America today is the light that ordinary Americans bring each day, oftentimes grounded in faith and in our shared humanity,” Shapiro said. “I think politicians would do well to take cues from the people we represent, to listen more to them, to see our shared humanity.”
The governors began their conversation by noting their commonalities: both are members of Generation X, fathers of four, married their high school sweethearts, and are known in their states for working across the aisle.
Both have also had to address some of the nation’s highest profile acts of political violence within their respective states in recent years.
In April, Shapiro and his family were the targets of an attack. On the first night of the Jewish Passover holiday, Cody Balmer of Dauphin County set off multiple molotov cocktails in the Governor’s Residence while Shapiro and his family slept inside.

The previous year, he also took the national stage to call for calm following the 2024 assassination attempt on then-presidential candidate Donald Trump in Butler. While Trump sustained a mild injury, one rally attendee and the shooter were killed, and two others were critically injured.
In September, Cox earned bipartisan praise for his response to the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at an event at Utah Valley University. Cox repudiated political violence across the partisan spectrum, and his calls for civility struck a stark contrast with some Republican politicians who blamed a “radical left.”
Cox said his words were shaped by a call from Shapiro following the shooting. 
“He told me to speak with moral clarity and to speak from the heart,” Cox said. “At that moment, we were two Americans who were deeply sad and struggling.”
Their conversation probed the roots of political violence and polarization in America. Though the two did not always agree on the causes or how to address it.
When discussing the role of politicians in shaping the national discourse, Shapiro focused directly on Trump.
“Here’s what we can not allow: for leaders who don’t act with moral clarity, remain silent about certain violence, or give a pass to others, because that is insidious, that is gasoline on the fire, and that leads to greater violence,” Shapiro said. “When you’re a governor, when you’re a president of the United States, you are looked to for that moral clarity. And we have a president of the United States right now who fails that test on a daily basis.”
Shapiro pointed to Trump’s response to the June killing of the former Democratic House Speaker of Minnesota, Melissa Hortman.
Asked after the shooting whether he called Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to discuss it, Trump said it “would be a waste of time” and called Walz “so whacked out.”
Months later in September, Trump was asked by a reporter why he didn’t order flags flown at half-staff for Hortman, like he did for Kirk. Trump said he wasn’t familiar, and suggested Walz never called him to ask.
Trump also pardoned more than 1,500 people accused or charged for their role in the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 election in his favor. That included 170 people charged with using deadly weapons, and dozens who plead guilty to assaulting police officers.
Cox acknowledged Trump’s combative political style, but said there are factors that go beyond the president for the rise in political violence in America in recent years.

“I’m not trying to play down his divisive rhetoric at all. I’m not going to do that,” Cox said. “But I am going to say this: If we think that a president of the United States or a governor is going to change where we are right now, we’re fooling ourselves. I truly believe that the people of our country are the ones who are going to have to change this. Our elected officials are a reflection on us.”
Cox also noted that, in private, Trump praised his calls for peace and bipartisanship following Kirk’s assassination.
“When I talked, when I shared so passionately about bringing our country together, he called me and he thanked me,” Cox said. “He said, ‘I appreciate that you said that and I liked that part.’”
When Cox discussed Trump, it was one of four points in his conversation with Shapiro that was interrupted by shouting audience members.
The other three all yelled, individually, when Shapiro was speaking, and at least one mentioned Gaza. Guthrie, the moderator, said interrupters would be removed.
Shapiro, the highest-ranking Jewish politician in the commonwealth, has faced particular scrutiny over his views of the war between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas, and his involvement in quelling protests on Pennsylvania college campuses.
Balmer, the man who was sentenced to 25 to 50 years after pleading guilty to firebombing the Governor’s Residence on a Jewish holiday, also said he was motivated by Shapiro’s views of the conflict.
“I’ll just thank the Cathedral for these amazing acoustics,” Shapiro said as one of the shouting audience members was removed. “I can’t hear a word of what these people are yelling about.”
The governors also discussed the role of social media in enabling partisanship and insulating people from those who disagree with them politically. 
“These are the opioid companies of the early 2000s,” Cox said.
Cox, whose state is suing several social media companies, including Snap and Meta, alleged social media products are designed to addict users, overrepresent polarizing content, and trap users in ideological echo chambers.
The Utah governor said he supports a ban on social media use for children under 16, modeled after a new law in Australia.
Shapiro, however, disagreed on the approach.
“I think the approach we’ve tried to take in Pennsylvania, led by our first lady, is to ensure that digital literacy is taught in our classrooms,” he said.
Though he did say special media companies should be “held accountable,” noting their products are addictive and are vectors of misinformation.
Cox said the disagreement on stage could be a model.
“I didn’t say he’s an evil person because he doesn’t want to ban social media,” Cox said. “The Constitution forces us to disagree within a framework, that we have to be able to build a coalition to pass a law.”
Near the end of the conversation, Cox discussed studies that have found Democrats and Republicans believe members of the other party are more likely to hold extreme beliefs than in reality.
Cox said the phenomenon is called the “perception gap.”
“That’s really dangerous,” Cox said. “It’s more dangerous when you put yourself in a cocoon surrounded by people who only agree with you, and then talk about people that you don’t really know … we have to find ways to be in a room together, to look each other in the eye, to have a conversation. Because when we do that, what we find out is we’re not as far apart as we thought we were.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Shapiro-and-Cox-1024x494.jpg,,,2025-12-09 23:56:24.343000

(Photo by Peter Hall/Capital-Star)President Donald Trump kicked off his midterm campaign to retain Republican control of the U.S. House with a rally Tuesday in one of Pennsylvania’s most competitive congressional districts.
Large banners reading “Lower Prices” and “Bigger Paychecks” flanked the stage at Mount Airy Casino Resort in Mount Pocono, Monroe County. That’s in Pennsylvania’s 8th Congressional District where Republican U.S. Rep. Rob Bresnahan is running for reelection in 2026.
The rally, Trump’s first since July, was billed as focusing on affordability, a topic that the president dismissed as a Democratic hoax. 
“They say ‘affordability,’ and everyone says, ‘Oh, that must mean Trump has high prices.’ No, our prices are coming down tremendously from the highest prices in the history of our country,” he said. 
Rising energy, food and housing costs, which have dogged consumers since the COVID-19 pandemic, are sure to be a central theme in next year’s congressional campaigns.
“I have no higher priority than making America affordable again, that’s what we’re going to do,” Trump said 13 minutes into his talk. “They caused the high prices, and we’re bringing them down. It’s a simple message.”
But with an apology to his speech writer, Trump delivered a wide-ranging 90-minute discourse on his administration’s first 10 months, including claims that he has ended eight wars and suggesting that the military deployment targeting drug boats in the Caribbean would soon move to land.
Trump also spoke about his 2024 presidential victory in Pennsylvania and the Republicans who flipped two of the commonwealth’s seats in Congress. He said  Chief of Staff Susie Wiles recently told him it was time to start campaigning.
“I said, ‘I won already.’ She said ‘We have to win the midterms, and you’re the guy that’s going to take us there,’” Trump said. 
Bresnahan (R-8th District) defeated Democratic incumbent Matt Cartwright in 2024. In the neighboring 7th District, which covers the Lehigh Valley and includes a sliver of Monroe County, U.S. Rep. Ryan Mackenzie defeated Democratic incumbent Susan Wild.
“We had victories up and down the ballot because people were sick and tired of four years of out of control inflation under Joe Biden, a wide open southern border and chaos all around the world,” Mackenzie said before Trump took the stage. “So what did they vote for? They voted for change.”
Bresnahan and Mackenzie won their contests by 2 percentage points and 1 point, respectively. And Trump carried Monroe County by less than one point, making the region a battleground in the fight for control of the U.S. House next year.
Mackenzie and Bresnahan, who also spoke before Trump, focused on the economic challenges facing their constituents including high prescription drug prices, skyrocketing electricity rates and workforce shortages.
“We know so many people are struggling because of those high prices from Joe Biden’s inflation. That does not mean that prices come down when we say that we tamed inflation, it just means that we have stopped the rate of growth … So we have a lot more work to be done,” Mackenzie said. He added two more years with Trump in the White House and Republicans controlling both chambers of Congress would get the country “back on track.”
Food prices have continued to increase during the first year of Trump’s term. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the price of food was 3.2% more in August than a year earlier. The overall consumer price index, which measures inflation across the economy, increased 2.9%. The USDA’s Economic Research Service predicts food costs will continue to rise in 2026, but more slowly than in the last year.
Bresnahan highlighted the tax cuts contained in the omnibus budget reconciliation bill that Trump signed into law in July. Those included tax exemptions for earnings from overtime and tips, a $6,000 tax credit for seniors and several other deductions and credits.
“The message is the same everywhere we go, lower the cost, support high paying jobs, keep our communities safe, and listen to the people doing the work. They aren’t asking for partisan arguments,” Bresnahan said, adding he was proud to vote for the legislation Trump dubbed his One Big Beautiful Bill. 
Electricity prices have also spiked as a result of fossil fuel power plants being retired as demand driven by the electrification of industry and transportation as the race to develop artificial intelligence drives a proliferation of power-hungry data centers.
Energy Secretary Chris Wright, a former fracking and mining industry executive, described the Biden administration’s energy policy as an “all out war on every form of energy.”
“He called it a war on climate change. But of course, that’s nonsense,” Wright said, noting that Trump’s energy policy prioritizes domestic sources and lower prices.
Shortly after taking office in January, Trump issued a slate of executive orders slashing incentives for renewable energy and directing the elimination of regulations and policies that give preference to wind and solar energy. He also reformed the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which Trump said in July would allow Pittsburgh-based Westinghouse to proceed with construction of new nuclear reactors across the country.
Last month Trump issued another executive order outlining the “Genesis Mission,” described as “a dedicated, coordinated national effort to unleash a new age of AI‑accelerated innovation and discovery.” 
“AI is going to be transformative for our country, and we cannot be second behind China,” Wright said.
Toward the end of his speech, Trump explained how tax exemptions for overtime and tips were putting thousands of dollars back in the pockets of regular Pennsylvanians. He called out a waitress from Stroudsburg, noting that she would keep hundreds of dollars each month that would help her support her daughter’s dream of becoming a veterinarian. 
Another woman accepted Trump’s invitation to take the stage after he described how the tax exemptions helped her and her husband keep more from their jobs.
“No tax on overtime is incredible for my husband, and it all comes back to our family. It saves us, and it’s for the future of our children,” the woman said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_6026-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-09 23:56:24.343000

Larson won about 70% of the vote to about 30% for Burns with all precincts reporting, according to the Secretary of State’s office. The House District 7 seat covers Calhoun, Pocahontas, and Sac counties, as well as a part of Webster County.
Larson celebrated her victory in a statement Tuesday, saying she was “very blessed to have the opportunity to serve House District 7.”
“Throughout this campaign, I vowed to be a common-sense, conservative leader for rural Iowa in the Statehouse,” Larson said. “I look forward to delivering on promises that I campaigned on, including protecting landowner rights, providing property tax relief, and protecting our children. I’m eager to carry the voices of House District 7 to Des Moines and deliver results for rural Iowa.”
The district holds significantly more Republican voters than Democrats — according data from the Iowa Secretary of State’s office, there are 55.1% of active registered voters in the area are registered Republicans, while 29.3% of voters do not have a party affiliation and just 15% are registered as Democrats.
The Iowa House District 7 special election was called in September by Gov. Kim Reynolds to fill the seat vacated by former Rep. Mike Sexton, R-Rockwell City. Sexton resigned from his legislative office to become the director of the Iowa U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Development office.

Larson, who ran against Sexton in the 2024 Republican primary, is a stay-at-home mother from Odebolt who serves as the chair of Femi’s Heart, a nonprofit focused on mental health advocacy and health care access created in honor of a heart transplant recipient. Larson’s daughter received a heart transplant when she was four months old in 2013.
House Speaker Pat Grassley congratulated Larson on her victory.
“Unsurprisingly, House District 7 awarded Wendy Larson a resounding victory today,” Grassley said in a statement. “Iowans continue to reject out-of-touch liberal agendas and opt instead for more of the common sense, freedom-loving approach you’ve come to know from Iowa House Republicans. We are proud to have a strong leader for House District 7 in Wendy Larson and we look forward to her joining us in the Iowa House.”
Burns, also from Odebolt, is a speech language pathologist who holds several positions serving her community, including as a volunteer firefighter and Emergency Medical Technician, as well as working as a medical examiner for Ida and Crawford counties. She has said she was motivated to run for the seat in a heavily GOP area by fellow Democrats and was encouraged by other Iowa Democrats’ successes in 2025, such as Democratic Sen. Catelin Drey‘s special election win in August.
There will be one more Iowa special election before the year ends. Voters in Iowa Senate District 16 will participate in a Dec. 30 special election to fill the seat left by Sen. Claire Celsi, who died in October after battling an undisclosed illness. Democrat Renee Hardman, a West Des Moines councilwoman and president and CEO of Lutheran Services in Iowa, is running against Republican Lucas Loftin, who serves on the boards of In His Light ministries and Homeschool Iowa, in the election.
Four other special elections have taken place earlier in 2025. Sen. Mike Zimmer of DeWitt and Drey of Sioux City, both Democrats, won in earlier Senate special elections. In the Iowa House, Rep. Blaine Watkins, R-Donnellson, won in a March special election, and Rep. Angelina Ramirez, D-Cedar Rapids, won in April.

Wilmington, DE – Officials, educators, and families packed a Brandywine School District workshop at Mt. Pleasant Elementary School on Monday, December 8th, to discuss redistricting proposals. This was a high-stakes discussion about how to redraw school district lines in Wilmington and northern New Castle County—changes that could reshape governance, funding, and opportunity for thousands of students.  The Multipurpose Room was overflowing with several hundred parents and community members.  Overflow went to the Cafeteria, which was also “standing room only”.  It was reported that another 600 participants joined via Zoom.

The session, led by members of the Redding Consortium for Educational Equity, focused on three redistricting options now under consideration and the broader effort to close deep academic gaps between low‑income and more affluent schools. Legislators emphasized that, while opinions differ sharply on how to move forward, the work is driven by a shared commitment to students.
“We may have different perspectives and different concerns, or different tactical ideas about how we get to the finish line,” said Jason Heller, President of the Brandywine School District Board. “But we all share the same fundamental goals in our heart—that every child, no matter where they live or their circumstances, receives the benefits of an excellent education and the opportunity to thrive.”
What the Redding Consortium is tasked to do
The Redding Consortium, created by the Delaware General Assembly in 2019, has a statutory mission to promote educational equity and improve outcomes for all pre‑K through 12 students in northern New Castle County, including the city of Wilmington. By law, one of its core responsibilities is to develop a redistricting proposal for Wilmington and the surrounding districts.
Senator Elizabeth “Tizzy” Lockman, Redding Consortium Co-Chair
“The consortium doesn’t have a choice about whether to propose a redistricting plan,” said Sen. Elizabeth “Tizzy” Lockman (D-SD, Consortium co‑chair. “It’s the consortium’s assigned job by law.” The legislation establishing the group passed unanimously in both chambers and has been amended several times since, also with unanimous votes, primarily to extend deadlines so that members could gather more data and public input.  Sen. Lockman was joined by co-chair Matt Denn (former Lt. Governor) and Representative Nnamdi Chukwuocha (D-RD1) as a guest legislator.  Several other legislators were present, including Sen. Dan Cruce (D-SD1) and, Rep. Melanie Ross Levin (D-RD10).  Sen. Ray Siegfreid (D-SD5) and Rep. Debra Heffernan (D-RD6) were present on Zoom.

To illustrate why the work is considered urgent, the presenters highlighted achievement data from Brandywine elementary schools. At the three schools with the lowest levels of student poverty, average reading proficiency is just over 54 percent and math proficiency just under 53 percent. At the three schools with the highest poverty levels, average reading proficiency falls to roughly 30 percent and math to about 27 percent—roughly half the rate of their more affluent counterparts.
“I doubt if there is anyone in this room who thinks those numbers are acceptable,” a presenter said. While noting that Brandywine’s disparities are smaller than those in some neighboring districts, they stressed that the pattern—achievement tracking closely with poverty—runs through northern New Castle County and is precisely what the consortium was formed to address.

“Fragmentation of school districts in and around the city of Wilmington has itself become a root cause that has worsened conditions… It just makes it harder for nonprofits and service agencies to do their work.” – Rep. Nnamdi Chukwuocha (guest legislator, speaking in support)

How any plan would move forward
Even once the consortium settles on a favored option, the redistricting plan will be advisory, not self‑executing. The process has multiple layers of review.
First, the consortium will recommend a specific, detailed plan to the State Board of Education. The state board must then undertake a full public process and vote on whether to approve it. Only if the state board gives its approval will the plan move to the General Assembly, which must also vote to adopt it. If the state board rejects or modifies the proposal, it would be sent back to the consortium to be revised.
By statute, the plan must also be highly specific. The law requires a “transition, resource, and implementation plan” covering 13 subject areas, including transportation strategy, detailed resource allocations from state, district, and local sources, and clear timelines and responsibilities for every phase of implementation. One non‑negotiable requirement, the presenters emphasized, is that no student currently attending a school will be forced to leave it because of boundary changes; students will be able to remain at their existing school through the school’s terminal grade.
Getting to the point of choosing a single set of district lines has been a slow process. Between the consortium’s full body and its four subcommittees, there have been 46 public meetings over the last three years. Members have methodically narrowed a wide range of possible maps to the three options now on the table, using criteria developed with community members and research partners.
The consortium is now weighing three broad redistricting models:


Brandywine–Red Clay option:


All four current districts—Brandywine, Red Clay, Christina, and Colonial—would keep their existing outer footprints. However, responsibility for educating Wilmington students now assigned to Christina and Colonial would shift to Red Clay and Brandywine. State funding tied to those students would follow them, and consortium leaders said their working assumption is that any additional costs related to higher‑need student populations would be covered by the state, not by the receiving districts.


Metropolitan Wilmington School District:


Brandywine and Red Clay would be consolidated into a single district serving the city of Wilmington and the suburbs currently within those two systems. Students from Christina and Colonial who live in the city would also be absorbed into this new metropolitan district.


Northern New Castle County Consolidated School District:


All four districts that currently serve Wilmington—Brandywine, Red Clay, Christina, and Colonial—would be combined into a single large district encompassing most of northern New Castle County.
Both consolidation options (options 2 & 3) seek to unify governance across a broader geography, while the Brandywine–Red Clay option keeps more pieces of the existing structure in place. In all three models, Christina would cease serving Wilmington students.
Promised benefits: more access, less fragmentation
Supporters of the consolidation concepts argue that they would create significant new opportunities for students by expanding access to specialized programs now locked within district boundaries, as well as shifting more dollars to classrooms.
Today, language immersion, gifted education, arts pathways, and career‑focused programs are often limited to students who live inside the hosting district or who can navigate complex choice and transportation hurdles. Under a consolidated northern county district, for example, Brandywine families could more easily access Red Clay’s magnet and charter programs, Christina’s Chinese immersion pathway, or Colonial’s early career offerings.
“More schools means more choices,” Sen. Lockman said. “Fewer boundaries means fewer hurdles of bureaucracy to navigate.” The stated goal is to maintain programs that are working well, while “scaling and improving access” rather than narrowing it.
On the financial side, the consortium has asked consultants to estimate both the costs of “leveling up” salaries—so that teachers, paraprofessionals, and other staff across merged districts would be paid at the highest existing rate—and the potential savings from reducing duplicative central‑office positions over time through attrition and transfers. Leaders were candid that, initially, the cost increases would likely outweigh savings but argued that the net effect would be to “give raises to a lot of school personnel who deserve them, and to shift the overall mix of funds away from district‑level administration and toward frontline educators.”

“We expect that the leveling-up part of the equation — which we anticipate the consortium will propose to be borne by the state, not the districts — will outweigh the savings. We’ll just say that up front.” – Sen. Tizzy Lockman

At the same time, Mr. Denn stressed that broader research on district size and performance is mixed, and that any decision must be grounded in careful analysis. Another noted that, while evidence on large‑district cost savings varies, there is clearer evidence that fragmented governance structures can depress outcomes and contribute to inequities—precisely the problem they say they are trying to solve in Wilmington.
Concerns about redistricting cost, scale, and risk
Board members voiced skepticism about whether consolidation at the scale being proposed could deliver either savings or better achievement. Jason Heller, BSD President, cited multiple studies and state reports indicating that large‑district mergers often increase costs due to transportation, salary equalization, and transition expenses, with little evidence of academic gains—particularly once districts grow beyond a moderate size.
BSD Board President, Jason Heller

“I haven’t been able to find any verifiable example where consolidation at this scale resulted in any cost savings. In fact… the research seems to point the other way.” – Jason Heller (Board President)

Referencing national data showing that each of the involved districts is already much larger than the typical U.S. school system, Mr. Heller warned that a fully merged northern New Castle County district would rank among the nation’s largest. “I feel like the metropolitan and countywide options are by far the highest‑risk options under consideration,” he said, asking how Wilmington’s context would differ from other large mergers that struggled.

“Show me the data that consolidation into a district of this size improves student achievement…there’s no real empirical evidence.” – Parent (referencing Memphis-Shelby merger & other studies)

In response, the consortium leaders said they had specifically tasked their financial consultants with reviewing the evidence from prior consolidations and applying it to Delaware’s data. They promised to release cost estimates and analysis before the consortium’s mid‑December vote.
“We did not come with counterexamples on savings tonight,” Sen. Lockman acknowledged, “but we know this is a completely legitimate question.” Another added that “coherent, academically focused governance does improve student outcomes,” stressing that careful design—not just lines on a map—would determine whether changes help or harm students.

“You keep saying ‘the state is going to pay.’ Who the heck do you think the state is?” – Ralph Ackerman (board) echoing a parent

Other board members questioned why, if governance complexity is central to the problem, vocational‑technical and charter schools are not being folded into the redistricting conversation. Some also challenged the idea that state leaders effectively legislated redistricting as the solution without first proving, with data, that moving lines would fix the underlying issues.
Students with disabilities and vulnerable learners
Families of students with disabilities were another focus of the discussion. Consolidation could broaden access to specialized staff and programs, giving parents more options when one school’s approach is not working. But larger bureaucracies can also feel more distant and harder to navigate for parents already fighting to secure services.
Presenters reported spending several hours with parents and advocates discussing these tradeoffs. “There wasn’t unanimity about which of the three options would be best for students with disabilities,” one co‑chair said. “But there was unanimity that, whatever option is chosen, a lot of time needs to be spent ensuring the specific needs of children with disabilities are protected in very concrete ways.”
Beyond boundaries: programs and investments
Consortium leaders repeatedly stressed that redrawing district lines is only one part of their charge. They outlined several programmatic ideas they hope to include in a comprehensive plan, contingent on cost and state support:

State‑funded, academically focused before‑ and after‑school programs in high‑needs schools across northern New Castle County.
New elementary programs in Wilmington schools, including a day‑long gifted model modeled on Brandywine’s Mount Pleasant and Claymont programs, an arts‑focused elementary program, and specialized supports for students with language‑based learning disabilities.
Expanded, high‑quality pre‑K in many or all elementary schools in any newly configured district.
Salary premiums for high‑quality teachers and paraprofessionals who commit to working in high‑needs city schools.
Possible reforms to choice and charter policies to ensure broader access to innovative school models.

Since 2021, the consortium has also advanced a series of funding recommendations already in place, directing what one leader estimated as roughly 93 percent of recommended dollars straight to the Department of Education and school districts for use in schools, rather than for the consortium’s own operations. “We’re proud of the programs that have been funded,” he said, emphasizing that students should not have to wait for structural reforms to begin seeing benefits.
What happens next
The December 16 vote is expected to narrow the field to a single redistricting model, around which the consortium will build a detailed proposal in the months that follow. Officials framed that decision point as both pivotal and only the start of the most intensive phase of their work.
“In some ways, this is just the beginning,” Sen. Lockman told the audience. “Ultimately, this work is about making sure the students who you and we care about have an opportunity to fulfill their potential and live out their dreams—not just some students, but all students in the greater New Castle County community.”
As the meeting moved into open discussion and board members began a round‑robin of questions, the underlying tension remained clear: nearly everyone in the room agreed that current outcomes for Wilmington’s most vulnerable students are unacceptable. The unresolved question is whether the sweeping changes now under consideration will truly create a fairer, more effective system—or introduce new instability into communities already under strain.  The concern that the Consortium was preparing to make a decision among the current options without either evidence of positive impacts of consolidation and without detailed financial analysis was echoed by MANY presenters in the Public Comment session.  After over 5 years of study, dozens – if not, hundreds – of meetings, there was clear concern that the process of moving from 9 options to 3 options to a recommendation lacked a clear, data-driven basis.

“If there’s a secret plan, nobody told me about it… I don’t know how I’m going to vote on the 16th.” – Former Lt. Gov. Matt Denn


“We are not proposing any school closures. We are not proposing any attendance-zone changes or forced busing.” – Sen. Tizzy Lockman

Public meetings will continue this week.  These meetings are a prelude to a Redding Consortium meeting scheduled for December 16th, where a decision between three proposals will be made and this recommendation will be sent to the State Board of Education and, then, the General Assembly for further consideration and action.

(Courtesy of the Nebraska Governor's Office)MEAD, Neb. — Years of private efforts to clean up wet cake pollution from a Nebraska ethanol plant that turned pesticide-coated seed corn into fuel inched in recent weeks toward resolution.
Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen on Tuesday visited with Mead residents to tout the state’s progress in working with six seed companies now running the former AltEn ethanol plant’s cleanup, the AltEn Facility Response Group.
Pillen told locals who have fought for state attention that he is proud of the work that removed a roughly 165,000-ton “mountain” of mixed material that included about 84,000 tons of contaminated byproduct. Work continues to clear polluted lagoons and groundwater.
Nebraska tried regulating AltEn into compliance but eventually shut it down in February 2021, filing a separate state-led lawsuit that year against the plant that is still being negotiated for settlement. A wastewater spill followed days later. Seed companies that had been working with the company took over cleanup.
Essentially, the company running AltEn had thought it could burn the seeds hot enough to leave no trace of the pesticides in the waste byproduct of fuel production, but tests found neonicotinoid levels too high.

Jesse Bradley, the director of the state’s water and environmental regulator, said much work remains to be done but that the state would continue to focus its work on safety for nearby residents of Mead.
The state says its next steps include remedial action plans and agreements for addressing remaining contaminated groundwater, solids in the lagoon pits and other soil that needs fixing.
Those steps, plus last month’s settlement of a separate federal lawsuit between agricultural chemical producers and the former plant and its overseers, could help resolve a separate state lawsuit that has been paused for settlement negotiations in Saunders County District Court.
The lawsuit, from the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office, accuses AltEn of using and improperly disposing of pesticide-treated seed corn, not ordinary field corn as its permit described, and alleges improper byproduct storage and disposal. 
Settlement details might not be disclosed, but court documents hint that the AltEn property’s current and future owners will have to accept restrictive environmental rules on the land and groundwater.
The Department of Water, Energy and Environment, the state’s water and environmental regulator, uses such regulatory tools to reduce the health risks of pollution to people and animals.
Part of the deal means that the state maintains access to check samples of the property’s land and water for contamination levels and monitor for problems that could impact water used for agriculture.
The deal placed limitations on the industrial property’s future use. Among them: restrictions that won’t let the land, even after remediation wraps up, be used for homes, schools or child care facilities.
Saunders County Board member Bill Reece, a member of the Mead group working with the state and seed companies on the cleanup effort, praised local resilience. Neighbors faced chemical smells, sores and more.
“They know their town is worth standing up for, and we’re glad to see the progress that has been made at AltEn,” he said. He credited the state and seed companies for keeping Mead residents in the loop.
The governor, who owns a hog operation based in Columbus, said cleanup of the AltEn site was among his “top” priorities since becoming governor in 2023. He is Nebraska’s first farmer-governor in more than a century. 
“I’m proud of the fact that when we got involved, a lot of people rolled up their sleeves and collaborated to fix this problem,” Pillen said. He stressed that the cleanup is privately funded.

Courtesy photo Democrats appeared to gain a northeast Georgia House seat during an off-year special election Tuesday in the latest sign of their growing momentum in the state. 
Democrat Eric Gisler, a tech executive and small business owner, was in the lead with 50.85% of the vote, according to unofficial results from the Secretary of State’s office. Republican candidate Mack “Dutch” Guest IV was nearly 200 votes behind, with 49.15% of the vote.
The district, which covers parts of Clarke and Oconee counties, has been under Republican control since 2019. Former state Rep. Marcus Wiedower, a Watkinsville Republican, abruptly resigned from his seat earlier this year to focus on his work as vice president of external affairs at the real estate firm Hillpointe. 
Gisler, who made affordability a key focus of this year’s campaign, previously challenged Wiedower in 2024, but received under 40% of the vote. This year, he credited his campaign’s success to his focus on issues like health care access and the rising cost of living, which he said likely appealed to some Republican voters.
“We had the right message in this time,” he said, adding that his opponent “ran on tired MAGA talking points.”
Guest, an Oconee County resident who helps run a Watkinsville-based transportation business, centered his campaign around protecting conservative values, as well as improving transportation, strengthening education and keeping communities safe. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday night.
Ken Martin, who chairs the Democratic National Committee, celebrated Gisler’s apparent victory.
“Fresh off the resounding victories in the Georgia Public Service Commissioner races and now this historic flip, the DNC will continue to invest, organize, and compete in every corner of Georgia,” he said in a statement.

Sears/Maryland Matters)The House and Senate welcomed two new members to their chambers Tuesday — just in time for a special legislative session next week.
In ceremonies a little more than an hour apart, Kevin Anderson (R-Lower Shore) was sworn in to fill the vacancy created by the October death of Del. Charles Otto (R-Lower Shore), and Del. Kevin Harris (D-Charles and Prince George’s) was elevated to the seat left open when then-Sen. Michael Jackson (D-Calvert, Charles and Prince George’s) became superintendent of the Maryland State Police.
The swearing-in ceremonies came just hours before Gov. Wes Moore (D) issued an executive order calling lawmakers into a Dec. 16 special session to elect a new speaker of the House.

Anderson was appointed in late November to fill the District 38A seat held by Otto, who had just filed to seek election to a fifth term when he died.
“This is a bittersweet moment for myself, because my wife and I worked hard for Charles Otto to be a delegate and represent our district,” Anderson said in comments following the morning ceremony.
He was sworn in by House Speaker Pro Tem Del. Dana Stein (D-Baltimore County) who has temporarily assumed leadership of the House after Del. Adrienne Jones announced in a statement last week that she was stepping down as speaker after more than six years on the rostrum.
Anderson, a father of two, is a fourth-generation farmer and owns and operates a farm and seed business.
But early in life, he considered a faster path.
“The only other thing I wanted to do in my life besides farming was race cars,” Anderson said in a 2013 interview. “So, when I decided that racing cars was a little bit like a drug addiction, I decided I’d better find something else to do and my second love was farming.”
Anderson – who shares a name with the former secretary of the Department of Commerce — attended Washington High School in Princess Anne and the McDonogh School in Owings Mills, and the University of Maryland College Park.
With the swearing-in of Anderson, the 141-member House is now one shy of full strength: When Harris became Sen. Kevin Harris Tuesday, it opened the District 27A seat he had held since January 2023.

“As I embark on this new chapter, I’m committed to working diligently for the prosperity of District 27,” Harris said in comments following his swearing-in shortly after noon.
“Together, we strive to secure a bright and hopeful future for every resident. This is just the beginning, and with the continued support, I am confident that we can accomplish extraordinary things for our community,” he said.
His predecessor, Jackson, was on hand for the ceremony, but wearing the uniform of a Maryland State Police colonel. Jackson, a 10-year veteran of the legislature who previously served two terms as Prince George’s County sheriff, was named by Moore in October to head the Maryland State Police.
Harris, 44, was born in Newark, New Jersey. He earned a bachelor’s degree in business administration from Washington Bible College and a master’s degree in leadership development from Walden University. He served in the U.S. Navy for a decade and is now employed as a project manager for a defense contractor.
With Harris on board, the Senate is back to its full contingent of 47 members.

Tony Evers announced Tuesday that he has signed 34 bills into law, including a bill requiring judges to sentence offenders to at least 10 years in prison if convicted of a human trafficking crime and 15 years for a child trafficking crime. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers announced Tuesday that he has signed 34 bills into law, including a bill requiring judges to sentence offenders to at least 10 years in prison if convicted of a human trafficking crime and 15 years for a child trafficking crime. 
The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
“Crimes of this nature — most especially when it comes to our kids — should be punishable by the full extent of the law,” Evers said in a statement. “With this bill, we are helping ensure that we’re protecting some of our most vulnerable youth and holding predators accountable, most especially when they prey on our kids.”
The bill includes increases to the maximum amounts of prison time a person can receive for human and child trafficking crimes, and it allows more time for prosecution of human trafficking crimes. 
Human trafficking involves using force, fraud or coercion for labor, services or a commercial sex act. Trafficking of a child can involve a knowing attempt to recruit a child for commercial sex acts. Wisconsin trafficking law also bans benefiting from trafficking or knowingly receiving compensation from the earnings of debt bondage, a prostitute or a commercial sex act. 
Last month, the Wisconsin Examiner reported on lawmakers’ reasons for supporting the bill, such as preventing human traffickers from doing further harm. Rep. Jerry O’Connor (R-Fond Du Lac) cited cases that appeared to have taken place in other states in which people convicted of sex trafficking received between six and eight years in prison. 
The Examiner reported on criminal justice advocacy groups and attorneys’ criticisms of the mandatory minimums, including a concern from attorneys that judges would sentence people who are trafficking victims themselves to the mandatory minimum punishment without being able to consider whether the person deserved a lighter sentence because their trafficking crime was influenced by their trafficker. The bill didn’t contain an exception to the mandatory minimum for that type of situation. While Wisconsin law allows a defense in court for people who committed a crime as a “direct result” of trafficking, that didn’t allay critics’ concerns.
The anti-sex trafficking organization Shared Hope International gave Wisconsin law failing grades on multiple categories relevant to survivors of child sex trafficking: “protection from unjust criminalization,” “legal relief” and “survivor-centered supports.” The analysis was based on laws enacted as of July 1.

(Photo courtesy of Stevenson-Carson School District)After letting funding lapse for nearly two years, Congress voted to renew crucial federal funding that rural counties and schools have counted on for a quarter century.
The U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday evening voted 399-5 to reauthorize the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act through September 2026, and to provide lapsed payments for the 2024 and 2025 fiscal years. The vote came after a year-long campaign led by bipartisan federal lawmakers from the West.
The U.S. Senate in June unanimously voted to reauthorize the act. It now goes to the president to be signed into law.
“The Secure Rural Schools program has been a lifeline for rural communities across Oregon since I originally authored the program back in 2000,” Oregon’s U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat, said in a statement. “I’m relieved the House has finally done its job with the long-overdue passage of my bill to return the safety net for critical services to communities that need it the most.”
Wyden co-authored the original law that provided tens of millions each year for rural schools and communities that previously benefited from revenue generated by natural resource industries on public lands. Since then, it has provided $7 billion in payments to more than 700 counties and 4,400 school districts across 40 states and Puerto Rico that have large swaths of federal land within their borders.
Oregon, where more than half of the state consists of federal land, has experienced the biggest loss of any state since the funding lapsed in 2023: nearly $48.7 million in money for rural roads, public services and schools, according to a September report from the D.C.-based Center for American Progress, a liberal public policy and think tank. Idaho has missed out on $21.3 million, Alaska more than $12.6 million and Washington more than $14.7 million.
Overall, states have lost out on more than $207 million in the two years since the act expired, the Center for American Progress found.
Twice since December 2024, the Senate has voted to renew the act in an effort led by Wyden and Idaho’s senior U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, a Republican.
But each time the Senate approved it, the House failed to take a vote. The bill lapsed in 2023 and counties haven’t gotten payments since early 2024. House Republicans most recently failed to reauthorize the act in the tax and spending cut megalaw they passed in July.
With just weeks before the House is due to wrap its work for the year, Wyden, Crapo and 83 bipartisan lawmakers from the Senate and the House sent a letter to U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat from New York, urging them to take a vote on the act before they recessed.
Just 12 hours after receiving the letter, the House announced it would fast-track consideration and a vote on the bill.
Washington’s U.S. Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, a Democrat representing southwest Washington’s 3rd Congressional District, led the passage of the bill in the House.
“The Secure Rural Schools program is absolutely critical, and the passage of this legislation is beyond overdue,” she said in a statement. “Candidly, the only reason it took this long is because way too many folks in D.C. have been blissfully ignorant about how disastrous the lapse of SRS has been for timber communities in Southwest Washington and across the West. Schools have closed up, teachers have been laid off, and our kids have been left footing the bill for Congress’s neglect.”
Since the funding lapsed, schools in Skamania County in her district have laid off staff and a middle school was forced to close.
In Alaska, the failure to reauthorize the program caused rural school districts to cut their budgets, particularly in southeast Alaska, home to the vast Tongass National Forest.
Rep. Nick Begich, R-Alaska, voted for the bill on Friday, and both of the state’s senators — Republicans Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan — supported it as well.

The Public Service Commission regulates monopoly utilities in Montana, but NorthWestern Energy leaves the agency in the dark, fails to ask it for approvals, and fires off requests at the last minute without adequate information, said Jenny Harbine, representing the Montana Environmental Information Center.
In this case, NorthWestern wants the Public Service Commission to approve a request that it be allowed to temporarily tap a customer credit to pay for operations and maintenance costs for part of its new shares at Colstrip — a request the utility acknowledges is “unusual.” NorthWestern said it wants to use some revenue from the new “excess capacity” to offset those costs.
On Jan. 1, 2026, NorthWestern will control 55% of the coal-fired electricity plant at Colstrip following its acquisition of shares from Avista Corp and Puget Sound Energy. NorthWestern has announced different plans for the separate acquisitions — both controversial.
NorthWestern set up a shell company to control the Puget Sound Energy shares in a move both the Public Service Commission and the Montana Environmental Information Center have contested with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
Tuesday, the Public Service Commission took up the utility’s plan for the Avista shares in a request the Montana Consumer Counsel described as “confusing” and one commissioner said was part of a “dumpster fire” related to NorthWestern’s treatment of the new acquisitions.
Both the Montana Environmental Information Center and the Montana Consumer Counsel described the proposal as “unprecedented.”
Harbine, a lawyer with Earthjustice, said the proposal isn’t justified for several reasons. She said it could have been made three years earlier, when the utility announced the acquisition, but it’s coming at the last minute instead, and without any evidence besides a two-page affidavit.
“Now, (NorthWestern) asks the commission for extraordinary and unprecedented rate treatment for that share in order to avoid purported harm to the company, and without any discussion of the impact to ratepayers of the proposal,” Harbine said.
When NorthWestern Energy has extra energy, it can sell that generation, and revenue from those contracts is typically counted as credit to customers. In this case, NorthWestern is arguing it needs a “limited carveout” to use income from three contracts associated with its new Avista shares to cover the new costs of operations.
“NorthWestern justifies its 11th-hour request in this docket by claiming an urgent need to cover significant fixed costs, around $18 million …” Harbine said. “But NorthWestern’s proposal seeks to solve a problem — if there is one — of NorthWestern’s own making.”
The utility hasn’t provided the facts that back up its case, and there is no statute or regulation that authorizes its proposal to use funds “owed to customers” for operations and maintenance, Harbine said.
Harbine said NorthWestern argues it isn’t charging customers directly, but she said it’s still asking to take money that should go to them, so to customers, “it’s a distinction without a difference.”
“The result is the same, which is that customers are paying for costs that may or may not be prudent for an asset that may or may not be, in its entirety, used and useful,” Harbine said.
Harbine also said the purpose of a “true up” proposal is to ensure deferred costs and credits are reasonable — but NorthWestern Energy is using it to handle a new source of generation, adding more of Colstrip to its portfolio.
She said the utility has other ways to properly present the issue to the Public Service Commission, ones that aren’t “true up” proposals and would allow regulatory scrutiny, but NorthWestern has opted against them.
On behalf of NorthWestern Energy, however, lawyer Mike Green said the proposal protects both customers and the utility itself. Green said the request is “unusual,” but it comes out of “unique circumstances.”
On Jan. 1, 2026, NorthWestern will acquire 222 megawatts at Colstrip for “zero capital costs,” Green said. As a result, the utility believes it will have enough capacity to serve customers, meet its regional resource obligations, and sell excess power into the market.
(Both Avista and Puget operate in the state of Washington, which banned the use of coal-generated electricity for its customers by the end of this year. But Avista said it wanted to exit Colstrip anyway because continuing to operate it wasn’t economically feasible, according to the Spokesman Review.)
But Green said the acquisition won’t provide “any return to the company or its shareholders” right away. So he said the proposal to the Public Service Commission allows the utility the chance to minimize losses and try to break even until new rates are put in place.
“We hope the commission and interveners will ultimately view this waiver request as a way to support NorthWestern’s decision to place its customers’ interest ahead of its own with this acquisition,” Green said.
He said if the Public Service Commission doesn’t approve the waiver, it will mean customers get all the benefits of the Avista acquisition, and NorthWestern suffers all the costs and burden. But he said the revenue NorthWestern wants wouldn’t exist without the additional capacity in the first place.
If there’s a shortfall, he said, NorthWestern will bear that burden.
Green said some people want to know the reason NorthWestern Energy is treating the shares from Puget differently, and he said the difference is the Avista shares were identified as a “needed resource” in 2023, and they’re needed today.
But he said that isn’t the case with the Puget shares, so NorthWestern is holding those shares “outside the utility,” also, he argued, to protect customers. But he said the utility’s decision about Puget should not affect the Public Service Commission’s decision about the Avista shares.
Green agreed the utility had other options besides a “true up” docket for presenting the matter to the Public Service Commission, but he said intervenors have contested NorthWestern Energy in other types of cases, and it is difficult to reach settlements with them.
Jason Brown, on behalf of the Montana Consumer Counsel, said although he takes some responsibility for not understanding all of the pieces of the proposal from NorthWestern, he said the utility takes responsibility as well for “waiting so long to address this” and for using “vague and confusing terms” to explain its case.
He said one primary issue is addressing “so much excess capacity” at NorthWestern after it has been in a deficit for so long —  but he said “there are market risks and other problems associated with being long.”
For one thing, he said, it’s important for NorthWestern to avoid selling power at a loss, and it would be problematic for the new buyers to pay less for power than existing consumers pay.
Brown also agreed existing customers shouldn’t be responsible for shortfalls if the negotiated contracts don’t cover the actual cost of service — but he said that commitment shouldn’t be considered a concession by NorthWestern.
He said he is concerned about costs not being fully accounted for, and with the dearth of evidence from NorthWestern, many questions remain. He said the utility had plenty of time to address the questions, but its delay shouldn’t mean others have to hurry.
“The failure to address this sooner should not become a reason for rushed decision-making,” Brown said.
Commissioner Brad Molnar, who said “it’s basically been a dumpster fire” ever since the Public Service Commission learned about the proposal, said NorthWestern’s actions in withholding information about its plans for the new Colstrip shares and trying to dodge regulation hurt its credibility — prompting Commission Vice President Jennifer Fielder to ask Molnar to avoid “inflammatory remarks.”

According to Johnson, the federal permitting process “has failed to ensure project permitting is on-time and on-task.”
“Oftentimes, the root causes of delays in the environmental review process have little to do with questions about environmental protection and a lot to do with failure to embrace modern technology and move on from legacy bureaucratic approaches, like paper forms,” Johnson’s office said in a news release.
Johnson’s ePermit Act would establish a framework for agencies to implement a digital permitting system and unified portal, his office said.

(Photo courtesy of Pete Serrano, via X)Pete Serrano’s time as a federal prosecutor in eastern Washington ended Tuesday. 
His tenure with the U.S. Department of Justice may not be over.
Tuesday marked Serrano’s final day as interim United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Washington. He was appointed on Aug. 6 and sworn in five days later. He could serve up to 120 days while awaiting confirmation.
But President Donald Trump never nominated Serrano, a Republican and 2024 candidate for state attorney general. Even had Trump done so, Serrano knew success was a long shot.
That’s because Patty Murray, Washington’s senior Democratic senator, opposed his selection and declared in August that she would use a Senate maneuver known as the “blue slip” process to prevent the Pasco lawyer from getting confirmed to the federal post.
Yet Serrano could soon be back in the job temporarily. 
Judges in the Eastern District can act to reappoint him as the U.S. attorney until the position is filled. There would be no time limit on his service.
Or, the judges could appoint someone else. They’ll need to file a notice with the court clerk of any decision.
Another possibility is the Trump administration finds Serrano a different federal position that does not require Senate confirmation.
Serrano did not respond to multiple requests for comment this week.
In the past, he pointed to the experience of Alina Habba, the president’s ill-fated choice to be New Jersey’s top federal prosecutor, as a parallel to what might lie ahead.
Habba was appointed in March, but New Jersey’s two Democratic U.S. senators, Cory Booker and Andy Kim, declined to submit a blue slip supporting her confirmation. When her 120 days ran out, the U.S. District Court in New Jersey appointed a replacement rather than retain her.
Since then, Habba, a former personal attorney for the president, has been engaged in an unsuccessful legal battle to remain in the job. She resigned Monday a week after a federal appeals court ruled against her. 
But that same day, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi hired her as a senior adviser.
Serrano moved to Pasco in 2015 with his family. He worked as an environmental lawyer for the U.S. Department of Energy and at Energy Northwest before founding the conservative nonprofit Silent Majority Foundation, which has unsuccessfully challenged the state’s gun restrictions and COVID mandates. 
Serrano was elected to the Pasco City Council in 2017 and re-elected in 2021. He was running unopposed for re-election at the time of the appointment. He resigned from the city position in August. Because it was too late to have his name removed from ballots, he won and, if he chooses to be sworn in again, will be able to take part in the council’s Jan. 5 meeting.
Serrano’s exit, even briefly, represents the latest command change for the U.S. attorney’s office in eastern Washington.
He is the third person to hold down the job this year. Serrano took over for acting U.S. Attorney Stephanie Van Marter, who assumed the position in July following the resignation of Richard Barker as the acting federal prosecutor. 
There are 93 U.S. attorneys nationwide. They prosecute federal criminal cases and work on civil litigation involving the federal government. Serrano supervised a staff of approximately 79 prosecutors, civil litigators, and support personnel, according to the Department of Justice.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/pete-serrano-swearing-in-1024x807.jpeg,,,2025-12-09 20:56:50.894499

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)The owner of a south Bismarck property leased to the Attorney General’s Office will pay the state over $14,000 to settle financial discrepancies related to a building project spearheaded by Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem’s administration.
The payment came up Tuesday during a meeting of the Legislative Audit and Fiscal Review Committee, which asked for additional information about the building project during its August meeting.
The Attorney General’s Office selected the Burlington Drive building around 2019 to become office space for several agency divisions. The building became controversial in part because of Rep. Jason Dockter’s role as a co-owner. The Bismarck Republican was later convicted of a conflict of interest misdemeanor and found to have committed three ethics violations.
Lawmakers attempt to clear up unanswered questions over attorney general building lease

After Stenehjem’s death in 2022, incoming Attorney General Drew Wrigley alerted state officials to concerns about the project’s finances. Despite a limited review by the state auditor and an outside investigation, the Ethics Commission in a June report said there are still unanswered questions about the building deal.
The Attorney General’s Office disputes the Ethics Commission’s report and told lawmakers in an August meeting the agency has long considered the project settled. However, an attorney for building owner Stealth Properties LLC at the time said he wasn’t aware the office considered the project reconciled.
Due to discrepancies between the Attorney General’s Office and Stealth Properties’ records, the state concluded it had overpaid Stealth an estimated $14,600 related to lease payments. Stealth calculated it had already fully paid the state, however.
While Chief Deputy Attorney General Claire Ness in a Nov. 4 memo said the Attorney General’s Office was willing to give up pursuing the $14,600 to avoid litigation, an attorney representing Stealth Properties on Tuesday said the agency and Stealth had since met to work the issue out. 
Stealth agreed to pay the money so that the parties could move on, the attorney, Monte Rogneby, said.
“Stealth was uncomfortable with the public record being that there’s some disagreement between the Attorney General’s Office and Stealth,” Rogneby told lawmakers.
North Dakota Ethics Commission makes first finding of violations by public official

The Attorney General’s Office years ago ordered extensive renovations to the Burlington Drive property, which it initially decided to pay during the 2019-2021 biennium based on cost estimates, Rogneby said.
“Everybody understood that it was an estimate, and when the building was done, there would have to be a reconciliation,” he said. 
The remodeling cost $1.7 million more than the parties had initially anticipated. The Attorney General’s Office dipped into several funding sources from within its budget to cover about $1.3 million of those additional costs, according to Ness’s Nov. 4 memo. It paid the other $400,000 by agreeing to pay a larger monthly rent to Stealth.
After learning that the building project exceeded its initial cost estimate, Wrigley informed the Legislative Audit and Fiscal Review Committee.
That led to a review by State Auditor Josh Gallion and a third-party investigation by the Montana Division of Criminal Investigation. The Montana investigator said his probe was limited by a lack of subpoena power. Mountrail County State’s Attorney Wade Enget then reviewed the Montana report, but said questions about the building project were beyond the scope of his inquiry and suggested additional investigation.
Rogneby said that the State Auditor’s Office’s report was based on incomplete financial records. He said he later provided additional records to the Attorney General’s Office and Legislative Audit and Fiscal Review Committee, including invoices, that ultimately allowed the parties to settle the construction costs.
The parties discovered the Attorney General’s Office had overpaid. Ness’s Nov. 4 memo says the Attorney General’s Office recovered more than $530,000 from Stealth.
Sen. Kathy Hogan, D-Fargo, asked during the committee meeting if the North Dakota Ethics Commission’s investigation had access to the additional records Rogneby referred to. She said maybe those records could answer the remaining financial questions the Ethics Commission raised in its June report.
But Pat Monson, a retired attorney who was hired by the North Dakota Ethics Commission to investigate Dockter, said the commission did have access to the records at the time of its investigation.
“We had all the documents,” Monson, who was a trial attorney for nearly 50 years, said. “It was just that the documents didn’t necessarily support the numbers.”
She said the lack of documentation raises doubts about how taxpayer money was spent.
North Dakota ethics attorney calls out AG’s Office; lawmakers call for civility

Ness said during the meeting the Attorney General’s Office did not pay Stealth any money that was not backed up by an invoice.
Lawmakers during the August meeting asked the Attorney General’s Office for a written agreement between the agency and Stealth showing both parties consider the project reconciled. 
Ness said the agency has email correspondence with Stealth showing the matter is settled and a legal memorandum on the reconciliation signed by both parties is not necessary.
“A reconciliation is not a settlement agreement, so that’s just not going to exist,” Ness said.
The committee on Tuesday did not take further action. Several lawmakers said the matter had been thoroughly investigated and urged the committee to move on.
“There’s no ‘there’ there anymore,” said Rep. Mike Nathe, R-Bismarck. “There was in the beginning, but there’s not now.”

(Annie Knox, Utah News Dispatch)The man who was arrested in a fatal shooting at a Utah No Kings protest in June, though prosecutors now say he committed no crime, said Tuesday he carried a rifle at the protest to peacefully exercise his First and Second Amendment rights and didn’t plan to harm anyone.  
“I did not fire a single shot. I did not have any ammunition in the rifle. However, the blame was placed squarely on my shoulders,” Arturo Gamboa told reporters in a measured voice, speaking publicly about the shooting and his subsequent arrest for the first time.

Salt Lake City police arrested him for investigation of murder at the June 14 protest, saying an armed safety volunteer saw Gamboa “manipulate” his rifle and shot at Gamboa, wounding him and accidentally killing innocent bystander Afa Ah Loo in the process. 
Nearly six months after the protest, Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill announced last week he would not charge Gamboa with any crime. The same day, Gill filed a charge of manslaughter against the safety volunteer, Matthew Scott Alder, in the death of Ah Loo. 
Gamboa spent six days in jail, his attorney noted Tuesday, but Alder has not spent any time behind bars as authorities say he has cooperated with them. 
His attorney Greg Skordas told reporters his client was a victim. Skordas displayed large pictures at the news conference of two wounds from a bullet entering and exiting Gamboa’s abdomen, saying they illustrate that Gamboa was “bent down when he’s shot. He’s running for his life when he’s shot.”

Skordas said he understands why some people were alarmed when they saw Gamboa carrying a gun at the protest in Salt Lake City. 
“But what caused some concern in this case wasn’t Arturo carrying a gun, so much as a large Hispanic man was carrying a gun,” Skordas said. 
Asked if he believes racial bias played a role, Gamboa referenced a history of such bias against people of color in the United States and said, “I have no doubt that played a factor because it has always played a factor.” 
He told reporters he believes “the reality of the situation is that you will see those biases once again in the leniency that is shown to the perpetrator, rather than what was shown to me.
He wants to recoup medical debt of more than $10,000 but isn’t suing anyone yet, Skordas said, because he doesn’t want to interfere with Ah Loo’s family recovering any damages they may be entitled to. 
Gamboa described being shackled while in jail, wearing handcuffs, a waste chain, leg cuffs, and wearing a chain leash. 
He spoke of “irreparable damage to your psyche, to have never had encounters with police outside of trying to demand justice for oppression and wrongdoings, but to never have been in a jail facility, never been into a prison, to then be chained and bound.” 
He said he wants to see large-scale changes to the prison system and to laws giving police broad immunity from liability, though he didn’t suggest specifics. 
On a personal level, he said, “I think that it’s going to be a lot of healing, a lot of therapy.” Given the international publicity of the case, Gamboa added, “my life is forever changed.”

(Dan Forer | Getty Images)Democratic lawmakers are proposing a bill to ensure that school districts get reimbursed for their special education costs at the rates projected when the current state budget was signed. 
The 2025-27 state budget, passed by the state Legislature and signed by Gov. Tony Evers in July, provided funding that was estimated to bring the reimbursement rate to a historic 42% in the first year of the budget and 45% in the second year. However, recent estimates show the funding set aside will not be enough to meet that rate.
Wisconsin currently uses a “sum certain” funding model for its special education reimbursement rate, meaning payments to schools come from a fixed pot of money set aside in the budget. If schools spend more than estimated, there is no increase in reimbursement and the rate falls. 
The Department of Public Instruction notified school districts in November that the initial special education reimbursement payments this year will be about 35% of their costs. This will not be the final reimbursement rate.
The Democratic bill would change state education funding to a sum sufficient model, meaning the amount of money provided by the state would meet shifting costs to maintain a set reimbursement rate.
Rep. Angelina Cruz (D-Racine) said in a statement that the bill gives Republican lawmakers the opportunity to “prove” that they were serious about providing a special education reimbursement at the rate that they proposed in the budget.
“Imagine your employer choosing to pay you for less than half of the work you’ve done,” Cruz said. “That’s the position we’re putting our public schools in. This level of reimbursement is not what our schools want or need, and it’s not what our children with disabilities deserve. At the very least, we must keep our promise.”
Rep. Christian Phelps (D-Eau Claire) said school districts deserve a higher reimbursement rate, noting that many advocates including state Superintendent Jill Underly called for a 90% reimbursement rate in the state budget, and Democratic lawmakers, who are seeking to win control of the Legislature in 2026, would pursue making that a reality in the future. 
“When Democrats control the Legislature, we will fight for full, fair funding in the budget. But right now, this bill ends the broken promises,” Phelps said. “It prevents another year of shortfalls and tells kids, families and districts that they can count on the state to keep its word.”

Summer nuclear site near Jenkinsville, South Carolina. (Photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)
A day after inking a $2.7 billion deal to lead South Carolina’s nuclear reboot, executives of a New York investment firm were in the Palmetto State to talk about what drew them to the multibillion-dollar undertaking.
Hundreds gathered Tuesday on the floor of Colonial Life Arena in Columbia to hear from South Carolina utility executives, legislators and leadership of Brookfield Asset Management — the winning bid holder selected to restart construction on two abandoned reactors at the V.C. Summer nuclear plant in Fairfield County.
“It’s a bit of a no-brainer for us,” Mitch Davidson, a managing partner in Brookfield’s Renewable Power and Transition Group, told the crowd at the second annual nuclear summit.
In October, Brookfield, its subsidiary Westinghouse and Canada-based Cameco inked a partnership deal valued at $80 billion with the U.S. government. The companies will build 10 reactors identical to those at V.C. Summer.
South Carolina’s reactors could be the first and second on the list.
Three Mile Island restart project gets a $1 billion federal loan

“There are parts of this project that are already there, big parts that are there — equipment is there, foundations are there,” Davidson told the SC Daily Gazette. “So this seems to be the perfect opportunity for us as a start.”
The companies involved still have at least six months’ worth of engineering and financial feasibility studies to determine whether the project — a black mark on the state for nearly a decade — stands a chance of ever getting done.
“I’m not going to tell you that we’re able to do it faster. That’s all things that we have to determine,” Davidson said. “But you would think, because it’s already partially built, that you can do quicker, faster, cheaper.”
And according to the leaders of Santee Cooper, if it happens, it will be done differently this time.
“This is not going to be on the backs of rate payers. It’s not going to be on the backs of our taxpayers in the state,” said board chairman Peter McCoy, who’s led the utility since 2021.
He draws a distinction from the debacle he investigated as a House committee chairman, then prosecuted as U.S. attorney.
“This is private business stepping up, with help from the federal government,” McCoy said.
Santee Cooper and the now defunct South Carolina Electric & Gas started construction on the two first-of-their-kind nuclear reactors alongside an existing unit near rural Jenkinsville in early 2013. But the project was riddled with delays, cost overruns and fraud that led to multiple federal convictions of former executives.
The utilities scrapped the plant’s expansion in 2017, but not before jointly spending $9 billion on the reactors that never produced a megawatt.
As part of the restart, Santee Cooper and its customers won’t put a single cent more into construction. The utility will, however, retain a 25% ownership interest in the expansion should it be successful, allowing it to buy, at cost, a portion of power produced to sell to its customers.
Davidson said this arrangement works differently than historical nuclear projects because it’s not just utilities and their customers putting their pocketbooks on the line. There are more parties involved so the financial risk gets chopped into smaller pieces.

“I work with utility companies around the United States, and I would tell you that all of them are very focused on this project,” said John Cogan of Centerview Partners, financial advisors to state-owned utility Santee Cooper amid the sale effort. “They see Jenkinsville as the rebirth of the nuclear renaissance in the United States.”
And the driver behind this “renaissance,” according to the panelists, is the massive demand for electricity coming from major industrial users — namely, data centers.
“We haven’t seen load growth, like true load growth, in this country for a decade,” Davidson said. “The data centers have been the driver behind all of this. The data centers, and the size that they’re getting to today, are the genesis.”
That’s why tech giants, such as Microsoft, have taken an interest and been willing to act as financial partners in the restart of retired nuclear reactors in places such as Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island.
“We’ve got to make sure that we build these power plants efficiently and at a reasonable price,” Davidson said.
Especially, he added, if the United States wants to continue to play host to these massive data centers and the advancements in artificial intelligence that the centers make possible.

A deadly prion disease is taking off at Dell Creek Feedground, and the next four months could be pivotal and a harbinger of what’s to come for thousands of Wyoming elk. 
The post Summer elk deaths stoke CWD worries at onset of ‘important’ winter for western Wyoming herds appeared first on WyoFile .","After the snow burned off at the tail end of last winter, some 480 elk wandered away from the Dell Creek Feedground.
The tawny ungulates left tight quarters at the 35-acre feeding site north of Bondurant, migrating toward their summer ranges high in the Gros Ventre Range and beyond. Most of the elk went off to points unknown, and their individual fates, likewise, remain unknown. 
But 14 of the adult female elk departed with tracking collars. And three of them — over 20% of the tracked animals — died in the high country in the months that followed. Cow elk, which can live over 20 years, rarely keel over in the summer, a season when adult elk are least likely to die.
Wyoming biologists were unable to reach the cow elk carcasses before nature and decomposition ran its course. A critical datapoint — whether the elk died from or carried always-lethal chronic wasting disease — was unretrievable. 
“Although they reached the carcasses within a couple of days of the mortality signal, the carcasses had been completely scavenged, and no samples were available,” Wyoming Game and Fish Department staffers wrote in response to emailed questions. 
The state agency declined a verbal interview for this story. 
The unusual summertime mortalities added to suspicions that the degenerative, incurable prion disease was continuing to advance in the elk population that uses the Dell Creek Feedground. Infected animals were found within Wyoming’s feedground system for the first time and at four locations in the winter of 2024/’25, but signs pointed toward Dell Creek elk being the farthest along in the CWD epidemic’s curve. 
The scavenged dead bull and cow elk pictured were discovered over the weekend of Feb. 22-23, 2025 on the Dell Creek Feedground. The bull tested positive for chronic wasting disease, while the cow is suspected to have succumbed to CWD. (Wyoming Game and Fish Department)
Over the winter there were six dead CWD-positive animals found within or immediately adjacent to the Bondurant-area feedground, which operates on permitted Bridger-Teton National Forest land. Although that is just 1.3% of the elk tallied at Dell Creek last winter, many more likely have the disease and are destined to die in the months and years ahead. 
“Given how long elk can live with the disease, your minimum prevalence is going to be four times [higher than 1.3%],” said Hank Edwards, a retired Game and Fish Wildlife Health Laboratory supervisor. “It’s closer to 5%, probably.” 
An elk herd with 5% prevalence of chronic wasting disease in itself wouldn’t be alarming. Statewide, 3% of elk tested positive for the malady last year, and there are Wyoming elk herds that have sustained, and even thrived with, low rates of the disease for decades. 
The worrisome factor is where disease rates go from here. When it infects big proportions of a herd, CWD has the capacity to devastate ungulates. Major population impacts are already on display in some Wyoming mule deer herds. Because of the feedgrounds, which are proven spreaders of disease, wildlife biologists expect that elk that gather tightly for months at feeding sites like Dell Creek will see much higher rates of the disease and, eventually, diminished populations that vastly reduce hunting opportunities.

Now, wildlife managers and the public are about to discover what actually happens. For that reason, Edwards called the coming year at the Dell Creek Feedground “so important.” 
“This next year could be really interesting,” he said. “It’ll hopefully provide some clues.” 
In the meantime, he added, it’s too early to make specific predictions about prevalence this coming winter. 
There are some bright spots in the data available. 
Elk hunters in the two hunt areas nearest to the Dell Creek Feedground have so far encountered very low rates of CWD in tissue samples they’ve submitted, Game and Fish officials wrote in the email. There have been zero detections out of 151 samples in hunt area 84, and only one of 33 samples collected in hunt area 87 has shown signs of the disease — an elk killed by a hunter this fall.

Those numbers are likely to ramp up as CWD becomes more established. In tandem, biologists and wardens are ramping up efforts to monitor the herd and better understand how it’s being impacted.  
The agency’s staff are exploring the use of a new test, known as “RT-QuIC,” that allows them to quickly test infectious CWD prions at low concentrations, even from live animal tissue. They’ve also collected soil and fecal samples for future testing, according to Game and Fish’s email, and they plan to GPS-collar additional Dell Creek elk this coming feeding season.
For now, there are no plans to change the feeding regime in response to CWD’s rise in the Hoback Basin. 
Wyoming’s relatively new elk feedground plan allows for making changes only when consensus is reached, and it calls for addressing the state’s six feedground-dependent elk herds two at a time. First up for review were the Jackson and Pinedale herds, and specific plans for feedgrounds in those areas are “being reviewed by stakeholders” and a public review is forthcoming, according to the email.
Game and Fish officials won’t begin examining changes to the Dell Creek Feedground until it starts a separate plan for the Upper Green River Herd. Based on the pace of the in-the-works herd plans, it could be years away — and by that time they’ll know a lot more about how CWD is impacting the Hoback Basin’s elk.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)By the end of 2025, thousands of Alaskans may be hit hard by health insurance cost increases. The Enhanced Premium Tax Credit, also called the ePTC, is set to expire, and without renewal, health care costs for users could more than double. The credits have been effective in reducing federal marketplace insurance premiums for self-employed, hourly wage earners, seasonal workers and small business owners, as well as for diminishing the number of people without access to vital healthcare resources.
If Congress does not extend the ePTC by the end of 2025, many Alaskans, including people involved in the criminal justice system, will be paying exorbitant rates for health insurance. This will result in many going without healthcare or relying on more costly options, such as hospital emergency rooms, Medicaid or government-funded health programs. The ePTC is crucial for working Alaskans to afford healthcare coverage and ensure that the cost burden isn’t passed on to taxpayers.
We see this firsthand at the Juneau Reentry Coalition, where we and our partners provide hands-on support for Alaskans before, during and after incarceration to help them find employment, housing, access to treatment and healthcare.
Those returning to their communities after incarceration have plenty of hurdles to clear. Limited access to basic needs and treatment, reliable transportation, sober housing and stable employment are just a few of the hardships they face when they get out. The jobs available to reentrants are often low paying, physically demanding positions without many benefits. Paying for healthcare is tough enough for all of us, but it is even tougher for someone who has just been released from incarceration and is starting with nothing. The ePTC gives them an opportunity to purchase lower cost health insurance. It increases their chance to become a healthy, productive member of the community and avoid future legal system involvement. Everybody wins.
Not only are these tax credits beneficial for our justice-involved population, they are also in the best interest of self-employed workers, hourly wage earners, seasonal employees and business owners in the state of Alaska. Extending the ePTC will protect the well-being of thousands of our family members, friends and neighbors. Alaskans are hard-working, resilient people. Unaffordable healthcare should not be another challenge that we have to overcome.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/FSIRXhLVgAAjtQ5-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-12-09 19:58:30.841102

(Getty Images)In a technically worded ruling that focused on how the Montana Legislature allocates money, a Lewis and Clark County District Court judge struck down a law passed in 2023 that created an education savings account for students with disabilities who wanted to utilize the program.
Opponents to House Bill 393 argued that the law that could set up a private education paid for with state funding was illegal, unconstitutional and only served to starve taxpayer resources from already cash-strapped districts.
District Court Judge Mike Menahan issued a ruling on Tuesday that dismissed most of Disability Rights Montana and the Montana Quality Education Coalition’s arguments, including that the law violated the state constitution’s prohibition against public funds being used for private education, saying instead that the Legislature didn’t allocate the money properly, invalidating it.
Disability Rights Montana and the Montana Quality Education Coalition had sued the state in the case. That included the Office of Public Instruction Superintendent Susie Hedalen and Gov. Greg Gianforte, both Republicans. And Rep. Sue Vinton, R-Billings, in her capacity as a lawmaker and the sponsor of HB 393, intervened on behalf of the lawmakers. Former OPI Superintendent Elsie Arntzen was the head of Montana’s public education system at the time of the legislation’s passage. She was a Republican who reached her term limit in 2024.
House Bill 393 established a new system by which parents of children with disabilities could use an Education Savings Account for a number of support services and educational opportunities. Individual school districts were required to send back most of their funding for that student to be applied to the accounts, which were overseen by staff members at the state’s OPI.
Though critics of the legislation argued that it was shifting public education dollars, funded by taxpayers, to private, unaccountable programs, Menahan dismissed that argument. He also said because the two school organizations, represented by Upper Seven Law, had established that the Legislature didn’t authorize the funds properly, it made other parts of the lawsuit moot.
Since the law was enacted, 47 families have utilized the program, according to court documents.
The plaintiffs group argued that HB 393 violated state law, specifically Article VIII, Section 14, because the Legislature did not appropriate the money, and because it did not include a “sum certain or maximum amount that may be spent on the ESA program.”
Menahan agreed that the Legislature created the program, but didn’t allocate funding to it. Moreover, he said that while the Legislature allocates money to the individual districts for student education, the cost of the program will change over time, too, based upon the number who participate. For example, in 2024, there were 13 students; in 2025, the number had grown to 47.
Menahan also said that while the Legislature included funding for OPI officials to set up and administer reimbursing the expenses, the law was invalid because it didn’t appropriate money, only created the program.
“Taking money from public schools for vouchers without clear limits on how much and when that money will be spent is unconstitutional,” said Doug Reisig, the Montana Quality Education Council executive director.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/gettyimages-1088179758-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-09 19:58:30.841102

Richard Blumenthal cast a spotlight Tuesday on what he described as ""troubling patterns of conduct"" by federal immigration agents","U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal cast a spotlight Tuesday on what he described as “troubling patterns of conduct” by federal immigration agents during detentions of U.S. citizens.
The Connecticut senator used his role as the top Democrat on the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations to focus on nearly two dozen accounts of Americans who said they were detained despite having proper documentation or telling officers they are lawful citizens.
Those firsthand stories came out of an investigation launched in October by Blumenthal’s subcommittee and a House oversight committee. ProPublica reported around that time that federal agents detained more than 170 citizens this year at immigration raids and protests, despite the denial of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security that Americans are being arrested or detained.
A congressional report released Tuesday featured interviews with 22 American citizens who detailed their encounters with immigration officers — who were often wearing masks or dressed in plain clothes — reporting various instances of mistreatment, use of excessive force and the denial of medical care while they were detained.
Five of them delivered emotional testimony Tuesday afternoon before lawmakers about those experiences and their interactions with federal immigration officers. Some of their stories were featured in a video, including footage of one woman, Dayanne Figueroa, being dragged out of her car by agents during her commute to work in Chicago.
Blumenthal’s subcommittee teamed up with the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to hold the public forum. It’s considered a shadow hearing since it was held and organized by the minority party. No Republicans attended — something Blumenthal was dismayed by but said he expected.
“There’s a script — citizens going about their business, taking kids to school or going to work. Immigration agents stop them, sometimes smashing into their cars, unprompted seizures at the airport, blockades at their streets,” Blumenthal said in the Senate hearing room. “Citizens are then subjected to brutal physical violence, agents frequently masked and unidentifiable turn violent without provocation.”
“This kind of abuse is a pattern,” he continued. “This excessive force has resulted in injuries to some of you and many others that have lasting impact on them.”
Over the summer, Wilmer Chavarria was coming back into the country after visiting family in Nicaragua. He said he was separated from his spouse and held in a detention area for hours while his personal and professional devices were searched without consent. Chavarria, a school superintendent in Vermont, came to the U.S. years ago on a student visa and has been a citizen since 2018.
“My devices were taken and searched out of view, and I was never given a reason for my detention. Several hours later, and after interrogations that questioned everything from my marriage to my work, I was finally released to find my spouse in the baggage claim area, still shaken from the verbal assaults he had suffered when asking for my whereabouts,” Chavarria said in his testimony.
Across the country in Los Angeles, Andrea Velez was dropped off for work when “the street was swarmed by unmarked cars.” An ICE agent approached her, and she said she used her work badge to shield her. She was detained for two days and charged with assaulting a police officer, though it was ultimately dropped.
“In the chaos of ICE’s disorganization, I spent most of the first day handcuffed and shackled in a van, watching people arrive distraught and taken against their will, while ambulances came and went for those attacked. Requests to use the bathroom or ask for food were met with hostility and anger,” Velez testified.
Those stories run counter to the Department of Homeland Security’s characterization.
“ICE does NOT arrest or deport U.S. citizens. If a U.S. citizen is arrested, it is because they have obstructed or assaulted law enforcement. What makes someone a target for immigration enforcement is if they are illegally in the U.S. — NOT their skin color, race, or ethnicity,” DHS posted on the platform X last week.
In response to Tuesday’s report and hearing, a DHS spokesperson provided a similar statement, reiterating that, “ICE does not arrest U.S. citizens.”
But based on their personal experiences, the five individuals testifying Tuesday vehemently disagreed with DHS’ explanation.
Blumenthal asked each of the witnesses if they made an effort to inform officers that they are citizens and attempt to present identification.
“It was the first thing out of my mouth,” said George Retes, a California resident who is an Iraq combat veteran. “They asked me if I had an ID. I told him I did. I told him that I was a citizen. I said I have a license plate that could prove I’m a disabled veteran.”
The testimony also recounted the physical and emotional toll of the witnesses.
“I feel violated. I never felt this disgusted in my life,” Figueroa said.
As a diabetic, Javier Ramirez, who was born in San Bernardino, Calif., said he couldn’t get the care he needed while he was detained.
“As soon as I was released, I had to go to a hospital to get medical care,” he said.
While the report didn’t offer specific recommendations, Blumenthal suggested at the hearing that lawmakers should work on changing federal legislation to prevent repeat situations.
“We’re here seeking accountability. We probably need to change laws to really make the federal government accountable to people like yourselves whose rights have been violated,” Blumenthal said. “I know that we’re going to be working on it here in the United States Senate, and you will be providing a powerful impetus to us in that work.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP25280586989933-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-09 19:58:30.841102

(Photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — A day after inking a $2.7 billion deal to lead South Carolina’s nuclear reboot, executives of a New York investment firm were in the Palmetto State to talk about what drew them to the multibillion-dollar undertaking.
Hundreds gathered Tuesday on the floor of Colonial Life Arena in Columbia to hear from South Carolina utility executives, legislators and leadership of Brookfield Asset Management — the winning bid holder selected to restart construction on two abandoned reactors at the V.C. Summer nuclear plant in Fairfield County.
“It’s a bit of a no-brainer for us,” Mitch Davidson, a managing partner in Brookfield’s Renewable Power and Transition Group, told the crowd at the second annual nuclear summit.
In October, Brookfield, its subsidiary Westinghouse and Canada-based Cameco inked a partnership deal valued at $80 billion with the U.S. government. The companies will build 10 reactors identical to those at V.C. Summer.

South Carolina’s reactors could be the first and second on the list.
“There are parts of this project that are already there, big parts that are there — equipment is there, foundations are there,” Davidson told the SC Daily Gazette. “So this seems to be the perfect opportunity for us as a start.”
The companies involved still have at least six months’ worth of engineering and financial feasibility studies to determine whether the project — a black mark on the state for nearly a decade — stands a chance of ever getting done.
“I’m not going to tell you that we’re able to do it faster. That’s all things that we have to determine,” Davidson said. “But you would think, because it’s already partially built, that you can do quicker, faster, cheaper.”
And according to the leaders of Santee Cooper, if it happens, it will be done differently this time.
“This is not going to be on the backs of rate payers. It’s not going to be on the backs of our taxpayers in the state,” said board chairman Peter McCoy, who’s led the utility since 2021.
He draws a distinction from the debacle he investigated as a House committee chairman, then prosecuted as U.S. attorney.
“This is private business stepping up, with help from the federal government,” McCoy said.
Santee Cooper and the now defunct South Carolina Electric & Gas started construction on the two first-of-their-kind nuclear reactors alongside an existing unit near rural Jenkinsville in early 2013. But the project was riddled with delays, cost overruns and fraud that led to multiple federal convictions of former executives.
The utilities scrapped the plant’s expansion in 2017, but not before jointly spending $9 billion on the reactors that never produced a megawatt.
As part of the restart, Santee Cooper and its customers won’t put a single cent more into construction. The utility will, however, retain a 25% ownership interest in the expansion should it be successful, allowing it to buy, at cost, a portion of power produced to sell to its customers.
Summit to tell story behind the deal to restart SC’s failed nuclear reactors

Davidson said this arrangement works differently than historical nuclear projects because it’s not just utilities and their customers putting their pocketbooks on the line. There are more parties involved so the financial risk gets chopped into smaller pieces.
“I work with utility companies around the United States, and I would tell you that all of them are very focused on this project,” said John Cogan of Centerview Partners, financial advisors to state-owned utility Santee Cooper amid the sale effort. “They see Jenkinsville as the rebirth of the nuclear renaissance in the United States.”
And the driver behind this “renaissance,” according to the panelists, is the massive demand for electricity coming from major industrial users — namely, data centers.
“We haven’t seen load growth, like true load growth, in this country for a decade,” Davidson said. “The data centers have been the driver behind all of this. The data centers, and the size that they’re getting to today, are the genesis.”
That’s why tech giants, such as Microsoft, have taken an interest and been willing to act as financial partners in the restart of retired nuclear reactors in places such as Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island.
“We’ve got to make sure that we build these power plants efficiently and at a reasonable price,” Davidson said.
Especially, he added, if the United States wants to continue to play host to these massive data centers and the advancements in artificial intelligence that the centers make possible.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_3717-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-09 19:58:30.841102

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)FRANKFORT — A super PAC supporting U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie has won crucial backing from one of the biggest Republican mega-donors — a man who has the wherewithal to offset millions of dollars that Republican President Donald Trump is trying to raise to beat Massie in the spring primary elections.
That man is Jeff Yass, who recently — and indirectly — gave $1 million to a new super PAC that in recent weeks has been advertising in support of Massie’s reelection, according to records filed with the Federal Election Commission. Those records show Yass has set aside millions more in what could potentially be used for additional independent spending to help reelect Massie.
Trump recruited and has endorsed Shelbyville Republican Ed Gallrein, a former Navy Seal, to challenge the incumbent Massie who drew the president’s ire by differing with him on several high profile issues and House votes.
Trump-backed challenger vying to unseat Massie formally enters Kentucky congressional race

Yass is co-founder of the Philadelphia-based trading firm Susquehanna International Group. Bloomberg reports he is worth $63 billion, making him the 27th wealthiest person in the world. Politically conservative with a libertarian streak, Yass has backed Kentucky U.S. Sen. Rand Paul since Paul’s failed bid for the 2016 Republican nomination for president. And, according to the campaign finance watchdog group OpenSecrets, Yass has made more than $100 million in contributions to super PACs in the 2023-24 election cycle.
Massie, a Republican from Vanceburg, has won election to the U.S. House in Kentucky’s 4th District by wide margins seven times, but now is a target of the Republican president because he has strayed from the Trump line on several important votes. Most significantly, Massie opposed Trump’s showcase public policy proposal, the Big Beautiful Bill Act, over concerns about the bill’s impact on the national debt. Massie drew widespread media attention over the summer and fall as the key Republican who successfully  pushed to force a vote to require the Justice Department to release its records of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Trump opposed releasing the Epstein files until it became clear Congress would vote for their release.
In June a new anti-Massie super PAC was created by Trump supporters, and it reported quickly raising $2 million that funded a media campaign attacking Massie over the summer.  
With ally Rand Paul, Thomas Massie travels Northern Kentucky to fend off Trump attacks

But reports filed recently with the FEC show that a new super PAC called Kentucky First PAC countered with a pro-Massie advertising campaign in late October.
Those reports show the following steps:

On Oct. 20 Yass contributed a whopping $7.5 million to a super PAC called Protect Freedom Political Action Committee. This super PAC was created in 2017 by political advisors to Paul that for the past five years has gotten 95% of its money (about $35 million) from Yass. Its cash on hand was down to about $114,000 until Yass provided the $7.5 million on Oct. 20.
On Oct. 23 Protect Freedom donated $1 million to the new pro-Massie Kentucky First PAC.
On Oct. 31 Kentucky First reported paying a bit over $1 million ($1,006,986 to be exact) to a company called Maverix Media, for the pro-Maddie media campaign now going on in the district.

Massie’s campaign declined to comment for this story. 
But in an article published by Roll Call on Monday, Massie said he is ready for an onslaught of attack ads from super PACs aligned with Trump.
And he referred to some of the recent activity by super PACs in the campaign. 
“The state of play now is that the anti-Massie super PAC has gone dark and has been dark for a few months, and a pro-Massie super PAC is spending a million dollars on ads right now in the congressional district,” Massie told Roll Call.
Gallrein’s campaign on Monday released a two-minute video introducing him to voters as a three-decade Navy SEAL officer and showing him working on his Shelby County farm. It accuses Massie of trying to undermine Trump’s “plan to save America.”
Michael Biundo, the spokesman for Protect Freedom, did not respond to a list of questions sent to him by the Kentucky Lantern.
Deanna Hayes, treasurer for Kentucky First, did not return a phone message.
No one at Susquehanna International Group returned an email seeking comment from Yass about his contribution to Protect Freedom.
Yass may have funded additional support to help Massie through Protect Freedom beyond the $1 million contribution it made to Kentucky First PAC.
Protect Freedom also listed in its recent report to the FEC that it had two major expenses: $508,000 paid to Maverix Media for a media buy and $500,000 for get out the vote efforts. However, the report does not identify the candidate who was supported, or opposed, by that independent spending.
Protect Freedom reports having more than $5 million on hand.
Yass surfaced as a player in elections involving Kentuckians in 2015 when he helped fund super PACs supporting Paul’s presidential bid.
In 2017 he started making regular contributions to the Paul-affiliated Protect Freedom PAC, which initially had several wealthy donors but since 2021 has almost exclusively been funded with contributions from Yass.
In more recent years he has spent millions on independent advertising campaigns on Kentucky elections, including supporting the so-called “school choice” constitutional amendment last year and Republican Daniel Cameron’s 2023 campaign for governor. The school choice amendment was defeated and Cameron lost to incumbent Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear.

(Photos by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)There’s a new ad campaign promoting abortion pills at dozens of gas station pumps across South Dakota, and state officials said Tuesday they’ll investigate it for potentially deceptive trade practices and possible violations of the state’s anti-abortion laws.
The ads ask “Pregnant? Don’t want to be?” and provide a link to the website of Mayday Health, a New York-based nonprofit that’s dedicated to educating people about the safety and effectiveness of abortion pills. The group said the campaign started Monday at 30 gas stations and will run for six weeks, but locations checked by South Dakota Searchlight in Fort Pierre and Rapid City did not have the ads as of Tuesday afternoon.
The website offers legal and medical support, and links to purchase abortion pills and birth control.
Abortion pill campaign targets rural West Virginia, Kentucky gas stations

Mayday Health’s Executive Director Liv Raisner said the group isn’t worried about legal repercussions, despite South Dakota’s near-total abortion ban.
“It’s really important to us that we can absorb the risk of spreading information about safe medication,” Raisner said. 
On Tuesday, Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden asked South Dakota Republican Attorney General Marty Jackley to investigate the ad campaign.
South Dakota lawmakers adopted an abortion trigger ban in 2005 that took effect in 2022, after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Abortions are prohibited in the state, unless the mother’s life is threatened by a pregnancy. State lawmakers also passed legislation in 2022 banning “medical abortion by telemedicine.”
Rhoden’s office said Tuesday in a news release that Mayday’s campaign could be in violation of South Dakota’s anti-abortion laws and “could even be a deceptive trade practice.”
Jackley pledged an investigation.
“All ad campaigns, no matter what the issue, need to follow state laws and fair trade practices,” Jackley said in the release. “We will review these ads and determine if any laws have been broken. If laws have been broken, we will take appropriate action.”
The gas station campaign has already had runs in West Virginia and Kentucky. Mayday Health has also flown airplanes towing messages over the Indianapolis 500 and Big Ten college football games, among other efforts. In July, the Arkansas attorney general sent a cease-and-desist letter to Raisner concerning Mayday’s advertising practices in that state.
The nonprofit aims its campaigns at states that have higher restrictions on abortions. Mayday promotes resources at gas stations to reach people in everyday places with anonymity, Raisner said.

“Gas stations aren’t just places for gas, especially in rural areas,” Raisner said. “They’re community hubs, and it’s really critical to provide health information anonymously at places like gas stations.”
Mayday was founded in response to the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 decision that overturned Roe v. Wade.
In 2023, medication abortions accounted for 63% of abortions in the country, according to data from the Guttmacher Institute. The drugs mifepristone and misoprostol, commonly used in medication abortions, are also listed on the World Health Organizations’ list of essential medicines. Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected an attempt by anti-abortion medical organizations to overturn the Food and Drug Administration’s prescribing guidelines for mifepristone.
“There’s a lot of misinformation out there, and that’s why Mayday Health exists, to combat the misinformation,” Raisner said.

LEXINGTON — Heading into 2026, the “elephant in the room” for Kentucky policymakers will be Medicaid, said Senate Republican Leader Max Wise, speaking Tuesday during Kentucky Voices for Health’s annual meeting. 
Rep. Mary Lou Marzian, a Democrat from Louisville, told the gathering that her constituents “are really concerned” about Medicaid changes coming as a result of cutbacks approved by Republicans in Congress and signed by President Donald Trump earlier this year.
“Folks are scared to death to lose that health care,” Marzian said. “Medicaid is insurance, it’s not health care. But they’re scared to death to lose that ability to be able to access the provider when you’re sick (and) when you’re not sick and you have a wellness check.” 
They were speaking on a bipartisan panel at the Hyatt Regency in Lexington. Sheila Schuster, a longtime mental health advocate and leader, moderated the discussion.
Advocates and experts have said Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which will cut Medicaid by $900 billion over 10 years, could cause 130,000 Kentuckians to lose health care coverage and put rural hospitals at risk of reducing services or closing. Medicaid is the federal-state program that pays for almost 1 in 3 Kentuckians’ health care. 
“We can look at being compassionate, and also being responsible, as we go forward as the Commonwealth as it relates to Medicaid,” said Wise of Campbellsville. 
Of particular interest to Wise — his wife is a dentist — is a focus on oral health in a state with extremely poor oral health, ranked 49th in the nation, and low reimbursement rates that keep many dentists from treating Medicaid patients.
“Oral health is a priority in our family (and) it should be across the entire Commonwealth of Kentucky,” Wise said. 
Rep. Ken Fleming, R-Louisville, stressed Medicaid’s high cost to federal and state taxpayers   as “nothing to sneeze at” and “not sustainable.” 
He also said it’s important for the General Assembly to look at social determinants of health — housing and transportation access, for example. 
“We look at how they’re getting from day in and day out, in order to make ends come together,” he said. 
Lawmakers also said they plan to focus on housing, artificial intelligence and disaster recovery as the legislature crafts the next state budget during the 60-day legislative session that begins Jan. 6.  
On housing
Sen. Brandon Smith, R-Hazard, wants to focus on housing and homelessness during the 2026 legislative session. Eastern Kentucky was hit hard in back-to-back deadly floods in recent years. 
“We had a housing shortage before the first flood,” Smith said. “I don’t think anybody can deny that. And when the flood hit, the first one, it made it critical. And then now it’s hard to even describe … you still have so many people there that are living in somebody else’s home. They’re not sleeping in their own house.”  
Rep. Derek Lewis, R-London, said he’ll focus on disaster recovery among other issues. Lewis serves on an artificial intelligence task force and said to expect legislation on AI. 
“The main thing is you don’t want to hinder the advancements of what this technology can do, but at the same time, you’ve got to be cognizant of having guardrails in place and making sure that that is protected as well,” he said. “But … you’ll see some advancements on that.”

(Courtesy of Habitat for Humanity)OMAHA — In the making for five years, the first phase of the “affordable” Bluestem Prairie neighborhood has wrapped up, and Habitat for Humanity of Omaha on Tuesday celebrated what it calls a “milestone” occasion.
Nonprofit Habitat said its $29 million Bluestem Prairie — built on the site of the former and notoriously troubled Wintergreen apartments — is the largest development in its 40-year history. Typically a builder of 10 or fewer home clusters, Habitat believes the venture to be the largest nonprofit affordable homeownership project in Nebraska’s largest city.

The first wave of newly constructed homes at the roughly 15-acre North Omaha site near 52nd Street and Sorenson Parkway connects 85 families to homeownership. Another 15 homes in the area were renovated.
Ground preparation and infrastructure for the second Bluestem phase is underway. Construction of those 64 homes is expected to begin next year.
Habitat CEO Amanda Brewer said it’s widely known that homeownership makes a difference in a family’s quality of life, health and education. She said it was unimaginable early on that a homeownership project of that scale could materialize.
“This land that was out of commission for so long, vacant, abandoned and overrun with weeds, trees and dumping — it seemed impossible,” she said. “But what seemed impossible, not just difficult but impossible, happened. It gives you renewed faith.”
 Pay it forward 

Two families on Tuesday officially got the keys to their new homes. Eligible Habitat clients are able to achieve homeownership at a more affordable rate, as the nonprofit links them to lower interest rates, smaller down payments and also provides support in removing credit barriers.
Those living at Bluestem enter into a so-called pay-it-forward pact, in which a homebuyer who receives downpayment and other assistance agrees to certain resale restrictions designed to keep a house affordable for generations.

Officials say the new North Omaha subdivision also will deliver economic impact. In 15 years, after Habitat pays off its city-approved public tax-increment financing loan, the first phase of Bluestem is expected to be valued at about $13 million and produce roughly $300,000 in annual property taxes, Habitat officials said.
Residents, community members and representatives of city government attended the Tuesday event at the Bluestem site, which had been vacant for about 16 years following demolition of Wintergreen Apartments. Rental housing originally rose at the site in the early 1970s, and had gone through different ownership and names before the city cleared the area and took possession of the property in 2007, according to city records.
The city transferred the land to Habitat in 2021 for $1 under the Nebraska Community Development law. 
Prior to being renamed Wintergreen, the more than 200 rental units that opened there in 1975 for low- to moderate-income residents were called the Myott Park apartments.
One of the hallmarks of the new Bluestem neighborhood is the overhauled Myott Park — a roughly five-acre Omaha public park that had devolved before private dollars, a $1.1 million federal grant and a celebrity artist named Frankie Zombie helped revive it.
 ‘Rather notorious’ 

Habitat’s efforts overall have accelerated in the last few years, boosted by private donations, federal pandemic recovery funds, the Nebraska Affordable Housing Trust Fund and tax-increment financing (TIF) approved by the city. Brewer in 2022 spoke of how the nonprofit expected to invest more than $200 million by the end of 2026 in housing programs, which almost doubled the amount of the previous four years. Tuesday, she said that expectation remains on track.

At the time, community discussion about affordable housing was front and center, pushed in part by rising rents and housing costs. 
Also in December 2022, Omaha officials had condemned a 408-unit apartment complex in northwest Omaha, sending occupants of about 165 units scrambling at the holidays. City officials at the time said they could not wait, given what they described as dangerous conditions.
Founded in 1984, Omaha Habitat builds and renovates homes and repairs existing houses in a five-county area of Burt, Cass, Douglas, Sarpy and Washington Counties. The organization also advocates for laws and policies that can improve the homeownership mission.

Habitat said more than 90,000 cubic yards of soil were moved and more than 10,000 cubic yards of soil were imported during the first phase of the Bluestem redevelopment effort, as the hilly property was prepared for construction. Sewers, power, internal and connection streets and other infrastructure was built. The projected price tag grew from $25 million to $29 million.
Thomas Warren, chief of staff for Omaha Mayor John Ewing Jr., noted that both he and Ewing served on the Omaha Police Department for many years. Warren said he can recall personally responding to calls for service in the apartment pocket he called “rather notorious at the time.”
“And so we’ve seen quite a transformation,” Warren said. 
He said development of more affordable housing is a key priority for the Ewing administration and said Bluestem shows the possibilities.
 ‘Feels good’ 

Families living there spoke about a sense of community and how they help each other during stow storms and other situations.
Homeowner Lam Ramdiet said his family has lived in Bluestem for a year and it has changed their lives.
“The kids keep running around. It’s amazing,” he said. “It’s not for me. I just want the best for my kids and their future.”
Brewer reflected on the moment: “On a site that had sat vacant for so long and seemed, maybe, hopeless … it feels good.”

Contained in two separate bills — HB 693 and HB 697  — dubbed “Florida’s New Frontier in Healthcare” by Perez, the package would change Florida statutes as necessary to implement the “One Big Beautiful Bill” passed by Congress at the urging of President Donald Trump.
HB 693 would require people on food assistance who are not disabled and who don’t have young children to show they are working through age 64. Florida law now requires people to show they are working through age 59. 
The bill would keep certain immigrants, including refugees, asylees, parolees, and abused spouses and children, from enrolling in Medicaid or the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).
The House had not prepared or released a legislative analysis or estimated fiscal impact for either bill.
Florida has since 2018 limited Medicaid retroactive eligibility for adults to just one month. It was a cost-saving change championed by former Gov. Rick Scott, who had to convince the federal government to waive its rules so it could be implemented.
The One Big Beautiful Bill, though, allows states to pare back Medicaid eligibility for pregnant women and children from three months to two.  Perez’s proposal would change state law to allow it to happen. And it wouldn’t require additional federal approval.
“President Trump’s bold leadership through the One Big Beautiful Bill set the standard for real, results-driven healthcare reform, and Florida is proud to lead the way in implementing that vision at the state level,” Perez said in a prepared statement. 
“We are taking decisive action to cut red tape, grow our healthcare workforce, expand patient choice, and protect taxpayer dollars while ensuring families can access high-quality care when they need it most. In partnership with the President’s leadership, Florida is delivering real results.”
“New” frontier sounds familiar
While Perez touts the “new frontier,” some of the proposals in the bill are familiar.
Sponsored by Miami Republican Rep. Mike Redondo, HB 693 would repeal the requirement that nursing homes, hospice services, and intermediate care facilities for individuals with developmental disabilities secure certificates of need (CON) before building new facilities or adding services. 
CONs are a regulatory tool long controversial with critics who argue they limit competition and access, while proponents contend they help control costs by preventing an over-proliferation of services.

The Florida Legislature in 2019 eliminated CON requirements for general hospitals, specialty hospitals, and tertiary services but maintained the requirement for nursing homes. At the time, the nursing home industry argued to retain CONs for nursing homes.
The Florida Health Care Association, the state’s largest nursing home lobby, said it was still reviewing the legislation. Senior Director of Strategy and Communications Kristen Knapp said the association will take a formal position when its board meets in January.
Redondo’s bill aims to expand access to health care by expanding the type of services the health care workforce can provide.
Specifically, HB 693 authorizes all advanced practice registered nurses to work independently of medical doctors. While some advanced nurses can do that today, it’s authorized on a limited basis and only for the provision of primary care.










To me, that's the most problematic provision of the bill.


–  Jacksonville health care attorney and lobbyist Christopher Nuland, on autonomous practice for advanced nurses


“To me, that’s the most problematic provision of the bill,” said Jacksonville health care attorney and lobbyist Christopher Nuland, whose clients include the Florida Chapter of the American College of Physicians Services; the Florida Chapter, American College of Surgeons; and the Florida Neurosurgical Society, among others.
The bills were filed Tuesday. They have not been referred to committee. But they are guaranteed to attract plenty of attention when the House starts to debate them. 
Some of the more controversial provisions, Nuland predicted, will attract lobbyists who have an interest in Medicaid, SNAP, and the children’s health insurance program, as well as those who lobby for organized medicine.
“The question is, can the bills sustain different attacks on different parts?” Nuland asked.
The second bill, HB 697, takes aim at prescription drug costs.
The bill would establish a “most favored nation” pricing model for prescription drugs in Florida, requiring drug manufacturers selling here to report international drug pricing data as a licensure requirement. The Agency for Health Care Administration would identify, publish, and routinely update the lowest international price paid for each drug among countries with comparable economic standards and market-based health systems.
To guarantee reduced costs for consumers, the bill would require commercial insurers, Medicaid health plans, and pharmacies to pay no more than the established benchmark price and insurers to use resulting savings to reduce premiums and patient cost-sharing.
“This bill is about restoring fairness, competition, and transparency to a system that has become deeply tilted against patients,” bill sponsor Rep. Jennifer Kincart Jonsson said in a prepared release.
“Following President Trump’s leadership on drug pricing reform, Florida is standing up for families at the pharmacy counter by demanding market-based pricing, cracking down on abusive PBM [pharmacy benefit manager] practices, and ensuring patients can rely on stable access to the medications they need.”

(Getty Images)In the year that has passed since New Hampshire Republicans held a news conference to celebrate the repeal of the state’s Interest and Dividends Tax, I’ve thought (and written) a lot about the $150 million-plus in annual revenue the state has thrown away.
Every week, it seems, there’s a reminder of the sacrifices demanded in order to pay for the repeal, from the $15 million no longer going to beleaguered child care providers, to the hundreds of dollars in monthly Medicaid premiums now being charged to lower-income families, to the limits placed on how much the state can help rural people whose wells have gone dry due to drought. And how can anyone forget the gutting of the Office of the Child Advocate or the $51 million back-of-the-budget cut to the Department of Health and Human Services? I invite you to pick your own unfunded or underfunded line item, and there are plenty to choose from, that could have been covered in part or in full by revenue from the Interest and Dividends Tax.
To be clear, it’s not like the repeal decision was made impulsively under the influence of economically heady days.
New Hampshire Republican lawmakers had long targeted the tax and long known 2025’s budget season wasn’t going to be pretty. Still, Republican House Speaker Sherman Packard celebrated the repeal last December as a populist victory: “It’s the citizens’ money,” he said, as reported by the Boston Globe, “and we need to make sure they keep it. We don’t want it.”
What he didn’t say is what he meant by “citizens”: The repeal was enacted in service to the top 20% of income earners in the state. Just 8% of the dollars collected from the Interest and Dividends Tax would be paid by people in the bottom 80% of earners, according to New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute data.
Why not simply adjust the tax to help out the people who fall in the 80%? Because it was never about safeguarding “the citizens’ money”; it was about safeguarding influential citizens’ money.
Expansive, policy-driven inequality is the Republican Party’s guiding light, whether you call it Reaganomics, or neo-liberalism, or Trumpism, or trickle-down economics — and it is also the root of Gov. Kelly Ayotte’s political motto “Don’t Mass Up New Hampshire.” The idea, reflected in the state and national policies of tax cuts for the wealthy and simultaneous cuts to supports and services for everyone else, is that wealthy people deserve to keep their full wealth and poor people deserve to keep their full poverty. The middle class, meanwhile, becomes more and more hollowed out because wages can’t keep up with rising costs of groceries, housing, health care, property taxes, utilities, college tuition — you name it.
Republicans know that wealth doesn’t actually trickle down, which is why so much of their political focus is on redirecting the fiscal hostilities of the suffering classes away from the wealthy and on to each other. The American people have been conditioned, over decades if not centuries, to blame those below or next to them on the wealth ladder for their own struggles. Blame immigrants. Blame poor people. Blame anyone. Just don’t look up. 
Meanwhile, New Hampshire Republicans can’t stop themselves from handing out wads of cash to the wealthy even when they supposedly set out to create “school choice” for lower- and middle-income residents. 
A few years into the education freedom account program, the income cap is gone. Now, should billionaire Mark Zuckerberg relocate to the Granite State with his growing family, the state’s universal school voucher program dictates that New Hampshire taxpayers would be obligated to fork over about $5,000 per year per Zuck offspring for their private school educations. Maybe that’s a ludicrous example, but then again it’s a ludicrous program. 
To that point, here’s the latest data on the newly capless education freedom accounts program: Just one-fifth of the 10,000-plus students now receiving vouchers are from families earning less than 185% of the federal poverty line and 96.7% of this year’s recipients were already attending private school or being home schooled when they cashed in their coupon.
There’s never been a better time to be a well-to-do private school parent. New Hampshire is spending more than $50 million on the voucher program this year, up from $30 million last year. 
Oddly enough, the Interest and Dividends Tax could have paid for that, too.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/disparity-1024x546.jpeg,,,2025-12-09 18:56:50.250888

Former Gov. Roy Barnes, an attorney arguing on Willis’ behalf, told justices that a subpoena issued by the Senate Special Committee […[...]","Sen. Bill Cowsert at Senate Special Committee on Investigations meeting on Nov. 13, 2025, at which Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis had been scheduled to appear. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderFulton County District Attorney Fani Willis is calling on the Georgia Supreme Court to dismiss a subpoena to answer questions from a state Senate committee investigating her historic 2023 indictment of President Donald Trump.
Former Gov. Roy Barnes, an attorney arguing on Willis’ behalf, told justices that a subpoena issued by the Senate Special Committee on Investigations is moot.
Barnes argues that the committee, led by Athens Republican Sen. Bill Cowsert, who is running for Georgia attorney general next year, does not have the power to issue subpoenas under state law. Barnes said a single-chamber committee cannot subpoena testimony unless it is empowered to do so by statute or by the General Assembly as a whole.
The state’s highest court heard oral arguments on the matter Tuesday.
“For over 150 years, the General Assembly has been very reluctant, particularly when it is only one house of the General Assembly, of giving to a regular or special committee of either house the right to exercise the power of subpoena, and for good reason,” Barnes said.
Barnes said that reluctance helps protect the balance between the branches of government, giving the example of a 2021 effort in the Montana Legislature seeking to subpoena the emails of Supreme Court justices there in an effort to root out alleged bias.
Barnes further argued that the subpoena is not valid because it was issued in August 2024 under the 157th General Assembly of Georgia. That body dissolved in January when the 158th General Assembly was sworn in, Barnes said.
“The General Assembly dies and has no further effect when a new General Assembly comes in,” he said.
Barnes said that Willis plans to appear before the committee on Dec. 17 pursuant to another subpoena filed in November, after the passage of a law sponsored by Cowsert granting new powers to investigatory committees, including subpoena powers.
Attorney Josh Belinfante, arguing on Cowsert’s behalf, said the original subpoena is not moot.
“There is simply zero constitutional text to support that argument, and there is no reason this court should adopt it now,” Belinfante said. “Nor does the fact that the witness has agreed to testify on Dec. 17 change the calculus today.”
Belinfante indicated that Willis testifying could largely resolve the issues at hand, but he also expressed skepticism that she will do so.
“We remember that we had dates before and it did not work out,” he said. “We hope that it does.”
Willis has been resisting calls to appear from the start. In October, Cowsert said the parties reached an agreement that Willis would testify at a November hearing, but when the day came, she did not appear, with the committee citing a scheduling conflict.
Willis’ election interference case centered on Trump’s now-infamous phone call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger in which Trump asked Raffensperger to “find” enough votes to overturn the election.
Co-defendants were also accused of acts including an intimidation campaign against poll workers, a breach of Coffee County’s election systems and a plan to certify a false Trump victory. Four of the 18 alleged co-conspirators pleaded guilty and agreed to testify against Trump and the other defendants.
But Willis’ hopes of taking the case to trial turned to dust after a romantic relationship with a special prosecutor she hired for the case led to accusations of a conflict of interest and her ultimate removal from the case. Late last month, a Fulton County judge dismissed the case once and for all after a special prosecutor found that charging a sitting president was unrealistic.
The section of the state constitution organizing the Legislature states that there “shall be a different General Assembly for each two-year period.” The justices appeared to back up Barnes’ argument that the Legislature that issued the subpoena is no longer around to enforce it.
Chief Justice Nels Peterson said the Legislature is the only state body described in the constitution as reconstituting in that way.
“There’s no other place in the constitution that I’m aware of that provides that, say an executive branch agency or a court becomes different simply because the people constituting the entity change over,” said.
Peterson also appeared to agree that the second subpoena carries greater authority because of Cowsert’s bill.
“I think we would be in a much more challenging constitutional space had the General Assembly not acted in 2025, both the House and the Senate, to confer this power of subpoena on committees that now has been exercised in this most recent subpoena that service has been acknowledged,” he said.
Following arguments, Peterson told the sides that they would have a resolution within the time required by the constitution, which means the end of March at the latest, but he said the court will look forward to a status update follow Dec. 17, when Willis is supposed to appear before Cowsert’s committee.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DSC0453-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-09 18:56:50.250888

The Gem State Housing Alliance is being led by state Sen. Ali Rabe, a Boise Democrat who ran a nonprofit called Jesse Tree that focuses on preventing eviction and homelessness. She says the Gem State Housing Alliance is Idaho’s first housing organization focused on creating statewide opportunities to build affordable housing. 
Rabe said she’s seen the Treasure Valley change a lot while growing up. 
“While that has been happening, obviously, housing prices have increased by 40%. So a lot of my friends, family members who are trying to enter the home market for the first time are unable to do so,” Rabe told reporters Tuesday. 
In its first year, she said the group is focused on city-level policies. The group hopes to tackle a range of local policies — including simplifying housing development and ending bans on smaller homes.

Panhandle Affordable Housing Alliance Executive Director Maggie Lyons sits on the board of directors for the Gem State Housing Alliance. 
“The policy piece of this is so critical, and it has been something that I faced and other other like minded developers who want to build smaller starter homes for our local workers. They want to do it, but they can’t because of the prohibitive cost of particularly land, infrastructure and red tape,” Lyons said.
Another board member, Caleb Roope, CEO of Eagle-based The Pacific Companies, said there’s no shortage of ideas for local governments to tackle to simplify the building process.
“The longer a project takes to get off the ground, the more unaffordable to the users it becomes,” Roope said.
Pocatello Mayor-elect Mark Dahlquist said local zoning codes often make it harder for developers to build smaller family homes. He said he ran into that in Pocatello, when he was developing a community called the Bonneville Commons. He is the executive director at NeighborWorks Pocatello, a community development nonprofit organization. 
“What was stopping us from doing that were some outdated zoning codes. And I think Pocatello, like a lot of other cities in Idaho, they had really old codes, and they were probably put together during the post World War II era,” Dahlquist said.

Michael Bennet answers a question from a constituent during a town hall at the University of Northern Colorado in Greeley on March 18, 2025. (Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet, a Democrat who is running for Colorado governor in 2026, would support a constitutional amendment to allow the state to redraw its congressional districts to offset partisan gerrymandering in other states. 
President Donald Trump has urged Republican-led states to redraw their congressional lines so the party can pick up more seats in the U.S. House of Representatives next year. Texas, Missouri, North Carolina and Ohio are among the states that have completed mid-decade redistricting to give Republicans an advantage. California voters approved a ballot measure last month to redraw the state’s maps to counter Republican gerrymandering. 
Attorney General Phil Weiser, a Democrat who is also running for governor in 2026, was the first statewide elected official in Colorado to support the idea of redrawing the state’s congressional districts mid-cycle. Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold, who is running for attorney general in 2026, has also supported a ballot initiative to allow for emergency redistricting.

A state constitutional amendment proposed for next year’s Colorado ballot would give the governor emergency redistricting power to offset “national redistricting imbalances.” The earliest any new maps could be drawn under that amendment would be for the 2028 election cycle, and Bennet previously said that would be “too late.” 
Now Bennet says “we have no choice but to fight back” as Trump and Republicans followed the “dangerous path” of mid-cycle redistricting. 
“I support a one-time change to Colorado’s constitution so we can do our part. That process begins in 2026, but our maps won’t change until 2028,” Bennet said in a statement. “Right now, the most important thing we can do is flip the House of Representatives in 2026.”
An independent redistricting commission for the first time redrew congressional maps in Colorado in 2021, creating the highly competitive 8th Congressional District on the Front Range north of Denver. Democrats represent four districts and Republicans represent four districts.

(Photo courtesy of Washington Department of Ecology)TransAlta Corporation has signed an agreement with Puget Sound Energy to switch the last coal-fired power station in Washington state to natural gas.
The deal, which TransAlta announced Tuesday, comes as the Centralia plant is set to fall silent at the end of the month. 
Its closure is part of a deal the Washington Legislature approved in 2011. The winding down of the last coal-fired unit represents a long-sought goal for Democratic state politicians: the move toward cleaner energy to reduce fossil-fuel emissions and combat climate change.
But it also comes amid rising concerns that the state could face a power crunch as it makes that transition.
In a statement, John Kousinioris, president and chief executive officer of the Canadian-owned company, said the switch to natural gas “will lower the emission intensity profile of the facility by approximately 50 percent.”
“This project demonstrates the valuable role that legacy assets can play in supporting the State’s clean energy laws and system reliability in a cost effective and timely fashion,” added Kousinioris.
Under the agreement, the conversion will deliver 700 megawatts of power under a 16-year contract that runs through Dec. 31, 2044.
With California experiencing power disruptions as it switches to cleaner energy, some key Washington state officials have said they support adding natural gas to the facility.
In an interview conducted before the announcement, former Washington Gov. Christine Gregoire said she supported the company burning natural gas there as a backup while planned renewable energy projects around the state, like solar and wind power, get built.
During her tenure as governor, Gregoire, a Democrat, helped negotiate the agreement between TransAlta and the state that led to the winding down of the coal plant.
“Natural gas today is under the gun, but it is the backup for us … to avoid the brownouts, blackouts,” Gregoire said. “We do want to move to a clean energy future, but we have to do it in a way that we don’t deprive people and businesses and communities of the energy they so desperately need.”
She isn’t alone with that perspective. State House Majority Leader Joe Fitzgibbon — a key architect of Democrats’ clean-energy blueprint under Gregoire’s successor, former Gov. Jay Inslee — said he supports TransAlta putting a natural-gas facility there for the short-term.
Gov. Bob Ferguson’s office did not respond to emails seeking comment.
State Senate Minority Leader John Braun, a Republican from Centralia, said generating power through natural gas would help avoid California-style energy disruptions seen in recent years.
“We have to make the transition without hurting anybody,” Braun said.
‘Risk of power shortfalls’
The Centralia site had once included a neighboring coal mine, the largest such mine in Washington. By 2009, when Gregoire signed an executive order on climate change that declared an intent to strike a deal with the company, that mine had already shut down.
“They were having to bring coal in, there were all kinds of pressures,” Gregoire said. “Whether that was a safety issue, a health issue, whether that was a good economic future for the people of Lewis County.”
Subsequent negotiations led to the 2011 agreement being passed by the Legislature. The agreement spelled out the coal plant’s decommissioning by the end of 2025 and secured the company an expedited consideration for a gas-powered facility. 
The deal also secured $55 million from TransAlta to be spent on several things, including energy efficiency and economic development projects for the Centralia-area community.
“You can shut it down, and walk away, but what you leave behind is untenable,” Gregoire said. “So it was really about trying to find the right way in which to leave the opportunity to help those people who would be out of a job, to retrain. And a new vision for Lewis County.”
A recent study commissioned by Puget Sound Energy, Seattle City Light, Avista, Tacoma Power and others contends that Washington is already on the cusp of an electricity crisis.
The shift toward wind and solar has prompted the region to retire fossil fuel power faster than it has been replaced, according to the report released in September. 
“Adding weather-dependent resources without balancing them with reliable backup has left the grid more exposed to extreme conditions,” it stated.
The region “is going to have to add natural gas peaking plants as a critical backstop for reliability when the sun isn’t shining or the wind isn’t blowing,” Matt Steuerwalt, a senior vice president with Puget Sound Energy, said in a statement.
“A key finding is the region is at risk of power shortfalls, which could lead to rolling blackouts during extreme conditions, such as a winter cold snap during a very low [hydropower] year,” Steuerwalt said, citing that study. “This is a problem now — not 2030 or 2045, though it will get worse as demand continues to grow and more legacy power plants shut down.”
In an email, state Senate Majority Leader Jamie Pedersen, D-Seattle, said officials continue to work “on speeding the transition to clean energy by increasing solar and wind generation; making our grid more efficient; and exploring technological solutions such as demand management to reduce peak period electricity demand.”
“I suspect that we will also be extremely cautious about approving major new drains on the grid, such as data centers, that do not bring along dedicated generation facilities,” Pedersen added.
In an interview, Fitzgibbon, the state House majority leader, said he’s not opposed to TransAlta’s shift to natural gas. Fitzgibbon previously chaired the House’s energy and environment committee and sponsored the low-carbon fuel bill that passed in 2021. That was a key part of Democrats’ ambitious plans to reduce carbon emissions that passed under Gregoire’s successor, former Gov. Jay Inslee.
The envisioned TransAlta natural-gas facility, Fitzgibbon said, wouldn’t be expected to operate decades into the future like brand-new construction. The lawmaker added that he isn’t aware of any law that the Legislature would need to change to allow the project.
“Having coal out of Washington power is a huge milestone,” Fitzgibbon added.
Braun, the Republican state Senate minority leader, also called the TransAlta property the second-best place in the state for the next generation of nuclear energy, behind the Hanford nuclear site in central Washington. 
Under federal oversight, nuclear projects take many years and potentially decades to come to fruition. Braun urged Washington to pursue that option in Centralia, as well: “I’d like to see us get into that sooner and not later.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/transalta-coal-plant-e1765321297646-1024x699.jpg,,,2025-12-09 18:56:50.250888

In November 2022, the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) approved a request from the Arkansas Department of Human Services to allow an additional 5,000 pregnant and postpartum Arkansans to receive at-home visits during a high-risk pregnancy. St. Bernards launched the Maternal Life360 HOME program in Jonesboro in November 2024. The health system will start providing the same services in Paragould “in the near future,” DHS communications chief Gavin Lesnick said.
“Through our Pregnancy Clinics and Maternal Life360 HOME programs, St. Bernards is helping individual moms and babies get healthy starts,” said Emily McGee, St. Bernards vice president for Nursing and Women’s & Children’s Services, in the news release. “We provide the care they need, regardless of their insurance status, financial ability or health history… Our calling is to serve them however and wherever we can, and we plan to continue to grow by serving additional counties in the near future.”

Expanded Arkansas Medicaid services for high-risk pregnancies will start soon in Jonesboro


The program for low-income women with high-risk pregnancies aims to meet not only their medical needs but also their “health-related social needs” such as food security and housing, according to the news release.
Life360 started as part of Arkansas Health and Opportunity for Me (ARHOME), the state’s version of Medicaid expansion in place since 2021. Initially, only ARHOME enrollees were eligible for Life360 HOMEs, but the program now includes any Arkansan on Medicaid with a high-risk pregnancy living in a Life360 service area.
Arkansans must not be currently receiving other state or federally funded home-visiting services to be eligible for the Life360 HOME program.
DHS funds three other Life360 HOME programs. according to the news release. Two are in Little Rock and North Little Rock in partnership with Baptist Medical Center, and one is in Batesville in partnership with White River Health. All three started services within the past year, DHS Division of Medical Services Director Elizabeth Pitman said in the news release. She said three more hospitals are working to become Life360 HOME providers.
Those three hospitals are CHI St. Vincent in Hot Springs, Mercy Hospital Northwest Arkansas in Rogers, and the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, based in Little Rock, Lesnick said.
Arkansas has consistently had among the nation’s highest maternal and infant mortality rates, according to the Arkansas Center for Health Improvement. Additionally, Arkansas is the only state that has taken no action to adopt the federal option of extending postpartum Medicaid coverage from 60 days to 12 months after birth.
Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders has said that this expansion would be “redundant” and “duplicative,” since the state has other insurance coverage options for postpartum low-income Arkansans. She convened a strategic committee in early 2024 to develop a plan to improve the state’s maternal health infrastructure and outcomes, and the committee’s recommendations included expanding access to Life360 HOMEs.
Bills to improve Arkansas maternal health, change ballot initiative process head to Sanders’ desk

The committee’s report also recommended considering higher Medicaid reimbursements for existing maternal health care providers and implementing presumptive Medicaid eligibility for pregnant Arkansans.
The Healthy Moms, Healthy Babies Act of 2025 established this presumptive eligibility. It also provides Medicaid reimbursements for doulas and community health workers, and it established pregnancy-related Medicaid coverage for specific treatments.
The law passed with bipartisan support despite some lawmakers’ concerns that it reduced the statute of limitations for any actions against alleged medical injuries during birth from a child’s 11th birthday to a child’s fifth birthday.
Legislation that would have expanded postpartum Medicaid coverage to 12 months after birth did not pass the Legislature in 2023 or 2025.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/pregnant-woman-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-12-09 18:56:50.250888
,DC,2025-12-09 23:14:34+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,US Senate GOP rolls out health care plan that fails to extend premium subsidies,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-gop-rolls-out-health-care-plan-fails-extend-premium-subsidies,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Senate Republicans announced Tuesday they will hold a vote on their own health care proposal later this week to counter a Democratic bill that would extend enhanced tax credits for Affordable Care Act marketplace plans for three more years.The 32-page GOP bill would not address the expiring ACA marketplace tax credits but would send payments to certain Americans through Health Savings Accounts to cover some of the cost of health care. Neither measure has the 60 votes needed to advance under that chamber’s rules. That would leave the ACA marketplace subsidies to expire at the end of the year and dramatically spike the cost of health insurance for the millions of people enrolled in those plans. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said Democrats’ bill to simply extend the enhanced ACA marketplace tax credits to offset the costs Americans pay for that insurance was unacceptable. “The way that the program is structured, the money goes straight to the insurance companies,” Thune said. “And the way that we think this ought to work is you ought to come up with a way in which you can deliver the benefit to the patients and not to the insurance companies.”Thune said the Democratic bill lacks an income cap for ACA marketplace tax credits and allows $0 premiums for health insurance plans — guaranteeing the measure will fail.Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, of New York, called the GOP proposal a “nonstarter” that would lead to “junk insurance.” He said the only way to avoid a dramatic increase in health insurance costs next year is to extend the enhanced ACA tax credits. “Their phony proposal is dead on arrival,” Schumer said. “The bill not only fails to extend the tax credits, it increases costs, adds tons of new abortion restrictions for women, expands junk fees and permanently funds cost-sharing reductions.”Multiple plansSenate Republicans have debated for weeks whether to hold a vote on a GOP plan to show the party has something to offer toward reducing health care costs. Thune promised Democrats a vote on a health care bill of their choosing in exchange for votes to end the government shutdown. Schumer announced last week that Democrats would hold the vote on a three-year extension of the enhanced ACA tax credits as they exist now. Several GOP senators, including Maine’s Susan Collins and Ohio’s Bernie Moreno, have released plans that would include an extension of the expiring tax credits while beginning to transition away from those subsidies. But Republican leaders ultimately decided to hold a vote on a proposal released earlier this week by Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee Chairman Bill Cassidy, R-La., and Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo, R-Idaho. The Cassidy-Crapo legislation would have the Department of Health and Human Services deposit money into Health Savings Accounts for people enrolled in bronze or catastrophic health insurance plans purchased on the ACA marketplace in 2026 or 2027, according to a summary of the bill. Health Savings Accounts are tax-advantaged savings accounts that consumers can use to pay for medical expenses that are not otherwise reimbursed. They are not health insurance products.ACA marketplace enrollees who select a bronze or catastrophic plan and make up to 700% of the federal poverty level would receive $1,000 annually if they are between the ages of 18 and 49 and $1,500 per year if they are between the ages of 50 and 64. That would set a threshold of $109,550 in annual income for one person, or $225,050 for a family of four, according to the 2025 federal poverty guidelines. The numbers are somewhat higher for residents of Alaska and Hawaii.  The funding could not go toward abortion access or gender transitions, according to the Republican bill summary. Proposal modeled on Trump commentsCassidy and Crapo outlined how their proposal would work during afternoon floor speeches, where they also aired their grievances with how the Affordable Care Act has affected Americans’ health care costs. Crapo rebuked Democrats for establishing the enhanced ACA marketplace tax credits during the coronavirus pandemic and scheduling them to sunset at the end of this year. “The pattern has become clear: Democrats respond to rising premiums by throwing taxpayer dollars at the problem,” Crapo said. “Their supposedly short-term fixes only drive premiums higher and make the problem harder to solve. Leaving us with apparently no choice other than to do the same thing again and again and again.”The GOP plan, he said, was modeled off President Donald Trump’s request to send funding directly to Americans to spend on their health care. “Families can use that money to cover costs not handled by their insurance policy without having to wait for insurance companies to approve their treatment decisions,” Crapo said. “Because families want the best value for their money, they will seek out the most appropriate treatment. Over time this will result in lower health care costs as providers compete for patients.”Cassidy said the bill would not subsidize health insurance premiums but would help some Americans pay for doctor exams, dentist visits, glasses and prescriptions. Once eligible ACA marketplace enrollees receive that funding in their Health Savings Accounts, he said, they will shop around for better prices, including on x-rays, which are often used to determine if someone has broken a bone. “She’s going to say, ‘Wait a second, the x-ray is $150 here and $500 there. I’m going to where it’s cheaper, not more expensive,’” Cassidy said, giving an example. “And I can tell you when that begins to happen, the people who are more expensive begin to lower their price.”",,,,2025-12-09 18:56:50.250888

(Photo courtesy Cuba Public Library)The head of the nonprofit New Mexico Rural Library Initiative asked state lawmakers this week to allocate $29.5 million in next year’s legislative session to further fund an endowment assisting 60 rural and tribal libraries.
Shel Neymark, executive director of the library initiative, made his pitch to legislators on the Economic and Rural Development and Policy Committee during its Monday meeting in Santa Fe. The organization provides grant writing and other support to public, nonprofit libraries that lack financial backing from local governments in small communities across the state.
“Rural libraries are often the only infrastructure in the towns they’re in,” Neymark said during the meeting. “Besides providing library services, they tend to provide early childhood education, after school programs, adult education. They also do economic development, they connect people with healthcare, they step up during natural disasters and provide help for citizens.”
He explained to committee members that since the endowment’s creation in 2019, the Legislature has appropriated $30.5 million toward the initiative. The goal is to have $1 million per library, Neymark said, so the initiative is asking for $29.5 million more be appropriated to the endowment during the upcoming 30-day session. 
“Then the disbursement from the endowment would give each library about $45,000 a year. We figure that’s enough that if libraries have no other money, they can keep their doors open,” Neymark said. “This money will go to the libraries every year in perpetuity. And part of the endowment was also to help towns that don’t have libraries to establish them.”
According to the initiative’s website, each of the 60 eligible libraries received $23,000 this year.
Neymark added that one of the biggest needs of rural libraries is staffing support and funding for liveable wages for often underpaid staff.
Rep. Patricia Roybal Caballero (D-Albuquerque) suggested lawmakers look into and the initiative support an annual recurring amount that would allow the initiative to submit annual budget reports and work with the Department of Finance Administration to disburse funds and “help leverage and bring in more money” for the libraries’ use. 
Sen. Antonio Maestas (D-Albuquerque) added that state funds could be used now rather than transferring it into an endowment. 
“You’re not asking us to spend $30 million, you’re asking us to put $30 million more in a mattress and then peel out 5% each year for libraries,” Maestas said. “I say we spend money now. Could you imagine if we put $29 million into rural libraries next year?”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/cubapubliclibrary-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-09 18:56:50.250888

Dec. 9, 2025 | ScreenshotMichigan’s continuing struggle to create a child welfare system free of court oversight could get help from an outside foster parent training program, one that focuses on trauma-informed care, building trust and meeting needs.
Members of the House Families and Veterans Committee heard a soft pitch Tuesday from One Big Happy Home, which has developed a set of trust-based intervention training and workshop modules geared toward parents of both biological and foster children. The company, founded by Ryan North and his wife, Kayla North, also works with schools and churches to offer pre-service trauma training for adoption and foster care services.
Although One Big Happy Home has not yet filed a formal pitch to the Legislature to partner with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees foster care and child welfare services, North and a client appeared before the committee on an invite from state Rep. Gina Johnsen (R-Portland).
Johnsen said it was her hope that the department would be open to partnering with One Big Happy Home or at least making the trainings available to new and current foster care parents, as well as biological parents. The intent, she said, would be to create better environments for those children and keep them in homes, either their own or in foster situations, and not child welfare facilities.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“(Ryan and Kayla North) have developed, over years, their own foster care training that many groups are using around the country, finding great success and a great rate of being able to keep the children in the foster care home, because the parents are more equipped,” Johnsen said.
North said it was his hope to show that the system he and his wife developed, which pulls from other evidenced-based child care practices, much like the trust-based relational intervention training One Big Happy Home hangs its hat on.
The trainings are not necessarily unique in that regard, as trust-based training courses are delivered across the country in various forms. What they do offer, however, are tools for adoptive or foster parents to better understand a child’s lived experiences, potential trauma and its impact on the brain. The Norths have been trust-based intervention training practitioners for years, and work with organizations and agencies to bring those practices to those who need it most.
“We believe the entire community has a responsibility to care for the kids in their community. It’s not just the parents, it’s not just the state; any single place where children live, that group, those adults, need to understand trauma, and they need to understand how to help the children,” North said before the committee Tuesday. “It’s not enough that the parents are trauma informed, because your kids spend more waking hours at school than they do in your home. And so we have to affect every single environment the kids operate in.”
North said some of the techniques he and his wife espouse are based off others work in medical and psychiatric fields, including the neurosequential model theories of Bruce Perry, a medical doctor and psychiatrist who has authored self-help books and worked with the FBI in crime situations where people or children were either harmed or facing high degrees of trauma.
He told the committee that if the state adopts these types of trainings for new or current foster care parents, it allows an opportunity for them to better understand what’s driving the behaviors of children that might be seen as problematic or make them unfit to be placed in foster or permanent homes.
North noted that Michigan’s foster home supply is shrinking, and that the state remains under federal court monitoring, which has been in place since 2008 as a result of a class action lawsuit that exposed the depth of dysfunction of the state’s child welfare system. Michigan is attempting to make systemic reforms and has had some success, per the recent Modified Implementation, Sustainability and Exit Plan report, but there have been challenges, like retention.
“The state lost more homes than it gained last year, a net loss of 382 general foster homes, 120 homes for adolescents, 253 homes for sibling groups, and a net loss of 200 homes for children with disabilities,” North said. “Insufficient placement capacity undermines stability, healing and permanency. Shortages disproportionately affect adolescents, sibling groups and youth with special needs.”
North proposed that the state partner with a company like his to provide necessary pre-service training that would both meet the requirements of the state but also to aid in accelerating the rate by which Michigan can end its federal court monitoring.
“I will tell you right now that none of those trainings, as my wife and I are not medical professionals, they don’t have anything medical in them. We won’t give medical advice. You can be assured of that, but we will find the best resources in the state of Michigan to redirect people to parent coaching and a trauma and attachment certification program for staff,” North said. “What we know is just equipping and supporting the parents is not sufficient to change outcomes. You have to equip and support the entire system if you want better outcomes for the kids in care.”
Members of the committee appeared to be at least interested in continuing the conversation.
State Rep. Carrie Rheingans (D-Ann Arbor) asked if North was requesting that legislators advocate for funding the training. North said that would be the goal, but said he was happy to help no matter how that looked, whether that was through a comprehensive contract or by just providing specific aspects of the training if the state was interested.
Rheingans said she hoped the committee would see a formal proposal at some point. She noted that the committee’s role was one half appropriations but also making new laws, and wondered if North could be a partner in that way, as well.

Instead, the board ordered the school to close immediately, saying it had been “operating illegally.”
The school had planned to relocate from Union County to a campus in Mecklenburg County, a move the board approved last month. But Monroe Charter never secured the educational certificate of occupancy required to open the new site.
The school began remote instruction on Nov. 17 without state approval, and exceeded the five-day limit that charter schools are permitted to operate virtually without authorization.
Board members said they could not allow the school to continue under those conditions.
“The issue we face as a board is that the school is in operation illegally,” Bruce Friend, the board’s chair, said. “You don’t have a school building. You’re past the five days you’re allowed to go virtual. You don’t have funding.”
School leaders pleaded for more time, saying they had run into unexpected delays in Mecklenburg County’s inspection process. “I wish you would give us a week, two weeks — let us rise to the challenge,” board chair Eric Hall told state officials.
Another board member, Jim Stegall, acknowledged the school had exhausted its options. “As hard as this is going to be for parents, kids and staff, I know what you have to do,” he said.
The board also cited other problems in its vote to close the school, including failure to meet student performance standards.
The school, which opened in 2019 and enrolls 101 students, received an F grade from the state for three consecutive years, with only 12 percent of students reaching grade-level proficiency last year. Last month, the state placed Monroe Charter on “financial noncompliance status” after its expenses exceeded revenues by $180,000.
The closure is the second mid-year revocation by the Charter School Review Board this year. In October, the board ordered Triad International Studies Academy in Guilford County to close after it enrolled only 45 students, far below the state minimum of 80. Although that closure was scheduled for Dec. 31, financial troubles forced the school to shut down two weeks early.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Charter-School-words.jpg,,,2025-12-09 18:56:50.250888

For Ned Coletta, the potential closure of pediatric beds at Rutland Regional Medical Center is not a question of regulatory power and hospital autonomy. It’s a question of whether his 4-year-old will have an appropriate place to stay while doctors manage and monitor his airway condition. It’s a question of how he and his wife could balance the two-hour drive back and forth to another hospital with caring for their other two children at home. It’s a question of how they could again bear to put their child, alone, terrified and wailing, on a helicopter to Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center. It’s a question of whether they should leave Rutland. 
The Collettas’ concerns are a version of those so many parents, doctors and nurses in the Rutland region share. Since the medical center’s October announcement of the potential closure of its five inpatient pediatric beds, over 150 comments have poured into the Green Mountain Care Board’s public comment box, almost entirely in opposition to the change. Friday’s first public hearing on the closure ran hours longer than scheduled, as parents and health care providers weighed in and the board interrogated the hospital’s rationale for closure.
But as the care board deliberates these details of closure, it also opens a new chapter of regulatory power and hospital independence. The closure is the first instance of how the state’s main health care regulator flexes its newly granted ability to block hospital service cuts. The Green Mountain Care Board is an independent state regulator tasked with setting hospital budgets and commercial insurance premiums, and, as of last legislative session, its authority has extended to hospital service reductions. On Friday, the board may vote to prevent the hospital from closing the pediatric service.

“I think it’s really a useful tool, in that when the hospital wants to cut things, they’re looking at their four walls, and they’re making decisions as to their fiduciary obligations and their need for that particular place, but they’re not taking a broader bird’s eye lens for the most part, as to how it impacts the system,” the care board’s chair, Owen Foster, told VTDigger of this new authority. As few other states have regulators with this type of power, he said Vermont is “pioneering” in this ability. 
In its notice to the board of the planned closure, Rutland Regional Medical Center outlines a vision for closing its five beds and shifting instead to treating acute pediatric patients in the emergency department or transferring them to one of the region’s large academic medical centers — Dartmouth Hitchcock in Lebanon, New Hampshire, or the University of Vermont Medical Center in Burlington. Under the proposed plan, babies less than a month old would be readmitted to the labor and delivery unit, while adolescent patients could go to alternative adult inpatient units at RRMC.
Many opponents argue that these proposed alternatives fall short of the care Rutland’s children need and would exceed the cost the state’s health care system can support.
“I’ve lived through this a few times,” Coletta said of the occasions when his son has needed to go to the emergency department with breathing issues before being admitted as an inpatient, “and it’s not that easy.”
‘Not just small adults’: Care in the emergency department 
The emergency department, by nature, is a space for triage. “They’re not specialists. They’re not focused on children’s pulmonology issues,” Coletta said. His son has had to stay in the hospital overnight to ensure that his oxygen levels stabilize well enough to return home. Coletta worries about the ED becoming the default place to do this. 
Many of Rutland’s pediatricians and nurses fear the same thing: “The ED is not a family-centered nor child-friendly space. The ED environment is not meant for specialized pediatric care. It is a loud, overwhelming, chaotic, developmentally-inappropriate, adult-centered care environment,” a group of pediatric hospital providers wrote in a letter to the care board. 
During Friday’s hearing, one of those signatories, Amy Pfenning, a pediatric nurse practitioner at the hospital, elaborated on that concern: “It truly isn’t developmentally appropriate,” she said to the board. “Putting children on a stretcher with a teddy bear is terrifying. It is terrifying when they have an acute illness.” 
In a pediatric unit, a child is shielded from seeing other patients who come in mental distress or with physical trauma wounds. In the pediatric unit, the doors close fully, and the hospital bracelet sets off an alarm if a child starts to wander out toward the parking lot, Pfenning continued. In the emergency department this is not the case.
“A trauma room that, essentially, is staged with a teddy bear and a coloring book and a red wagon, does not make it a pediatric room,” Pfenning said. 
Brooke White, a nurse at RRMC wrote to the care board and illuminated some of these specific concerns that come with treating a pediatric patient: “Children are not just ‘small adults’; they have unique vital signs, medication dosages, and assessment needs,” she wrote in her letter, adding that as a pediatric nurse she frequently went to the ED to help staff place IVs and direct care. 
The hospital, for its part, says that the volume of pediatric patients requiring inpatient stays is simply not enough to justify keeping the beds open — roughly 117 children this year were admitted for a day or less. Under the new model, children who need observation for a day or less would receive the care through an extended ED stay. 
During the presentation to the care board, representatives from the hospital explained that on 169 days so far this year, its pediatric beds had zero overnight patients. Further, 63% of patients who were admitted to the inpatient beds stayed for less than one day. They say this compromises their practitioners’ ability to keep their skills fresh and get trained up to speed —  though care board member Thom Walsh pointed out that studies showing a correlation between low volume and compromised quality are weak when it comes to common pediatric admissions. It’s much more consistent for complex pediatric surgery, he said, which is not the type of care the pediatric providers at RRMC are responding to.
Local care vs. transfers hours away  
Part of the hospital’s ability to reduce the length of pediatric stays may come from keeping children close to home, posited Rebecca Merrifox, a pediatrician in Rutland. She sees patients in and out of the hospital. 
“We can wrap around our patients and our families really well,” she said during the care board meeting. “We can get them right in (to the office) the next morning and follow them up. I anticipate that if some of these sick children were transferred to other hospitals, those stays would actually be longer because the follow-up wouldn’t be quite as easy or as comprehensive as what we currently have.”
The value of having care providers, from inside and outside the hospital, embedded in the community has stood out to Coletta as well: “They know who your kid is. They know everything about them. They know you, and they actually care.”
It’s not just the type of care that a child would receive outside of their community that opponents worry about; it’s also the act of physically getting the child there, should they need to be taken to larger hospitals far away.  
RRMC’s representatives estimate that this year between 60 and 80 patients have had inpatient stays longer than one day at the hospital. Under their new plan, those children would be possible transfers. This year, an estimated 15 children have needed more acute care than the Rutland hospital could provide and were transferred elsewhere.
The hospital has established a transfer agreement with UVMMC, but in that agreement, the Burlington hospital is not required to admit the patient to their inpatient beds. It means a child could go from Rutland’s ER, into an ambulance, to waiting in the emergency department in Burlington.   
RRMC says it is still “exploring similar transfer agreements” with other hospitals, like Dartmouth. Officials reported that they have communicated with local ambulance teams about this process. 
From here, many worry that the wait times can tick up to a dangerous level: It can take hours to receive and assemble a transport team to prepare an ambulance to move a child in distress. Then, it takes nearly two hours to drive from Rutland to either Burlington or Lebanon, where DHMC is located. 
“Please consider that it is unethical and unsettling to place a low-acuity child at risk by transferring them at night, mid-winter to a facility 2 hours away. This is unacceptably dangerous,” the group of pediatric staff wrote in their same letter to the care board. They estimate that a “minimum” of three hours should be added to the transport time, to account for all that is needed for set up and breakdown.
Others also worry about the drain this would cause on the Rutland region’s EMS resources. A local ambulance taking a four hour round trip to the outer edges of the state could pull resources away from responding to stroke or heart attack patients more quickly, worried Myla Lindroos, an emergency nurse at the Rutland hospital, during the Friday hearings. “They can’t get that tissue back. They can’t get that brain tissue back, that personhood. They may never be able to walk up the stairs unaided again because they lost that heart tissue that they should have been able to have restored, with timely transport.” 
Plus, transport is destabilizing to the child. Coletta’s son has needed to go to higher-level care centers twice: once by ambulance and once by helicopter. “That’s actually not an experience that helps you get better faster,” he said. “That’s beyond terrifying and adds a whole ’nother layer of stress and risk to the situation, in my view.”
Even still, Coletta felt lucky that, through it all, the expense was something his family could manage. 
Cost to the individuals, cost to the hospital
It is expensive not only to the families — who shoulder the medical bills of expensive transport and hospital care, who bear the costs of driving hours from home to visit their sick child, missing work to do so, while potentially paying for food and lodging away from home. But it may also risk creating more expense to the system overall, care board members pointed out during the Friday hearing.
In its presentation to the board, the hospital maintained that this choice is driven not by financial realities but because low patient volume compromises quality. However, an earlier letter the hospital’s Chief Legal Officer, Mitchell Braroody, sent the care board does specify the significant losses to its revenue the hospital expects recent legislative changes will bring. He estimates an approximately $17 million drop in the hospital’s revenue in light of last year’s drug pricing cap, for instance. 
During Friday’s presentation, Jennifer Bertrand, the hospital’s chief financial officer, walked the care board through her estimate that sending young patients to RRMC’s emergency department instead of inpatient care would actually reduce the cost of local care. For 121 patients, she found that the cost of emergency department based care was $741,253 while inpatient hospital care came to $970,224.
She further estimated that cutting this service would save the hospital more than $500,000 in a year, mostly in salary reductions as the hospital consolidates 27 full-time staff equivalents to 14. However, the hospital still hopes to keep these providers employed at RRMC, even if they are re-assigned.
Incongruous costs to the system 
Care board member David Murman interrogated these figures during the Friday hearing.
He pointed out an incongruence in the hospital’s cost analysis: In calculating expenses, the medical center includes the costs of services across its Women and Children’s Unit (that includes labor and delivery, peri- and  post-natal care), hospital representatives“ neglect to include the revenue from those services. 
The hospital said the service closure could save the state’s health care system $229,000 in net costs. But many took issue with this number. 
Murman pointed out the higher cost of care in an academic medical center, the added cost that an additional ED admittance would bring, on top of the personal expenses incurred by a family. “Have you calculated out those costs?” he asked the hospital representatives. They had not. 
Following the hearing, RRMC CEO Judi Fox issued a statement, saying, “Rutland Regional Medical Center (RRMC) is committed to providing the highest quality care for children and families in our region. The proposed redesign of pediatric services presented today to the Green Mountain Care Board adjusts our care delivery to meet evolving clinical needs and workforce realities while supporting the long-term sustainability of our health care system. We recognize that any decisions involving children are especially difficult, and we approach this work with the utmost care and responsibility.” 
She was unable to respond to additional questions by press time.
Walsh, one of the care board members, picked up the issue of affordability during the hearing, concluding, “it’s not clear to me that this would make anything more affordable for your community.”
Walsh asked about maintaining fewer than five pediatric beds, adopting the more adaptable stepdown beds or having a swing bed (which can be used for multiple purposes ) model more common in other rural settings. Jessica Holmes, also a member of the care board, inquired about the consideration of expanding pediatric service to address the volume concerns. 
Board members echoed a question put most concisely by their chair, Foster: “Why now?” 
The Vermont Agency of Human Services is in the midst of organizing a broader, statewide health care transformation, aimed at tackling questions of low volume and quality just like the ones RRMC are facing. That statewide strategic plan is not expected to be available until 2028. 
In the meantime, Foster recently explained, hospitals are beginning an “unintentional transformation,” cutting services before the state has a chance to intervene and direct those decisions to maintain access. Already, Copley Hospital, in Morrisville, closed down its birthing center and pre- and post-natal care on Nov. 1; over the past year, UVMMC has moved its kidney transplant services to Dartmouth while also making an effort to shutter dialysis and a Waitsfield clinic.
However, for the first time, the Green Mountain Care Board may now exercise its recently granted authority to intervene. Under Act 68, which the Legislature passed last session, the care board has the power to evaluate hospitals’ proposed service reductions and may act to preserve access to necessary services.
The board has scheduled possible votes on the Rutland closure for Dec. 12 and 17; its deadline to decide is Dec. 20. Pending the care board decision, RRMC has scheduled the closure of the pediatric inpatient beds for Dec. 21. 
The possibility of closure is destabilizing for Coletta as he and his wife consider what would be best for their son and their family: “We of course have no idea what to do,” he said. “My job is here, our lives are here, but it really causes us to question whether our jobs and our life should be here.”

(Photo by Paul Morse Photography/Courtesy of Combat Antisemitism Movement)On a national stage last week, Providence Mayor Brett Smiley described the scene outside his house in May the night before he left on a weeklong trip to Israel funded by the Jewish Alliance of Greater Rhode Island.  
“The night before we left, we were greeted at our house with protesters on the sidewalk chanting that I support genocide and asking how many babies I had killed that day,” Smiley recounted to the audience on Dec. 3 at a conference in New Orleans sponsored by the Combat Antisemitism Movement (CAM).
“I’ve traveled for work plenty, even internationally, but the only time I have ever been protested for doing so was a trip to Israel,” Smiley, who converted to Judaism in 2024, said. “Why is that? That’s the double standard.”
It was the third year in a row that Smiley attended a summit centered around fighting antisemitism. But his attendance this year drew rebuke from Democratic state Rep. David Morales — Smiley’s main rival in the 2026 Democratic primary for the Providence mayorship. Morales said the conference was organized by a national coalition connected to “outside donors pushing a national agenda.”  
“Providence is a diverse city with strong immigrant communities, and we should never align our municipal policies with dark money efforts designed to chill political speech or target residents for expressing solidarity with Palestine,” Morales wrote in a Dec. 4 news release sent out by his mayoral campaign.
More than two years after the war in Gaza War began, the Israel-Palestine conflict continues to carve a sharp divide in Providence municipal politics — including the capital city’s mayoral race with its Democratic primary still nine months away. 
Morales cited a Dec. 2 investigative piece in the left-wing magazine Current Affairs which claims that CAM is funded by a network of largely right-wing and President Donald Trump-affiliated donors, and that the organization is “staffed heavily with former Israeli military and government communications operatives.” 
The North American Mayors Summit Against Antisemitism which Smiley attended from Dec. 2 to 4, according to Current Affairs, was “not really about ‘combating antisemitism’ at all,” but “getting city governments to suppress pro-Palestine activism, plain and simple.” 
That interpretation was disputed by Smiley’s campaign manager, Josh Block, who wrote in a Dec. 5 email that the event was attended by city leaders and organizations “committed to creating safe, welcoming cities where residents can peacefully disagree free from discrimination.” 
“For Representative Morales to suggest that these efforts to address hate speech through cooperation and collaboration amount to ‘policing free speech’ and ‘targeting residents’ is exactly the type of dangerous and divisive rhetoric that sows more hatred in our community,” Block said. 
The event program shows the mayor — who also chairs CAM’s nine-member Mayors Advisory Board, which launched in October — spoke during the event’s opening plenary on Dec. 3. A video of Smiley’s speech shows he spoke for about six minutes. 
As the mayor of “a relatively liberal New England College Town,” Smiley told the conference crowd he has seen his city fulfill all three parts of an antisemitism litmus test modeled by former Soviet dissident and Israeli politician Natan Sharansky: delegitimization, demonization and double standards. 










For Representative Morales to suggest that these efforts to address hate speech through cooperation and collaboration amount to ‘policing free speech’ and ‘targeting residents’ is exactly the type of dangerous and divisive rhetoric that sows more hatred in our community.


– Josh Block, campaign manager for Mayor Brett Smiley


Providence has “had a lot of protests, a lot of activism,” the mayor said. “There were young people ready to make posters and to go out and spew hate.” 
The protest in May outside Smiley’s home was organized by the state chapter of Jewish Voice for Peace, a national anti-Zionist organization mostly made up of American Jews and allies who criticize the Israel occupation of Palestinian territories. 
 Smiley told conference attendees that the same week he returned from his Israel trip, a Palestinian flag was flown over City Hall via a City Council-led push to recognize Palestinian-Americans on Nakba Day, which marks the displacement of the Palestinian people. The Council’s move drew condemnation from the Jewish Alliance. 
Smiley also participated in a breakout session on Dec. 3, titled “Leading from City Hall against bias and antisemitism,” which focused on “how mayors can respond with clarity and authority to antisemitic incidents,” according to the event program.
Lisa Katz, CAM’s chief government affairs officer and the head of the organization’s Mayors Program, responded to Morales’ release in a statement Monday, saying Smiley “has proven to be a committed and effective ally, and we are proud to partner and stand resolutely with him.” 
“Rather than kowtowing to malicious disinformation campaigns, Mayor Smiley has shown up time and again to do the hard work of recognizing and countering Jew-hatred in all its modern-day forms, across the political spectrum, from the extremes on both the left and the right,” Katz said, “It is unfortunate some would seek to besmirch Mayor Smiley’s leadership role in this vital collective effort to score cheap partisan points. We will not be deterred, and we’re confident Mayor Smiley won’t be either.”
The Jewish Alliance of Greater Rhode Island wrote in an unsigned statement to Rhode Island Current Tuesday that it is not affiliated with the Combat Antisemitism Movement, but that, as the “largest collective voice of the local Jewish community … we do encourage leaders across the political spectrum to engage in meaningful efforts to address the alarming rise in antisemitism at the local, national, and international levels.”
“Our leaders have an obligation to listen to and understand the Jewish community’s fears and concerns, recognize the impact of rhetoric and policies, and ensure this city remains safe for everyone,” the statement continued. “The path forward requires recognizing that Jewish safety and rights depend on building a strong, inclusive city and democracy where all people are protected.
Smiley’s trip in May was part of a “regularly scheduled civic leaders’ trip” paid for by the Alliance. Guests of participants pay for their own travel expenses, the statement said.

‘Practical playbooks’?
The Current Affairs report added that mayors attending the conference would be encouraged to adopt policies based on the organization’s Municipal Antisemitism Action Index, whose action items include broadening the definition of hate speech as well as divesting from companies and businesses that participate in the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement — which encourages the severance of ties with Israel-associated businesses. 
Morales’ statement included a few public demands of Smiley, including that the mayor release the conference agenda and “any practical playbooks” from the conference relating to municipal policymaking. Morales also asked for information on conference costs and expenses.   
The conference landing page notes that attendees would receive “practical playbooks with model ordinances and sample resolutions,” but according to Smiley’s campaign manager Block, the program booklet was “the only material from this conference.” 
“The purpose of this conference was to share best practices from around the country on combating hate speech and learn from one another — there was no slate of policy recommendations developed or agreed upon by attendees during this conference,” Block added.
Block did confirm that CAM funded the trip. “[N]o city money was spent on this conference,” he added.
Different strokes at City Hall 
 Smiley’s even-keeled approach to governance has often served as a foil to the council’s tendency to float more sweeping reforms.
Not all of the council’s bolder wishes have gone fulfilled, but from rent stabilization and safe drug use sites to carbon neutral buildings and phasing out gas-powered leafblowers, Providence’s council generally has been a reliable source of progressive policy proposals. That progressivism also applies to the council’s November 2023 resolution urging a cease-fire in Gaza and a June 2024 ordinance that would divest city funds from Israel-linked bonds. 
Both initiatives were led by Council Majority Whip Miguel Sanchez, who, in November 2023, was fired from his role as a staffer in Gov. Dan McKee’s office after posting his support for Palestine on social media and participating in a pro-Palestine rally.      
Along with City Council President Rachel Miller, who has stated she’s of Jewish heritage, Sanchez also led the move to raise the Palestinian flag over City Hall in May. Some city officials argued that other flags from around the world, including Israel, had been flown in the recent past to celebrate different heritages. After the uproar over the Palestinian flag’s presence, Smiley signed an executive order setting rules for flags flown above City Hall.     
Not all City Councilors have been on board with such maneuvers. Councilor James Taylor decried the flying of the Palestinian flag in May, the Providence Journal reported then, and former Councilor Helen Anthony did not support the move either.  
The council’s actions, such as the divestment ordinance, resurfaced in Smiley’s speech at the CAM conference.

Included in Morales’ Dec. 4 statement was a quote from Sen. Sam Bell, a Providence Democrat who is Jewish and, like Morales, more closely aligned with the leftist wing of the Democratic party.  
“While I’m grateful for his conversion to our religion, when Brett Smiley persecutes people who disagree with his right-wing views on Israel, especially fellow Jews, it makes Providence a less safe place to be a Jew,” Bell said.
Morales, replying via his campaign manager to Blocks’s statement, told Rhode Island Current, “The mayor’s statement would be more believable if he hadn’t spent the past two years filing criminal charges against peaceful college students exercising their right to protest.”
Morales was referring to the 41 Brown University students who were arrested on trespassing charges during a December 2023 sit-in that demanded the school divest from Israel-associated companies. The university administration and Smiley’s office opposed dropping the charges, which were filed in Providence District Court, but Judge Nicholas Parrillo ultimately issued a not guilty verdict in May 2024, citing their protest as “a reflection of what nonviolent and peaceful resistance, frankly, is supposed to look like.” 
“There is critical work that has to be done to make Providence a safer city for all of our neighbors, especially in the face of antisemitism,” Morales added.

(Getty Images)The Senate Public Policy Committee voted 8-0 Tuesday to allow the casino located in Ohio County to relocate to Allen County or Fort Wayne.
Senate Bill 70, authored by Sen. Justin Busch, R-Fort Wayne, will be considered again by the Indiana House when it returns in January.
There are a handful of casino bills filed this year that would give northeast Indiana a casino. One heard last week in the House would have created a new license, but no vote was taken.
Busch’s bill would allow the Rising Star Casino in southeastern Indiana — owned and operated by Full House Resorts — to move to Fort Wayne or Allen County. That casino has seen revenues plummet since casinos opened in Ohio and gambling expanded in Kentucky.
Full House supported a bill last year to move its license to New Haven but the legislation died. This year Fort Wayne Mayor Sharon Tucker is pushing for a casino in Fort Wayne, and has an agreement with the Allen County Commissioners on how to spend development dollars that would come with a gambling location.
A study released by the Indiana Gaming Commission in October found that Indianapolis was the top location for a casino relocation, followed by northeast Indiana.
While the Indianapolis region would bring the state more tax revenue, it would also hurt the two casinos nearby in Shelbyville and Anderson that help support the horse racing industry. Northeast Indiana was seen as more of an open market, impacting casinos in Ohio and Michigan.
Senate Bill 70 would require a relocation fee of $25 million be paid to the state. To move, Full House must plan an investment of at least $500 million for a casino and non-gaming amenities in the city or county.
There are also provisions in the bill to mitigate the loss to Ohio County. But the legislation does not include a requirement that local voters approve gambling.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-155351687-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-09 17:57:02.956920

(Photo by Anne-Marie Caruso/New Jersey Monitor)The New Jersey lawmaker who wanted to strip the state comptroller’s office of its investigative powers will no longer pursue his bill, caving to critics who warned the move would cripple a key state watchdog and embolden corrupt public officials.
The bill by Sen. Nicholas Scutari (D-Union) would have eliminated the comptroller’s duty to investigate complaints of governmental waste, fraud, and abuse flagged by members of the public and stripped the comptroller of some investigatory tools, including subpoenas. Scutari told the New Jersey Globe he’s not moving forward with the bill “right now.”
Acting Comptroller Kevin Walsh, who had called the bill a scam, responded on social media by thanking activists “who showed up to fight for government oversight, transparency, and accountability!” Walsh said the bill was payback for his investigations of state Democrats and other Scutari allies.
As Senate president, Scutari is the state’s most powerful state legislator and largely controls what moves in the Senate. He introduced his bill just before Thanksgiving and fast-tracked it to a hearing just a week later. The Senate state government committee’s five members passed it unanimously despite more than four hours of testimony largely opposing the measure.
Scutari argued that his bill would have merely moved investigatory powers to a different state agency that would have been better equipped to handle serious probes.
The bill’s critics included U.S. Sen Andy Kim (D) and Attorney General Matt Platkin, who testified against it in front of the committee last week. Both men sparred with the committee chair, state Sen. James Beach (D-Camden), who chastised Kim when Kim noted that he had spent nearly six hours at the Statehouse waiting to testify.
“Why do you think you’re special? You’re not,” Beach told him.
Tuesday, Kim said the bill would have severely weakened the comptroller’s oversight power, further damaging the public’s trust in state government.
“This is a win for the people of New Jersey and a signal of the power of a growing anti-corruption movement throughout our state and this country,” Kim said in a statement. “As I’ve said before, the opposite of democracy is apathy. Do not feel helpless about fixing our broken politics. It isn’t just possible, it’s necessary. Now let’s get ready for the next fights.”

The largest contract was for nearly $97 million to Crossland Construction Co., Inc., for bridges and paving on the East-West Connector turnpike in the Newcastle and Oklahoma City areas, said Darian Butler, OTA engineering director. 
The bridges will be over Pennsylvania Avenue and the Canadian River, he said. 
The project includes 2,412 feet of mainline roadway including earthwork, drainage and paving.
The 28-mile East-West Connector will link Interstate 44 in the area of Newcastle and Tuttle at Oklahoma Highway 37 and cross the Canadian River east to Interstate 35. The tollroad will continue northeast to Interstate 40 to connect to the Kickapoo Turnpike in eastern Oklahoma County.
The entire link is expected to be completed in 2030, said Lisa Shearer-Salim, an OTA spokesperson.
OTA awarded a $3 million contract to Sherwood Construction Co. to drain and backfill a pond in the path of the East-West Connector.
The panel also awarded Duit Construction Co. a $23 million contract to widen the John Kilpatrick Turnpike at Wilshire Boulevard about four miles north. It includes widening  a bridge over Oklahoma Highway 3.
“The Kilpatrick is the fastest traffic-growing four-lane divided highway in the state of Oklahoma,” said Joe Echelle, OTA executive director.
Growth on the Kilpatrick Turnpike, with the exception of the COVID outbreak, has grown between 8% and 12 % a year, he said.
All three contracts are part of ACCESS, called Advancing and Connecting Communities and Economies Safely Statewide. The 15-year program is expected to cost more than $8 billion.
Tolls were increased between 10% and 20% in January to fund it.
In unrelated action, OTA does not expect to increase tolls in 2026 on the Gilcrease Turnpike in west Tulsa. 
Due to how the financing was structured, the roadway is not part of the overall system where toll revenue is cross pledged to support the entire system. 
The Gilcrease opened in 2022. 
Toll revenue has generated $82 million more than what was projected, Shearer-Salim said.
A 3% toll increase was set for Jan. 1. An earlier planned toll increase in 2024 was also deferred due to better than expected revenue.

Under a joint proposal with seven Republican-led states that challenged the program, the department would not enroll any new borrowers in the Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan, deny any pending applications and place borrowers currently in the plan into legally compliant repayment plans.
The program, introduced in 2023 under then-President Joe Biden’s administration, was hit with legal challenges from several GOP-led states, including Missouri, and has been blocked by the courts. The initiative sought to provide lower monthly loan payments for borrowers and forgive remaining debt after a certain period of time. 
If a Missouri federal court approves the agreement, the department said borrowers currently enrolled in the SAVE plan “will have a limited time to select a new, legal repayment plan and begin repaying their student loans.”
The agreement stems from a legal challenge to the plan brought by Missouri, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, North Dakota, Ohio and Oklahoma in 2024.
A ‘deceptive scheme’
In a statement alongside the announcement, Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent said President Donald Trump’s administration “is righting this wrong and bringing an end to this deceptive scheme.” 
“The law is clear: if you take out a loan, you must pay it back,” Kent added. “Thanks to the State of Missouri and other states fighting against this egregious federal overreach, American taxpayers can now rest assured they will no longer be forced to serve as collateral for illegal and irresponsible student loan policies.” 
Republicans argued the permissive repayment plan let borrowers off the hook at the expense of federal taxpayers.
Missouri Attorney General Catherine Hanaway said in a statement Tuesday her office “fought for hardworking Americans who were being preyed upon by Biden Administration bureaucrats, and we won in court every time.” 
“We appreciate President Trump’s real, long-term solutions instead of illegal student loan schemes,” Hanaway added. 
Student advocates, though, said the agreement would place an additional burden on student borrowers already struggling with a rising cost of living.
Persis Yu, deputy executive director and managing counsel at the advocacy group Protect Borrowers, blasted the settlement agreement as “pure capitulation” in a Tuesday statement. 
“While millions of student loan borrowers struggle amidst the worsening affordability crisis … billionaire Education Secretary, Linda McMahon chose to strike a back-room deal with a right-wing state Attorney General and strip borrowers of the most affordable repayment plan that would help millions to stay on track with their loans while keeping a roof over their head,” Yu said. 
Interest accumulating
In February, a federal appeals court upheld a lower court injunction that blocked the SAVE plan from going into effect. Borrowers under the plan were placed in an interest-free forbearance last year amid legal limbo. 
But borrowers’ loans in the SAVE forbearance began to accrue interest Aug. 1 — a move the department announced in July to comply with court orders. 
The SAVE plan was already set to be phased out by July 2028 under congressional Republicans’ tax and spending cut bill that Trump signed into law this year.

Josh Shapiro’s private residence in Montgomery County and administrative travel on charter flights. 
Democrats on the Intergovernmental Operations Committee called the move a “witch hunt” and “disingenuous,” saying the body doesn’t have the authority to subpoena and questioning its “legislative purpose.”
Committee Chair Sen. Jarrett Coleman (R-Lehigh) chronicled requests sent to the Shapiro administration dating back to August, saying he’d only received partial answers related to the administration’s spending.
Harrisburg man pleads guilty to attempted murder and arson in Governor’s Residence firebombing

“No one disputes that the governor should have reasonable and appropriate protection, or that the governor should have access to transportation for reasonable and appropriate travel associated with his role,” said Coleman. “But no administration, Republican or Democrat, should be allowed to operate in the shadows and refuse to provide basic details about their decisions when millions of taxpayer dollars are being involved and precedent is being set.”
SpotlightPA reported nearly $1.1 million was allocated to Shapiro’s private residence in Abington Township outside of Philadelphia for updates following an arson attack on the Governor’s Residence in Harrisburg while Shapiro and his family slept inside. 
Two of Tuesday’s subpoenas relate to the Abington home. The first, to the Pennsylvania State Police, requests a copy of a May security assessment, along with communications related to construction and security work at both the private home and a neighboring property. It also directs the agency to hand over body camera footage from officers who visited either Shapiro property between Sept. 20 and Nov. 19 of this year. 
The second subpoena request to Abington Township seeks permits and zoning hearing transcripts related to the property as well as communication records. The third dives into charter flights. 
All three are due to the committee by noon on Jan. 16.
 Background details

In February, during a State Police budget hearing, agency leadership confirmed that Shapiro and Lt. Gov. Austin Davis had used their aircraft in addition to the plane traditionally used by governors that is operated by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. But while the latter is required to post flight logs, state police don’t have the same obligation — though both are funded by taxpayers. 
Coleman’s subpoena focuses on a separate category of chartered flights taken by state officials with Let’s Go Air, Inc. when state police planes needed maintenance. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette details January flights taken across the state and obtained through a records request, which doesn’t include the passenger lists sought by Coleman, who is an airline pilot. 
Following Tuesday’s meeting, Coleman told reporters that the administration had provided “conflictory” records in regards to flight manifests, saying that “passengers were changing after the fact.”
“We’re really not confident they can provide the information accurately to us. We’re just going to the source,” he said. 
Tuesday’s subpoena, directed to Let’s Go Air CEO Michael Hartle, also seeks passenger screening confirmations for those January flights, alongside booking records and communications between the company and state leaders.
Shortly before the meeting, Coleman said his team received an email from State Police, but he said he hadn’t yet reviewed it. He said the administration similarly delivered information minutes before a previous committee to issue a subpoena, prompting Coleman to delay that vote — an action he said wouldn’t happen again despite the last-minute communication. 
“We’re not playing games anymore. Taxpayers deserve an answer,” Coleman said. 
In a statement about all three subpoenas, Shapiro spokesperson Will Simons criticized Coleman’s actions, emphasizing that the home upgrades were recommended for the governor’s safety.

“Following the assassination attempt on the governor’s life and attack on the Governor’s Residence earlier this year, the Pennsylvania State Police and independent security experts conducted thorough reviews to pinpoint security failures, review protocols, identify gaps and make concrete recommendations for improvements to the governor’s security. As a direct result of those recommendations, security improvements have been put in place to keep the governor and his family safe,” said Simons.
Simons highlighted a bipartisan event Shapiro will cohost Tuesday night with Utah Gov. Spencer Cox on faith and political violence. 
“The Shapiro administration has repeatedly responded to lawmakers’ inquiries on this matter and publicly released a substantial amount of information about the security improvements put in place by PSP without compromising those security protocols,” he said. “While Governor Shapiro is speaking about political violence alongside the Republican governor of Utah, Senator Coleman is once again showing clear disregard for the governor and his family’s safety – leveling partisan attacks through the press instead of working in good faith to protect the governor and future governors while carefully stewarding taxpayer dollars.”
 Partisan divide

The seven GOP committee members turned back attempts from the four Democrats to table the subpoenas or recess the meeting until Coleman could review his newly received email. Each motion introduced by Minority Leader Sen. Jay Costa (D-Allegheny) was defeated on a party-line vote. 
“We believe that this committee doesn’t have jurisdiction over the subject matter that you’re seeking,” said Costa. 
Members of the Senate Intergovernmental Operations Committee assemble on Dec. 9, 2025 ahead of a subpoena vote. (Whitney Downard/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)
At times, Costa and Coleman traded barbs about the process, with Costa maintaining that Coleman “(had) not described to us the legislative work you’re trying to achieve with this.”
“You indicated that this may lead to legislation,” continued Costa. “This is disingenuous … there’s no legislative purpose in what you’re trying to do.”
Committee Vice Chair Sen. Cris Dush (R-Jefferson) painted the subpoenas as necessary in order to obtain “information that, for some reason, the governor chooses to withhold from us.”
“(We) definitely have the authority to investigate the misuse of those funds because we have to make decisions going forward as to whether or not we are going to continue to allocate funds to the executive,” said Dush. “We have to be informed in order to pass legislation.”
But Sen. Vincent Hughes (D-Philadelphia) called subpoenas “an extreme in the investigative process,” adding that lawmakers weren’t “investigative authorities in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.”
“This smells awfully of a witch hunt trying to find something that is not there,” said Hughes. 
Committee-issued subpoenas are rare, but not a new experience for Coleman. A 2024 effort went all the way to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which sided with Coleman’s subpoena and compelled committee testimony.

Those students are Kerly Mariangel Sosa Rivero and her father Gleiner Jose Sosa Mujica; Antony Janier Peña Sosa and his mother Maryeli Antonieta Sosa Marquina; Mor Ba; and Santiago Jesus Zamora Perez and his mother Evelin Josefina Perez, all of whom were seeking asylum from Venezuela besides Ba, who was seeking asylum from Senegal. 
“Kerly, Antony, Mor, Santiago, along with parents Gleiner, Maryeli and Evelin are simply following the immigration process and trying to gain asylum as they seek a better life in Detroit,” the letter from legislators stated. “The students’ teachers and community leaders have spoken about how respectful the students are and have spoken publicly about their desire that ICE release them immediately, a call that resonates deeply throughout the Detroit community.”
“The abduction of these students is unconscionable,” state Sen. Erika Geiss (D-Taylor) wrote in a press release from her office. “These students and their families came to this country to seek a better life and instead are the victims of political violence at the hands of an indiscriminating agency that is abusing its power.”
State Sens. Stephanie Chang (D-Detroit) and Mary Cavanagh (D-Redford Township) echoed these concerns, noting that all of the students and families involved had active asylum cases and were following legal immigration procedures.

“These Detroit students should be in their classrooms, not torn from their community,” U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit) said. “I am demanding their immediate release. Our children deserve safety, human dignity, the love of their families, and the freedom to pursue their dreams without being terrorized by a system that treats them as disposable.”
“ICE must release them immediately so they can continue their education, keep their families together, and pursue their asylum cases with dignity,” Detroit City Councilmember Gabriela Santiago Romero said. “Detroiters will not look away while our children are taken. We stand with our students and the immigrant families who make our city strong.”

Busy Anderson is a reporter with the Community News Service, part of the University of Vermont’s Reporting & Documentary Storytelling program.
Vermont is in the midst of an alarming referee shortage — a problem unfolding nationwide, but one that has hit hard in a state with a small and aging workforce.
Between 2018 and 2023, the National Federation of State High School Associations reported a loss of almost 60,000 officials nationwide, a trend exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
In Vermont, officials are spread thin covering games across 23 sports at over 70 high schools in the Vermont Principals’ Association — the state’s governing body for school athletics. Trainees aren’t offsetting the number of retiring veteran officials, and the resulting gap in personnel is forcing games to be postponed or canceled. 
“What was just affecting a couple sports out of the wide pool of varsity sports in the state — now it’s virtually every sport,” said Devin Wendel, president of the Vermont State Athletic Directors Association and athletic director at Mount Abraham Union High School. 
With a working population that is already strained, the persisting shortage of officials in Vermont carries a serious risk of interrupting high school seasons. 
“If we don’t do something, in the next three to five years there won’t be enough of us to cover sporting events in Vermont and that is bad for all involved,” Steve Cicio — president of Vermont’s branch of the International Association of Approved Basketball Officials — wrote in a Nov. 13 email. “We are going to struggle this season with what we have for numbers,” he said.
This year alone, the association lost between 10 and 12 varsity officials, and five to six junior varsity officials, according to Cicio. 
Many of those retiring have been in the business for numerous decades, with expertise in multiple sports. Their retirements mean fewer mentors for the next generation filling their shoes. 
A 2023 survey of the association’s officials found that around half planned to retire by 2028. 
“Not only are we losing a large percentage of our board, but out of that 50%, a large percentage of those folks are capable and qualified to work almost any game in the state,” said Trevour Houle, a varsity basketball official of nearly 10 years. “If I were to guess, it’s going to create a snowball effect where we lose a large amount of officials — those who are left are asked to work more nights a week, those officials are probably going to get burnt out or injured, and they’re going to decide next year whether they want to do that all over again or not.” 
Dwindling numbers puts a greater burden on those remaining, who are expected to cover more games across further distances than they had previously. 
“You’re seeing officials that are getting overworked, trying to hustle over to get from one location to the next,” said Michael Jabour, senior director of activities at South Burlington High School and Middle School. 
Varsity teams typically take priority because their regular seasons determine playoffs and championships, unlike junior varsity teams, said Tim Messier, athletic director at Lamoille Union High School. Teams at Lamoille Union lose a couple games each season because officials aren’t available, he said.
Referees are paid $97.50 for varsity and $75 for junior varsity games, plus the cost of mileage. First-time registration to be an official costs $30 and secures certification for one year. Referees can then officiate as many sports they choose to train for.
The VPA’s officials committee increased the pay by 30% two years ago and the earnings are aligned with all other New England states, said Lauren Young, executive director of activities at the VPA.  
“You take your $97.50 and it sounds like, ‘Wow, that’s a great fee for a game.’ Well, it was an hour there. You have to get to the game an hour early. The game takes an hour and a half to two hours. You shower, you’re in the locker room for 20 minutes after the game and then you have your hour ride home,” Houle said. “When you start breaking it down to an hourly rate, it’s not that great.” 
Vermont’s handful of remaining referees also face continuing harassment, particularly from spectators, said Young. She suspects that poor sportsmanship is partially to blame for disillusionment about joining the force. 
Among those who become certified, most new officials resign within their first three years, according to the National Federation of State High School Associations. 
“They can never be right. They’re always to blame,” Jabour said. “It’s hard to be an official because you’re constantly being told how terrible you are.”
As the VPA ramps up their recruitment efforts, Young wants to see a more accurate representation of Vermont’s student body with whistles — particularly through more women and people of color becoming certified to officiate.
“We have diverse schools, and I think there’s power in seeing people in a position of authority in the game that are reflective of what they look like to try to dispel some of the older white male dominance over the officiating world,” she said. 
Nationally, the shortage could be on the mend. The National Federation of State High School Associations reported an 8% increase in registered officials this year compared to 2018. 
But in Vermont, the void left by referees stepping down isn’t being filled. While the VPA is marketing to college students and tapping school administrators to spread the word about the shortage in their communities, Young expects to draw in just two or three newcomers this year.
“Even recruiting 10 officials in the state of Vermont can have a huge impact on a local high school being able to actually keep their schedule intact,” Wendel said.

Pictured here is a completed project Black Hawk Lake. (Screenshot from DNR video on YouTube)The Iowa Department of Natural Resources has about $9.6 million annually of state appropriated money to improve water quality and recreational opportunities at Iowa lakes. 
Most of these projects take several years to complete, but DNR’s annual report for 2025 and plan for 2026 show shoreline work, sediment removal, nutrient reduction and chemical treatments that inactivate lake phosphorus continue to be priorities. 
Since 2006 when the Lake Restoration program was initiated, the department has removed nearly 8 million cubic yards of excess sediment, enhanced 14,000 acres of wetland and shallow lakes, completed more than 60 infrastructure improvement projects and worked with partners to install more than 700 watershed best management practices. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
According to DNR, the projects completed with the program have an average cost share of 37% with other partners. To date, the Lake Restoration Program has invested more than $176 million into 72 Iowa lakes. 
In fiscal year 2025, which ran from July 1, 2024 through June 30, 2025, the report details major restoration projects at lakes across the state, some of which are still in the works for 2026. 
Projects like shoreline restoration, sediment removal, the construction of sediment and nutrient ponds upstream and fish habitat restoration were listed as major restorations at Three Mile Lake, Casey Lake, Lake Keomah and Little Storm Lake, according to the DNR report. 
The report notes that shoreline restoration and dam improvements for Lake Keomah will continue into 2026, as will similar projects at McKinley Lake.

DNR also conducted flood restoration and flood prevention strategies at Cedar Lake and the Iowa Great Lakes in 2025. 
The Iowa Great Lakes had more than 90 miles of collapsed shoreline, according to DNR, due to flooding in 2024 that caused “extensive” erosion in West Okoboji Lake, East Okoboji Lake, Big Spirit Lake and Silver Lake. 
The Lake Restoration Project helped to restore shoreline slope at 33 sites around the Iowa Great Lakes and the public shoreline at Triboji in 2025. Additional bank stabilization projects for the lakes are slated for 2026, according to the plan. 
Green Valley Lake and Prairie Rose Lake were treated with alum in 2025 to help neutralize the excess phosphorus in the water. 
Excess phosphorus, according to the report, is the “primary contributor” to algae blooms in Iowa lakes. According to DNR, the excess phosphorus comes from up the watershed, but also can be “internally recycled” as sediment in the lake is stirred up. 
DNR started treating lakes with alum, or aluminum sulfate, which binds to soluble phosphorus in the lake and brings it to the surface of the water, thus reducing the phosphorus release into the water. 
According to the report, the alum treatments at Green Valley and Prairie Rose lakes led to clearer water — as much as 15 feet of visibility — and fewer algae blooms throughout the summer season.
Lake of Three Fires and Silver Lake are slated for alum treatments in the coming year.
DNR also noted it will prioritize beach restoration work in 2026, to reduce bacteria concentrations at Brushy Creek Lake, Big Creek Lake and Hickory Grove Lake. 
In the 2025 lake recreational season DNR reported beach closures as 28 state park beaches, at least once, because of high levels of E. coli or microcystins, a toxin released by certain types of algae.
DNR’s draft plan said runoff from rain events “contributes to ongoing issues” with indicator bacteria at Brushy Creek Lake and Big Creek Lake beaches. The department plans to improve these issues with best management practices, like grassed waterways, sediment control basins, streamside buffers, terraces and other practices to catch nutrients and sediment up the watershed. 
DNR plans to address Hickory Grove Lake’s beaches with stormwater management improvements with help from a $25 million, 20-year, Water and Land Legacy bond approved by Story County voters.
According to DNR, Iowa’s lakes are an “important” part of its economy. More than 60% of Iowans say they visit a lake at least once a year and $1.32 billion in annual spending can be attributed to lake recreation.
DNR said at the current allocation rate for the Lake Restoration Program, the department will be able to “stay on schedule with implementing restoration efforts” at the designated lakes and wetlands outlined in the report. 
“Current and future appropriations will be critical to complete current projects and initiate new projects during FY27-FY31,” the plan said. 
The Legislature approved $9.6 million for the program for fiscal year 2026. 
More information about the Lake Restoration Program, project cost and detailed plans for each lake can be found in the report. 
DNR is accepting public comments on the report through Dec. 17.

The bill (SB 126) was introduced just weeks after the PSC approved a nearly $7 billion rate increase for Florida Power & Light’s (FPL) 12 million customers, the largest rate hike in history.
State Sen. Don Gaetz, R-Crestview, introduced a “strike-all” amendment Tuesday before the Senate Regulated Industries Committee revising Florida law regarding the PSC, including:

Expanding the number of PSC commissioners from five to seven and requiring one commissioner to be a certified public accountant and another a chartered financial analyst.
Requiring the PSC, when issuing orders, to provide adequate support for its conclusions.
Requiring the PSC to provide reasoned explanations when accepting or denying a settlement agreement.
Requiring the PSC to submit an annual report on public utility rates that includes benchmarking and analysis on economics, costs, return on equity, and executive compensation.

One provision that the amendment drops from Gaetz’s original bill would have capped a utility’s return on equity (ROE). That represents the utility’s allowed profit. FPL’s recently approved rate increase includes an ROE of 10.95%.
The removal of that provision upset two members of the public who spoke about the legislation during the hearing.
“The bill as amended has altered a critical tool — a cap that would limit shareholder profits, which is necessary to keep utilities from passing executive costs on to taxpayers,” said Brian Lee of Reclaiming Florida’s Future.
“The strike-all amendment weakens its ability to deliver real relief for Florida families,” added Taylor Brown. “Housing costs, insurance, and utility bills are pushing people to a breaking point.”
Affordability
Florida law requires the rates of regulated utility companies to be “fair, just and reasonable.”
Sen. Gaetz’s bill says that the PSC should consider affordability in any proceeding before the agency that has the potential to affect rates.
“The reason affordability got into this bill is because when the latest case came before the PSC, associated with FPL, commissioners were asked to consider affordability and they said, ‘We can’t because it wasn’t in the statute.’ We’re going to help them with that, I hope,” he told the committee.
Committee chair Jennifer Bradley, R-Fleming Island, asked Mark Futrell, deputy executive director with the PSC, whether the agency could define affordability.
“I think more certainty, more clarity as far as definitions from the intent of the Legislature is always helpful, but I think that we can work through that,” Futell said. “Affordability is something that — we get the sentiment of it. I think we understand that part of it.”
Sen. Debbie Mayfield, R-Melbourne, said she had a number of concerns about the legislation, including the provisions about adding two new members to the PSC.
“If we have a problem with the PSC board, I don’t think increasing it would solve their problem,” she said. “We are the ones who do confirm them, so if we have a problem with the commission, it’s just as much our fault for confirming people that we don’t think are going to do a good job.”
Sen. Jason Pizzo, NPA-Sunny Isles Beach, said he appreciated that Gaetz had removed the provision that would have capped a utility’s ROE.
“I am not for caps,” he said. “I think that’s socialism.”
Gaetz told the committee his intent was “not to tie the hands of the utility companies.”
“The intent of the bill is to direct the commission to justify their decisions,” he said. “And to explain how they made their decisions and the effect that those decisions have on ratepayers.”
The bill was ultimately unanimously approved by the committee, 9-0, and moves to the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Environment, and General Government.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/FLORIDA_POWER_AND_LIGHT_COMPANY__PA_Consulting.jpg,,,2025-12-09 17:57:02.956920
,DC,2025-12-09 22:15:21+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Democrats turn up the heat on Hegseth over Caribbean boat strike that killed 2 survivors,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/democrats-turn-heat-hegseth-over-caribbean-boat-strike-killed-2-survivors,,"WASHINGTON — Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill Tuesday escalated their demands that Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth publicly release an unedited video of a controversial follow-on strike by U.S. forces in the Caribbean Sea that killed two shipwrecked survivors.The Sept. 2 strike has drawn scrutiny and questions over Hegseth’s role in ordering a commander to launch additional ammunition to kill two men clinging to the wreckage of an alleged drug smuggling boat after an initial strike left the vessel in flames.“Why wouldn’t they release it? They were so excited, the Department of Defense and Pete Hegseth, so excited to release all those videos until this part, and then, ‘Oh no, we can't release that,’” Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., told States Newsroom.President Donald Trump posted a 29-second edited video of the strike on Sept. 2 on his social media platform Truth Social that did not show the survivors. Several military experts argue the early September follow-on strike was against international law and the Pentagon’s own law of war that states shipwrecked survivors should be rescued, not killed.The follow-on strike in question was the first of nearly two dozen U.S. attacks on boats in the Caribbean Sea, which the administration alleges are all smuggling narcotics. The operations — the latest killing four on Dec. 4 — have killed 87 individuals, according to multiple media reports. Hegseth has posted videos of some.‘Illegal orders’ videoSix Democratic lawmakers, including Kelly, released a video of their own on Nov. 18 on social media, reminding active duty military members they have a right to refuse “illegal orders.” All six had served in the military or worked in intelligence agencies.Trump accused the lawmakers of “seditious behavior,” and Hegseth launched a Navy investigation and involved the FBI, even threatening Kelly, a member of the Armed Services Committee who reached the rank of captain before retiring from the military, with a potential arrest by this week.“Based on what was said publicly, tomorrow the secretary of the Navy is supposed to give a plan to the secretary of Defense,” Kelly said, adding that he hasn’t been “officially notified” of anything. “I mean, I've also been retired from the Navy for 14 years. So okay, maybe they don't have my number anymore. Maybe that's the issue. But actually, what the real issue is, is these are a bunch of clowns who do not have any idea what they're doing,” Kelly said.Sen. Roger Wicker, chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, told States Newsroom he is “still listening to concerns” about releasing the unedited footage of the follow-on strike.“There are people still considering the ramifications when it comes to whether it would put some of our troops in danger. There were classified items on the video, and that is still under consideration,” the Mississippi Republican said.Senators briefedHegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio were on Capitol Hill Tuesday to brief top senators on the attacks on alleged drug running boats and the buildup of U.S. Navy ships off the coast of Venezuela.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said afterward, “it was a very unsatisfying briefing.”“I asked Secretary Hegseth, secretary of Defense, would he let every member of Congress see the unedited video of the September 2 strike. His answer: 'We have to study it.' Well in my view, they studied it long enough. Congress ought to be able to see it,"" said Schumer, a New York Democrat.He told reporters ahead of the briefing that he planned “to confront Secretary Hegseth on exactly what the hell is going on in the Caribbean.” Schumer later said he is “very, very concerned” the administration will begin a land war in the South American country.When asked if he supports making the unedited video public, Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters he’s “happy with” the committee probes already underway.“The relevant committees as I’ve said before, the Armed Services Committee, both Democrats and Republicans, have had an opportunity to view that video. How they decide to proceed with it, I’ll leave to their discretion. But I think any member who wants to see that, I suspect probably would have that opportunity,” the South Dakota Republican said.Kelly told States Newsroom he “guesses” all members of the Senate Armed Services Committee will be able to view the video by next week.Hegseth travel curbedLawmakers included a provision in the annual defense policy bill to withhold a quarter of Hegseth’s travel budget until the Department of Defense releases unedited video of the “double tap” strike.The House and Senate committees on Armed Services both launched bipartisan probes shortly after The Washington Post published revelations about the attack. Top members of the House and Senate committees on Armed Services viewed the full footage of the follow-on strike. Reaction afterward was split along party lines.Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, backs releasing the video, which he told reporters reveals “nothing remarkable.”The top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, Adam Smith of Washington state, said Sunday the video would contradict the GOP’s telling of the footage.“When they (the survivors) were finally taken out, they weren’t trying to flip the boat over. The boat was clearly incapacitated. A tiny portion of it remained, capsized, the bow of the boat. They had no communications device. Certainly, they were unarmed,” Smith said on ABC News’ “This Week with George Stephanopoulos. “Any claim that the drugs had somehow survived that attack is hard, hard to really square with what we saw.”Trump walks back commentsTrump told Politico during a one-on-one interview published Tuesday that “it looked like they were trying to turn back over the boat, but I don’t get involved in that.”Trump walked back on Monday previous comments that he would have “no problem” releasing the unedited video. The Washington Post reported Nov. 28 that Hegseth gave a verbal directive to “kill everybody” that in turn led the commanding admiral to order the follow-on strike.Hegseth initially dismissed the report as “fabricated.” On Dec. 1, the White House confirmed that Hegseth authorized Adm. Frank M. “Mitch” Bradley to conduct the strikes.A New York Times article Dec. 1, citing five U.S. officials who spoke separately on the condition of anonymity, reported that Hegseth gave an initial written order for an operation to kill the alleged drug smugglers on the boat and destroy the entire vessel. According to the report, Hegseth did not address additional steps if the first missile did not accomplish both goals, and he did not give Bradley additional orders in response to video surveillance of the boat.Hegseth said during a livestreamed Cabinet meeting Dec. 2 that he was not in the room when the follow-on attack was launched.",,,,2025-12-09 17:57:02.956920

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahomans still lack a date for when public access to the state’s system that tracks election, lobbying and campaign finance will be restored, nearly three months after it was taken offline for updates.   
While the public can request data through the Oklahoma Ethics Commission, the Guardian system’s online component, which provides a quick way to examine information about campaign spending, lobbyists and candidates, remains inaccessible. The system was first taken offline Sept. 19 and a beta version was launched with limited access for filers, but not the public, in late October.
The delay is also affecting new lobbyist registration and candidate filings as the 2026 statewide election season begins to intensify and the Legislature prepares for session in February. 
Lee Anne Bruce Boone, executive director of the Oklahoma Ethics Commission, said Guardian 2.0 is in the “final phase of transition” and the Ethics Commission is validating data delivered by the vendor. 
The change in the software system is a result of a vendor no longer supporting the old system. 
Bruce Boone said the timeline for replacing Guardian wasn’t set by the Commission. The previous vendor established the shutdown date for the old system and the new vendor committed to replacing it within the established window, but unanticipated data conversion issues led to a longer timeline, she said.
“The complexity of the data-conversion process proved greater than the vendor initially projected,” Bruce Boone said. “When the data arrived, it required substantially more remediation and validation than anticipated, resulting in delays outside the Commission’s control.”
Guardian provides public access to candidate expenditures and contributors as well as information about lobbyists, which candidates have filed paperwork to run for office and the formation of political action committees.
On Tuesday, a special primary election was occurring to fill a vacant House seat covering parts of Pawnee, Payne, Creek, Noble and Osage counties. 
A number of candidates have also indicated that they’ll be running for office in the 2026 general elections.
“Campaign finance data is not like ordinary website content — it is legal data,” Bruce Boone said in a statement. “Every number in a report can affect compliance decisions, enforcement actions, public trust, and even the outcome of an election.”
The Commission will decide on the system’s readiness based on accuracy, reliability and performance when data validation is complete, Bruce Boone said. 
Bruce Boone said the Commission has fulfilled every public data request while the online system hasn’t been accessible and is “preparing temporary contingency options to support reporting if the vendor cannot finalize the remaining issues within a very short window.”
No filers will be penalized or negatively affected during this period because of delays from the system transition. 
“We recognize this is a critical time in the election cycle, and no requester has been denied access to information because of this transition,” Bruce Boone said. “… The Commission cannot responsibly accept new filings until the underlying legacy data is validated. Opening the filing portal before that validation is complete would risk mixing new reports with inaccurate historical data, which would undermine both compliance and public trust.”
Lobbyists are also affected. 
The Ethics Commission website advises that “2026 renewal registrations for lobbyists and liaisons are not active at this time.” The Commission expects the renewal feature to be finalized by the end of the year, Bruce Boone said. 
Registration for new lobbyists is available, she said.

(Courtesy Glacier National Park)State officials report mixed hunting results across Montana as the general deer and elk season ended on Nov. 30, according to the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks.
Montana FWP collects data through check stations and reports back success rate and numbers relating to animals taken.
In northeastern Montana, hunter numbers were in line with long-term averages, but distributed differently than they had been in the past.
“Hunter numbers at the check station were up 27% at the beginning of the season after antelope and pheasant season opened, but down 15% during the general deer and elk season,” Scott Hemmer, a Havre-area biologist said in an FWP press release. “Most notably, deer hunter numbers were down 11% from last year and 14% below the long-term average.”
Lower white-tailed deer numbers and mule doe takes were reported, though this was expected, Hemmer said in the press release. Notably, antelope checked by FWP in the area was 55% higher than in 2024. FWP reported 1,681 hunters passed through the Havre check station.
They took 346 mule deer, 67 white-tailed deer, 232 antelope and 26 elk. Additionally, 639 pheasants were taken and 126 sharp-tailed grouse.
“Most antelope hunters reported improved numbers of antelope seen compared to recent years,” Hemmer said in a press release, “and this was our largest number checked since 2010.”
Hunter harvests in southwestern Montana were “mixed,” an FWP press release said. 
FWP’s Region 3 office reported check stations at Alder, Cameron, Canyon Ferry, Divide, Gallatin Canyon, Lakeside and Silver City collectively met with 7,069 hunters who harvested 49 white-tailed deer, 174 mule deer and 355 elk.
In southcentral Montana, FWP reported a below-average deer harvest and an above average elk take.
Throughout the season, a total of 4,203 hunters visited Big Timber, Columbus, Lavina and Billings check stations in Region 5. FWP reported they harvested 487 total mule deer, 384 white-tailed deer, 284 elk and 58 antelope.
“Season totals for mule deer, elk and antelope were all above totals observed in 2024; total white-tailed deer harvest this year was slightly below the total from 2024,” a Region 5 FWP press release said.
Augusta, the only check station in Region 4, reported just over 2,800 hunters passing through the check station.
That’s a 10% increase above the five-year average but a 9% decline from the 10-year average, a FWP press release stated. 
Overall harvest finished with 679 deer and elk with Montana residents taking 83% of the total harvest in Region 4. Additionally, 75% of the total deer and elk harvest came from public lands, the Region 4 release said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/4406928530_3cb5d140bb_k-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-09 17:57:02.956920

Hanshaw says their policies will focus on economic development and job creation. (Photo by Perry Bennett/West Virginia Legislative Photography)Republican members of the West Virginia House of Delegates said Tuesday that their priorities for the upcoming 2026 regular session will be policies focused on economic development and job creation.
House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, R-Clay, made the announcement during a news conference with lawmakers in the House Chamber on Tuesday afternoon. He said that members of his caucus will be putting their legislative efforts into a three-pillar approach to increase jobs in the state and grow the economy through investment across multiple industries.
Those three pillars, Hanshaw said, will be: job training, workforce development and retention; an emphasis on “job-creating businesses” and, lastly, practicing “responsible economic growth.”
As part of workforce development, Hanshaw said lawmakers will be eyeing another pay raise for the state’s teachers and school service personnel. 
West Virginia has one of the lowest teacher pay rates in the country. Before the 2025 legislative session, Gov. Patrick Morrisey called for teacher pay raises during his State of the State address. During the session, however, lawmakers shot down a bill that would have tied teacher pay to the home values in the counties where they live.
In November, state Treasurer Larry Pack — who does not have any legislative authority — said he would be backing legislation to ensure all teachers in West Virginia make at least $50,000 annually. Those already at that threshold, he said, should receive a $2,000 raise.
Hanshaw did not provide details of the potential 2026 teacher pay raise bill on Tuesday. He said that the House Republicans want “to be sure that [they] are continuing to try to be responsive to market demands” regarding teacher and school personnel pay to ensure educators are able to remain in the state.
Hanshaw said other priorities for the first pillar of his economic development plan include the “Recharge West Virginia Act,” which would “support” local businesses in the state that increase their staffing. He said he also wants to see the state government expand support for training and apprenticeship programs for high school- and college-aged students to enter the workforce.
A large focus in general for the House Republicans — in Hanshaw’s first pillar and beyond — will be a “doubling down” of support for the state’s aviation industry, including in expanding manufacturing and training efforts while also examining opportunities at the state’s numerous regional airports. He said Republicans will introduce a bill to create a “technician, maintenance, repair and operation program” for aviation.
“We know that in so many of our communities across West Virginia, the aviation industry represents one of the fastest growing segments of our economy, particularly of our manufacturing economy,” Hanshaw said. “That’s important to us. We’ve doubled down on it already … It’s a priority for this caucus. We want it to be a priority for this Legislature. We want it to be a priority for this government, and that’s one way in which we’ll do it.”

The second pillar of the House Republican’s strategy will see potential tax cuts for businesses and further cutting of regulations and “red tape” that Hanshaw said has hindered business growth in the state.
Other initiatives in the second pillar include updating statutes relating to advanced manufacturing in the state, incentivizing businesses to offer certain benefit packages for employees and working with electric utilities to find “opportunities West Virginia is perhaps missing” that could stabilize power costs for consumers.
The first bill introduced by the House this session, Hanshaw said, will be the TEAM-WV Act, an acronym meaning Technology, Energy, Aviation and Manufacturing. The act, Hanshaw said, is modeled under the same guiding principles of the nearby JobsOhio. In West Virginia, the potential bill would propose creating a “competitive, statewide” nonprofit to help form a more “cohesive” approach for developing sites for industry and growing partnerships between sectors.
Regarding “responsible economic growth,” Hanshaw said House Republicans want to see the state invest in “lasting infrastructure” that meets the needs of people currently living in the state as well as those who could move here in the future.
The speaker said one of the most pressing issues will be confronting the state’s ongoing housing crisis, where there has been little development of affordable housing while, overall, wages have remained stagnant. Hanshaw said the focus will be on making the construction of housing more affordable for developers, but did not address how those cost savings would be passed on to residents.
Overall, priorities shared by Hanshaw on Tuesday were largely vague. He said more details will become available as legislation is put together and, in January, filed as proposed bills.
Del. Kayla Young, D-Kanawha, sat in the House Chamber as Hanshaw — surrounded by dozens of members of the House Republican Caucus — announced their plans for session.
She said that while details were few, she was “excited” to see the body’s Republican members approach issues she said the Democrats in the House have been trying to address for years. Momentum for those initiatives, though, has been inconsistent in the body where Republicans hold a supermajority.
“We’ve just never seen those bills move for one reason or another,” Young said. “I’m personally excited to see the [Republican] majority focus on something other than social issues for the first time in a very long time.”

A new audit explores possible reasons why more Louisiana residents don't take part in the program. (Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)A federal program that provides food aid to low-income pregnant women, infants and children sees lower participation rates in Louisiana, where the number of food retailers that accept the benefits has fallen by nearly half over the past dozen years.
A Louisiana Legislative Auditor’s review of the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, known better as WIC, attributes the drop in program vendors, in part, to state efforts to ensure grocery stores don’t overcharge for eligible items such as infant formula, baby cereal, milk, rice and fresh fruit. 
Because WIC-approved items account for a small portion of purchases, many retailers choose not to accept the benefits, even though they’re paid for with electronic benefit cards similar to those used for the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance program.  
Grocery chain mergers and store closures have also cut into the number of locations that participate in the WIC program, the audit found. In 2012, there were 723 WIC vendors in Louisiana. As of September, the number had fallen to 406, and it could decrease by about 20 more stores once Winn-Dixie completes its exit from the market. Aldi, which purchased Winn-Dixie’s parent company in 2023, will open in some of the former locations, but Aldi does not participate in the WIC program.

Another factor contributing to lower WIC participation rates in Louisiana is an increase in mothers who breastfeed their infants. The audit notes the National WIC Association, a nonprofit advocacy group for the program, promotes breastfeeding as cost efficient because it can lower health risks for infants. 
WIC also offers breastfeeding support and resources such as breast pumps and in-person consultations with lactation experts. 
Formula still remains the favored form of feeding in Louisiana for WIC recipients, but the program’s rate of formula-fed infants has decreased from 84.5% in 2021 to 74.8% this year.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which funds the WIC program, reports the rate for fully or partially breastfeeding has increased 62.6% since 2021.
There were 104,064 WIC participants in Louisiana as of Sept. 1, with 25% pregnant, breastfeeding or postpartum women and 75% children under age 5. 
According to federal data, Louisiana had the lowest state participation rate for WIC participation in 2022, the most recent year for which analysis is available. Only 36.7% of eligible state residents took part in the program. Other public assistance available during the COVID-19 pandemic and a nationwide formula recall three years ago might have reduced participation, the audit said.
Louisiana was one of 45 states that did not draw down all of the WIC money the federal government allotted for the state in fiscal year 2024. Its unused WIC balance was $10.6 million, which was 8.8% of the amount provided. That’s on par with other states that didn’t tap into all of their USDA funding.
The Louisiana Department of Health, which administers the WIC program, has tracked improving participation since 2022, according to the audit. As of September, the rate increased 16.7%, but USDA coverage data isn’t available yet to reflect those gains.       
Research into why participation rates are low in some states has pointed to issues with transportation, lack of promotion and language barriers for immigrant communities. 
The audit also noted Louisiana has 100 WIC clinics, either parish-owned or contractor-operated, that recipients must visit approximately every three months to remain eligible for benefits. Forty-two of 64 parishes have only one WIC clinic, while Plaquemines and West Feliciana parishes have none.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-1253306537-1024x683-1.jpg,,,2025-12-09 17:57:02.956920

Uncertainty persists. (Stock photo byPaul Bradbury/Getty Images),"The Trump administration issued — and then rescinded — a funding notice advocates warn will spike homelessness. Uncertainty persists.Federal housing officials backpedaled Monday on a recent policy change that advocates warned would drive more than 170,000 people into homelessness.
U.S. Housing and Urban Development officials sent advocates into a panic last month after announcing they would overhaul how federal funding gets distributed under the agency’s Continuum of Care program, a key federal program that historically has supported permanent housing for people at imminent risk of homelessness.
The change, which would have shifted funding to transitional housing and conditioned aid on work and other requirements, prompted several lawsuits, including one filed by New Jersey and 19 other states.
Just an hour before a court hearing Monday in Rhode Island on the lawsuits, HUD officials rescinded the funding notice that sparked the uproar, citing a need for unspecified revisions.
Taiisa Kelly, CEO of Cranford-based Monarch Housing Associates, welcomed the reversal, saying it will give local housing advocates time to plan and develop both short- and long-term solutions to HUD cuts that they still expect despite Monday’s turnaround.
“As we wait to see what comes of the litigation against HUD, we continue to push for bridge funding for programs set to expire starting January 1 to ensure no person loses their housing,” Kelly said. “HUD continues to indicate that they will move forward with their proposed policy changes even with the pull back of this (funding notice) so we continue efforts to find long-term funding for programs that are at risk.”
New Jersey gets $66 million a year from the Continuum of Care program, 81% of which pays for permanent housing, according to the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs. The state would lose at least half of that under the notice HUD withdrew Monday. Such a loss could drive 2,439 New Jersey residents into homelessness, the National Alliance to End Homelessness warned.
New Jersey officials, though, had predicted worse harm, saying the change put more than 3,000 people at risk of immediate homelessness and would cost the state $173 million over two years in lost program funds and related repercussions. That would mark a 22% jump in homelessness from the almost 14,000 people counted as homeless during last January’s HUD-mandated annual enumeration of homelessness.
Despite applauding HUD’s backtracking, local advocates say they still don’t know exactly what changes HUD will settle on, and that uncertainty creates more stress for struggling families.
“Already this process has thrown people — who were formerly homeless and are now terrified of losing their housing after finally getting stabilized, as well as homeless service providers who are trying to figure out how to respond — all into chaos,” said Raisa Rubin-Stankiewicz, a policy associate with the New Jersey Coalition to End Homelessness.
The HUD hubbub came after President Donald Trump announced in a July executive order that his administration would take a different approach to reducing homelessness. He rejected housing-first policies, which get a person into permanent housing before addressing their addiction, unemployment, or other troubles.
HUD had promoted that approach for over a decade, but Trump administration officials complained it encourages “dependence on endless government handouts” while not addressing the root causes of homelessness.
Trump has threatened to withhold funding from applicants who persist with housing-first policies. He also ordered mandatory treatment for people whose mental illness or addiction contributed to their homelessness and directed law enforcement to crack down on homeless encampments, loitering, squatting, and open drug use.
It’s unclear when HUD will issue a revised funding notice; the rescinded notice had set a Jan. 14 deadline for funding applications. HUD officials haven’t released a new timeline or explained what further revisions they have in mind.
That leaves providers with a rapidly closing window in which to apply for funding, and that could create a gap in services, Rubin-Stankiewicz said. Officials should postpone funding changes a year, rather than risk a funding gap, further confusion and chaos, and a spike in homelessness, she added.
“You can’t play with people’s lives like this,” Rubin-Stankiewicz said.

Property taxes in the state are assessed at the local and county level; the state does not determine their rate. But lawmakers, including leading Republicans, have repeatedly expressed a desire to address rates that they argue are prohibitive to home buying and ownership.
Rep. Erin Paré (R-Wake), a co-chair of the committee, said in a news release that they would “work to deliver responsible reforms that balance homeowner affordability with a local government’s ability to meet community needs.”
Those reforms could include, according to the new committee’s charge, a potential amendment to the state constitution to let local governments stray from the “uniformity” requirement that assesses all properties at the same rate.
Also included in the committee’s studies: adjusting the frequency of re-evaluations, reviewing local governments’ spending and finding ways to bridge gaps to keep those local governments funded if rates go down.
Home values in North Carolina have increased significantly over the last decade, according to Federal Reserve data, driving higher tax rates. 
The state has multiple programs aimed at property tax relief: one providing a break for homeowners who are over 65, disabled or disabled veterans, and a “circuit breaker” that defers part of a person’s tax bill if it exceeds 5 percent of their income.
House lawmakers earlier this year approved a bill that would have commissioned a study committee on property tax reform. And several other measures proposed expanding existing relief programs.
Still, some lawmakers have urged caution on the issue as they keep a close eye on local government revenue. Rep. Deb Butler (D-New Hanover), during debate this year on a bill to expand the relief for disabled veterans, remarked that “obviously we want to support our veterans” but “we have some unmet needs in this state.”
Any new bills or substantive debate on the issue is almost certain to wait until next year’s “short session.” The state remains without a new budget as leaders in the House and Senate continue to disagree on another tax issue — whether or not to adjust planned gradual income tax cuts.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_1695-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-09 16:58:31.796635

(Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)Sen. Jeanne Shaheen and the New Hampshire congressional delegation announced Tuesday that 17 grantees received over $9 million in federal funding for child care, health care, infrastructure development, and outdoor recreation. 
The funding is from the Northern Border Regional Commission, a federal-state partnership aimed at economic and community development within New Hampshire, Maine, New York, and Vermont’s “most distressed counties,” according to their website. New Hampshire’s Belknap, Carroll, Cheshire, Coös, Grafton, Merrimack, and Sullivan counties are a part of the commission. 
“The Northern Border Regional Commission is an essential partner helping to ensure that rural communities across the Granite State get their fair share of federal resources,” Shaheen said. “The awards announced today will improve rural health care facilities, bolster and grow the northern outdoor economy, strengthen access to child care and much more.”
Over $2 million was awarded to three projects to create and improve child care facilities in Cheshire and Sullivan counties. 
In Claremont, The Well Collaborative NH was awarded over $820,000 to repurpose a historic church into a community hub offering child care. The proposed community center will also have a commercial kitchen and public meeting space. 
In Keene, Rise For Baby and Family, a child care center, was awarded over $288,000 to expand a project that provides credential support, advising, and mentoring to “address staffing shortages and improve child care access.” Keene Day Care Center received $892,847 to create 20 new child care slots and “preserve” 70 existing ones. They will also use funds for HVAC upgrades, window replacements, and sprinkler installation. 
The commission allocated money from its three programs for economic growth, forest-based economic evolution, and “Timber for Transit.” Fourteen other guarantees were awarded funding to improve health care and transportation infrastructure, as well as bolster outdoor recreation and tourism throughout the state.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0327-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-09 16:58:31.796635

Dec. 9, 2025. Screenshot. Leaders from the Michigan Municipal Electric Association, which represents all 40 of the state’s municipally owned electric utilities, testified to the House Energy Committee on Tuesday about the benefits of municipal energy. 
Katie Abraham, the association’s executive director, testified that in 2023, Michigan’s public power customers, “saw an annual savings of over $400 million in one year.”
Dave Koster, the general manager at Holland Board of Public Works — one of the utilities that is a part of the Michigan Municipal Electric Association — also emphasized that, because the board is not for profit, “every dollar that you spend on your service goes back into the service that we’re providing.”
“Our mission in Holland is to provide competitive, reliable and innovative public utility solutions to the greater Holland area in a sustainable manner,” he added.
Koster also explained how Holland decided to move away from coal towards a natural gas combined cycle plant as well as increased renewable energy over time, a decision making process that he said “really brought our community together in a very positive way.”
The Michigan Municipal Electric Association’s largest utility is Lansing’s Board of Water and Light, which serves around 100 thousand customers, while their smallest is in Daggett, which serves under 200 customers.

Abraham noted that public power covers around 10% of the state’s electric load. These publicly-owned utilities, in contrast to private utility companies like DTE Energy and Consumers Energy, provide municipalities with greater control over decisions on their utilities, including shifting to renewable energy sources. Advocates for municipalization also note that, because these entities are not for profit, costs are often lower without private-sector investors.  
“We call ourselves public power because that really captures the heart of who we are,” Abraham added, noting that the utilities are largely governed by local regulations. “We are owned and operated by the people in our communities, by our customers. We are nonprofit entities. Our customers pay the true cost of their service that they receive.”
Abraham also explained how the Michigan Municipal Electric Association provides mutual aid across utilities — providing assistance in the case of ice storms in northern Michigan and tornadoes in southern Michigan, for example. 
The committee’s start was delayed by nearly an hour as much of the state faced inclement weather on Tuesday morning, with Chair Pauline Wendzel noting that her roads in western Michigan were mostly black ice. As such, the testimony from the Michigan Municipal Electric Association was shortened. 
The committee also passed two bills related to utilities, referring them both to the House Committee on Rules. The first, House Bill 4631, would allow utility companies to trim trees and maintain vegetation around utility wires. The bill, put forward by Rep. Phil Green (R-Millington), passed with 14 votes in favor and two passing on their vote, both Democrats. 
The second bill, House Bill 4486, would prevent municipalities from adopting or enforcing any rules that ban the use of natural gas or propane or block the installation of natural gas or propane infrastructure. That bill, authored by Rep. Steve Frisbie (R-Pennfield Township), passed on slightly closer margins, with 10 yeas, four nays, and two passing, all of the nays and passes coming from Democrats.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-09-at-10.01.44 AM-1024x640.png,,,2025-12-09 16:58:31.796635

This story by Patrick Bilow was first published in the Stowe Reporter on Dec. 4, 2025.
Stowe Emergency Medical Services is raising its rates to keep up with the ever-increasing cost of aiding people in the area.
According to Assistant EMS Chief Scott Brinkman, the gap between billed revenue and the cost of providing services has widened over the years. Operational costs, including medical supplies, equipment maintenance, fuel and recently implemented personnel wages are outpacing revenue, he added.
The department is also missing out on some reimbursements for service, either through inconsistencies with billing out-of-state patients or non-payment after service, the cost of which the town of Stowe absorbs as bad debt rather than sending patients to collections.
“We haven’t sent an ambulance bill to collections since we started billing in the late 80s,” Brinkman said. At the time, the sentiment behind that decision was to not bill Stowe residents who either don’t have insurance or can’t afford a service, and who already support Stowe EMS through taxes, Brinkman said.
In addition to billing, the department relies on taxes and a nonprofit for revenue.
To narrow that gap between operational expenses and revenue, Stowe EMS is raising its rates by more than 100% in some cases. The bill for a critical care transplant, the department’s most-costly service, will more than double from $1,250 to $3,210.
ALS 1 and 2 Emergency responses will increase from $1,000 to $1,8000 and $1,400 to $2,716, respectively, and BLS Emergency services from $750 to $1,500. Higher rates will allow the department to recoup costs from a convoluted healthcare system with different policies and reimbursement rates.
Prior to the rate change, Stowe EMS offered a basic level of service that cost $1,000, but depending on a patient’s insurance policy, the reimbursement for that service ranged from full to partial. As rates increased and became more nuanced in surrounding towns, Stowe EMS realized it was leaving money on the table for policies that reimburse in full.
“So, by raising our rates overall, there are going to be times where we make the entire rate,” Brinkman said, “and that’s going to help us with all of the write offs we have to do, or the contractual allowances we have to accept for billing Medicare and Medicaid.”
Brinkman likened the rate change to a familiar convenience store exchange.
“If you went to Maplefields in town for a coffee, and you were on some kind of a program that the state covered that cup of coffee for you, and Maplefields was only making 40 cents on that cup of coffee, then they might raise the rates for a person walking in the door that doesn’t have that assistance, so they can make up the difference,” Brinkman said.
As rates increase the department is also trying to recoup reimbursements from out-of-state patients, which Brinkman said accounts for roughly half of EMS calls nowadays, a trend that has shifted over the years.
According to Brinkman, the department noticed that reimbursement checks are sent to homes for out-of-state patients, rather than the department for in-state patients. Oftentimes those checks don’t make it to Stowe.
“We aren’t trying to put ourselves in a place that is, three times the price of an ambulance run in another neighboring town or anything like that,” Brinkman said. “We’re just trying to stay competitive.”

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)A week after being sued by the federal government to turn over Rhode Island’s complete voter rolls, Secretary of State Gregg Amore is now receiving legal help from two of the state’s good government organizations.
The American Civil Liberties Union of Rhode Island and the state’s Common Cause chapter jointly filed a motion Tuesday to intervene in the lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Justice in Rhode Island federal court on Dec. 2, citing a need to halt a “potential misuse of voters’ sensitive data.”
DOJ hits Rhode Island with lawsuit over voter list data

“Privacy is essential — especially as related to a right as fundamental as voting,” Steven Brown, executive director of the ACLU of Rhode Island, said in a statement. “The Department of Justice has no need for voters’ personal information.”
Since May, the DOJ has reached out to at least 40 states seeking voter lists, including personal information typically protected under state and federal laws, like Social Security and driver’s license numbers.
Amore was formally asked by the DOJ to turn over Rhode Island’s full list on Sept. 8, but he refused to comply. Instead, Amore offered to provide a free copy of the statewide voter list already publicly available — typically provided upon request with a $25 fee.
The Trump administration argues the government is entitled to personal voter data under the 1960 Civil Rights Act, the 2002 Help America Vote Act and the National Voter Registration Act of 1993.
In suing Amore, the DOJ states it aims to “ascertain Rhode Island’s compliance with list maintenance requirements,” according to the 10-page complaint.
But the ACLU and Common Cause argue in their filing that the federal government does not have a proper purpose under the law for requesting the personal data of Rhode Island’s electorate.
“This dangerous directive puts our sensitive information at risk simply so the Trump Administration can spread election lies,” John Marion, executive director for Common Cause Rhode Island, said in a statement.
The groups’ motion to intervene also includes voters who have agreed to testify over their concerns over how the Trump administration may use their data, including a recently naturalized resident originally from Brazil.
“I believe that recently-naturalized citizens like me may be more vulnerable than other groups of voters to false allegations about illegal voting,” Julia Sanches of Providence wrote in her declaration. “We should make the electoral process more welcoming to every eligible voter and make sure that voters are not intimidated from exercising their rights.”
Amore’s office referred comment on the ACLU and Common Cause’s joint motion to the Rhode Island Office of Attorney General.
The case is assigned to Judge Mary S. McElroy, a first-term Trump appointee. No hearings have been scheduled as of Tuesday afternoon.

“It’s going to keep a lot of people like myself and other producers farming one more year,” Sherlock said Tuesday, a day after the aid announcement. “We still have to continue to work with China to restore that market.”

Sherlock farms near Dazey in east-central North Dakota and is president of the North Dakota Soybean Growers Association. Soybeans have been hit particularly hard by the trade war with China, which has turned to South America for soybeans instead of buying from the United States. 
North Dakota is more dependent on China than other soybean-producing states, with most soybeans and soybean meal being shipped through the Pacific Northwest to Asia. 
While some other Asian countries buy U.S. soybeans, China remains the key market. 
China has resumed buying U.S. soybeans after an agreement was announced in November, but at levels below previous years. 
“China is doing everything in its power not to buy from us,” North Dakota Farmers Union President Mark Watne said Tuesday. 
Watne said farmers are in a “crisis situation” because of tariffs with China and other countries, making the federal payments necessary. He said his fear is that the $12 billion in assistance won’t be enough. 
“If we remain in a situation where we’re not competitive in the global market with agricultural products, we’ll probably be looking for more,” he said. 
Trump to send $12 billion in one-time payments to farmers to offset ag losses

North Dakota Farm Bureau President Val Wagner said in a statement that the group “supports free-market policies that give farmers and ranchers the freedom to conduct business and participate fully in free enterprise. When markets are free and functioning well, the need for government programs naturally decreases.”
Sherlock also said trade wars that have hurt prices are not the only problem affecting the farm economy. 
“Farmers experienced inflation, just like most of the rest of the country did the last few years,” Sherlock said. “So our input costs went up and our revenues went down, and that just has not allowed farmers to be in a place to even break even for a few years now.”
Input costs include expenses for things like seed and fertilizer. He said in previous cycles of low commodity prices, input costs have typically gone down. 
“The trade issues kind of multiplied that effect, especially here in North Dakota,” Sherlock said. 
After President Donald Trump’s announcement, Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., touted improvements to crop insurance and other farm support programs in what Republicans call the One Big Beautiful Bill.

Sherlock said the changes should help make more crop insurance options affordable and reference prices — prices that trigger federal assistance to kick in — have been updated. But he said any payments from those programs wouldn’t come until 2027. 
Payments from the $12 billion assistance program announced Monday are expected in February. 
Meanwhile the Bank of North Dakota, the nation’s only state-owned bank, has developed two loan programs for the state’s farmers. 
“I think that the assistance program will help just as I think the North Dakota programs will help,” Sherlock said. “None of them are going to make farmers whole.”

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Leaders on a public retirement system oversight panel said Tuesday that lawmakers were largely not motivated to make any major changes to Iowa Public Employees’ Retirement System, or IPERS, in the coming 2026 legislative session, but said studies on the system and potential changes may be requested.
The Tuesday meeting of the Public Retirement Systems Committee comes following months of concerns about changes to IPERS. The concerns were largely spurred by suggestions discussed by the Iowa DOGE task force, the group of private industry leaders convened in February with the goal of finding ways to make Iowa state and local government more efficient. The task force was modeled on the federal Department of Government Efficiency led by Elon Musk.
One of the proposals included in the task force’s final report, submitted to Gov. Kim Reynolds and legislators, was a recommendation that state leaders conduct a study on public employee benefits. The report also said, “where feasible, offer employees a choice among benefit plans.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
This suggestion is a scaled-back recommendation from an earlier DOGE task force suggestion to move the IPERS system from a defined benefits program to a defined contribution program, in which both employees and employers would contribute to retirement benefit plans. This proposal was met with significant backlash from labor organizations and advocates who said the plan would endanger the system and retirement benefits for current IPERS members.
As the meeting began, Sen. Tim Kraayenbrink, R-Fort Dodge, who co-chairs the committee, emphasized DOGE’s suggested changes to IPERS are not concrete. He referred to the task force report suggestions as ideas from nonelected officials, and said there is not “any written legislation waiting to be passed.”
However, Kraayenbrink said lawmakers are willing to consider proposed changes to IPERS and move forward proposals if they would potentially improve the system.
“There are some positive things out there that I think myself as an IPERS contributor and many others in the room here today … want to maybe take a look at some of those things — that are not currently what’s happening, but things that could possibly be part of IPERS,” Kraayenbrink said.
Speaking with reporters, Kraayenbrink said there is not an “appetite” to make large changes to IPERS among Republican lawmakers immediately. However, he said if employees on the retirement system advocate for a change, lawmakers would consider it. He pointed, for example, to the cost of living adjustments recently added to the calculations of Sheriffs and Deputy Sheriffs retirement benefits.
He said a study on some of the proposed changes, such as the viability of a move to a defined contribution program for future employees, may be conducted, and said he would support getting more information on the impact of these proposals.
“Why wouldn’t you want a study done that would either verify that, ‘yeah, we need to stay where we’re at, and it’s too costly … it’s not worth it.’ If it comes back and says, ‘by gosh, this would be great,’ and everybody agrees it’s great, then why wouldn’t you want to know that?” Kraayenbrink said. “I don’t think there’s any harm in knowing something, being educated on something.”
Kraayenbrink said “having a study doesn’t mean that we’re going to go down the hole and change things drastically.”
“I think everybody’s just so close-minded at certain times — that they don’t want to look at anything else — because they think everything’s going to just be destroyed,” he said. “And that’s not the intent. The intent is just to know what it is, so that we can make Iowa more competitive.”
The DOGE report suggests IPERS would not change for existing public employees, but that if financially viable, future workers could choose to move to a defined contribution plan instead of a pension. However, organizers said this proposal would still compromise IPERS’ solvency in the future.
Tammy Gertsen, an organizer with the nonprofit group Indivisible Iowa, said the money coming into IPERS through current and new employees is needed to support those who are retired and ensure the system continues to work in the future. IPERS needs “the money coming in at the top to flow all the way through, for those that are going to earn it,” she said.
Gertsen also said she was skeptical of lawmakers who said they do not plan to make changes to IPERS under the DOGE task force recommendations.
“That plan could change in a heartbeat,” Gertsen said. ” … What they say today may not be what’s in the plan, because once it reaches Reynolds’ desk, they may have another discussion. She may want it a different way, so to say what they are laying out is in concrete — I don’t trust that. Whereas IPERS can’t change what they’ve done, that’s set, even the Legislature have set how they can do things.”
Some officials with IPERS also spoke about their support for keeping the system as-is during the meeting. Matt Carver, chair of the IPERS Benefits Advisory Committee, said his committee voted unanimously to approve a resolution during their Oct. 28 meeting encouraging IPERS to remain under its current legal framework.
“I’m not here to shoot arrows at the DOGE commission,” Carver said. “I think they were just trying to do their best to come up with different ideas, say ‘well, where can we save some money,’ that happened to be one of them. But that is very concerning, as you can imagine.”
He thanked the lawmakers who had responded to the DOGE task force’s suggestions saying the Legislature was likely uninterested in moving forward on IPERS changes, saying their public statements “helped settle things down somewhat.”
Gregory Samorajski, chief executive officer of the Iowa Public Employees’ Retirement System, and other officials with public employee benefits systems for Iowa, all said the funds did better than projected in 2025 and were in good condition heading into the upcoming year. Rep. Adam Zabner, D-Iowa City, who serves the committee said the Tuesday meeting “made it clear that IPERS is one of the strongest retirement systems in the country.”
“The proposed changes from the Governor’s D.O.G.E. committee are dangerous, unnecessary, and would put the retirement of hundreds of thousands of Iowans at risk,” Zabner said in a statement. “I urge my Republican colleagues to join me and commit to keeping IPERS strong and untouched. I will always fight to protect the earned retirement security of Iowans.”

And it is unacceptable.” (Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein is expected to restore Medicaid rates at a news conference Dec. 10.
A cut of 3% to 10% in the state’s payments to Medicaid providers took effect in October for many programs. The state Department of Health and Human Services said the cuts were necessary because state lawmakers had underfunded the Medicaid program by around $319 million in its stopgap spending package this summer. 
NC DHHS Secretary Devdutta Sangvai said the state’s Medicaid program is required to have a balanced budget. He said the cuts were intended to ensure the program didn’t run out of money sometime in spring 2026. 
Stein’s office announced a press conference with Sangvai at 9:30 a.m. Wednseday that will include “an update on the status of Medicaid funding.” A spokesperson for DHHS said Sangvai would be in attendance and would speak at the meeting. Stein’s office did not respond to a request for comment.
It is within Stein’s power to order DHHS to restore the rates.
Republican legislative leaders said the cuts were unnecessary because they plan to appropriate more money to fill the gap. 
However, there’s no clear timeline for providing the extra funding: GOP House and Senate leaders have been in a monthslong standoff on the issue. Both chambers have passed separate bills to fund the program, acknowledging it as a need, but have declined to pass each other’s proposals.
Stein previously asked the Republican-led legislature to return to Raleigh and approve legislation to fully fund Medicaid. They rejected his call in November, calling it unconstitutional and politically motivated.
Rural health practices and clinics, whose patients rely on the program, have said they are already struggling in the face of reduced payments.
The state’s rate cuts have already been challenged in court. An administrative judge blocked an 8% cut for personal care services in adult care homes last month, and ordered the state to pay the full rate. And a separate judge blocked cuts to autism treatment, NC Newsline previously reported.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4353-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-09 16:58:31.796635
,Source New Mexico,2025-12-09 21:28:56+00:00,Source New Mexico,New Mexico legislators debate standard statewide property tax for short-term rentals,Patrick Lohmann,,,,,https://sourcenm.com/2025/12/09/new-mexico-legislators-debate-standard-statewide-property-tax-for-short-term-rentals/,Report authors detailed the results of their months-long study or the first time Monday during a presentation to an interim legislative committee.,"A short-term rental in downtown Albuquerque owned by Irvie Homes pictured Dec. 9, 2025. A new report on New Mexico’s short-term rental market found that of the nearly 14,000 STRs statewide, 85% are seasonal or partially owner-occupied and that the state Legislature should ensure they have residential versus commercial classifications for property tax purposes. (Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)County tax assessors classify New Mexico’s roughly 14,000 short-term rental properties differently across the state, according to a legislative study released this week. The “assessment confusion is harming homeowners,” the report says, and should be made uniform.
The report comes via House Memorial 52 — sponsored by two Republican lawmakers during the regular legislative session earlier this year — which convened a group of realtors, state agency officials and others to study the economic impacts of short-term rental properties, as well as how local agencies tax and regulate them. 
Short-term rental apps like AirBnB and Vrbo, which allow residential property owners to list homes or rooms for rent for short periods, produced more than $1 billion in economic impact in New Mexico in 2023, the report says. But critics contend using housing in this way translates into fewer long-term or permanent housing options amid a statewide housing shortage. 
Authors detailed the results of the 19-page report for the first time Monday during a presentation to the interim legislative Economic and Rural Development and Policy Committee.
One top concern that emerged is divergence in how the state’s 33 county assessors classify the properties. Lawmakers are now considering whether they should intervene to create a state law standardizing the classification of short-term rentals and, if so, whether short-term rental properties should be classified as businesses or residences. 
NM homelessness coalition will ask Legislature to fill in federal funding gaps

The report found that just 15% of roughly 14,000 short-term rental properties are available to rent for short stays year-round. The rest are seasonal or “owner-used,” meaning that owners live in them part of the year or rent out a room or two rather than the full dwelling, according to the report. As such, they don’t constitute full-time businesses.
That finding was one reason Carl Vidal, founder and CEO of Irvie Homes, said assessors statewide should be required to classify short-term rentals as residential versus commercial properties. Irvie Homes owns dozens of short-term rental properties in Albuquerque, Santa Fe, Placitas and Corrales, as well as Austin, Texas, according to its website. 
Vidal said more than 1,000 short-term rental owners this year had their properties re-classified as “non-residential,” unfairly subjecting them to tax hikes and other fees.
“A few assessors across the state took completely different positions depending on the county,” Vidal told lawmakers. “This lack of uniformity happened because the legislation and the Legislature never provided direction.”
While assessors participated in the working group, they said in the completed report and at the meeting Monday that the report was biased toward short-term rental owners and that they did not agree with its recommendations. The group was “not well represented since the beginning,” assessors wrote in the report, adding that they “still don’t believe we have a well-balanced consensus of the community on this subject.”
Santa Fe County Assessor Isaiah Romero told the committee that the working group should have had “members of our community on both sides,” including city managers, treasurers and others who are regulating short-term rentals in their towns or cities. Still, he said, assessors would follow the law if the Legislature steps in to create a mandated statewide standard.
Housing summit speaker: NM home shortage could be as high as 90,000 units

State Sen. Antonio “Moe” Maestas and Rep. Marian Matthews, both Albuquerque Democrats, agreed during the meeting that the Legislature should consider such a bill, but disagreed on what it should say.
Maestas, who said he owns rental properties, said restrictive zoning, not short-term rentals, is the biggest driver of the housing shortage, and he said short-term rental properties don’t require more public services and therefore should not be subject to higher taxes. 
“If someone’s able to maintain their old home and buy a new home and turn it into an AirBnB, more power to them,” he said. “They shouldn’t be blamed for the lack of housing.”
Matthews, however, said short-term rentals change the character of neighborhoods and that she’s heard many in the Northeast Heights area in her district complain about the lack of affordable housing as more and more owners convert their properties into short-term rentals. 
“We’ve taken residential property that has been historically residential property, we’re renting it to people for short-term vacations and so forth,” Matthews said.“And the question is, ‘Should that be taxed the same as my home, which I live in all the time… as opposed to taxed as a business property?’ To me, it seems like a business, and it is going to take more resources.”
The discussion ended Monday without any particular lawmaker volunteering to introduce legislation, though Matthews urged colleagues to consider it ahead of the 2026 legislative session that begins Jan. 20.
“I would like us to think about whether or not we should pick a dog in this fight,” she said. 
“Because it does have an impact.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_3521-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-09 16:58:31.796635

To his right are NU President Jeffrey Gold, UNK Student Regent Sam Schroeder and Regent Paul Kenney of Amherst. April 23, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)KEARNEY — University of Nebraska at Kearney Chancellor Neal Schnoor unveiled a plan Tuesday to cut up to $4.8 million from the campus budget and close a structural deficit.
Schnoor, who started as UNK chancellor July 1, said in a Tuesday email to faculty, staff and students that the proposal would close a $4.5 million structural deficit identified through June 30, 2027. He provided materials indicating he began a complete fiscal review July 1, informed the campus of the deficit July 23 and started the “shared governance” process with faculty Aug. 11.
“I know the weight of these changes is felt differently across our community, and I appreciate the care and resilience you continue to show,” Schnoor said in his email.

Dele Davies (University of Nebraska Medical Center, interim), Joanne Li (University of Nebraska at Omaha) and Neal Schnoor (University of Nebraska at Kearney). Dec. 5, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
The budget reduction proposal states UNK is “committed to collaboration and innovation, to preserving our mission as a comprehensive university, expanding student access and opportunity and meeting the workforce and educational needs of Nebraska and beyond.”
Schnoor repeated a message from University of Nebraska President Jeffrey Gold that NU is operating at a budget gap of about $250 million each year as state funds fall behind inflation. The NU Board of Regents has also kept tuition increases behind inflation by about $59 million.
Over the same span, Schnoor’s report states, UNK has also lost about 16% enrollment. 
About 80% of UNK’s budget supports personnel. Schnoor said state funding didn’t cover the 7% faculty salary increases approved in the current biennium as part of a union agreement. He added that tuition waivers and general costs are also rising.
Academic and faculty reductions
Schnoor’s proposal seeks to save $2.4 million from the elimination of five degree programs and 21 faculty positions. The degrees are:

Family science, bachelor of science (27 majors).
Higher education student affairs, master of science in education (eight candidates).
Modern languages — German emphasis, bachelor of arts (one major).
Music comprehensive – music business emphasis, bachelor of music (three majors).
Modern languages 7-12 teaching endorsement — German emphasis, bachelor of arts in education (zero majors).

UNK’s Faculty Advisory Committee recommended eliminating all but the family science degree. Any current students in eliminated programs would be “taught out” and still be able to graduate.

The eight-member faculty committee said one of the challenges facing UNK is how to satisfy the demands of current students and of the citizens in the communities UNK serves. The faculty said that while UNK has lost funding, communities still trust UNK, which must be maintained.
“We are lean, but we must not be brittle,” the advisory committee wrote. “All of us must flex and stretch and work collaboratively to find change that works to grow the university.”
Of 21 faculty positions proposed for elimination, five faculty would be let go, in family science, music and history ($617,627). Nine more positions are expected to come open through an early retirement bonus for long-time tenured faculty ($1.09 million), and the remaining seven would come from already open positions ($709,784). Those offered the separation bonus must accept by Jan. 5.
Non-academic reductions
The rest of UNK’s budget proposal seeks $2.4 million in non-academic reductions as follows:

Seven open staff positions and a part-time custodial post ($559,993).
Across-the-board 5% reduction in state-aided budgets ($400,000)
Fewer tuition waivers for Athletics, Kearney Health and Kearney Law Opportunities Programs, though UNK hopes to find replacement funds using private philanthropy ($400,000).
Reduced graduate assistantships by 20 positions ($300,000).
Reduction in summer salary budget ($200,000).
Reduced athletics operations ($200,000).
Eliminate the vice chancellor of enrollment management position and a vacant office associate position ($153,983).
Vacate the Memorial Student Affairs Building and Thomas Hall to avoid costly repairs ($85,047).
Restructuring of the Office of International Engagement and Leadership ($66,630).
Reduce and clarify UNK support for the Museum of Nebraska Art in a new memorandum of understanding, beginning in fiscal year 2027-28 ($35,649).
Changes to institutional marketing and engagement for savings at the College of Business and Technology ($18,737).

Next steps
Schnoor will host a two-hour forum Thursday with two vice chancellors for those wishing to provide feedback on the UNK budget proposal. It begins at 11 a.m. in the Nebraskan Student Union, Antelope Room. Comments can also be submitted to chancellor@unk.edu through Dec. 17.
The UNK proposal will be finalized and released Dec. 22. Only academic degree eliminations would require approval of the NU Board of Regents.
Regents last week approved eliminating four departments at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, which is anticipated to save $6.74 million while cutting 51.5 department positions. About 69 faculty members at UNL could take the voluntary separation buyout.

Mikalla Starr Winkel, 20, of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, is suing the State of Iowa in Polk County District Court.
Winkel’s lawsuit alleges that early in her life, her biological parents struggled with substance abuse and addiction before separating in September 2006. In December 2006, she and her three siblings were allegedly removed from their mother’s care for 11 months, with Winkel’s mother regaining custody in October 2007.
Court records indicate that in February 2008, Winkel and her siblings were again removed from their mother’s care due to ongoing issues involving drug use and addiction. The records show that in April 2008, the Woodbury County Attorney’s Office filed a petition for termination of parental rights, which the court granted in October 2008, thereby transferring custody and guardianship to the state agency then known as the Iowa Department of Human Services.
The lawsuit alleges that before DHS placed Winkel in a foster home it was required by law to conduct a criminal background check on her prospective foster parents and show evidence that in selecting a foster home, it had considered the social and cultural standards of the Santee Sioux Nation, of which Winkel was a member.
In 2009, when Winkel was 4 years old, she and two of her siblings were placed in the foster home of Norman and Cammie Winkel of Sioux City – a couple who had no connection to the Santee Sioux Nation or any other Native American community.
According to the lawsuit, at the time of the foster-home placement Norman Winkel was a former prison inmate who “had an extensive drug-related criminal history with five drug convictions, including a felony for which he received a 25-year prison sentence.”
In 2010, Winkel was legally adopted by the couple. The lawsuit alleges that while Mikalla lived in the home, Norman Winkel “began to exhibit grooming behaviors toward Mikalla,” and then, as she matured, the “grooming escalated to sexual assault, including fondling, mutual touching, and sexual assault in the foster home.” The alleged sexual abuse “continued for multiple years,” according to the lawsuit.
In 2018, at the age of 13, Winkel allegedly reported the abuse to the Mercy Child Advocacy Center in Sioux City, triggering a DHS investigation that allegedly concluded with a determination that the allegations of abuse were founded.
“Upon the sexual abuse finding, Norman Winkel absconded and remains at large,” the lawsuit states. “As a result of the years of abuse, Mikalla suffered severe mental health issues.”
Court records indicate Norman Winkel has never faced criminal charges of sexual abuse or assault. Iowa Capital Dispatch was unable to reach him.
According to the lawsuit, Cammie Winkel’s custodial rights were terminated in 2020 when Mikalla Winkel was 15. In May 2024, the lawsuit alleges, the State of Iowa denied Mikalla’s claim for damages against the state, leading to the lawsuit recently filed on her behalf.
The lawsuit alleges DHS, now known as the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services, is guilty of negligence in that the agency failed to properly conduct a background check on Norman Winkel before placing Mikalla and her siblings in his care and that the agency failed to consider the full extent of his “lengthy criminal history.”
The lawsuit also alleges negligence stemming from DHS’ purported failure to consider whether the Winkels’ home would accommodate the social and cultural needs related to Mikalla’s Native American heritage.
The State of Iowa has yet to file a response to the lawsuit. The Iowa Attorney General’s Office says it does not comment on pending litigation.

(Photo by Megan Henry, Ohio Capital Journal). A bill to ban intoxicating hemp products and make it illegal to bring legally purchased marijuana back to Ohio from another state is now heading to Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine’s desk for his signature after being passed by Ohio Senate Republicans. 
The Ohio Senate voted along party lines 22-7 to pass Ohio Senate Bill 56 Tuesday. The Ohio House passed the bill at the end of a marathon session last month. If DeWine signs the bill into law before the new year, it could take effect as soon as March. 
“(Intoxicating hemp products are) going to be off the shelves immediately upon the effectiveness of this bill,” Ohio Senate Majority Leader Rob McColley, R-Napoleon, said.

Ohio’s bill complies with recent federal changes by banning intoxicating hemp products from being sold outside of a licensed marijuana dispensary. 
“As far as intoxicating hemp goes, when all is said and done, this bill definitely benefits big marijuana businesses,” Ohio Senate Minority Leader Nickie J. Antonio, D-Lakewood, said. “And at the same time, leaves a lot of small business owners in the wake.”
DeWine has been asking lawmakers to do something about intoxicating hemp products for nearly two years. 
The bill also allows five milligram THC beverages to be manufactured, distributed, and sold until Dec. 31, 2026. 
“I’m so worried that the fastest growing industry in the beverage market, being hemp beverages, are going to get hurt,” Ohio state Sen. Bill DeMora, D-Columbus, said. 
On the marijuana side, the bill would reduce the THC levels in adult-use marijuana extracts from a maximum of 90% down to a maximum of 70%, cap THC levels in adult-use flower to 35%, and prohibit smoking in most public places. 
Part of the probable cause portions were removed from the bill, but some of it still remains. 
The bill prohibits possessing marijuana in anything outside of its original packaging and criminalizes bringing legal marijuana from another state back to Ohio. 
“It is a crime, but it’s not something that’s going to be heavily penalized,” McColley said. “It’s really just a reflection of the fact that Michigan has different testing standards.”  
DeMora supports getting intoxicating hemp products off the streets, but has issues with the marijuana regulations. 
“It re-criminalized dozens of different provisions dealing with marijuana,” DeMora said. 
“We can’t forget about the fact that we’re going to have millions of dollars of taxpayer money be wasted on Ohio troopers sitting on the border or every road coming from the state up north to see people who are driving into Ohio with marijuana products.” 
It also requires drivers to store marijuana in the trunk of their car while driving. 
Ohio S.B. 56 would give 36% of adult-use marijuana sale revenue to municipalities and townships that have recreational marijuana dispensaries.
“That money will be available to locals as quickly as tax can get it out as soon as the governor signs,” Ohio state Sen. Steve Huffman, R-Tipp City, said. 
The bill also maintains the 10% tax rate on recreational marijuana and keeps home grow the same at six plants per adult and 12 per residence. It also places a cap on 400 marijuana dispensaries in the state. 
Ohioans passed a citizen-initiated law to legalize recreational marijuana in 2023 with 57% of the vote. Sales started in August 2024 and exceeded $702.5 million in the first year. 
Ohio lawmakers can change the law since it passed as a citizen initiative not a constitutional amendment, something they have been trying to do since late 2023. 
“This bill leaves the crux of Issue Two and marijuana access intact while providing for several important public safety concerns and also regulations that protect Ohio children,” Huffman said.

(Photo by Graham Stokes for Ohio Capital Journal. Republish photo only with original story.)
Ohio Democratic lawmakers argue this bill goes against the will of Ohio voters. 
“What my caucus believes is that at the at the core of this is you have a group of legislators in the majority that are out of touch with everyday Ohioans, even when it comes to legalizing marijuana, and they’ve tried to do everything they can to rescind the vote of the people,” Antonio said.
McColley disagrees.  
“I think that’s a little bit of exaggeration and hyperbole,” he said. 
If signed into law, the bill could be ripe for a legal challenge, Antonio said.
“I’m going to leave that up to the folks who sit at the table and pour over the law books to figure that out, but I would not be surprised,” she said.   
The bill has gone through many revisions. 
Ohio state Sen. Steve Huffman, R-Tipp City, originally introduced the bill and the Senate passed it in February, but the House made major changes, most notably by adding intoxicating hemp regulations.
The Ohio House passed Ohio S.B. 56 in October with a bipartisan vote and the Ohio Senate voted unanimously one week later not to concur with changes made to the bill, sending it to conference committee. 
After the bill was sent to conference committee at the end of October, changes were made to hemp at the federal level.
Congress recently voted to ban products that contain 0.4 milligrams of total THC per container earlier this month when they voted to reopen the government.
Previously, the 2018 Farm Bill said hemp can be grown legally if it contains less than 0.3% THC.
There is a one-year implementation delay for the federal hemp ban, but states can create their own regulatory framework before then.

Frankfort Police Assistant Chief Scott Tracy said in a Tuesday evening press conference the suspect arrested after the shooting was not a student at the university.
“Frankfort Police believe this to be an isolated event and there are no active safety concerns on campus at this time,” Tracy said.
Tracy said both students were transported to a local hospital.
KSU announced Tuesday evening that it was cancelling “all classes, final exams, and campus activities for the remainder of the week” and that counseling resources would be made available to students, faculty and staff. The university’s statement said the incident happened near Whitney M. Young Jr. Hall, a dorm on campus.
During the press conference, KSU President Koffi C. Akakpo called the shooting a “senseless tragedy.”
“As a parent, I cannot imagine receiving the call I placed today to the parents (of the students),” he said.
Earlier Tuesday, the Frankfort Police Department said that its officers responded to “an active aggressor” on KSU’s campus around 3:30 p.m. KSU was on lockdown “until further notice.” 
Shortly after the reports emerged, Gov. Andy Beshear posted on social media that he was aware of “some injuries” and more information would be shared as it became available. 
Thursday evening, the governor said in an online video that the situation was “not a mass shooting or random incident” based on information given to him. 
“Pray for those that have been injured. Please pray for these Kentucky State University students, that again, might rightfully be scared,” Beshear said. “Pray for a world where these things don’t happen. And I’ll keep trying to build the Kentucky that we don’t see arguments ended in violence.”

RUTLAND CITY — On a freezing Monday morning, around six dozen people were forced out of their Sheldon Towers apartments after an isolated stove top fire set off the sprinkler system, causing significant water damage throughout the building.
The Rutland City Fire Department responded to the scene Monday morning around 11 am, and found the sprinkler system extinguished the fire on the sixth floor, said Fire Department Chief William Lovett. The tenant of the unit with the fire had some smoke inhalation, but otherwise no one was harmed by the fire, Lovett said. 
“We had all of our crews come in, and then we also asked the Rutland Town Fire (Department) to come in so that we could help limit the amount of damage done to the building and get the people out of the building safely,” Lovett said. 
Sheldon Towers is a 10-story building with 74 units, owned and managed by Rutland Housing Authority. The building, located near the intersection of Route 7 and Route 4 in Rutland City, primarily serves older adults and people with disabilities.
Housing Authority’s executive director and CEO Kevin Loso said 73 people were displaced on Monday, and the Authority has been working to find residents emergency motel housing if they were not able to stay with family or friends. The Authority also helped residents gain access to medications and shelter for pets. 
“We secured housing for everyone last night that needed it,” Loso said. “We were able to secure the necessary resources to ensure that immediate needs were met.”
While no one was harmed, Loso said a few residents were brought to the Rutland Regional Medical Center due to anxiety from the event or pre-existing medical conditions. 
Loso said he hopes the Authority will get the go-ahead to open up 50 units by the end of the day Tuesday, but at least 18 units have significant electrical damage, and some units may need to be cleared out for remediation.
A local firm called G.W. Savage is conducting the water damage assessment and restoration work, Loso said. 
The water damage primarily impacted the units from the sixth floor down to the second floor, Loso said. But, the Authority cannot reenergize housing units until the electrical damage is fully assessed by the Division of Fire Safety, Building Inspector and the Authority’s electrician, he said.
The Rutland Area community mobilization effort was “extraordinary,” Loso said. 
Along with the local fire departments and Rutland City’s Emergency Management Services’ response, the American Red Cross and the Open Door Mission help provide “food and blankets and everything else that was needed in order to get people through yesterday,” Loso said.

Jerry Laktonen is a fisherman and boatbuilder who began carving in his 40s and has become a leading voice in the revival of Alutiiq carving traditions. His masks and ceremonial paddles are celebrated nationally, and his colorful, powerful works greet visitors at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of the American Indian. His works  have earned first-place awards at the Santa Fe Indian Market, the Heard Museum Fair in Phoenix, and other major Indigenous art shows across the country.
Most recently, he has also won the Distinguished Artist Award as part of the Rasmuson Foundation’s Individual Artist Awards program. The award, which includes a $50,000 grant, honors his lifetime of creative excellence and cultural leadership, the foundation’s highest recognition for an Alaskan artist.

This recognition shines a light on the broader role of Alaska Native artists: sustaining Indigenous identity, mentoring the next generation and contributing significantly to Alaska’s economy. Traditional Native artists are central to cultural revitalization and the strength of Alaska’s Indigenous communities. Laktonen’s carvings include ceremonial Alutiiq paddles and expressive masks.
“Jerry Laktonen brings intention and integrity to every piece he creates,” said Gretchen Guess, president and Chief Executive Officer of Rasmuson Foundation. “He has worked tirelessly to ensure Alaska Native artists are recognized and respected. His commitment to authenticity has left a lasting mark on both his community and the field. Artists like Jerry Laktonen remind us that culture is not only preserved. It is lived, shared, and continually reimagined,” added Guess.
What does it mean to win this award?
A self-taught artist who began carving in his mid 40s, Laktonen turned to art after the Exxon Valdez oil spill disrupted his fishing livelihood to express his creativity in a new way.

“When I first started it out at ground zero, not having a lot of money and having to make something with my hands in order to have some security to just live and to not be stressed out all the time,” Laktonen told ICT. “I had to stick my neck out quite a bit to increase my visibility and give myself more of a chance of having success.”
A move to Washington state from Alaska helped his transition.
“That was when I moved south to Washington state and made it easier for me to be able to go to major shows in the major markets in the United States,” Laktonen said. “That was often done with an awful lot of hope involved because I didn’t have any money to be able to do anything extra except just make something that I thought I could sell and also take care of my other needs.”

But desperation and necessity are often at the forefront of invention.

“That stress actually brought out something in me that I didn’t know I had and that was resourcefulness or maybe talent,” Laktonen said. “I was surprised at what I was able to come up with as far as ideas and ways of expressing what I wanted to express in my culture.”
Laktonen says he felt  blessed to learn about carvings, the innovation of the people that came before, which inspired his own creativity.
In trying to create his own style of the traditional Alutiiq carving art form, he ran into creative roadblocks that were partly mental and partly from the art world.
“There was always the danger of misrepresenting what was known about from the past,“ Laktonen says, “I wanted to bring out the elements of what I was available a long time ago and express it without manipulating it too much. I think almost without any doubt I did go a little bit too far sometimes, but that was a little bit of what I thought was my duty as an expressive artist.”

He says that there was a lot going on between survival and his personal expression creating a balancing act to stay alive.
“Maybe getting the award affirmed to me that I may have been on the right track,” Laktonen says. “I don’t know, but with the way things have been going I’m optimistic.”
After many years of working as an artist, the recent award money will allow him to produce work in a more sustainable way that allows for rest.
“As far as volume of work my hope is that I can decline in volume but increase my expressiveness,” he says “I’m looking forward to what might happen now being creative and not feeling the pressure as much. I hope that I was able to express what I thought were the elements of the Alutiiq culture, at least as I saw it.”
Looking over his body of work Laktonen says he is both impressed but a little bit disappointed he wasn’t able to put more energy into it at times. He says when he looks back at his work he thinks it was “fantastic” and  believes carving and making artwork is a good way for people to understand themselves and learn what’s going on inside of their own head.
“I will continue to make my usual masks and paddles,” Laktonen says “And try and make them exceptional and spend more time on them because I won’t be pressured to try and make money to stay above water.”

Clements’ last day will be Dec. 31. The college’s governing board is expected to appoint Provost Bob Jones as interim president as it searches for a new leader.
“Serving Clemson University has been one of the greatest privileges of my life. I am deeply grateful for the trust and friendship you have shown me and my family over the years,” Clements wrote in a letter that went out to students and employees Tuesday. “After much consideration and prayer, I have come to the conclusion that it is time for me to step aside and allow the University to begin its next chapter.”
Clements’ retirement comes a year after the board approved him for a contract extension through 2031. He is 61 years old.
As president, Clements’ total compensation is $1.5 million.
Before Clemson hired Clements, he spent about five years as president of West Virginia University. Now, with 17 years of university leadership on his resume, Clements said he is ready to spend more time with family.
“There comes a time when health and family must take precedence,” Clements said. “Clemson has been my home and passion, yet my greatest love is for my wife, Beth, and our children and grandchildren. Life moves quickly, and I don’t want to miss what truly matters – the major milestones and the quiet, everyday joys.”
In his letter, Clements touted university accomplishments, including Clemson’s designation as a top-tier research university, setting records for the number of applications submitted by prospective students hoping to gain admittance and football championships.
“President Clements has been more than a leader — he has been a mentor, a friend and an advocate for every member of the Clemson Family,” board chairwoman Kim Wilkerson said in a statement. “While we will certainly miss his guidance and enthusiasm, we also deeply respect and understand his decision to focus on his priorities.”
Wilkerson said the board plans to start the search process immediately and she hopes the board can select the college’s 16th president in time for the fall 2026 semester.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/President-Jim-Clements_028a_AJ-1-scaled-e1765310252375-1024x702.jpg,,,2025-12-09 15:56:55.807754

[…],"Wind turbines generate electricity at the Block Island Wind Farm in 2022 near Block Island, Rhode Island. (Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)A federal judge on Monday agreed with more than a dozen states that early actions from the Trump administration to halt offshore wind development were unlawful. 
On day one of his second term President Donald Trump issued an executive order that froze permitting for offshore wind and asked for a federal review of the process. That order was challenged in court by seventeen states, including Maine, and Washington, D.C. 
The states argued they would be harmed by the pause because of the investments their governments had already made into wind developments and the potential to jeopardize future energy supply. 
Judge Patti B. Saris of the Massachusetts U.S. District Court said the states provided “ample evidence” showing that they would face negative consequences from the executive order.. 
In a statement Tuesday, Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey said he was grateful the court agreed that the Trump administration overstepped with the executive order. 
“Whatever the federal administration’s position is on wind power, it does not have the right to arbitrarily ban development of this sustainable energy resource,” Frey said, adding that he and other attorneys general will continue to work to hold the federal government accountable.
Developing offshore wind as a power source has been at the crux of Maine’s clean energy and climate goals, though that planning has had several fits and starts. 
In 2010, the state worked on a $120 million offshore wind pilot project that never came to fruition. But a decade later, Gov. Janet Mills signed a law that not only pumped new life into the effort, but did so with high labor and environmental standards, which she said would create quality jobs while building the infrastructure to produce three gigawatts of low emission energy — enough to power between 675,000 and 900,000 homes — by the end of 2040.
Last year, the state announced its preference to build a new port on Sears Island to support the budding industry, and the Maine Legislature took efforts to protect those plans. Under the Biden administration, the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, the agency within the U.S. Department of Interior responsible for managing energy resources on the outer shelf, outlined eight lease areas off the coast of Maine, Massachusetts and New Hampshire for wind development. 
But following Trump’s executive order, one of the project’s key developers paused talks in April, citing “recent shifts in the energy landscape.”
Republican legislators have thanked Trump for the executive order freezing permitting and asked him to go a step further to revoke existing leases and permits in the Gulf of Maine.
They argue offshore wind would put Maine’s fishing industry at risk. However, the lease areas avoid the vital fishing area known as Lobster Management Area 1, and Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Golden introduced legislation to codify those protections into federal law.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1407548865-2048x1349-1-1024x675.jpg,,,2025-12-09 15:56:55.807754

(Photo by Anne-Marie Caruso/New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey’s Supreme Court declined to take up a case that challenged a state law barring candidates from running under the banner of more than one party, ending efforts to overturn the more than a century-old ban through the courts.
The Moderate Party had argued that the state’s ban on fusion voting, which allows candidates to appear on a ballot multiple times on different parties’ tickets, ran afoul of rights to free speech, association, assembly, and equal protection guaranteed by the New Jersey Constitution.
Supporters of fusion voting, which is allowed in New York, have argued that the state’s ban on the practice deliberately excludes “new ideas and new parties from the political marketplace.” 
The party sued after Secretary of State Tahesha Way declined to list then-Rep. Tom Malinowski as its nominee for the 2022 general election. Malinowski was then the 7th Congressional District’s Democratic nominee, and state law barred him from also running as the Moderate Party’s nominee.
The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled fusion voting bans are not unconstitutional. An appellate court in February declined to depart from the higher court’s ruling, noting that language in the state’s constitution is similar enough to language in the U.S. Constitution.
The appellate judges said state interests in the administration of elections outweighed the Moderate Party’s constitutional claims. The party, the three-judge panel said, could still endorse and support its chosen candidates, but they could not place a candidate’s name on the ballot for the same office a second time.
The Supreme Court’s choice not to take up the case means that the ruling will stand.

Jeff Landry's administration has partially reversed course and decided to cut one Medicaid plan instead of two in 2026. (Photo by Michelle Liu/Verite News)Gov. Jeff Landry’s administration partially pulled back on its plan to cancel two of the state’s six Medicaid contracts with private companies that provide health insurance to hundreds of thousands of Louisiana residents. 

The Louisiana Department of Health announced Tuesday morning it would end only one of its deals with a managed care organization instead of two as originally planned.  
The state will continue to work with Aetna Better Health of Louisiana, which covers 157,000 Louisiana residents on Medicaid, despite sending notice to the company a week ago saying its contract would end Dec. 31. 
“After discussions between the State of Louisiana and Aetna Better Health of Louisiana, LDH will renew its contract with Aetna as a Medicaid Managed Care Organization (MCO),” state Medicaid Director Seth Gold wrote in a letter sent Tuesday to Aetna CEO Bridget Galatas. 
The Landry administration still plans to terminate its contract with UnitedHealthCare of Louisiana, which insures 330,700 Medicaid enrollees, at the end of month. Those who have a UnitedHealthCare plan will be reassigned to one of the five other companies offering Medicaid coverage in the next two weeks, Health Secretary Bruce Greenstein said. 
The UnitedHealthCare contract would have been $4.2 billion for the 2026 calendar year. The company covers about a quarter of the 1.4 million Medicaid enrollees who are insured through a private company.

“[W}e remain committed to working with the Louisiana Department of Health through this transition,” said UnitedHealthCare spokeswoman Christina Witz in a written statement Tuesday. 
Attorney General Liz Murrill pushed the health department to end its agreement with UnitedHealthCare due to ongoing litigation she has with the company. 

In 2022 as attorney general, Landry sued UnitedHealthCare and its affiliated pharmacy benefits manager, OptumRx, for allegedly overcharging Louisiana’s Medicaid program for prescription drugs. Murrill took over that lawsuit when she succeeded the governor in the attorney general’s office in 2024. 
Murrill and Landry’s legal efforts to extract financial compensation from UnitedHealthCare recently suffered a setback. The Louisiana First Circuit Court of Appeal overturned a lower court ruling on Nov. 21 that had favored the state.

Just days after that court decision was released, the Landry administration halted its plans to move forward with a UnitedHealthCare contract extension for 2026. 
“They are violating the contracts and have refused to provide us with [documents] we have requested,” the attorney general wrote in a text message Monday. “United has engaged in frivolous attacks on the AGs contracting authority as well.”
Murrill said she was unavailable for an interview Tuesday because she is in Rome preparing for a human trafficking conference at the Vatican. 

The contract turnabout came as a surprise to lawmakers who had signed off on the UnitedHealthCare agreement at the urging of the Landry administration on Nov. 20, the day before the court ruling came out. 
During a nearly three-hour legislative hearing, Greenstein and health department undersecretary Drew Maranto, both Landry appointees, answered dozens of questions from lawmakers and never expressed reservations about continuing to work with UnitedHealthCare.
Greenstein even pushed back when legislators suggested during the hearing that the state reduce the number of Medicaid contracts with private companies. 
Lawmakers believe working with fewer businesses could lower the administrative costs in the Medicaid program, but Greenstein cast doubt on whether those benefits would be worth the upheaval in the program. 
“Each of the plans brings a different way of envisioning how to engage patients with certain medical complexities,” Greenstein told legislators. “Patients don’t generally switch their health plan very often.”
His remarks are likely why several lawmakers, reached Monday, said they were blindsided when they discovered the health department had canceled the contract extensions. The governor and the health department didn’t give legislators advance notice before they reversed course with Aetna and UnitedHealthCare.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Medicaid-navigators-1-1024x768.webp,,,2025-12-09 15:56:55.807754
,DC,2025-12-09 19:54:13+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump administration aims to officially scrap Biden-era student loan forgiveness program,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-administration-aims-officially-scrap-biden-era-student-loan-forgiveness-program,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Education announced a proposed agreement Tuesday that would permanently axe an income-driven student loan repayment plan in which more than 7 million student loan borrowers are enrolled. Under a joint proposal with seven Republican-led states that challenged the program, the department would not enroll any new borrowers in the Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan, deny any pending applications and place borrowers currently in the plan into legally compliant repayment plans.The program, introduced in 2023 under then-President Joe Biden’s administration, was hit with legal challenges from several GOP-led states, including Missouri, and has been blocked by the courts. The initiative sought to provide lower monthly loan payments for borrowers and forgive remaining debt after a certain period of time. If a Missouri federal court approves the agreement, the department said borrowers currently enrolled in the SAVE plan “will have a limited time to select a new, legal repayment plan and begin repaying their student loans.”The agreement stems from a legal challenge to the plan brought by Missouri, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, North Dakota, Ohio and Oklahoma in 2024.A ‘deceptive scheme’In a statement alongside the announcement, Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent said President Donald Trump’s administration “is righting this wrong and bringing an end to this deceptive scheme.” “The law is clear: if you take out a loan, you must pay it back,” Kent added. “Thanks to the State of Missouri and other states fighting against this egregious federal overreach, American taxpayers can now rest assured they will no longer be forced to serve as collateral for illegal and irresponsible student loan policies.” Republicans argued the permissive repayment plan let borrowers off the hook at the expense of federal taxpayers.Missouri Attorney General Catherine Hanaway said in a statement Tuesday her office “fought for hardworking Americans who were being preyed upon by Biden Administration bureaucrats, and we won in court every time.” “We appreciate President Trump’s real, long-term solutions instead of illegal student loan schemes,” Hanaway added. Student advocates, though, said the agreement would place an additional burden on student borrowers already struggling with a rising cost of living.Persis Yu, deputy executive director and managing counsel at the advocacy group Protect Borrowers, blasted the settlement agreement as “pure capitulation” in a Tuesday statement. “While millions of student loan borrowers struggle amidst the worsening affordability crisis ... billionaire Education Secretary, Linda McMahon chose to strike a back-room deal with a right-wing state Attorney General and strip borrowers of the most affordable repayment plan that would help millions to stay on track with their loans while keeping a roof over their head,” Yu said. Interest accumulatingIn February, a federal appeals court upheld a lower court injunction that blocked the SAVE plan from going into effect. Borrowers under the plan were placed in an interest-free forbearance last year amid legal limbo. But borrowers’ loans in the SAVE forbearance began to accrue interest Aug. 1 — a move the department announced in July to comply with court orders. The SAVE plan was already set to be phased out by July 2028 under congressional Republicans’ tax and spending cut bill that Trump signed into law this year.",,,,2025-12-09 14:58:27.140625

Lindsey Tichenor, R-Smithfield, asks University of Louisville President Kim Schatzel about the university’s diversity, equity and inclusion program during the a meeting of the Interim Joint Committee on Education, Sept. 17, 2024. (LRC Public Information)An Oldham County Republican will renew her push to end diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in Kentucky’s public schools in the legislative session that begins next month. 
Met with support from her party and opposition from Democrats, Sen. Lindsey Tichenor, R-Smithfield, presented a draft of a bill to end DEI in K-12 schools to the Interim Joint Committee on Education Tuesday. She called it “a measure to eliminate the wasteful, ineffective and divisive DEI initiatives that have become interwoven in K-12 institutions.

Tichenor was critical of investments by school districts and the Biden administration for financially supporting DEI programs in public schools and argued they did not close achievement gaps among students who are in minority groups or are economically disadvantaged. 
She also pointed to the state’s two largest school districts — Fayette and Jefferson counties — for not signing a form from the U.S. Department of Education to certify their compliance with the Trump administration’s interpretations of civil rights law earlier this year.
“DEI reinforces division rather than unity, and encourages students, teachers and staff to see each other through the lens of identity and creating group think instead of creating independent thinkers,” Tichenor said. 
When committee members were able to question the proposal, a few Democrats voiced opposition. Rep. Sarah Stalker, D-Louisville, said that by ending DEI in education, the General Assembly would be “missing an incredible opportunity.” As a white woman, she’s had moments to reflect on her own privilege that many of her colleagues, friends, family and more do not have. 
“I think we’re missing an opportunity when kids have a moment to reflect about how the color of their skin does and does not allow them to move through the world,” Stalker said. “Running to them and trying to stifle that and trying to say, ‘You shouldn’t feel bad, so we don’t want to ever expose you to something that is going to make you have to pause and have maybe some internal feelings.’ It’s a missed opportunity for some really good dialog.”
Stalker added: “It’s not about making people feel bad about being white. I think it’s about acknowledging the historical privilege that white people have always had in this country.” 
Tichenor filed a similar bill during the 2025 legislative session, but it did not get a committee hearing. However, Republicans, who hold a supermajority in both the House and Senate, easily passed a law to end DEI in Kentucky’s public universities and colleges.
The senator was joined by Michael Frazier, the executive director of the Kentucky Student Rights Coalition, who backed the law to end DEI in higher education. He said that while DEI began with “good intentions” it has changed. 
The primary sponsor of the higher education law, Rep. Jennifer Decker, R-Waddy, said the committee “already heard today the start of what will be countless hours — countless hours — of advocacy against this bill that will bear no relationship to the bill.” Decker’s proposal was hotly debated this year, with college students traveling to Frankfort to oppose the bill in committee meetings and Democrats in the House and Senate speaking against the bill during hour-long floor debates in both chambers. 
“There will be discussions of violations of inclusion, for example, that as if the bill stops all inclusionary methodology. You will hear things that are specifically excluded being spoken of as a problem with the bill,” Decker said. “The bill does one thing, as I understand it, and that is stop unconstitutional practices that cannot be defended in the United States of America that are based on exclusionary preferences that will stop such things as methodologies that we’ve heard about that have been harmful to one minority community.” 
Tichenor said that her bill, which will be called the Kentucky Education Equality Protection Act, will “not affect instruction on the historical oppression of a particular group of people.” She also said that it will not impact freedom of speech or association of students, mental and physical health services, single gender schools, bona fide occupational qualifications and accommodations based on sex, or the ability of a school district or public school to comply with a federal mandate, provided compliance is narrowly tailored to the express and enforceable provision. 
Republicans nationwide have moved to end DEI initiatives following the 2023 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that overturned affirmative action policies in universities. 
Shortly after returning to the White House in January, Republican President Donald Trump took several steps to eliminate DEI policies, including signing an executive order that directed his administration to identify potential civil compliance investigations of corporations, nonprofit organizations, some higher education institutions and more.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/tichenor091724-1024x727.jpeg,,,2025-12-09 14:58:27.140625

Boeing reports the total transaction value at $8.3 billion, which includes acquiring Spirit’s net debt.
“This is a pivotal moment in Boeing’s history and future success as we begin to integrate Spirit AeroSystems’ commercial and aftermarket operations and establish Spirit Defense,” said Kelly Ortberg, president and CEO of the Boeing Co., in a news release.
The transaction moved forward after the Federal Trade Commission approved the merger with stipulations that Boeing divest itself of some key Spirit businesses, a move designed to ensure Boeing doesn’t have a monopoly.
In an FTC docket, the agency said the market for commercial aircraft is highly concentrated, with Boeing and Airbus SE accounting for 95% of large commercial aircraft delivered on an annual basis.
“The divestitures resolve FTC allegations that Boeing’s acquisition of Spirit would give Boeing the ability and incentive to raise the cost or degrade Airbus’ access to inputs for its competing aircraft,” an FTC news release said.
The acquisition includes all of Spirit’s Boeing-related commercial operations, which includes fuselages for the 737 program and major structures for the 767, 777 and 787 Dreamliner, the news release said.
Spirit Defense will continue as an independent supplier to the defense industry and will align to Boeing Defense, Space & Security for financial reporting and select enterprise functional and site support, but maintain independent governance and operations, Boeing announced.
Signs already were being replaced on Spirit AeroSystems buildings in Wichita, KWCH-TV reported.
“Boeing’s acquisition of Spirit AeroSystems will help build bridges between Seattle and Wichita and bring new opportunities to the Air Capital of the World,” said U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran in a news release.
U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall said the merger recognizes the “world-class talent” in Wichita.
“Our workers and the unions that represent them have kept America as the gold standard in aerospace, and they deserve to be at the center of any future investment,” he said in a news release. “I’m grateful that this agreement further solidifies Wichita’s prestige in the industry.”

(Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)A state government panel set up to evaluate judges’ pay recommends the Louisiana Legislature raise state judicial salaries — again. 

Louisiana’s Judicial Compensation Commission voted Monday to back a plan that would raise pay next year for district court judges by $25,414, appellate judges by $29,111 and state Supreme Court justices by $27,409. It also suggested smaller raises in 2027, 2028 and 2029, — ranging from $3,800 to $6,000 annually. 
The three judges who sit on the state Board of Tax Appeal, which meets between five and six days per month, would also see a pay hike of $35,800 in 2026 and subsequent salary increases of a little over $1,000 each year the next three years, under the commission’s recommendations. 
The panel followed a salary schedule created by economist Loren Scott, a retired LSU professor who state judges have paid to evaluate whether their compensation is adequate. Scott told the commission the salary increases, while hefty, would keep pace with inflation and other rising expenses. 

Louisiana trial court judges earn between $176,188 and $195,627, depending on whether they served at the district, appellate or Supreme Court level. Scott said the raises, which would run from 14% to 15.9% in the next year alone, would move the judges closer to the purchasing power they had in 1983. 
State judges have seen some form of an annual pay increase going back to at least 2019, when the first of five straight years of 2.5% hikes took effect. Even when legislators rejected permanent pay raises for judges over the past two years, they found a workaround to provide the judges with essentially the same increase, albeit on a temporary basis, through pay stipends. 
The commission’s newly adopted pay scales for the judges are only suggestions. Gov. Jeff Landry and Louisiana lawmakers ultimately have to weigh the higher salaries against other state expenses and decide whether to approve them. 

Yet legislators rarely turn down the judiciary request for pay raises. A critical mass of lawmakers from both political parties in the Louisiana Legislature are attorneys who have to appear in those judges’ courtrooms for their day jobs. 
The dynamic makes it awkward for lawmakers to reject judges’ requests for additional compensation.The legislature created the Judicial Compensation Commission, in part, to create a buffer between themselves and the judges to evaluate more independently what their pay should be. 

The 15 commission members include legislators, judges, attorneys and at least five members of the general public who must not be attorneys or elected officials. 

Some of those general public members have close ties to judges, however. For example, House Speaker Phillip DeVillier, R-Eunice, appointed Rebekah Cole, who is married to Supreme Court Justice Cade Cole, to one of the seats. 
The question of what is appropriate judicial compensation has become a touchier issue in recent years. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Weimer has made it a personal mission to rein in spending on judges’ salaries and other personal perks, such as state per diem payments they receive for travel and meals.
“The pennies become dollars and the dollars become millions over a period of time,” Weimer told the commission Monday. 
A study by the National Center for State Courts concluded Louisiana’s district court judges had the 17th highest compensation in 2023 compared to their peers in other states. Salaries for most other positions in Louisiana often fall well below the national average. 

But Scott and individual members of the judiciary have pushed back on the study’s conclusions. They said it doesn’t account for the financial perks judges receive in other states or the high rate at which judges are asked to pay into their retirement accounts.

“We are tens of thousands of dollars behind,” Supreme Court Associate Justice John Michael Guidry said in testimony before the commission. 

Guidry and several other judges vehemently disagree with Weimer that judicial compensation needs to be curbed, so much so that the chief justice regularly gets outvoted by his colleagues when it comes to budgetary matters. 
This year, Weimer tried a different tactic to get his message across to the compensation commission. He hired his own economist to counter Scott’s arguments and analysis, but the person didn’t come to the hearing to testify with Weimer. The chief justice withheld the economist’s name, saying he feared they might face retaliation from judges. 

Judicial compensation increases also affect far more than judges. A number of elected officials across the state, such as sheriffs and parish presidents, have their salaries tied to judiciary compensation in state law. When judges get a raise, many other public servants automatically see an increase in compensation as well, said former state Sen. Edwin Murray, D-New Orleans, who leads the commission.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IMG_3663-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-09 14:58:27.140625

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)Virginia House Speaker Don Scott on Tuesday set a Jan. 6 special election in House District 77, hours after Del. Mike Jones, D-Richmond, resigned his seat following his win in the Democratic firehouse primary for the open Senate District 15.
Jones’ resignation creates a fast-moving contest in a district that spans parts of Richmond and Chesterfield County — and one that Democrats are eager to hold after expanding their House majority to 63 seats last month. 
The Senate seat Jones is seeking was vacated by Lt. Gov.-elect Ghazala Hashmi. And although he still faces Republican John Thomas — also on Jan. 6 — the district is widely viewed as safe Democratic. That political reality likely contributed to Jones stepping down early, giving Democrats time to mount a full campaign in his former House district.
So far, at least two Democrats have announced they’re running for the party’s nomination in District 77. Former Richmond city council member Michelle Mosby and attorney Charlie Schmidt will likely face off in another firehouse primary ahead of the special election. As of Tuesday afternoon, no Republican has declared a bid in the district.
Mosby, who represented the city’s 9th District on council and has long been active in Southside politics, framed her run as an extension of decades of community work. She said she has spent “more than two decades” serving Richmond and the Southside “as a public servant, small-business owner, nonprofit leader, and former President of Richmond City Council.”
Her campaign is emphasizing economic mobility, public safety and reentry, housing stability and youth support — issues she said she has worked on directly. 
“District 77 deserves a delegate who can be an authentic bridge — someone who knows the challenges families face, who has worked side-by-side with them, and who can deliver meaningful results in housing, public safety, reentry, youth supports, and economic development,” Mosby said.
Schmidt, a self-described progressive Democrat, attorney and longtime community activist, cast his candidacy as the next step in a career centered on public-interest work. 
“Throughout my life and my legal career, I have worked to protect the vulnerable, seek justice, and ensure our government is accountable to the people,” he said, adding that he hopes to bring that background to the state legislature. “Now I want to take that experience to the General Assembly.”
District 77, created during the 2021 redistricting process, is a safely Democratic seat that has remained in party hands since its creation. Jones was first elected there in 2023 before quickly rising as a party favorite in the race to replace Hashmi. Last month, he won his reelection bid unopposed. 
The Jan. 6 date means both chambers will hold special elections on the same day and in the same area. 
For Jones, the timing offers a likely path to the upper chamber. For Democratic hopefuls in District 77, it opens a rare, fast-track opportunity to join the General Assembly at the start of the 2026 session.

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)A nonprofit providing legal aid to low-income South Dakotans will retain its federal funding, despite claims of ineffectiveness from a fellow legal aid organization.
The decision leaves South Dakota’s legal aid landscape unchanged, but will increase scrutiny over Dakota Plains Legal Services operations over the next year.
Dakota Plains serves the western half of South Dakota, as well as Native Americans on and off tribal lands across the state. East River Legal Services, which serves the eastern part of the state, had said earlier this year that it would compete for Dakota Plains’ federal grant funding because the organization was not effectively serving clients.

Lea Wroblewski, executive director for East River Legal Services, said in July that some organizations working with low-income, vulnerable communities in Dakota Plains’ jurisdiction were unfamiliar with the nonprofit. She added that East River had “not been able to successfully refer a single housing case” to Dakota Plains in her three years on the job.
Representatives with the nationwide Legal Services Corporation spoke to members of the state Commission on Equal Access to Our Courts during a Tuesday virtual meeting. Corporation officials said they will award Dakota Plains one year’s worth of funding rather than a standard three-year grant. Dakota Plains will receive nearly $2 million in total grant funding for its geographical area and its services to Native Americans.
The organization will adhere to special grant conditions to centralize its intake system and involve leadership in a nationwide search for a permanent executive director. Interim Executive Director William Sulik requested another compliance review from the national corporation to assess the organization’s effectiveness and train staff members.
“I know that this is a trust given to us,” Sulik told commission members, “and we intend to keep that trust with the people of South Dakota.”
The commission also voted to award funding that was withheld from Dakota Plains while the corporation’s assessment was pending. The commission awarded Dakota Plains $154,000, with the stipulation that the organization’s Justice Bus operations are prioritized.
The Justice Bus launched at the beginning of this year and is the state’s first mobile legal aid office, meant to increase accessibility to legal aid services across the state — especially in legal deserts.

Free.,"No due process guarantee in fast-track removal proceedings, Trump administration argues",Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/no-due-process-guarantee-fast-track-removal-proceedings-trump-administration-argues,,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration Tuesday defended the merits of its fast-track deportation policy before a panel of judges in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, saying immigrants who have been in the country for less than two years without legal authorization are not guaranteed due process.The suit, brought by immigration rights advocacy groups, challenges the Department of Homeland Security’s expanded expedited removal rule’s application to immigrants in the interior of the United States who cannot prove they have remained in the country for more than two years. The expanded policy, which allows the removal of immigrants without an appearance before an immigration judge, is a pillar of the Trump administration's mass deportation campaign. Arguing on behalf of the Trump administration, Drew Ensign from the U.S. Department of Justice said that immigrants cannot rely on due process rights granted in the Constitution because those rights are reserved for U.S. citizens. Congress and Supreme Court precedents restrict immigrants’ rights to due process, he said.Additionally, Ensign argued that because Congress authorized the DHS secretary to use expedited removal, the courts have no jurisdiction on the matter. Anand Balakrishnan, legal counsel for Make the Road New York, the immigrant rights advocacy group that brought the challenge, said the policy skirts a fair legal process for immigrants.Democratic state attorneys general also submitted a brief in support of the immigrant rights groups, arguing that the expanded use of expedited removal is unconstitutional. Those states include California, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawai’i, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state. Policy expanded to interiorFor decades, expedited removal has been used to apply to migrants apprehended at the U.S. border and quickly deported without appearing before an immigration judge. In January, the Trump administration expanded its scope to the interior of the country and applied it to any immigrant apprehended who cannot prove they have remained in the country for more than two years. An appeals court in late November declined the Trump administration's request to pause a district court's block of the policy while the appeal was pending. Tuesday's hearing was part of the Trump administration’s appeal on the merits of its policy before a different appeals panel, Judges Justin R. Walker, Neomi Rao and Robert L. Wilkins. President Donald Trump nominated Walker and Rao and former President Barack Obama nominated Wilkins.The panel appeared skeptical of the administration's argument that due process rights do not apply to immigrants who entered the U.S. without legal authorization.Duty to notifyThe judges seemed split, though, about if the government should be expected to explain the expedited removal statute to a person it is attempting to remove and what that person’s rights are to challenge their removal, or if the person should have to ask for their own due process rights. “Even if we accept your portrayal of how the due process works, … under that framing, there still has to be adequate notice (of removal),” Wilkins said to Ensign. Ensign argued that immigrants subject to expedited removal have sufficient notice they are being removed and can’t rely on the due process clause of the Constitution’s Fifth Amendment to challenge it. The executive branch has the authority to decide how to apply the clause to immigrants, he said.Wilkins pushed back on that argument, saying notices must meet minimum standards. “The notice (of removal) has to be sufficient,” he said to Ensign. “(It) has to inform you of at least what the procedures are or what you're facing.”Balakrishnan said a mere notice of removal is “inadequate.” An immigrant subject to expedited removal can be deported within hours and without having time to challenge their removal or even speak to an attorney, he said.Walker seemed skeptical that the burden of notifying an immigrant that they were subject to the policy fell to the government. “For someone who has chosen to be here illegally, in violation of our laws….from a due process perspective it’s not too much to ask that if someone here illegally wants the special non-expedited removal procedures that Congress has graciously afforded them, it's not too much to ask that they ask for them,” he said. Balakrishnan argued that wouldn’t be sufficient due process.“I think it's common sense that having even that bare amount of information, ‘if you've been here for over two years you're not subject to expedited removal’ would certainly decrease the risk of error,” Balakrishnan said. “I'm not sure how it would be overly burdensome for the government to do that.”",,,,2025-12-09 14:58:27.140625

Local communities around the country are seeking more input on where and how data centers are built. (Photo by Nathan Howard/Getty Images)How unpopular are new data centers being designed to help train and run artificial intelligence models around the United States?
On Monday, six Florida organizations signed a letter sent to Congress by more than 200 other groups calling for a national moratorium on approval and construction of such facilities.
A typical A.I.-focused data center consumes as much electricity as 100,000 households, but the larger ones under construction will consume 20 times as much, according to the International Energy Agency.
“To say that data centers are unpopular right now is probably an understatement, to say the least,” admitted Dan Diorio, vice president for state policy for the Data Center Coalition, speaking beforethe Florida House Economic Infrastructure Committee Tuesday.
The industry has been “very responsive” to that public perception, Diorio said, and it’s important to inform local communities where such facilities might be located that data centers provide “significant job opportunities,” specifically in the skilled trades such as electricians, plumbers, and HVAC technicians.
“It’s about education and it’s about communication and upfront, honest conversations,” added Tiffany Cohen, VP with Florida Power & Light (FPL). “People want to be heard. The have valid concerns, and we need to address them.”
FPL is the state’s largest investor-owned utility, servicing more than 6 million individual accounts comprising around 12 million Floridians. The company has said it welcomes data centers to its service areas and supports their development.
Under questioning from Rep. Linda Chaney, R-Pinellas County, Cohen told lawmakers that the Florida Public Service Commission recently approved two new tariffs that will require that “large load” customers that create data centers in Florida to pay in advance for their expected energy costs, and not FPL’s ratepayers.
“Instead of our general body paying for that, customers have to pay for that upfront,” Cohen told the committee.
“In return, as their load materializes on our system, we will give them a refund of that money. It’s a state law, we can’t change the law, but we will refund the money to them as their load materializes. So, it ensures that they show up and that the amount of power that they say they’re going to take from us, they actually do, but it also forces them to pay those costs upfront. Which has never been done before.”
Data centers use large amounts of water, primarily for cooling servers. But Diorio said new closed-loop cooling systems enable use of both recycled wastewater and fresh water, allowing water supplies to be used multiple times.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis last week announced his proposal to protect Floridians from footing the bill for A.I. data centers and to empower local governments to reject their development in their communities. He wants to prohibit utilities from charging Florida residents to support hyperscale data center development, including electric, gas, and water utilities.
Tuesday’s committee hearing was the first of 14 the Florida House has scheduled through Thursday to discuss AI use in different facets of the Sunshine State’s industries.
The letter sent to Congress this week calling for a national moratorium on data centers was organized by Food & Water Watch.
“Floridians are facing some of the highest electricity bills in the country. The explosion of data centers driven by Big Tech’s greed represents an unprecedented threat to communities suffocating under a crushing affordability and climate crisis,” said Brooke Ward, senior Florida organizer for that organization, in a written statement.
“The only acceptable action to protect people and the environment is to halt the expansion of this unnecessary, dangerous, and under-researched industry in order to determine the true depth of harm. Floridians simply cannot afford a reckless ask-for-forgiveness-and-correct-later approach.”",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/data-centers-VA.jpg,,,2025-12-09 13:57:13.907869

(Photo: Cassandra Stephenson)The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced Monday that $12 billion will be available for one-time “bridge” payments to farmers who experienced trade market disruptions and increased production costs during the 2025 crop year.
The relief comes as Tennessee farmers are projected to lose $450 million this year, Gov. Bill Lee said during the Tennessee Farm Bureau’s annual meeting in Franklin on Tuesday.
Up to $11 billion in federal funding will be used for the Farmer Bridge Assistance program, which will provide relief payments to farmers who produce specific row crops, including soybeans, corn, cotton, and other crops widely grown in Tennessee. 
The remaining $1 billion will be reserved for specialty crops, sugar, and other commodities not covered in the Farmer Bridge Assistance program, but the distribution timeline for that funding is “still under development” and will “require additional understanding of market impacts and economic needs,” according to the USDA.
Payments will be based on planted acres.
TN Soybean farmers face ‘desperate situation’ amid inflation, weather extremes and tariffs

Farmers have until Dec. 19 at 5 p.m. to ensure their 2025 acreage reporting is accurate, and the USDA will announce the payment rate by crop the week of Dec. 22, according to Alison Slagell, senior policy advisor to the USDA secretary.
Producers must certify that their adjusted gross income is less than $900,000 to be eligible. The program will limit payments to up to $155,000 per person or legal entity, according to USDA Undersecretary Richard Fordyce. Producers are not required to hold crop insurance policies to receive payments.
Eligible farmers should expect to receive payments by Feb. 28.
“If you plant an eligible crop and you’ve taken a hit, you’ll receive support,” Fordyce said during a Monday news conference.
Covered crops include:

Barley
Chickpeas
Corn
Cotton
Lentils
Oats
Peanuts
Peas
Rice
Sorghum
Soybeans
Wheat
Canola
Crambe
Flax
Mustard
Rapeseed
Safflower
Sesame

Lee said he is grateful for federal relief for farmers from the Trump administration.
“Our office has interacted with farmers in this state in order to advocate with the federal government for relief,” he said. “It’s a hard time, and you need to know that your elected officials understand that and are doing their best to navigate that in a way that’s gonna continue to help our industry.”
The payments are meant to “help address market disruptions, elevated input costs, persistent inflation, and market losses from foreign competitors engaging in unfair trade practices that impede exports,” according to the USDA. 
Fordyce described the program as an “economic loss” program spanning several factors that affected producers in the past year. When asked what portion of the payments are geared toward losses due to tariffs or trade deals, Fordyce said he is not sure about what portion of the payments were geared toward any one factor.










It’s hard to speculate the impact of a tariff policy. I do know that the plan for the impact of this tariff policy is actually to benefit producers, and this $12 billion relief package would be of great benefit to producers.


– Gov. Bill Lee


This year, Tennessee farmers growing soybeans, the state’s most prominent row crop, faced inflation, weather extremes and an unstable market amid tariff negotiations. In August, the University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture projected that Tennessee soybean farmers would lose an estimated $110 million this year.
China — the United States’ largest soybean export partner — boycotted U.S. soybean purchases for several weeks in 2025 during negotiations with President Donald Trump, instead turning toward Brazil and Argentina for soybean imports.
China and Trump reached an agreement in October. China agreed to purchase at least 12 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans before January, and at least 25 million metric tons each year from 2026 through 2028. 
From Oct. 30 through Dec. 8, China has purchased 2,845,000 metric tons of U.S. soybeans for the 2025-2026 marketing year, according to USDA data.
Asked whether Trump’s tariffs exacerbated farming losses in Tennessee, Lee said the tariffs generated money that will help offset the losses some producers suffered.
“It’s hard to speculate the impact of a tariff policy,” Lee said. “I do know that the plan for the impact of this tariff policy is actually to benefit producers, and this $12 billion relief package would be of great benefit to producers.”
“The tariff policy is complex and spans multiple industries,” Lee continued. “I can’t speculate as to the future there. But this plan is working, or is proposed to work. We’ll see how it works out.”
Fordyce and Luke Lindberg, the USDA undersecretary for trade and foreign agricultural affairs, blamed policies under the previous administration for the shaky farm economy. 
China has been investing more in soybeans from South America instead of U.S. soybeans since Trump’s first administration. China is also a key trade partner for other U.S. farm exports.
“I would not characterize our trade demand as only driven by China,” Lindberg said, adding that producers have not yet seen opportunities that were generated by Trump’s trade deals. “Certainly, they are an important buyer.”
Lindberg said the trade deal with China “specifies a floor” for soybean purchases, but Trump is “optimistic that the Chinese will buy more soybeans and other products than even indicated in the initial agreement.”
Regarding adherence to trade promises, Lindberg said Trump “has ways to create … historic leverage in trade negotiations.”
“I think folks that renege on their promises to American family farms run the risk of the president taking even more aggressive actions yet,” he said.

Oct. 29. | Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance. Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel joined a letter with 20 other state attorneys general to U.S. congressional leadership from both parties, urging them to reject a proposal that would tie extended tax credits for the Affordable Care Act to a ban on coverage of abortion, calling it an “effort to implement a back-door federal abortion ban.”
Tax credit extensions for the Affordable Care Act were a key sticking point for Democrats that led to a record-long federal government shutdown this fall, which ended after parties agreed to renegotiate the tax credit. The letter characterized the move as “a brazen attempt to stymie extension of the tax credits by threatening access to critical healthcare in an already hostile environment.”
The attorneys general also emphasized the importance of states’ sovereignty in determining coverage under each state’s health care marketplace, which has long been a part of the Affordable Care Act’s structure.
“This attempt to use essential abortion care as a bargaining chip to extend ACA tax credits shows a blatant disregard for the health and rights of millions of Americans,” Nessel said in a press release from her office. “We’ve already seen the devastating consequences of gutting access to reproductive health care, and further restricting care would only make things worse. Congress must reject this latest concerted effort to interfere with personal medical decisions.” 
The letter also emphasized that federal dollars, under the initial passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2009 and 2010, are not used to fund abortion services except in very limited cases. 
The proposal comes just a week after a federal judge granted an injunction in a lawsuit filed by Nessel and leaders from other states that sought to block a provision of President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” that would defund Planned Parenthood.

What this means, though, is unclear.
Board members during a Tuesday morning meeting expressed differing opinions on open enrollment,  a policy that broadly speaking would allow students to enroll in neighboring school districts. After debating the issue, the board initially seemed poised to remove it from its priorities for the upcoming legislative session but ultimately agreed to wave it through and make edits at a later date.
Board President Mary Schrag said the intention is to give the board and the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education a “seat at the table” as lawmakers consider provisions that alter how open enrollment would be administered.
“We don’t have to take a stance on (open enrollment),” she said. “I do think we need to make sure that we stay as a player and are at the table.”
State lawmakers have filed open enrollment bills for the past five years, passing out of the House each time but coming to a standstill in the Senate. The proposal has evolved over the years, with changes like a cap on the number of students that may leave a district and who is responsible for the cost of transportation.
Commissioner of Education Karla Eslinger said if lawmakers move forward with open enrollment, she’d like the board to have a say in some of the details.
“(State lawmakers) continue to have conversations in the legislature about what is the best fit for Missouri and how do you create this opportunity for choice within the public system,” she said. “So, by having this board have an opinion that open enrollment is something we want to have a conversation about, it makes us relevant.”
She told state senators in a hearing about an unrelated issue last week that she “did not have a problem with” open enrollment as a concept.
“As a superintendent of schools, I can tell you that if a parent didn’t feel like that I met their needs, I want them to be able to go someplace,” she told the Senate Education Committee last Thursday.
Board member Pamela Westbrooks-Hodge, of Pasadena Hills, said Tuesday that she had concerns that she would like to enumerate in a clearer policy position.
“I want to be supportive of our board, but I am concerned about harming small communities, and that isn’t reflected in this language,” she said.
Board member Mike Matousek, of Kansas City, indicated that he supported the idea of open enrollment but he felt like approving the legislative priorities was premature.
“There are key issues that we just need to talk about first to understand what it is we’re actually supporting here, and what are our priorities,” he said.
He was the lone vote in opposition to approving the document.
Schrag said many of the priorities, like a focus on early childhood literacy, have come up in numerous board conversations.
“As board members, we are learning and absorbing and digging in all the time through all of our conversations,” she said. “It doesn’t require a specific agenda item, in some cases, to come to an understanding of a position.”
The board has approved legislative priorities for four years, focusing on improving the programs offered by the state’s education department.
Other priorities approved Tuesday include a recommendation to fully fund the formula that determines state aid for public schools and the creation of a program to improve math instruction statewide.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/090925_schrageslinger1-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-12-09 13:57:13.907869

(Getty Images)Lawmakers should reimplement the Presidential Fitness Test for students as a part of West Virginia’s application for funding through the federal Rural Health Transformation Program, legislators were told Tuesday.
Curtis Capehart, director of policy for Gov. Patrick Morrisey, gave an update on the program to the Legislative Oversight Commission on Health and Human Resources Accountability. 
The state submitted its application to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid for the program in November. West Virginia is eligible for more that $100 million per year over five years from the program, which aims to “transform the existing rural health care infrastructure and build sustainable health care systems that expand access, enhance quality of care, and improve outcomes for patients,” according to CMS. 
The federal government has said it would announce award funding for the program by Dec. 31. 
During the meeting, LOCHHRA chairman Del. Evan Worrell, R-Cabell, asked Capehart what priorities lawmakers should focus on during the 2026 legislative session for the application. 
“The one that immediately springs to mind is the Presidential Fitness Test,” Capehart said. “We would be asking to have that put into code so that that would come back.’
He added that there are no commitments relating to scope of practice and certificate of need in the state’s application. 
President Donald Trump issued an executive order July 31 reestablishing the Presidential  Fitness Test and the President’s Council on Sports, Fitness and Nutrition. 
“As the United States prepares to celebrate its semiquincentennial anniversary in 2026, we must address the threat to the vitality and longevity of our country that is posed by America’s declining health and physical fitness,” the order says. “For far too long, the physical and mental health of the American people has been neglected. Rates of obesity, chronic disease, inactivity and poor nutrition are at crisis levels, particularly among our children. These trends weaken our economy, military readiness, academic performance and national morale.”
The school physical fitness exam was first established by President Dwight D. Eisenhower and was phased out during President Barack Obama’s administration. The components of the physical fitness test have changed over the years and include running, situps, pushups and stretching. 
Critics of the test say it caused embarrassment and shame for students.
Trump’s executive order does not say what metrics should be included on his version of the fitness test. 
The Rural Health Transformation program is a part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which Trump signed into law July 4. The bill makes historic cuts to Medicaid. Health care officials say the Rural Health Transformation Program will not make up for the approximately $1 billion per year that state hospitals are expected to lose once the legislation has been fully implemented.
The state has not yet released or published the application. Capehart said the application’s project narrative and supporting appendix documents would be made available online later this week.
According to a summary of the application, the state’s plan includes seven focus areas that include: building infrastructure to bring virtual and in-person care access to people on-demand; transporting residents to care when needed; recruiting, training and retaining health care workers in the state; supporting tech-enabled innovation and regulatory relief.
“West Virginia’s approach was deliberately structured for sustainability and will deliver on affordability and access,” Capehart told lawmakers Tuesday. “We’re confident that this plan will not end at the completion of the five-year grant cycle. It seeks to build a permanent infrastructure and programs that will strengthen health care in our state.”
The state will confront the health barriers that keep residents out of the workforce, he said. 
“Poor health is the single largest driver of low labor force participation and better health outcomes must be our primary focus moving forward,” Capehart said. “By moving toward investment in prevention as well, the state can restore more of our working-age population to health productivity, increasing fortunes of the entire state and all of our rural communities.”
Capehart said officials expect to hear how much funding the state will get on Dec. 31. Part of the funding is expected in the first few weeks of January 2026. Lawmakers would then appropriate the funding through legislation, Capehart said.

(Whitney Downard/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)School districts — whether public or private — across the commonwealth may be required to draft a policy prohibiting student cellphones with limited exceptions following a unanimous vote in the state Senate Education Committee Tuesday. 
Sens. Devlin Robinson (R-Allegheny) and Steven Santarsiero (D-Bucks) introduced the bill to address the “growing issue” of cellphones in schools, where the devices can cause distractions and disrupt learning. 
“We know these devices are addictive. As adults, we know how difficult it is not to pick up our phones during meetings and other inopportune times. Imagine how difficult it is for children who are still developing self control,” said Robinson. 
Robinson, and others, shared concerns that students also missed out on social growth opportunities, such as face-to-face communication and teamwork. He pointed to studies linking screen time to emotional instability and disrupted brain development in teens.

Following an amendment, phones will be banned at the start of the 2027-28 school year, with exceptions for students with medical conditions or individualized education plans that require a communication device. 
Though committee members broadly supported the bipartisan proposal, several lawmakers pitched potential revisions. Sen. Dawn Keefer (R-York) wondered if some students might try to get an individualized education plan — which is often used for students with disabilities to get appropriate accommodations — in order to get phone access. 
“I wish the schools would take the initiative and do it themselves,” said Keefer, noting that some of her districts had different policies for middle grades versus high schools. “This is the problem with us doing one size fits all.” 
Sen. Lindsey Williams (D-Allegheny) said she had received “mixed feedback” on the proposal, and hoped a future version would better detail the process for public comment and include greater flexibility for exceptions.
“I just don’t believe that we have a crystal ball as legislators,” said Williams. 
The committee held a hearing on the topic this past October, while its House counterparts heard from parents and teachers last month.

The state and CAIR look to have a legal battle looming. (CAIR photo)Gov. Ron DeSantis said a lawsuit filed against him by a Muslim civil rights group he recently declared a terrorist organization is “very much welcome.”
Monday, DeSantis declared via executive order that the Muslim Brotherhood and the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) are foreign terrorist organizations. CAIR promised a lawsuit, alleging defamation and that the order is unconstitutional.
The governor during a news conference about water quality in North Miami Beach Tuesday said state Attorney General James Uthmeier “is ready, willing, and able to be fighting” the lawsuit.
DeSantis said the lawsuit will give the state discovery rights to the organization’s bank records and other information.
“They have every right to sue and then we’re going to have a right to get the information we need to make sure,” DeSantis said.
Florida’s executive order calls on state agencies to deny material support or resources to the organizations.
“The Muslim Brotherhood’s Islamist ideology is irreconcilable with foundational American principles of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness reflected in the Declaration of Independence and the United States Constitution, especially including the right to religious freedom and the equal protection of the laws,” the executive order states.

CAIR is a Muslim civil rights group. Its website says CAIR’s mission “is to protect civil rights, enhance understanding of Islam, promote justice, and empower American Muslims.”
CAIR is not on the federal government’s list of terrorist organizations.
In 2010, Pew Research called the Muslim Brotherhood “without question the world’s most influential modern islamist organization.”
“I think our executive order is kind of the beginning. I think you’re going to see statutory codification of how we handle different terror designations,” DeSantis said. On his social media, the governor posted that he hopes lawmakers proposing “to stop the creep of sharia law” “codify these protections for Floridians against CAIR and the Muslim Brotherhood.”
Last month, President Donald Trump signed an executive order declaring that “certain chapters or other subdivisions of the Muslim Brotherhood shall be considered for designation as Foreign Terrorist organizations.”
CAIR Florida interim Director Hiba Rahim released this statement following DeSantis’ executive order:
“An attack on our civil rights organization is a direct attack on our constitutional First Amendment rights and an attack on the civil rights of Florida’s Muslim community.
“Governor DeSantis’ executive order singles out and defames our community based on an ‘Israel First’ a political agenda. CAIR-Florida will not stand idly by while we are defamed and our rights re denied. We are taking legal action to ensure that all citizens, regardless of their background or political views, are protected equally under the law. We are upholding our commitment: See you in court.”

A sign in the mountain region heralds the coming hospital, but the site behind it is just a field of dirt. (Andrew Jones/KFF Health News)Madison County, tucked in the mountains of western North Carolina, has no hospital and just three ambulances serving its roughly 22,000 people.
The ambulances frequently travel back and forth to Mission Hospital in Asheville, the largest and most central hospital in the region. Trips can take more than two hours, according to Mark Snelson, director of Madison Medics EMS, the local emergency medical service.
“When we get busy and all three of them are gone, we have no ambulances in our county,” he said.
Snelson and others in Madison County aren’t seeking more ambulances. They want a hospital closer than Mission. And the state agrees. In 2022, North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services officials said Madison and three other mountain counties needed 67 more acute care hospital beds. The state raised that to 93 beds in 2024, then to 222 by Oct. 15.
But the only indication of a new hospital thus far is a 25-acre field of graded dirt with a sign planted beside the highway reading “FUTURE HOME OF AdventHealth Weaverville.”
For the past three years, Mission Hospital’s owner has contested Florida-headquartered AdventHealth’s attempt to build the hospital on land bought for $7.5 million in rural Weaverville, just minutes south of Madison County. It was supposed to open this year, an event that would have defied the national trend of rural hospital closures.
The irony is that the very law that calls for the new hospital — the state’s certificate of need, or CON, law — has been used to prevent further construction. Such laws are intended to cap unfettered health care expansion by allowing new hospitals and expansions only when a state can document a need for them. But the legal process has tied up the proposed Weaverville hospital in court, just as other such laws have done with projects in Tigard, Oregon; Connecticut; and Fort Mill, South Carolina.
All states had certificate of need laws until 1987, when the federal government repealed a mandate requiring them. Today, North Carolina is one of 35 states with the laws still on the books. Twelve others have repealed them or let them expire, and some, such as Montana and South Carolina, have significantly weakened theirs amid concerns they limit health care access and boost costs. President Donald Trump’s Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice are among those questioning the need for the laws.

In North Carolina, too, opposition to the state’s certificate of need law has surfaced in both the General Assembly, where a bill to repeal the law has been dormant since April, and more prominently in the state Superior Court.
But some hospital industry organizations, health care economists, and certificate of need lawyers argue that, though the laws create bureaucracy that can delay projects, that’s not justification to do away with them.
The principle behind certificates of need is to hold at bay what supporters say is unnecessary expansion and price inflation brought on by a free market, which makes health care more expensive for everyone.
“If the principle is worth preserving, don’t abandon the principle,” said Mark J. Silberman, a health care attorney with the Benesch law firm and former counsel for Illinois’ certificate of need board. “Improve the process to allow the principle to flourish.”
Who Should Fill the Need?
Mission Health is the largest health care network and the largest employer in the Tar Heel State’s share of the Appalachians. Nashville-based HCA Healthcare bought the century-old, nonprofit, six-hospital system for $1.5 billion in 2019, converting it to a for-profit operation that serves an 18-county region. (The Dogwood Health Trust, a nonprofit established as part of HCA’s purchase of Mission Health, helps fund KFF Health News’ coverage.)
Though AdventHealth already owns one hospital in the North Carolina mountains about a 30-minute drive from the Weaverville site, its bid to build a new one represents a threat to HCA’s stronghold. Mission argues it is best positioned to meet the needs the state says exist in the Madison County region.
“Not all acute care beds are the same,” Mission Health spokesperson Nancy Lindell said. “Instead of adding more beds at facilities that are unable to provide the complex medical and surgical care needed, the region would be better served by expanding bed capacity at Mission Hospital.”
An eastern North Carolina eye surgeon’s lawsuit filed in 2020 against the state’s health agency and top state officials alleged the state’s certificate of need law “has nothing to do with protecting the health or safety of real patients.” The ophthalmologist, Jay Singleton, has argued the law prevented him from performing surgeries at his own center because the state didn’t see a need to duplicate services already provided at the local hospital, where he was obligated to operate.
In early November, Republican state Treasurer Brad Briner, the State Employees Association of North Carolina, and several academics who study such laws nationally filed amicus briefs supporting Singleton’s case and urging a judge to reject the state’s attempt to dismiss it.
“I’ve characterized CON law as a permission slip to compete,” said Thomas Stratmann, a George Mason University economics and law professor who co-authored the brief. “It’s as if, when a McDonald’s wanted to open up a shop next to Burger King, they have to go to the state regulator to ask if that’s OK.”
Stratmann argued that, instead of raising prices, more competition would give hospitals and providers greater leverage in negotiating with insurance companies.
That view aligns with a stance the federal government has held for almost 40 years. With varying degrees of fervor under Democratic and Republican leadership, the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice have argued that the laws are anticompetitive and bad for consumers. The Justice Department did not respond to questions about its current position, and the FTC declined to comment on the record.
“CON laws create barriers to entry and expansion, limit consumer choice, and stifle innovation,” the Federal Trade Commission wrote in an April letter to Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee, a Democrat, as the state’s legislature considered, but ultimately abandoned, amendments to its certificate of need law. “For these reasons, the Agencies have consistently suggested that states repeal or retrench their CON laws.”
‘It’s Personal’
In a June letter to Trump and congressional leaders, Senate Democrats named five North Carolina hospitals on a list of rural hospitals in danger of closing if the president’s then-pending spending and tax-cut legislation, called the One Big Beautiful Bill, became law, citing research from the University of North Carolina Sheps Center.
Two of the five North Carolina hospitals on that list, Angel Medical Center and Blue Ridge Regional Hospital, are part of the Mission Health system. Both had three consecutive years of negative profit margins, like hundreds of others on the list. Lindell, the Mission Health spokesperson, said HCA is committed to keeping those two facilities open.
Even so, Madison County Health Department Director Tammy Cody said the needs in the region remain and the certificate of need appeals process has slowed down getting help.
“This isn’t theoretical — it’s personal,” she said. “Every delay means a mother in labor risks a longer ride, an elder with chest pain waits longer for help, or a worker injured on the job faces unnecessary complications.”
AdventHealth spokesperson Victoria Dunkle said the hospital system supports the state’s law partly because it “protects rural access to health care and ensures the community has a voice in the process.” The legal process has kept families waiting, she said, but AdventHealth plans to move forward with the Weaverville hospital “as soon as possible.”
Snelson, the ambulance service director, voiced a question many in the region have asked since the hope of a new rural hospital surfaced.
“Why is it a bad thing for another hospital to come in here to take some of the stress off of Mission?” he asked. “Within a day of it opening, it’s going to be full.”

The law compels the U.S. Department of Justice to release nearly all investigative files in the government’s case against Epstein, who died in jail in 2019 awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.The U.S. Department of Justice asked the court to release the records after Congress overwhelmingly passed the legislation last month requiring disclosure of “all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials in its possession that relate to Epstein or (co-conspirator Ghislaine) Maxwell.”Attorney General Pam Bondi must release the material by Dec. 19 in accordance with the law, which lawmakers dubbed the Epstein Files Transparency Act. Law covers grand jury materialEngelmayer described the act’s language as “strikingly broad” and wrote Congress was “undeniably aware” that grand jury materials in Maxwell’s case were in possession of the U.S. attorney’s office in the Southern District of New York.“Its decision not to exclude grand jury materials despite knowledge as to their existence, while expressly excluding other categories of materials (such as classified information), indicates that the Act covers grand jury materials,” Engelmayer wrote.The order comes days after a Florida federal judge reached a similar conclusion Friday and ordered the unsealing of federal grand jury materials related to the government’s investigation of Epstein from 2005 to 2007.Epstein pleaded guilty to a state charge for soliciting a minor for prostitution but avoided a federal probe when then-U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta cut a deal with state prosecutors. Acosta was later appointed secretary of Labor during Trump’s first administration.Florida interviewMaxwell is serving a 20-year prison sentence. The Trump administration recently transferred the sex offender to a minimum security prison shortly after Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche interviewed her in a Tallahassee, Florida, facility as pressure to release the Epstein files ramped up in Congress and among Trump’s base.According to transcripts, Maxwell told Blanche, Trump’s former personal defense attorney, that she “never witnessed the president in any inappropriate setting in any way. The president was never inappropriate with anybody.

The Michigan College Access Network partners with AmeriCorps for its AdviseMI program, which places corps members in high schools with low numbers of students going to university, as well as its College Completion Corps, which has corps members serving as coaches on college campuses to assist students in navigating their college experience. 
However, the Department of Government Efficiency – which the Trump Administration has reportedly disbanded, despite having less than eight months left in its status as a temporary organization – terminated nearly $400 million in grants to AmeriCorps in April. AmeriCorps is an independent agency of the U.S. government which supports various volunteer programs throughout the country.
Both the AdviseMI and College Completion Corps program were included in the cuts, disrupting access to the programs and displacing 60 corps members.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Due to advocacy work and successful legal challenges lodged against President Donald Trump’s administration, funding for several programs has been restored, allowing the Michigan College Access Network to relaunch the programs last month. 
“It’s been a difficult year for our AmeriCorps staff, but we are proud to send members back in classrooms and on campuses, ready to uplift students across Michigan,” said Ryan Fewins-Bliss, the network’s executive director said in a statement Thursday. “Our advisers and coaches are ready to guide students to and through postsecondary education to reach their career goals.”
James Nelson, director of curriculum, instruction and assessment at Morley Stanwood Community Schools in Morley, Mich. cheered the return of the programs. He noted the program’s support for the state’s goal to increase the number of working-age Michiganders with a skill certificate or college degree attainment to 60% by 2030. 
“With staff time being strained, a college adviser is crucial in meeting the needs of our students as they explore the transition to college,” Nelson said. “They provide focused, caring and relevant knowledge needed for students to be successful in education past high school.”

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)A federal judge struck down an executive order issued by President Donald Trump that indefinitely froze permits and leasing for wind energy projects, finding federal agencies had neither explained nor justified the regulatory about-face that followed the order.
Federal agencies’ decision to block leasing and permitting for wind projects was arbitrary and capricious because the agencies did not provide an explanation to justify reversing decades of past practice on wind energy permitting, the judge said.
“The Agency Defendants were required, at minimum, to ‘provide a reasoned explanation for the change’ and to ‘display awareness that [they were] changing position,’” Massachusetts District Court Judge Patti Saris ruled. “They failed to do so.”
Proposal for ratepayers to subsidize nuclear development gets cold reception

Saris’s order comes in response to a suit filed by New Jersey, 16 other states, the District of Columbia, and a New York clean energy group that collectively alleged federal authorities violated the Administrative Procedure Act, which governs how federal agencies can impose regulations.
State officials argued the feds failed to explain or justify reversing decades of regulatory policy around wind energy projects, a failure the plaintiffs said risked compounding recent rises in electricity costs.
“At a time when utility prices are skyrocketing, Trump’s job-killing freeze would only increase costs,” Attorney General Matt Platkin said in a social media post. “Proud to fight — and win — for NJ families in court.”
Spokespeople for Gov. Phil Murphy, who made wind a cornerstone of his energy policy, did not immediately return an email seeking comment.
The judge found a recent order from the U.S. Supreme Court that held agencies do not need a reasoned explanation to justify following executive orders stemming from authority explicitly and exclusively granted to the president by Congress does not apply in this case.
Unlike in that case, which turned on a challenge to a Trump executive order that ended a policy allowing transgender people to update gender markers on their passports, regulators in the wind matter were acting on their own authority at the president’s direction, Monday’s ruling says.
“Here, the Agency Defendants concede that no statute expressly requires them to follow rules prescribed by the President regarding wind energy authorizations,” the judge wrote.
Administration officials told the court that the review called for by Trump’s order was ongoing but could not provide any timeline for the probe, the judge said.
The freeze’s indefinite nature also violated the law, Saris said.
Portions of the Administrative Procedure Act require regulators to speedily process applications for permits and other licenses and rule on other matters before them within “a reasonable time.”
“While a President may direct a reappraisal of permitting practices after a change of administration … the Agency Defendants may not, as they have done here, decline to adjudicate applications altogether, for an unspecified time, pending the completion of a wide-ranging assessment with no anticipated end date,” the judge wrote.
The order itself presented no explanation for the freeze, Saris said. Instead, it cited vaguely defined potential issues with wind permitting and environmental reviews.
Trump’s order, issued on the day of his second inauguration, spelled doom for offshore wind projects that had already faced hurdles like rising costs, lengthy supply chain delays, and some local opposition from people who feared wind turbines’ effects on ocean views or marine mammals, though the latter has not been linked to wind projects.
Trump’s wind order froze permitting and leasing for all but one of New Jersey’s offshore wind projects.
In September, the administration intervened in a suit brought by state offshore wind opponents that sought to reverse approvals granted to Atlantic Shores South, a 2,800-megawatt offshore wind project that had secured permits and leases about a month before Trump took office.
The pause has affected that project too.
State energy regulators in August withdrew an order approving the construction of a 1,510-megawatt wind farm off the coast of Atlantic City in response to a request from Atlantic Shores. The company cited federal regulatory uncertainty among the barriers the project faced.
Like other wind projects, Atlantic Shores had faced rising costs and supply chain challenges stemming from the pandemic, but it had secured its permits and leases, completed surveying, and was approaching construction. It had been expected to begin delivering power by 2027.
“Those anticipated benefits are now jeopardized or deferred,” the judge wrote.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)A debate on racism, sexism, and in-context quotations erupted Tuesday over a bill that would make Charlie Kirk only the second person — after Ronald Reagan — to be comemmorated in Florida statute.
Republican Sen. Jonathan Martin would memorialize Kirk’s birthday, Oct. 14, as “Charlie Kirk Day of Remembrance.” It comes three months after Kirk, a 31-year-old podcaster and right-wing debater, was assassinated while speaking at Utah Valley University.
It would slate him alongside Reagan as the only two people to have a special observance day in Florida law. Unlike holidays, observance days don’t allow for time off from school or work, and are generally just a day of recognition for a figure or event.
“I think that anybody who saw the video of Charlie Kirk getting — at his last speech, his last rally … ” Martin said before the Senate Governmental Oversight and Accountability Committee, appearing to get choked up as he took a lengthy pause and cleared his throat. “… Would agree that it’s important to remember somebody who lived a peaceful life.”
He continued, “I think that Ronald Reagan would be 100% OK with a Charlie Kirk Remembrance Day in the state of Florida.”
Following Kirk’s assassination on Sep. 10, Vice President J.D. Vance canceled his 9/11 memorial visit to fly out west. A week later, President Donald Trump and top Cabinet members spoke at his memorial service, held at the State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.
The political ramifications were massive. Teachers nationwide were suspended or fired for either applauding Kirk’s death or publicly claiming he was hateful. Some in the Trump administration, along with all of the Florida Cabinet, supported visa revocations for visa holders celebrating his death.
In Florida, pro-Kirk bills flooded in. Aside from Martin’s legislation, Rep. Kevin Steele — a candidate for chief financial officer — is sponsoring a measure to rename a road at every state university after Kirk. Sen. Ana Maria Rodriguez and Rep. Juan Porras have proposed a “Charlie Kirk Memorial Avenue” in Miami-Dade County. And Rep. Yvette Benarroch is carrying an identical form of Martin’s bill in the House.
‘Does not deserve the honor’
Although Martin emphasized that his bill was designed to signal to Floridians that political violence is wrong, Democrats raised serious concerns about some of Kirk’s comments — which Martin claimed were “spliced” and out-of-context.
They included quotes deriding Michelle Obama, Joy Reid, Sheila Jackson Lee, and Ketanji Brown Jackson as lacking “the brain processing power” to be taken seriously; claiming “prowling Blacks” target white Americans; questioning whether certain Black people received a job because of affirmative action; asking Taylor Swift to “submit” to Travis Kelce; and suggesting some gun deaths might be worth it to keep the Second Amendment “to protect our other God-given rights.”
“If you have to go through such mental and verbal gymnastics to explain away what this man said, how does he deserve a day of remembrance?” Sen. Tina Polsky asked.
“He was a provocateur. He was a podcaster. He did go on these college campuses, and it’s great that he was debating with people — that’s what we do all the time, that’s fine. But he’s still responsible for his own statements, no matter how you try to justify it,” she continued. “He does not deserve this honor.”
The bill passed along party lines, and will advance to the Education Postsecondary Committee.
“I went back and watched the debates,” Martin said. “If you look at the context, there’s not a single thing that he said that would disgust any reasonable American. … I don’t arrive at the same conclusion that those in the media that were trying to attack Charlie arrived at.”",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/charliekirk-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-09 12:58:03.202887

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)A group pushing new congressional boundaries in the Hoosier state has created Fair Maps Indiana Action to engage in state legislative races. 
The independent, expenditure-only political action committee will boost members of the Indiana General Assembly who support new maps intended to maintain a Republican majority in the U.S. House. The entity will also target members who vote against redistricting by recruiting primary challengers and coordinating with other aligned groups.
A news release said the super PAC is planning to spend seven figures in key Indiana Senate and House districts in the 2026 primary elections.
It is an affiliate of Fair Maps Indiana, Inc., a project of the 501(c)(4) Defending America’s Comeback.


The Indiana House last week passed a new map that would give Republicans all nine congressional districts. The Senate moved it out of committee Monday, but it is unclear if there are enough votes to pass the full Senate chamber.
President Donald Trump has pushed GOP-led states to maximize their advantage by redistricting mid-cycle. Districts are usually drawn after the decennial census, which was last done in 2021. Trump and Vice President JD Vance, who visited Indiana twice to speak to Indiana Republicans, have specifically called out key Hoosier GOP leaders.
“The Indiana House came through and supported President Trump. The Senate needs to do the same,” the organization said in the news release. “For those that vote yes, we will be there to support their campaigns. For those that vote no, we will ensure that they will have a quality, well-funded opponent and those members are defeated in May.”
Indiana natives Marty Obst and Carlin Yoder will serve as chairman and treasurer of Fair Maps Indiana Action. Yoder served as Indiana chairman for the Trump-Vance 2024 campaign and is a former state senator.
Other team members include Chris LaCavita, Chip Englander, and John Brabender — all part of affiliate Fair Maps Indiana, Inc. That group has spent over $250,000 engaging with voters to promote Indiana redistricting, according to the news release. 
Super PACs make “independent” expenditures for communications expressly advocating the success or defeat of clearly identified candidates. But they can’t legally give directly to candidates or coordinate with a candidate campaign.

Richard Blumenthal joined nurses and labor leaders on Monday at the state Capitol in Hartford to assail a proposal by the Trump administration that could reduce the dollar amount nursing students and others can borrow for graduate degrees. 
“There are already enough roadblocks to becoming a nurse — financially, emotionally and academically,” Keisha Gartman, a registered nurse who started her nursing career 16 years ago as a certified nursing assistant, said during the press conference. “Yet instead of removing barriers, the government is adding new ones.”
The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, also referred to as H.R. 1, eliminates a program that allowed borrowers to take out federal student loans for graduate programs up to the full cost of tuition. Beginning in July 2026, there will be caps on federal borrowing for graduate degrees, with higher caps for “professional” degrees and lower caps for all others. 
The legislation charges the federal Department of Education with determining which types of degrees fall into each category.  A “consensus definition” released earlier this year by a panel convened by the Trump administration designated 11 programs, including law, medicine and dentistry as “professional.” 
Degrees in nursing — as well as physical therapy, public health and social work — were excluded, meaning they would be subject to the lower borrowing limit. 
Effective July 2026, students pursuing professional degrees can borrow up to $50,000 annually, or $200,000 total. Those pursuing graduate degrees not designated as “professional” will have a stricter limit: $20,500 annually, or $100,000 total. 
Gartman and several other nurses at the press conference said they would not have been able to get the education they have if the policy been in place when they were in school. 
Ellen Keast, press secretary for higher education at the U.S. Department of Education, said the policy is intended to curb the ballooning cost of graduate degrees.
“While still in development, the Trump Administration is implementing long-needed loan limits on graduate loans to drive down the cost of programs, and under the new limits,” stated Keast in emailed comments. “We expect that institutions charging tuition rates well above market prices will consider lowering tuition thanks to these historic reforms.”
The department has yet to issue a proposed or final rule regarding which degrees qualify for the higher borrowing caps. Early next year, the Department will issue a notice of proposed rulemaking, which will initiate a 30-day public comment period. 
A graduate degree isn’t required for nursing. While roughly 17% of registered nurses hold a master’s degree or higher, the vast majority do not. And, according to a fact sheet about the new policy released by the Department of Education, “95% of nursing students borrow below the annual loan limit and therefore are not affected by the new caps.”
But the nurses at Monday’s press conference said certain roles in the industry — like becoming a nurse practitioner, as well as training, education or policy positions — require a master’s degree.  
Linda Wagner, executive director at the University of Bridgeport’s School of Nursing, said graduate-educated nurses play critical roles as providers and teachers.
“We see every day master’s-prepared nurses who serve as faculty, as well as advanced practice registered nurses who are the providers families know best,” Wagner said  in emailed comments. “When borrowing is restricted, it becomes harder for talented students to complete the training required for these essential nursing roles.”
Critics of the Trump proposal, including Blumenthal, say it restricts opportunities in the midst of a national nursing shortage. 
“Here is the definition of stupid: At a time when you have a shortage of nurses, put unrealistic, cruel, dumb caps on student loans for nurses,” Blumenthal said. “That’s what not to do. But that is exactly what the great, big, beautiful bill of Donald Trump is doing.”
Connecticut needs roughly 3,000 new registered nurses a year to make up for retirements — without factoring in nurses who leave the profession for other reasons, like burn out, according to a Governor’s Workforce Council Strategic Plan published in 2020. At the time, the state’s nursing programs were only producing 1,900 graduates a year. 
During comments on the House floor last week, Rep. Joe Courtney decried the policy, calling it “out of touch,” “offensive” and “an insult to the people who go through extensive training, testing, and certification before they are, again, allowed to practice their profession, the caring profession.”
In the fact sheet released by the Department of Education, the Trump administration rejected the critique that the proposal fails to recognize the important work that nurses do.
“The definition of a ‘professional degree’ is an internal definition used by the Department to distinguish among programs that qualify for higher loan limits, not a value judgement about the importance of programs. It has no bearing on whether a program is professional in nature or not.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/NURSING-PROFESSIONAL-DEGREE-1209-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-09 12:58:03.202887

The article is part of Mississippi Today Ideas’ ongoing effort to publish thoughtful guest essays.

I grew up in Greenville, in the heart of the Mississippi Delta, where family and community are everything.
Access to care was often determined by distance and circumstance. I watched some of my neighbors, friends and family go without the health services they needed because they could not afford them or because those services were never close enough to reach.
I saw how that lack of access held people back from living fully and reaching their potential. Those early experiences are why this work is deeply personal to me.
Across the Deep South, reproductive and sexual health care remains under constant threat. What happens here often sets the tone for the rest of the country. In Mississippi, our communities have carried that weight for generations, working against systems that make something as basic as care feel out of reach.
Still, we continue to move forward, creating new possibilities for what access can look like because our people deserve more than what history has offered us.

Opening a reproductive health clinic inside the Jackson Medical Mall felt intentional. The mall, once a neglected shopping center in a Black neighborhood, was brought back to life through Dr. Aaron Shirley’s vision of turning a forgotten space into one that could serve people again. The Jackson Medical Mall is part of the continuing legacy of expanding health care access in Mississippi by Dr. Shirley, who died in 2014.
That transformation reminds us that health care belongs in the heart of the community. Our clinic continues that commitment by creating a place where people can receive high-quality care close to home.
When we put out the call to Jackson residents, they made it clear that access also means choice. They wanted the same trusted, patient-centered care available through telehealth, but in a place they could walk into and experience in person.
That honesty from the community shaped what came next. In our new clinic inside the Jackson Medical Mall, we have created a space built in direct response to what people told us they needed most, care that feels personal, close and consistent. 
Patients will find both free and low-cost services that include wellness exams, testing and treatment for STIs, contraceptive counseling, pregnancy testing and preconception care.
We also offer resources such as the over-the-counter contraception Opill, prenatal vitamins and a community wellness pantry that will rotate based on local needs. Patients can also receive one-on-one support with scheduling appointments, enrolling in insurance programs like Mississippi’s Medicaid Family Planning Waiver, and connecting to other reproductive wellness resources.
This work honors the people and communities that raised me and reflects a continued commitment to the belief that everyone deserves access to care that is respectful, compassionate and rooted in trust.
I have witnessed the beauty of the people in Jackson and the power of what community can build together.
The opening of GetPersonal by Converge represents more than a new clinic.
It is a reflection of what can happen when care is shaped by the people it is meant to serve and grounded in the belief that every Mississippian deserves the best of what health care can be.

Tom Perriello announced Tuesday that he will seek the Democratic nomination to challenge Republican U.S. Rep. John McGuire in 2026. (Photo courtesy of campaign) Former Congressman Tom Perriello is jumping back into Virginia politics, announcing Wednesday that he will seek the Democratic nomination in Virginia’s 5th Congressional District — setting up a serious challenge to U.S. Rep. John McGuire, the Republican incumbent, in a district long viewed as safely red.
Perriello rolled out his campaign in a video posted on X, arguing the district is facing a “crisis of leadership” and accusing McGuire of failing to stand up for constituents during a period of rising costs and political volatility. He framed his run as a fight for working families.
“People are angry and confused, and they have a right to be. Families can’t afford groceries because Republicans in Congress, like John McGuire, won’t stand up to (President Donald) Trump’s tariffs.”
He criticized “tax cuts for huge corporations” and said Washington politicians have ignored the district’s economic pressures, pointing to rural hospital closures, food prices and rising unemployment. 
Perriello added that when the federal government “turns our region’s largest employer, the University of Virginia, into a political punching bag, our congressman was nowhere to be seen.”
McGuire did not immediately respond to text messages seeking comment. 
But Rick Buchanan, the chairman of the district’s GOP committee, said in a phone interview Tuesday that due to the current political climate and the results of the November elections, “it’s going to be an uphill battle for John.”
Perriello, 51, represented the 5th District from 2009 to 2011 after narrowly defeating longtime Republican U.S. Rep. Virgil Goode by just 727 votes out of more than 317,000 cast. 
At the time, the district covered much of Southside Virginia and extended north to Charlottesville. Perriello lost his seat in 2010 to Republican state Sen. Robert Hurt.
Before and after his brief congressional tenure, Perriello carved out a career in diplomacy and advocacy. 
He led U.S. Programs at the Open Society Foundations for more than four years and held two senior U.S. State Department roles in the administration of then-President Barack Obama. 
From 2015 to 2016, he served as the U.S. Special Envoy for the Great Lakes Region of Africa and the Democratic Republic of Congo. He ran for governor in 2017, losing the Democratic primary to Ralph Northam.
Most recently, Perriello served as U.S. Special Envoy for Sudan beginning in February 2024, overseeing diplomatic efforts aimed at halting civil conflict, supporting civilian leadership and responding to famine and mass displacement. He resigned Jan. 18, shortly before Trump’s second inauguration.
In announcing his return to electoral politics, Perriello leaned on his previous work in economic development and health-care reform. 
“When you elected me to Congress, I listened,” he said. “I fought to bring down the cost of health care, to expand rural internet access, and to bring good paying jobs into our region, including clean energy jobs.”
He also tied his campaign to a broader argument about political extremism and democratic stability. 
“I fought to protect civil rights, public education, and reproductive freedom, and I’ve stood up to corruption, hate, and authoritarianism at home and abroad,” he said, adding, “I will always defend our communities and our Constitution.”
The 5th District, which currently includes Charlottesville, Lynchburg, and a wide sweep of rural counties stretching to the Richmond suburbs and the North Carolina line, has been reliably Republican for more than a decade. Republicans have held a consistent advantage under the congressional map implemented by court-appointed special masters in 2021.
But the political landscape could shift with Virginia Democrats advancing a constitutional amendment that would allow the General Assembly — rather than the current bipartisan redistricting commission — to draw future congressional and legislative maps mid-decade. 
If passed again in 2026 and if approved by voters, the amendment would give lawmakers authority to craft boundaries more favorable to their party. Democrats have made no secret of their goals, intending to use a new map to strengthen their hold on competitive regions and potentially create a 10-1 Democratic-leaning congressional map if political conditions allow.
David Richards, a political science professor at the University of Lynchburg, said Perriello’s decision to run suggests Democrats see an opening. 
“I see Tom Perriello’s entry into this race as a sign that there is blood in the water,” Richards said, arguing that McGuire heads into 2026 in a more precarious position than many assume.
He pointed to several factors, including the district’s partisan makeup and shifting political winds. 
“The 5th District is the least Republican of the western House districts,” he said, noting that McGuire’s 2024 win was aided by Trump performing better in Virginia than he did four years earlier. Richards said that if Democrats experience “a large swing,” similar to the shift seen in Tennessee’s recent special elections, McGuire “might lose.”
He also noted that McGuire could face a primary challenge from former U.S. Rep. Bob Good, who has not ruled out attempting to reclaim his old seat. 
“If Good and McGuire duke it out, it could weaken the GOP enough that, coupled with a blue wave and Perriello being a known quantity in the district, it might give Democrats a win,” he said.
But Richards cautioned that the race remains fluid, with Democrats pushing the constitutional amendment that could reshape the political map, “which could upset any of these races,” he said. 
If Democrats succeed in creating what he called “some sort of ‘super district’ in Western Virginia,” he said Republican incumbents John McGuire, Ben Cline and Morgan Griffith could be forced into the same district. In that scenario, Perriello “sets himself up for one of the new, more Democratic leaning districts around Albemarle County or in Southside that might be created.”
“Either way,” Richards said, “Perriello is positioning himself to be a threat in 2026.”
For now, Perriello enters a race where Democrats remain underdogs. 
McGuire, a former Navy SEAL and state legislator from Goochland County, won the seat last cycle after defeating Good in a contentious Republican primary. The district supported Trump by wide margins in both 2016 and 2020, and GOP turnout remained strong in 2024.
But Perriello, who has kept ties in progressive organizing circles and foreign-policy networks, believes he can rekindle the coalition that propelled his 2008 upset. 
In his announcement, he framed his run as a grassroots effort focused on economic fairness and political accountability.
“Together, we’re going to fight for this district, we’re going to win back this seat, and we’re gonna bring the people’s voice back to Congress,” he said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-09 16:21:12+00:00,CT Mirror,Federal judge throws out Trump order blocking wind energy development,Associated Press and John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/09/judge-throw-out-trump-order-blocking-wind-projects/,Judge said the effort to halt virtually all leasing of wind farms on federal lands and waters was 'arbitrary and capricious' and violates US law.,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge on Monday struck down President Donald Trump’s executive order blocking wind energy projects, saying the effort to halt virtually all leasing of wind farms on federal lands and waters was “arbitrary and capricious” and violates U.S. law.
Judge Patti Saris of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts vacated Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order blocking wind energy projects and declared it unlawful.
Saris ruled in favor of a coalition of state attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, that challenged Trump’s Day One order that paused leasing and permitting for wind energy projects.
Trump has been hostile to renewable energy, particularly offshore wind, and prioritizes fossil fuels to produce electricity.
The ruling comes on the heels of another court battle over the fate of Revolution Wind, the 704-megawatt offshore wind farm being launched from the State Pier in New London.
The Trump administration ordered a halt to construction on the project in August, at which point work was already 80% complete.
The project’s developers sued along with Connecticut Attorney General William Tong and his counterpart in Rhode Island. The developers’ lawsuit succeeded in lifting the stop work order, while Tong’s lawsuit remains pending.
In a statement Tuesday, in response to the court ruling on the president’s wind moratorium, Tong said, “Trump’s erratic attacks on wind energy and his bizarre rants about windmills never made any sense.”
The attorney general added, “[Trump] was going to jack up energy costs for American families and businesses, further our reliance on fossil fuels and foreign oil, and throw workers off good jobs. We sued, we won, and I’m going to keep fighting to protect Connecticut’s ability to secure our own energy future that makes sense for our costs and climate.”
New York Attorney General James said she was grateful the court stepped in “to block the administration’s reckless and unlawful crusade against clean energy.”
“As New Yorkers face rising energy costs, we need more energy sources, not fewer,” James said. “Wind energy is good for our environment, our economy, and our communities.”
White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said Monday night that offshore wind projects were given unfair, preferential treatment during the Biden administration while the rest of the energy industry was hindered by burdensome regulations.
“President Trump has ended Joe Biden’s war on American energy and unleashed America’s energy dominance to protect our economic and national security,” Rogers said in a statement to The Associated Press.
The coalition that opposed Trump’s order argued that Trump doesn’t have the authority to halt project permitting, and that doing so jeopardizes the states’ economies, energy mix, public health and climate goals.
The coalition includes Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington state and Washington, D.C. They say they’ve invested hundreds of millions of dollars collectively to develop wind energy and even more on upgrading transmission lines to bring wind energy to the electrical grid.
The government argued that the states’ claims amount to nothing more than a policy disagreement over preferences for wind versus fossil fuel energy development that is outside the federal court’s jurisdiction. Justice Department lawyer Michael Robertson said in court that the wind order paused permitting, but didn’t halt it, while Interior Secretary Doug Burgum reviews the environmental impact of wind projects.
The executive order said there were “alleged legal deficiencies underlying the federal government’s leasing and permitting” of wind projects under the Biden administration.
A previous judge in the case allowed it to proceed against Burgum, but dismissed an action against Trump and other Cabinet secretaries. Judge William Young allowed the states to proceed with claims that blocking permits for wind energy projects violates the Administrative Procedure Act, which outlines a detailed process for enacting regulations, but not the Constitution.
Wind is the United States’ largest source of renewable energy, providing about 10% of the electricity generated in the nation, according to the American Clean Power Association.
Marguerite Wells, executive director of the Alliance for Clean Energy New York, said wind energy is a key component of powering the nation’s electric grid.
Wind “is currently one of the most cost-effective ways to generate power and is being used successfully not only in the United States, but across the world,” she said. “With this ruling behind us, projects can now be judged on their merits. We thank the attorneys general who helped us get this case over the finish line.”
Kit Kennedy of the Natural Resources Defense Council called the decision a win for consumers, union workers, U.S. businesses, clean air and the climate.
“From the beginning of its time in office, the Trump administration put a halt to the wind energy projects that are needed to keep utility bills in check and the grid reliable,” Kennedy said.
The wind order “has been a devastating blow to workers, electricity customers, and the reliability of the power grid,” she said, adding that the Trump administration “should use this (ruling) as a wake-up call, stop its illegal actions and get out of the way of the expansion of renewable energy.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AP25125499978507-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-09 11:58:20.327181

Dec. 12, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The State of Nebraska has charged State Sen. Dan McKeon of Amherst with “disturbing the peace,” a slight downgrade in criminal allegation from the public indecency citation he received in October.
Court documents filed late Monday show the freshman senator now faces a Class III misdemeanor charge, with McKeon’s arraignment scheduled Wednesday in Lancaster County Court.

McKeon’s attorney Perry Pirsch said McKeon will likely plead no contest, which would allow him to accept any coming penalties without admitting guilt, and would waive his right to a trial.
The Nebraska State Patrol cited McKeon for misdemeanor public indecency in late October after investigating an allegation by a legislative staffer attending an end-of-session party this spring in Lincoln.
The Patrol received a report in early September that McKeon allegedly “made inappropriate contact with her buttocks with his hand, over the top of her clothing,” Patrol spokesman Cody Thomas said at the time.
Public indecency is a Class II misdemeanor in Nebraska, and comes with a maximum sentence of six months behind bars, a $1000 fine, or both. Disturbing the peace comes with a maximum sentence of three months imprisoned, a $500 fine or both.
Lancaster County Attorney Pat Condon, who determined the charges, based the change on information from the Patrol investigation and Nebraska statutes, and said disturbing the peace was the most appropriate charge. He said he could not elaborate further on his reasoning.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Pirsch called the updated charge “a victory” that better aligns with McKeon’s perspective of the incident.
“This is consistent with his testimony (that) he only told a bad pun and patted her on the back,” Pirsch said in an email. “There was nothing sexually charged about it or even based on gender.”
However, McKeon still faces a possible civil lawsuit from the staffer in question.
Kathleen Neary, the attorney representing the woman making the allegations, said Tuesday that her client is “proceeding with the administrative filings as required by law” in regards to her civil action.
“As for the criminal charges against Senator McKeon, I defer to the county attorney,” Neary said in an email. “It will be interesting to see how Senator McKeon’s ever-evolving story will continue to change if he testifies under oath during his criminal trial.”
Nebraska lawmakers delay further action on colleague’s groping allegations

The Examiner is aware of the alleged victim’s name but is not publishing it because it is the policy of States Newsroom and the Examiner not to identify people who say they have been abused unless they wish to talk publicly.
The Nebraska Legislature is also in the midst of a separate internal investigation into the allegations against McKeon. The Executive Board, which is in charge of handling disciplinary procedures within the Legislature, met Monday to discuss the situation, but delayed voting until they had all voting members present. The Executive Board plans to meet on the matter again as early as Saturday.
State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, who chairs the group, said the board already decided in October to move McKeon’s former first-floor office, exchanging it with another first-floor office previously occupied by State Sen. Tanya Storer of Whitman.
McKeon is a registered Republican who was elected to the officially nonpartisan Legislature in 2024, replacing former State Sen. Fred Meyer of St. Paul. McKeon’s biographical page on the Legislature’s website highlights that he has been married for 30 years and has four children.
Since news broke about McKeon’s citation, state officials — including Gov. Jim Pillen — have called for McKeon’s resignation, but McKeon has said he will not resign. Pirsch said Monday that filing a no contest waiver would help McKeon “put the matter behind him and to focus on the upcoming legislative session.”

Shared on social media on Nov. 18, Slotkin appeared alongside Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Reps.

On Saturday, the Detroit News reported that the first-term senator had formed a legal defense fund, with Slotkin spokesperson Sonja Thrasher telling the News the fund had been created with approval from the bipartisan U.S. Senate Ethics Committee.
“Since President Trump called for Senator Slotkin to be arrested, tried, and hanged on November 20th, he has attempted to weaponize federal law enforcement and America’s legal system against her, reportedly over the objections of career FBI personnel,” Thrasher told the News.

(Photo by Glen Stubbe/Minnesota Reformer)Nearly half of Minnesota food shelf shoppers face barriers to accessing free food sites, including a lack of transportation, poor food selection and limits on how often they can visit, according to a survey released this month.
The survey, conducted by the The Foundation for Essential Needs and University of Minnesota Extension, is based on responses from nearly 10,000 Minnesotans surveyed at 308 food shelves earlier this year.
Almost half of the responding households have children and more than a third include seniors. Nearly one-third of food shelf shoppers surveyed said it was their first visit or they had just started using the food shelf in the past six months.
Asked what the most important experiences are when visiting a food shelf, 70% of shoppers listed feeling welcomed by staff or volunteers. The other most common responses were reasonable wait times, fresh and appealing food selections and a variety of foods available.
Food shelves, for the most part, seem to fulfill these wants — around 80% of respondents said they’re often able to choose their own food, and 94% said that they often feel welcomed by staff.


Other findings: 72% of respondents said they choose between food and other expenses like housing and medical costs; 52% said they have special dietary needs from chronic conditions; and 10% got all their food in the last 6 months from food shelves.
“Just like any of us, food shelf shoppers want fresh, nourishing food — and for the more than half who are juggling dietary restrictions, that need is even more urgent,” said Kate Burggraff, the executive director of FFEN, in a release.
Among foods that shoppers want at each visit, eggs and cooking basics like oil and spices were hardest to come by — only around 40% said they could always find eggs and cooking basics at the food shelf they were surveyed at.
The Food Group previously estimated that Minnesotans made nearly 9 million visits to food shelves in 2024, including 3.2 million visits by children.

(Wes Muller/LA Illuminator, Nov. 17, 2020)Former U.S. Rep. Cedric Richmond, D-New Orleans, said he turned down an offer to be the interim president of the Southern University System. 
Richmond said in an interview Monday at the State Capitol that while he was interested in the position, the timing wasn’t right because he is scheduled to undergo shoulder surgery next week. Richmond said he decided over the weekend he would not accept the position. 
The Southern University System Board of Supervisors was scheduled to name an interim president Nov. 28 but did not due to what board chairman Tony Clayton described as a computer error with the agenda. Clayton said an interim would be decided at the board’s Dec. 19 meeting. 
Clayton has not yet responded to a request for comment for this report. 
Current Southern President Dennis Shields, who has been in the position since 2022, said last month he will leave his position before his contract expires in 2029 because the board wanted to go in a different direction. A search committee to select Shields’ replacement will be formed early next year. 
Richmond resigned from his congressional seat in 2021 to become a senior adviser to President Joe Biden and later held a similar role with the Democratic National Committee. 
Richmond said he still remains committed to Southern. His mother, Maple Gaines, is on the university’s board of supervisors, and his family has a $600,000 endowment at Southern in the name of his mother and late father, Sidney Richmond Jr.. Cedric Richmond said he intends to increase that amount to $1 million to support scholarships for poor students from his parents’ hometowns. 
Richmond, who earned his bachelor’s degree from Morehouse College and a law degree at Tulane University, said he believed Southern should be among the elite historically Black colleges and universities and the best academic school in the Southwestern Athletic Conference. 
“I really think what Southern needs is a strong, independent president who can direct and lead the university, and also make sure that the roles between the board and the president are clear,” Richmond said.

(Louisiana State University)Research from an LSU professor and his students could make it cheaper and easier for small towns and rural communities to test for infectious diseases in their wastewater, potentially giving them the upper hand in public health efforts.
Aaron Bivins, a civil and environmental engineering assistant professor at LSU, used a 3-D printer to fashion what looks like a Wiffle Ball. It can be opened up, filled with a packet of activated charcoal pellets, screwed back together and then lowered on a string to sample wastewater.
The cost per ball: $4, which puts it within reach of municipalities that can’t afford the automatic samplers used in big-city sewerage systems. Those devices cost between $10,000 and $25,000 to buy and install, and they need a power source — not always easy to access in rural areas. 
“The resources in these communities are quite limited, so spending $20,000 on auto samplers is not really in the budget,” Bivins said. 
More than just an effort to see what pathogens exist, wastewater sampling can help scientists tell how diseases spread throughout human and animal populations. 
Bivins and his team spent three months using their devices to sample raw sewage coming into a small wastewater treatment plant for an undisclosed site in Louisiana. Their findings were recently published in the academic journal ScienceDirect.
The professor said the new technology could offer help fill the information void in areas where health care isn’t readily available or regularly used.
“When people get ill, they don’t always go to the doctor,” Bivins said. “From a public health perspective, this creates a lot of challenges in terms of knowing the true health status of a community.”
Historically, most wastewater sampling has focused on urban areas, leaving a gap in research for rural settings that public health resources often miss. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention runs a National Wastewater Surveillance System to monitor the spread of COVID-19, influenza and the common respiratory virus. The data gathered comes from roughly 140 million citizens, representing less than half of the U.S. population. 
“Who ends up being left out of that system are people living in … rural places who are served by small wastewater plants,” Bivins said. 
By making sampling tools more accessible, he said small municipalities and rural communities can gather more data, which means scientists would have more accurate information for their research. 
“The idea that we could deploy these very inexpensive samplers as a way of monitoring what types of antibiotic-resistant genes are present in our community is a really powerful one,” Bivins said.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Waterfilter-8-scaled-e1765296275395-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-12-09 11:58:20.327181

The count is one requirement for HUD Continuum of Care funding, which the agency in a recent notice threatened to drastically cut. (Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)Faced with increasing uncertainty over federal Housing and Urban Development’s homelessness-prevention funding, the leader of a state coalition said Monday she will ask the New Mexico Legislature to fill in a gap of roughly $12 million when lawmakers meet in January.
New Mexico Coalition to End Homelessness Director Monet Silva told Source New Mexico on Monday her organization needs state funds because funding through HUD’s Continuum of Care—the agency’s main anti-homelessness program—is increasingly precarious. 
The coalition organizes Continuum of Care applications from statewide nonprofit organizations that provide prevention and assistance services to the state’s growing unhoused population through services such as street outreach, emergency shelter and transitional housing, as well as permanent supportive housing for unhoused people with disabilities. The funds are divided between nonprofits in Albuquerque and the rest of the state.
The coalition organizes Continuum of Care applications from statewide nonprofit organizations that provide prevention and assistance services to the state’s growing unhoused population through services such as street outreach, emergency shelter, transitional and permanent housing.
Rural, unhoused people statewide cite deposit, application fees as greatest barrier to housing

Since the 1990s, the HUD program has typically allocated $14 million annually to New Mexico nonprofits tackling homelessness, according to the coalition’s website. In the most recent funding round, the state received $17 million, Monet said.
But on Nov. 13, HUD issued a sudden “Notice of Funding Opportunity” to New Mexico and other states that suggested it was seeking to slash Continuum of Care funding by roughly 70%. That would leave New Mexico’s homelessness nonprofits with between $5 million and $6 million, Silva said, and the only about six weeks to complete the application instead of the typical six months.
The announcement prompted two lawsuits, one in November from a group of state attorneys general and a more recent one on Dec. 1 from national anti-homelessness organizations. And then, on Monday, the New Mexico coalition alerted potential nonprofit recipients that HUD had removed the notice from its website without explanation. The coalition pointed to the lawsuits as the likely reason the notice no longer appears on the HUD website. 
While HUD removing the notice provided Silva and her team a “little moment to breathe” Monday, she said the coalition still expects a drastic reduction in funding it and others rely on to provide vital services to the unhoused.
Amid funding cut threats and homeless camp sweeps, a volunteer loses hope but keeps counting

Silva said she is meeting with state officials next week, including Workforce Solutions Department Secretary Sarita Nair, to discuss the state filling in the HUD gap during the legislative session beginning Jan. 20, along with the coalition’s other funding needs. 
“We’re going to continue to move forward with that ask from the Legislature, because we don’t know what’s going to happen,” she said. “And we can’t be in a spot if the Trump administration decides to pull [funding] willy-nilly.”
Without the Legislature providing some financial security, Silva stressed another abrupt HUD funding cut would have far-reaching consequences.

The political action committee behind the effort, People Not Politicians, called the campaign an “unprecedented show of grassroots power.”
The ball is now in Secretary of State Denny Hoskins’ court, as the first-term Republican must certify whether the signatures are valid. If so, the map is placed on hold until voters can decide its fate at the ballot box.
But several questions swirl around the signatures.
First, Hoskins has previously stated he won’t accept any signatures collected before Gov. Mike Kehoe signed the bill in October. That decision impacts around 92,000 signatures. Testifying in a Cole County courtroom on Monday in a lawsuit challenging Hoskins’ decision, the state’s director of elections said those signatures would be separated, scanned for preservation, but not distributed to county election officials for verification until Judge Chris Limbaugh rules on whether Hoskins must accept them. 
Second, a Trump-appointed federal judge threw out a lawsuit Monday that argued a referendum on redistricting was unconstitutional. In the ruling, the judge said state court was the proper venue if Hoskins believes the referendum violates the constitution. That could set the stage for yet another legal showdown over the power of voters to overturn the actions of the legislature. 
Federal judge rejects Missouri AG’s push to block referendum on gerrymandered map

Missouri has eight congressional districts, with six currently represented by Republicans. 
The 5th District, based in Kansas City and represented by Democratic U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver since 2005, is carved up under the new map with portions attached to the 4th and 6th Districts. Heavily Republican areas stretching along the Missouri River to Boone County would be added to the remaining Kansas City portions.
The intended result is a map where Republicans hold seven of the state’s eight seats. 
The day lawmakers passed the new map, People Not Politicians submitted paperwork with the secretary of state’s office for a referendum. Of the 27 times a referendum has been placed on the Missouri ballot, voters have rejected the General Assembly’s actions all but twice — including overturning a congressional map in 1922.
The last time a referendum campaign was deployed was in 2019, when the secretary of state’s office used procedural maneuvers to successfully derail a push to overturn newly-passed restrictions on abortion. The move sparked a lawsuit, and in 2022 the Missouri Supreme Court ruled the laws the secretary of state used to obstruct the citizen-initiated referendum process were unconstitutional.

Attorneys are asking for a timeout — arguing in federal court Monday that the public’s money shouldn’t be given to the Cleveland Browns, especially without telling Ohioans.
From a few dollars to nearly $300,000 for a Northeast Ohio animal shelter, unclaimed funds contain money left behind.
It’s money that attorney Jeff Crossman says belongs to its rightful owners — the people of Ohio.
“Taking someone’s property and giving it to somebody else, a private owner, for some other private use is unconstitutional,” Crossman said in an interview. “It’s a handout to the Cleveland Browns.”
This summer, the state lawmakers decided to give the Browns a $600 million performance grant for their new Brook Park stadium using unclaimed funds.
Ohio’s Division of Unclaimed Funds currently oversees about $4.9 billion in funds, including forgotten bank accounts, utility deposits, uncashed checks, and more.
To check for unclaimed funds, visit unclaimedfunds.ohio.gov.
Crossman asked U.S. District Court Judge Edmund Sargus, Jr. to prohibit the state from using the cash while the legal fight plays out.
“It’s kind of similar to an eminent domain situation,” Crossman said. “If they’re going to take your house, they’re supposed to send you notice and give you an opportunity to object. They’re not doing that.”
In testimony on Monday, Unclaimed Funds Finance Director Amy Schellhammer admitted that they have not provided any direct notice to Ohioans, nor is it listed on their website, that $1.7-1.9 billion in unclaimed funds will be taken on Jan. 1, 2026.
Witnesses on each side debated the efficacy of the website, with one calling it the equivalent of a “local dog shelter’s” website.
There were thousands of entries that the expert witness analyzed that had addresses that were possibly outdated, non-existent zip codes, and frequently misspelled names.
The errors on the website were all due to people entering their information wrong to the banks or other holders of money, a witness for the defense said.
The state’s attorneys declined to do an interview, but previously, Senate President Rob McColley, R-Napoleon, argued that it’s constitutional and that press coverage has helped raise awareness for the unclaimed funds process.
“Kind of having this as a PSA ‘Hey, we have an unclaimed fund, go check, get your money out,'” McColley said in June.
Republicans argue that they are taking funds that have been unclaimed since before Jan. 1, 2016, and that this will help economic development.
“It’s not just a Browns deal,” Senate Finance Chair Jerry Cirino, R-Kirtland, said. “It is a setting aside of money from the unclaimed funds for other projects in the future, some that we don’t even know about at this point.”
That is exactly the problem, Crossman said.
“There are a lot of professional sports teams in Ohio, right here in Columbus, you have the Blue Jackets, you have the Bengals down the road, and there are minor league teams, and there are a lot of businesses that might have their hand out, too,” Crossman said.
This sets a terrible precedent, he said.
“I understand the legislature was trying to be creative, and they’re pounding their chest and saying, ‘Hey, we’re not raising taxes.’ Well, no, they’re not raising taxes, they’re just taking your property — and that’s worse.”
During the summary portion of the day-long hearing, the plaintiffs argued that the state was “money laundering,” and the judge needed to issue the preliminary injunction because the defendants were unlawfully taking money without notification.
Defense attorney Aneca Lasley, representing the state, argued that there was no merit to the case, the law doesn’t require notification, and the “passage” of H.B. 96 was enough notice.
The public “is required” to be aware of what the legislators are doing, she added.
Judge Sargus went back and forth with each side, but told Crossman and his team that they had a “hill” to climb to get the injunction.
The judge said he was to determine if the law was constitutional, and “not here to decide if it’s a good idea or not.”
He may have a ruling as soon as Tuesday on whether the preliminary injunction will be granted, he said.

Andrew Ireland filed a measure to impeach ""rogue"" prosecutors and judges. He is pictured at a rally at the Indiana Statehouse on Friday, Dec. 5, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana prosecutors hope to fend off a proposed constitutional amendment they say could politicize prosecutorial decision-making — and, on Tuesday, released their own suggested legislative fixes.
“When we’re in a big room together, to be honest, I’m not sure who I’m sitting next to, a Republican or Democratic prosecutor,” Wabash County Prosecutor Bill Hartley said.

“Candidly, we don’t care, because at the end of the day, we all have the same goal, and that’s public safety,” said Hartley, who is the president of the Indiana Prosecuting Attorneys Council’s board of directors.
The 10-member board of prosecutors governs IPAC, a judicial branch agency that supports Indiana’s 91 elected prosecuting attorneys, as well as their chief deputies.
The agency is mobilizing against a disciplinary proposal filed last week by freshman Rep. Andrew Ireland, R-Indianapolis.
“I just filed my Constitutional amendment to let Indiana IMPEACH rogue judges and prosecutors who refuse to hold violent criminals accountable,” Ireland posted to X.
IPAC’s leaders “stand in complete agreement that we’re opposed to” the measure, according to Hartley.
Leaders believe Ireland’s rhetoric is “oversimplifying” the complex criminal justice system, Hartley said. “These are systematic issues that mislead the public.”
“We don’t have a rogue prosecutor issue in Indiana,” he added. “We feel like this is something that Andrew Ireland is using that term for political points and to get hits on his social media sites.”
Ireland accused prosecutors of trying to sidestep accountability in a Tuesday statement on X.
“It’s telling that the Association of Indiana Prosecuting Attorneys’ top priority today isn’t violent crime or public safety — it’s protecting their own from accountability,” he said.
“The Association believe their members should continue to enjoy a special carve-out from accountability. I don’t buy that for a second, and I don’t think Hoosiers do either,” the statement read. “Hundreds of thousands of Americans have celebrated this proposal online, and Elon Musk put it plainly: This ‘(h)as to be done nationwide.’ When people across the country are saying the same thing, maybe the problem isn’t my amendment, maybe it’s the culture of zero accountability.”
Constitutional changes coming?
IPAC leaders pointed to an existing provision in the state Constitution that allows prosecutors and circuit court judges convicted of “corruption or other high crime” to be removed from office. The document says the Indiana Supreme Court can force them out, or it can be done “in such other manner as may be prescribed by law.”
It’s unclear how often officeholders are removed under that provision.
Elkhart County Prosecutor Vicki Becker said ethics rules add another layer of accountability for prosecutors and judges.
“What we’ve seen recently is that when a prosecutor has done something where they have violated the oath of office, they step down from an ethical perspective, rather than having to be forced out by an impeachment,” said Becker, who is IPAC’s secretary and treasurer.
All are also up for election next year.

Ireland’s House Joint Resolution 1, however, would add prosecutors and circuit court judges to impeachment provisions.
One of those sections currently deals with state officers. Under his proposal, they could be removed from office for “crime, incapacity, or negligence” — through impeachment in the Indiana House, a trial in the Senate, or a joint resolution approved by both chambers.
They would also be added to a subsequent section specifying that state and local officers can be impeached, or removed from office, as “prescribed by law.”
“Right now, the Indiana Constitution holds the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Secretary of State, Auditor, and Treasurer to an impeachment standard from crime, incapacity or negligence,” Ireland said. “My proposed amendment (H.J.R. 1) simply says that state-funded Circuit Judges and Prosecuting Attorneys should be held to that exact same standard.”
IPAC leaders argued the proposal “undermines” prosecutors’ freedom to make their own decisions.
“When you have words like negligence floating around out there, it opens up so many opportunities for people who just politically disagree, or who have malice or they have some other agenda,” Becker said. “That then gives them a basis to distract prosecutors from doing their work and instead make it political.”
Madison County Prosecutor Rodney Cummings, another IPAC board member, said Ireland’s proposed changes are “not in the best interest of justice.”

“How is a prosecutor going to feel that he has the discretion to make a decision in an individual case when he’s looking over his shoulder …?” Cummings said. “… We have to have the freedom to make decisions that are in the best interest of the victims, the state and criminal defendants.”
“Rogue” prosecutor proposals have repeatedly been filed in recent years, but haven’t gone very far. Often cited as pretext is Marion County Prosecutor Ryan Mears.
“I’m not here to defend the Marion County prosecutor,” Cummings said. “We have very different political philosophies, but the reality is, he takes a lot of criticism for things he has no control over.”
Police, prosecutors and judges must work in concert — using the statutes lawmakers write — to maintain an effective criminal justice system, the IPAC leaders said.
Cummings gave an example of two drivers — one in Marion County and the other in Madison County — who each killed multiple people in police chase crashes weeks apart in 2023. Both were sentenced this year.
In the Indianapolis case, Mears asked for 25 years in prison, but a judge sentenced the driver to two years behind bars and seven of home detention. In the Anderson case, the driver was sentenced to 35 years.
Agency readies own fixes
IPAC on Tuesday released an alternative legislative agenda to “address violent crime and frequent felons.”
The platform includes mandatory minimum executed sentences for certain violent offenses or repeat offenders.
Becker noted Indiana Code contains a “very small” list of offenses with non-suspendable sentences and said it should be expanded.
Judges “can actually impose even a home detention … to satisfy that non-suspendable part,” she added. “That’s why this statutory framework is so important, because judges can find ways to, I suppose, find those loopholes. And that’s not what our communities want.”

Cummings also argued good time credits for prison sentences have gone too far, with offenders getting “massive time cuts for things that have nothing to do with” rehabilitation.
Another goal is the expansion of “preventative” detention, when people accused of crimes are incarcerated before trial in an effort to avert future criminal acts.
“It’s almost like the criminal justice system has to be reactive because we haven’t been given the tools to be proactive,” Becker said.
Money is additionally a top priority.
About 83% of prosecutors’ offices are understaffed, according to Hartley, even as the number of criminal case filings trends higher. IPAC leaders said poorer and more rural counties particularly struggle to pay wages competitive enough to draw in prosecutorial staff.
Lawmakers put an appropriation into a prosecutor bill last session, but nixed it later after a dismal revenue forecast.
“Is it going to cost money? Yes, it is. The question is … What’s it worth to you?” Becker said. ” … This is what our taxpayer dollars are supposed to go for, is public safety.”
“It’s symbolism over substance all day long, and it’s just not getting the job done,” she added.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)The state of Alaska has settled lawsuits against Juul and Altria, two nicotine vapor manufacturers, for a combined $7.8 million, the state Department of Law said on Friday.
The suits were part of a nationwide pattern: Alaska and other U.S. states had alleged that the companies deliberately targeted children with advertising, something that likely contributed to a surge in nicotine use among children and young adults.
Altria settled Alaska’s lawsuit for $2 million last year, and the state announced a $5.8 million consent judgment with Juul on Friday.
Under the settlements, neither Juul nor Altria must admit fault, but both must abide by marketing restrictions. One key point in the settlement: Juul can’t use cartoons to advertise its products.
“This case took five years and a great deal of work from our public health and consumer
protection teams, but it was worth it,” said Alaska Attorney General Stephen Cox, in a prepared statement.
“We now have strong court-enforceable limits on how these companies can operate in
Alaska, and we’ve obtained a per-capita recovery that ranks near the top nationally, with
those dollars going straight into prevention and consumer protection.” 
Alaska was one of the last states in the country to settle with Juul, which has already paid more than $1 billion to states across the country.
Some states have since filed additional lawsuits against vape distributors, alleging that they contributed to a surge in nicotine vapor use among children and young adults.
Money from Alaska’s Juul settlement is to be paid over the next five years.
Under the financial terms of the consent judgment, half of the proceeds would be used to fund tobacco control and prevention programs, and the other half would go to the Department of Law’s consumer protection program.
Typically, the spending of money earned in financial judgments must be approved by the Alaska Legislature before becoming official.
“The use of vapes and other nicotine products among youth in Alaska remains a concern,” said Alaska Department of Health Commissioner Heidi Hedberg in a prepared statement. “This funding will help families and communities continue to access education, prevention, and cessation programs.”

(Photo via U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement)A midcoast city has restricted local assistance with federal immigration enforcement.
In a 4-1 vote Tuesday night, the Rockland City Council passed a measure to amend the city code to prohibit city employees and departments from assisting or cooperating with, or allow any municipal money or resources to be used for, any federal agency in any immigration enforcement operation, except where legally required to do so by state or federal law or court order. 
That includes barring city employees from allowing federal immigration agencies access to a person being detained by, or in the custody of, the Rockland Police Department or transferring people into federal custody, unless presented with a valid and properly issued judicial warrant or as part of the department’s investigation of a serious crime, such as human or drug trafficking.
The ordinance also bans the city from sharing immigration statuses and other personal information about residents with immigration officials, which comes as President Donald Trump’s administration is seeking voter and other data for citizenship probes.
“Measures like this preserve local resources for local priorities, ensure Maine towns and cities are not complicit in or liable for federal abuses of power, and improve public safety by building trust between local law enforcement and the communities they are supposed to serve,” Michael Kebede, policy director for the the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine, said in a statement. 
The ACLU of Maine helped develop the ordinance and hopes its passage will encourage Gov. Janet Mills to allow a related bill to become state law. 
LD 1971 would prevent state and local law enforcement from detaining someone solely on the basis of a federal immigration-related request. The Maine Legislature passed the proposal in June, but Mills postponed her decision on the bill until lawmakers reconvene in January.

(Tero Vesalainen/Getty Images)A fight between President Donald Trump and Gov. Ron DeSantis has dominated Florida House Speaker Danny Perez’s planned “artificial intelligence week” in the Legislature, intended to explore the technology.
Although Perez, a Miami Republican, had planned for weeks to use Dec. 8-12 committee hearings to analyze the effects of AI in different Florida industries, the topic took on a national angle when Trump announced early Monday that he would sign an executive order creating a national rule preventing states from handing down their own regulations.
That put him in direct conflict with DeSantis, who’s long-railed against the dangers of AI and last week rolled out a proposal called the “Artificial Intelligence Bill of Rights.”
“There must be only One Rulebook if we are going to continue to lead in AI,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “I will be doing a ONE RULE Executive Order this week. You can’t expect a company to get 50 Approvals every time they want to do something.”
Hours later, DeSantis indirectly responded on X, asserting, “An executive order doesn’t/can’t preempt state legislative action. Congress could, theoretically, preempt states through legislation…I doubt Congress has the votes to pass this because it is so unpopular with the public.”
He referenced the U.S. House passing the “One Big Beautiful Bill” over the summer with a clause banning states from regulating AI for 10 years. The Senate voted 99-1 to strip that section out.
This is the latest — and most blatant — escalation in GOP politicos’ dispute over AI. DeSantis worries that unmonitored AI could usher in an age of “darkness and deceit” while Trump — allied with technology titans like Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg — has for months toyed with banning state-level AI regulations.
This fiscal year alone, massive companies like Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft are expected to invest more than $364 billion in the industry. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is pulling in roughly $13 billion in annual revenue while enjoying more than 800 million regular users.
And although the governor hopes lawmakers will crack down on AI data centers and “grooming” chatbots, and will protect consumer data from AI companies, a nationwide moratorium would severely limit the Legislature’s ability to do so.

From CalMatters homelessness reporter Marisa Kendall: 
Workers tasked with helping California’s largest homeless population are sounding an alarm, saying a recent upheaval at the Los Angeles County agency where they work has them scared for their livelihoods. 
In an open letter to the L.A. County Board of Supervisors, a handful of employees with the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority say threats of pending layoffs are affecting hundreds of county workers, and by extension, the thousands of homeless residents that they serve. 
The Homeless Services Authority is a joint city-county agency that oversees homeless services in L.A. County. After multiple critical audits, the county board of supervisors voted earlier this year to pull its funding from the joint authority and instead create a new county homelessness agency.
But as the county makes that transition, the employees doing the hard work of moving people off the streets and into housing worry they are getting left behind. Management has suggested there will be staff reductions, according to the employee letter. But workers don’t know who will get the chance to move to the new agency, and who won’t, Gilbert Youenes, a Homeless Services Authority employee, told CalMatters. Youenes evaluates homeless shelters in L.A. County to make sure they meet the county’s health and safety standards.

Youenes: “Some of us have been with LAHSA for decades. We have families. We have bills to pay. And we’re not sure how this is going to unfold and affect our lives. There’s a real sense of fear.”

The Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority declined to comment on the letter. 
The employee letter also alleges that terminating Homeless Services Authority employees would violate the terms of Measure A — a half-cent sales tax that funds homeless housing and services in L.A. County, which voters approved last year. The measure includes a section, aimed at improving recruitment and retention of homeless services workers, which states that contracts funded through the tax must not displace public employees.

Feds backtrack on homelessness cuts

More from CalMatters’ Marisa:
President Donald Trump’s administration has reversed course, for now, on cuts that were expected to defund thousands of homeless housing units in California.
On Monday the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development withdrew a controversial funding notice that had made sweeping changes to federal homelessness policy. The notice had drastically cut how much funding local governments could spend on permanent housing — something prior administrations had prioritized as the solution to homelessness. Instead, the current administration focused on temporary shelters, particularly those that require sobriety. 
In two separate lawsuits, Gov. Gavin Newsom’s administration, Santa Clara County and San Francisco sued, accusing the federal housing department of illegally going over Congress’ head to make the changes.
In the court filing, federal lawyers said the administration withdrew the funding notice “in order to assess the issues raised by plaintiffs” and draft a new notice.



It’s dour out there

Most Californians believe the country is headed in the wrong direction, according to a new poll examining attitudes on Trump’s policies, California’s next governor and more.
On Monday the Public Policy Institute of California published its latest survey, which polled 1,676 adult Californians from Nov. 13-19. It found that 29% of likely voters approve of Trump’s job performance, with 4% of Democrats, 79% of Republicans and 21% of independent voters approving.
Seven in 10 also thought that Congress should have extended tax credits for Affordable Care Act enrollees, which were not included in the latest federal budget bill, and were at the center of the government shutdown that ended on Nov. 12.
Regarding the state’s gubernatorial election next year, more than half (56%) of likely voters approve of Newsom and 45% say they want his successor to continue his policies. Former Rep. Katie Porter is the leading candidate in the survey, though 40% aren’t satisfied with any of the candidates. 
The general outlook on the state and the country is also grim: 74% of likely voters believe the country is heading in the wrong direction, and the same percentage of people believe the U.S. will enter a depression by 2030. As the top issues cited since 2023, 36% of participants say the cost of living and the economy remain the chief problems for the state.

Liberty Utilities, which services a small southeastern pocket of Massachusetts, filed its rate hike request in June and is asking the Department of Public Utilities for permission to raise gas rates by about 55 percent on average. DPU now has until May 31 to make a decision.  
The company delivers gas for heating and cooking to customers in Fall River, the tenth-largest city in Massachusetts with a median household income less than half of the statewide average, along with eight surrounding towns like North Attleboro and Westport. 
“No matter how you slice it, for my district, this is exorbitant,” said Rep. Carole Fiola, a Democrat who represents Fall River. “This was a shock to a lot of people. It will be very difficult for many people to afford this increase.” 
It’s also a direct shot at Gov. Maura Healey’s affordability push. 
Healey has based her energy agenda on a drumbeat of policy steps aimed at addressing high gas and electric costs and reducing or removing charges from utility bills to save ratepayers money. Liberty’s rate increase, if approved, would prompt dramatic sticker shock in a Gateway City and directly fly in the face of Healey’s effort. 
DPU declined to comment on the rate case. 
Pamela Bellings, a spokesperson for Liberty, which is owned by Canada-based Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp., defended the rate request in a statement, saying that the company has made “substantial investments” to comply with new pipeline safety regulations and enhance system reliability. Liberty serves customers in New Hampshire, Georgia, Iowa, Illinois, and Missouri, in addition to Massachusetts. 
“We recognize the financial challenges many in our community are facing and have carefully assessed ways to smooth the impact to customer bills,” Bellings said. “A rate adjustment is necessary to help maintain compliance with all new regulations and continue delivering safe and reliable service to customers.” 
The company is now negotiating the rate hike proposal with the state attorney general and other groups. For now, though, Liberty ratepayers are in the lurch. 
Liberty’s rate hike request would raise monthly bills anywhere from $33 to $103 a month depending on the customer’s location and income level in order to recover nearly $95 million. The company last raised rates a decade ago, in 2015, it said in its DPU filing, and the majority of this request is to recover costs for pipe replacement and repair that are associated with the state’s Gas System Enhancement Plan, which have ballooned in recent years.  
Liberty is also seeking to recover costs for improvements to the company’s customer information system and the relocation of its headquarters in Fall River.  
If DPU approves Liberty’s plan, gas bills could rise 90 percent by 2030 — prompting “rate shock that will significantly burden ratepayers,” Timothy Newhard, a financial analyst in the state attorney general’s office, testified to the DPU in October. 
The pure size of the rate hike request is putting a spotlight on Liberty’s gas system infrastructure work to fix leaky old pipes, the main driver of the company’s proposed bill increases. Newhard goes a step further, adding that Liberty is looking to profit from its “budgetary mismanagement” by recovering more than $40 million in a deferred GSEP revenue balance and recommending that DPU limit Liberty’s ability to charge ratepayers for those costs under reforms that the department adopted earlier this year.   
The rate request has unsurprisingly attracted a large amount of scrutiny — and pointed criticism.  
Sen. Michael Rodrigues, chair of the Senate Ways and Means Committee whose district spans the South Coast, including Fall River, said that “now is not the time” for Liberty’s rate hike. 
“This move by Liberty, on the heels of a federal government that continues to shirk its responsibilities in providing food and housing subsidies, is unacceptable,” he said. “The cost of replacing their aging infrastructure should not be entirely borne by the consumer.” 
Healey, meanwhile, said in a statement that this proposal “could not come at a worse time for families and businesses in southeastern Mass.” 
“My administration will be pushing back in the review process and will oppose additional burdens on ratepayers,” she said. 
State officials, including Department of Energy Resources Commissioner Elizabeth Mahony, appeared at an October DPU hearing to oppose Liberty’s request, alongside irate members of the public.  
It’s the exact scenario Healey has increasingly tried to fend off. She blasted other more modest rate hike requests from the state’s larger utilities earlier this year, called on DPU to comprehensively review gas and electric rates to find ways to lower costs, and filed landmark energy affordability legislation that has yet to gain traction as the winter season hits. DPU approved gas rate increases for other companies of up to 30 percent last year, which prompted an outcry from consumers.  
“I, too, am concerned about the size of the rate increase proposed by Liberty,” Mahony said in the hearing. “People are struggling every day to afford rising energy bills, and the 55 percent increase in rates proposed by Liberty is shocking.” 
Dan Dolan, president of the New England Power Generators Association, said the rate request highlights the tradeoffs associated with the state’s decarbonization goals. Electrifying homes through heat pumps requires significant upfront capital costs but offers savings down the line. Slow uptake, however, means dealing with the burdensome transmission and supply costs of maintaining the gas distribution system. 
“The fact that that is now coinciding with the sharpest political refocus on electric affordability that has happened in decades in Massachusetts and frankly, across the nation, is going to create an extraordinarily politically volatile situation,” Dolan said. 
Liberty is also asking regulators to approve a 9.9 percent return on equity, which is the allowed rate of profit for the utility’s shareholders through capital investments. Though that rate of return isn’t out of the ordinary, it would still be tied for DPU’s highest approved return on equity in the past five years, according to Liberty’s own filings. 
The rate hike request has also spawned debates about what kinds of costs utilities should be allowed to recover from customers in the first place. The Energy & Policy Institute, a nonprofit watchdog organization, is pushing legislation in Massachusetts to bar utilities from using ratepayer money for lobbying, investor relations, litigation and DPU cases, and lavish expenses for boards of directors.  
Liberty’s rate case includes roughly $675,000 in these expenses, and removing these items would save ratepayers on average roughly $11 per year, according to the Energy & Policy Institute.  
Still, that represents a small fraction of the $80 average monthly bill increase that Liberty is seeking for Fall River customers.  
The state attorney general’s office said in DPU filings earlier this year regarding the utilities’ GSEP plans that the utilities have “little regard for targeted replacement and prudent cost management” under the Gas System Enhancement Program and that GSEP capital expenditures have increased by about 12 percent per year over the past decade because the companies have almost exclusively chosen to replace rather than repair leak-prone pipe.  
Liberty, like most other gas utilities in the state, did not “demonstrate compliance” with its 2024 GSEP work plan approved by DPU and exceeded its cap by nearly $38 million, according to the attorney general, money that the company is now attempting to recover. 
Getting DPU to approve such a large rate hike request will be a tall order, said Christopher Knittel, associate dean for climate and sustainability at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. But the fact that Liberty is requesting the bill increases in the first place cuts both ways. 
“It’s certainly possible that they’re trying to play a more complex bargaining game and that they are trying to settle on a number that is close to what they really need,” Knittel said. “The DPU will obviously try to cut costs wherever possible, but the fact that they’re asking for it in this environment might signal that these are actually really legitimate because this is not going to play well.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/CorrodedNaturalGasPipelineInspection-edited-1.png?fit=1024%2C767&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-09 09:58:08.721526

Sign up for their newsletter here.
More than 200 environmental organizations signed a letter to Congress supporting a national moratorium on the approval and construction of new data centers. The letter, sent Monday, highlights these centers’ impacts on water resources, electricity rates and greenhouse gas emissions.
Data centers often suck up large amounts of water to cool their computers. They require a lot of electricity to run their servers, often leading to higher regional utility rates and upgrades to the electricity grid to accommodate them. Some utilities are planning to build natural gas plants to serve the new load, while some data-center companies are even building their own plants, increasing local greenhouse gas emissions.
It is near-impossible to paint a complete picture of the energy and water use of data centers, and the corresponding climate impacts, given the limited data that companies provide. A November study in the journal Nature Sustainability predicted that, depending on the speed of expansion, the artificial intelligence industry could emit as much carbon dioxide each year as 10 million cars, Inside Climate News reported.
People across the country, from New York to Alabama, have opposed data center developments in their neighborhoods—with varying degrees of success. The letter states that environmental groups want to stop these developments until “adequate regulations can be enacted to fully protect our communities.”
In a prepared statement, Eric Weltman, senior New York organizer at Food & Water Watch, said: “It’s prudent that we press the pause button on Big Data’s voracious and expanding appetite for energy and water before it’s too late to prevent massive harm.”
Data-center boosters have touted the economic benefits of new construction, including tax revenue increases for local governments and new jobs for residents.
In October, Dan Diorio, the vice president of state policy at the Data Center Coalition, told NPR that companies are trying to reduce their water consumption, and to ensure they pay “the full cost of service for electricity.”
In New York, state leadership has taken a mainly supportive stance on data center development—Gov. Kathy Hochul recently told Bloomberg News that she wants to “let the tech industry know this is the place you want to be.”
But some communities in upstate New York have opposed data center development, particularly cryptocurrency mines that consume large amounts of energy to create bitcoin for profit. More recently, a potential AI data center in Lansing, a town near the state’s Finger Lakes region, has residents concerned about rising electricity costs and environmental problems.
“These slick corporations come into unsuspecting communities with the promise of job creation and tax revenues,” said Yvonne Taylor, the vice president of Seneca Lake Guardian, an organization that fights data centers near the Finger Lakes, and president of the National Coalition Against Cryptomining, which opposes them across the country.
Both organizations signed the letter. “The fact of the matter is that all of these machines … they’re all fully automated, and it doesn’t require a lot of people, so there aren’t a lot of jobs that are created, but the community is left with the consequences, including increased energy bills,” she said.
In Southern states, despite a largely supportive regulatory environment, some communities have mounted strong opposition to proposed data centers. In Bessemer, Alabama, the city council voted to rezone agricultural land to allow the construction of a new data center. This decision has divided the community, which is concerned about electricity rates, water use and potential air pollution from the on-site backup diesel generators.
Data centers use up so much power in certain states, like Virginia, that the regional electric grid operator will need to upgrade the transmission system that is essentially the backbone of the grid, according to Eric Gimon, an independent consultant who works as a technical expert and policy adviser with Energy Innovation, an energy and climate policy think tank.
Consumers usually subsidize those changes. A 2024 report from Virginia’s legislative watchdog agency found that households there could see their bills increase by an estimated $14 to $37 monthly by 2040 as a result.
Data centers’ high power usage also pushes up the forecasts for peak demand—the highest demand possible for a region’s grid. This can also affect household electricity rates.
“For all these things, there are solutions,” said Gimon. “It’s just a question of demanding the solutions get implemented.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Amazon_data_center.jpg,,,2025-12-09 09:58:08.721526
,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-12-09 13:52:53+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,Massachusetts lagging on implementation of data equity law,Jaya Savita and Danielle Kim,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/opinion/massachusetts-lagging-on-implementation-of-data-equity-policy/,"Over two years since the law’s passage, we have seen little progress and movement on implementation, and our residents are continuing to suffer the consequences.","FOR BLACK, INDIGENOUS, and communities of color, as well as other marginalized groups, data can drive greater visibility of residents’ needs—or perpetuate our historic invisibility. Thanks to the longstanding advocacy of community organizations, researchers, state Rep. Tackey Chan and the House Asian Caucus, Massachusetts passed the most expansive data equity policy in the nation, embedding this language into the 2024 budget, which Governor Maura Healey signed into law in August 2023.  
These provisions require all state agencies that already collect race and ethnicity information to further disaggregate it by every major Asian, Pacific Islander, Black and African American, Latino, and white or Caucasian subgroup. This is vitally important given the growing diversity of Massachusetts residents and the persistence of significant disparities, both among different racial categories and within communities themselves.  
For example, consider educational outcomes among Black residents. Nearly half of Nigerian residents in Greater Boston hold a bachelor’s degree or higher, compared to 15 percent of Black Haitians and 10 percent of Cape Verdean residents. Among Latino residents, approximately two-thirds of Guatemalan and Salvadoran workers in Massachusetts are limited English proficient—compared to fewer than 20 percent of Puerto Rican residents, contributing to major disparities in employment and economic outcomes.  
For the local Asian-American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community, this policy is especially consequential and timely given the findings from the recent “No Longer Invisible” report —demonstrating the perniciousness of the “model minority” stereotype, which has characterized the nation’s Asian population as high-achieving economically, and therefore ignoring the intersecting challenges facing working-class Asian Americans.  
Consider the current food insecurity crisis. While Asian American households in Massachusetts, on average, experience food insecurity at rates comparable to white residents and lower than other racial groups, data findings like these often mask critical needs within the diverse AAPI community. Importantly, 46.1 percent of Cambodian families receive SNAP benefits, as do 25.5 percent of Vietnamese families, compared to 16 percent of all families statewide. 
The data equity law represents a significant milestone in not only overcoming harmful racial biases in data, but also opening the door for greater intentionality and effectiveness in delivering state programs. Food distribution, postsecondary readiness programs, and job training programs funded by the state could all be better tailored and targeted to meet the distinct needs of specific ethnic populations. 
But as we know from many other state policies, it all comes down to implementation—and the data equity law presents a historic opportunity for innovation and community engagement. Accordingly, the law included a significant runway for implementation, with the Executive Office for Administration and Finance tasked with creating guidelines by January 2025, and the law itself not going into effect until January 2026. 
Yet, over two years since the law’s passage, we have seen little progress and movement on implementation, and our residents are continuing to suffer the consequences. As community leaders, we are ready to partner with state advocates in the coming months to ensure that this policy is implemented with fidelity and intentionality. Here are some key steps that Massachusetts can take to deliver on the promise of data equity:  
1. Sequence implementation by starting with the Executive Office of Health and Human Services 
As the state’s largest single agency, accounting for over 50 percent of the state’s annual budget, EOHHS plays a central role in the delivery of key programs. Particularly given the changing federal landscape and funding instability, data-informed decisions are even more critical. The state must begin implementation within EOHHS because it is the initial, and often primary, touch point for working class, immigrant, and most marginalized individuals in our communities. By doing so, we will be able to better understand the demographics and ethnic makeup of all communities seeking public health services and support across the Commonwealth. 
2. Convene a Data Equity Community Advisory Committee 
Establishing a Community Advisory Committee composed of diverse stakeholders, including legislators, advocates, public health experts, and researchers, is a necessary step to ensure that implementation is fully inclusive and reflective of our communities. Moreover, the state needs to dedicate funding to host several public hearings in multiple languages and geographical regions, in partnership with this community advisory committee, ensuring that all community voices are heard.  
3. Invest in greater training and resources for our state agency workers 
Capacity matters, and just as Massachusetts law requires every state agency to create a language access plan and appoint a language access coordinator, so too must the state fund the development of comparable data equity plans and coordinator roles within each agency. Furthermore, additional funding is needed to provide trainings and resources for agency staff to implement the new data collection requirements outlined in this law. Accordingly, we urge state leaders to allocate funding in the fiscal year 2027 state budget to support these vital activities. 
Massachusetts faces intersecting public health challenges — from rising food insecurity and housing instability to widening economic and racial inequities, all compounded by the current deportation crisis. Additional investments in data disaggregation are urgently needed to fully understand how working class, immigrant, and Black, Indigenous, and People of Color communities are being impacted by current policies, where gaps in services and resources exist, and to strengthen the infrastructure to protect data privacy in the face of federal threats. 
The nation is once again looking to Massachusetts to be a beacon for innovation. Particularly in this political climate, where data privacy laws are being destroyed by the Trump administration, Massachusetts must stand firm in our commitment to data equity and privacy. We cannot afford to squander this pivotal moment, and we need our state leaders to prioritize the planning and implementation of the data equity law.

In lawsuits, women have accused 83 officers of sexual misconduct.","In summary
A new report on discipline in California prisons highlights slow handling of several sex assault cases filed against officers. In lawsuits, women have accused 83 officers of sexual misconduct. 


Five California correctional officers who were accused of sexually assaulting incarcerated people over the last dozen years remain employed by the state, according to a new audit from the state prisons’ inspector general. 
The audit, released last week, is a twice-a-year summary of how the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation addresses complaints about its staff members. Overall, the inspector general found fault with the internal affairs department’s investigations into prison guard misconduct.
The audit labeled 86% of the prison system’s internal affairs disciplinary and criminal caseload as “inadequate” or “needs improvement” — only 14% of the cases handled by the internal affairs department were rated “adequate.” Inadequate means there were significant problems with the investigation that affected its final outcome. The less-serious label, “needs improvement,” meant that the process had problems, but none so serious that they compromised the investigation. 
It comes as the department faces what the report called “a wave” of lawsuits from incarcerated and formerly incarcerated women who allege they were sexually abused by prison staff. The audit said at least 279 women have sued the department, and they have accused at least 83 prison employees of sexual misconduct.
The inspector general report does not include the names of the officers or even identify the prisons where they work, which is in keeping with its past disciplinary audits. The Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation did not immediately return calls and emails seeking comment for this story. 
California has two prisons that primarily house women. At the larger prison, the Central California Women’s Facility in Chowchilla, former guard Gregory Rodriguez was found guilty of 64 counts of sexual abuse in January, The Fresno Bee reported, and later sentenced to 224 years in prison. 
Thirteen incarcerated or formerly incarcerated women testified against him. A 2023 investigation by The Guardian found that women had made reports about Rodriguez as early as 2014. He worked at the prison until 2022.
As Rodriguez’s case unfolded, the inspector general’s office learned of other sex assault lawsuits. The inspector general’s office in the new report said it looked at 68 cases and it faulted prison lawyers for being too slow in referring names to internal investigators who could have developed disciplinary cases against officers.
On average, the audit said it took nine months for the corrections department’s legal staff to send cases to internal investigators. “Delayed investigation of sexual assault significantly impairs the integrity and effectiveness of the investigative process,” the audit said.
The audit then described three cases involving six officers, five of whom continue to work for state prisons. 
In a separate case not connected to the “wave” of lawsuits, internal investigators took so long to review allegations of sexual assault that a lieutenant accused by a dozen women was able to retire before facing discipline, the audit said.
The inspector general’s office wrote that the officer allegedly traded chewing gum, a radio and marijuana for sexual favors between 2021 and 2023, and then lied to the prison system’s internal affairs unit when asked about it. 
The internal affairs unit “unnecessarily delayed the completion of the investigation, which prevented the department from imposing discipline for some allegations,” the audit found. 
Other violations ranged from minor administrative chicanery, like two guards who allegedly faked the numbers in a prisoner count so they could use the time to eat Thanksgiving dinner instead, to allegations that a prison guard loudly, publicly and untruthfully indicated to other inmates that a prisoner was acting as an informant. 
The audit reflects a chaotic process for even routine investigations. In a January 2024 case, one of eight prison guards who had broken up a fight struck an incarcerated person with a baton, even though the incarcerated person had already “disengaged.” 
The Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation was aware of the case in January 2024, according to the lawsuit, but didn’t refer it to internal affairs until June 2024, according to the audit. An investigator didn’t start conducting interviews until August 2024. Then the case was reassigned to a second investigator, who didn’t start interviews until November 2024, and tried to close the case without interviewing the incarcerated person, the guard who allegedly struck him or any witnesses. 
Then, the second investigator went on extended leave, handing the case off to a third investigator who had weeks to wrap up an investigation that is supposed to take months to complete. Ultimately, the prison system was handed a case four days before the deadline for disciplinary action with “a wholly deficient investigative report.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/051821-Corrections-Medical-Parole-AP-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-09 13:57:13.907869

They keep kids alive in dangerous times,Ayo Banjo,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/12/school-counselors-youth-suicide-california/,"With suicide and violence stalking students, counselors are often the first to notice kids in trouble. They're also among the first to lose their jobs to budget cuts.","Guest Commentary written by

Ayo Banjo
Ayo Banjo leads a stigma reduction campaign funded through the California Youth Behavioral Health Initiative.


Weeks after a student and staff member were stabbed and four students arrested at Watsonville High, the school district that serves them is considering laying off every mental health clinician and most of its school counselors. 
If you want a snapshot of how we are failing young people, especially boys, you can start there. 
To balance its budget, the Pajaro Valley Unified School District is considering eliminating the equivalent of 15 full-time counselors, all 13 mental health clinicians and dozens of intervention staff at its schools  —  at a time when youth suicide is one of the leading causes of death for people ages 10 to 24. 
Men and boys make up nearly 80% of suicides in the United States, a rate almost four times higher than for women. For LGBTQ youth, the picture is even more alarming. A national survey found nearly 39% seriously considered suicide in the past year, and 12% attempted it. 
This crisis is not abstract. It is here. It is now. And it is local. 
Young people rely most heavily on school-based support, so if you remove counselors and clinicians, you remove the adults best positioned to intervene when a student’s silence becomes dangerous. 
And when we talk about violence, context matters. What we frame as “school safety” is often a reflection of untreated pain. 
When a boy explodes, we see a threat. When a boy shuts down, we assume he is fine. We rarely name what both can be — symptoms of a system that teaches boys to swallow everything and then acts surprised when the pressure finally breaks. 
I see this every week in my work as project director of a countywide stigma reduction campaign on the Central Coast. 
Our youth ambassadors — many of them Black, brown or LGBTQ — lead a movement called Break the Stigma Not the Vibe. They design billboards, bus ads and schoolwide messaging rooted in language they needed when they were younger.
Asking for help with no one to answer
Their message is simple: Asking for help is strength. You don’t have to go through this alone. And you deserve to be seen before you collapse. 
Their words will soon move across the Central Coast on buses and corridors, reaching thousands of students who may not talk to a teacher or open up at home. Sometimes visibility is the intervention.
Now, imagine pairing that visibility with the removal of every trained mental health professional on campus. That is the contradiction this moment demands we confront. You cannot cut lifelines in a suicide crisis and call it a safety strategy. 
School counselors and clinicians are not extras; they are core safety infrastructure. They are the adults who notice when a student stops being themselves, when grades slip, when friendships change or when a child who laughs easily is suddenly withdrawn. 
We have to stop treating mental health as a side conversation. These cuts are happening in winter — when depression, isolation and suicidal ideation increase. 
They are happening in communities still recovering from violence, and after the federal government removed the “Press 3”  LGBTQ-specific option on the national 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline — a resource that has supported more than a million people. We are watching lifelines shrink at the moment young people need more of them. 
California has invested heavily in youth behavioral health in recent years. But investment means little if school boards eliminate the positions that translate those state dollars into daily, life-saving support.
If we are serious about preventing suicide, especially among boys and historically marginalized youth, then counselors, clinicians and trusted adults must be the last thing on the chopping block — not the first. 
I say this not just as someone who works in mental health, but as someone who has lost people I love to suicide. Sometimes the difference between survival and silence is a single adult who knows your name and notices when your light dims. 
We have a choice in front of us. We can keep cutting lifelines and hope for the best. Or we can decide that in a youth suicide crisis, the most dangerous decision we can make is to remove the people who keep kids alive.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/021125-ICE-Schools-Salinas-LV_27.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-09 08:56:12.068379

(McKenzie Romero/Utah News Dispatch)Chanting “Immigrants are welcome here!” about 40 people gathered Monday outside the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services office in Salt Lake City, protesting the arrests of Utahns who went there for appointments like a green card interview and left in the custody of immigration agents.
The protesters held homemade signs saying “seeking safety is not a crime” and “no more racist deportations” in a show of support for anyone due at the office Monday, remaining positioned outside from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m., the facility’s operating hours. Drivers passing by honked in support, while people inside the building at times waved from the windows.

Immigration attorneys expect more people to be detained at the office and elsewhere in Utah this month and next as the Trump administration steps up enforcement. They’ve criticized the arrests, saying they force immigrants into the shadows, undermine the legal immigration process and unnecessarily separate families. 
That was the case for one man who went to the office last week for a green card interview with his wife and child, said attorney Adam Crayk. The young father was arrested, with immigration agents saying he overstayed a visa and citing a mark on his juvenile record that had since been expunged, Crayk said. 
Prior to this year’s immigration crackdown, an old case in juvenile court didn’t tend to land someone on the radar of immigration enforcers, Crayk said. While another of his clients who was detained at the Citizenship and Immigration Services office had a prior criminal conviction, he said last week, a third did not.

The federal agency did not comment on criticism of the detentions, but told Utah News Dispatch in a statement Monday that people may be apprehended at its offices if they “are identified as having outstanding warrants; being subject to court-issued removal orders; or having committed fraud, crimes, or other violations of immigration law while in the United States.” 
In an announcement last month, the agency said it was working with multiple agencies “to enforce immigration law and protect public safety.” Its referrals to law enforcers resulted in the apprehension of almost 2,000 people at its facilities around the country since Jan. 20, the date of Trump’s inauguration, the announcement said.
At the protest Monday, Charlie Padilla, of Layton, led the crowd in a chant of “DHS, let’s be clear, immigrants are welcome here!” He told Utah News Dispatch that those applying for green cards and other authorization at the office don’t represent the “worst of the worst” that Trump had said immigration operations would target. 
“It’s unacceptable,” Padilla said.

Protester Carmen Cancino held a sign saying “First things first: Love thy neighbor!” 
Standing outside the office with her daughters, ages 2 and 14, Cancino said she understands why immigration agents may arrest people convicted of crimes, but not those without a criminal record. 
She said she knew of someone who was scheduled to go to the office a few weeks ago. 
“She didn’t come to her appointment, because she was scared that they were going to take her,” Cancino said. 
Protest organizer Liz Maryon, with the Salt Lake Community Bail Fund, kept track as people came and went from appointments inside, and urged protesters to cheer in support for those who left without issue. Maryon said after the protest concluded that no one appeared to be arrested Monday.

(Will McLelland/Alabama Reflector)A University of Alabama alumni organization is raising money to support two student publications shut down by the administration last week. 
Media Alumni Seeking to Highlight Equity and Diversity (MASTHEAD), said in a statement Sunday the organization has launched a fundraising campaign to raise $25,000 to support Nineteen Fifty-Six a Black lifestyle and culture magazine and Alice, a women’s magazine.
The funds will go towards helping both magazines independently publish for the Spring 2026 semester. It is unknown if the publications will retain their names.

Victor Luckerson, President of MASTHEAD and a journalist and author, said in a  statement alumni and people who care about student journalism should step up to support the publications. 
“We have to build infrastructure that allows us to not only survive but thrive at a moment when so many voices are being stifled because of government and university overreach. This is a national issue, but the work starts in our own community,” the statement said.
In the same statement, Nineteen Fifty-Six Magazine Editor-in-Chief Kendal Wright and Alice Editor-In-Chief Gabrielle Gunter said they would fight to keep their publications alive. 
“But I think this experience has taught our community and our staff that there is always another way. We will always have a space to tell our stories, and we will always make one. We cannot be silenced,” Wright said in the statement.
Gunter said the suspension has upset the publication’s staff members to the point of protest.
“My staff is devastated, but I will also say we’re angry, and the university would have a hard time shutting us up right now. Given that these two magazines tell such important stories that other student publications might not be able to, getting censored is egregious,” Gunter said in the statement.
On Dec. 1, The University of Alabama notified members of Nineteen Fifty-Six Magazine and Alice Magazine that both publications would be suspended for not being in compliance with federal guidance on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs.
The university cited a July memo from U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi released this summer that made non-binding recommendations on how to remain in compliance with anti-DEI policies supported by the Trump administration. The university has also cited the memo in claiming it cannot reopen spaces for LGBTQ students and UA’s Black Student Union. 
Alabama’s closure of the publications has drawn national attention as well as criticism on campus. A petition was started on MoveOn to reinstate both magazines saying their suspension is “direct attack on free speech on a college campus.” As of early Monday evening, it had over 2,800 signatures.
On Friday, the University of Alabama Chapter of the Association of the American Association of University Professors sent a letter to University of Alabama President Peter Mohler; Academic Affairs Provost Lesley Reid and Vice President of Student Life Steven Hood saying they “dispute the administration’s legal rationale for closing these publications and stand in solidarity with the students who produce and read them.”
“Your decision to suspend these publications not only violates these students’ First Amendment rights, it also tarnishes the reputation of the University of Alabama as a space that welcomes all students,” the statement said. 
The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) has also criticized the decision to close Alice and Nineteen Fifty-Six, writing in a letter sent to UA last Wednesday that the school “may not retaliate against an editorially independent student publication based on its content or viewpoint.” 
“Once a university recognizes a student publication, it cannot act as a censor,” the letter said.
Since the suspension, the university has said UA staff “hope to work with students to develop a new publication that features a variety of voices and perspectives to debut in the next academic year.”
MASTHEAD is a non-profit organization that advocates for “diverse, anti-racist and equitable student media at the University of Alabama.” The organization, founded in 2020, provides financial support and mentorship to student journalists at UA to “promote a more inclusive environment.
The funding would cover the cost of student salaries, printing and equipment needs.
Luckerson said in an interview Monday printing costs for the magazines is typically $7,500 with student budgets per magazine being $5,000. He also said there are unknown costs for publication.
“We don’t quite know what it’s going to cost yet for space, for example, we don’t know where the students are going to work. You know, that might involve renting space on or off campus. We don’t know yet, so we want to make sure we have some money also for that purpose,”he said.
Fundraising updates can be tracked on Givebutter. As of early Monday evening $12,300 had been raised.
Luckerson said the support for the fundraiser has gotten more than 100 individual donors so far with donations ranging from $5 to $500.
“That just shows that everyone, no matter how much they have, is willing to contribute something to make this happen. Because I think alumni and students are so passionate about making sure that authentic voices are still able to be heard on the University of Alabama campus,” he said.
Luckerson said the university overreached by shutting down Nineteen Fifty-Six and Alice.
“I don’t think, I mean, there’s anything wrong with creating work that represents the people into different groups on campus,” he said. “It’s not wrong to have Essence or Vogue as magazines we can all enjoy on the newsstand. And so I see why it’d be wrong to have similar content being produced on campus.”

,California,2025-12-09 13:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,"Who’s seeking fire aid for Los Angeles, candidate Newsom or Gov. Newsom?",Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/12/gavin-newsom-wildfire-aid-plea/,President Trump and Republicans in Congress last week ignored Gov. Gavin Newsom's requests for fire aid. Newsom has been critical of them recently.,"California Gov. Gavin Newsom, an all-but-certain candidate for president in 2028, jumped at the chance to address a forum of business executives and other A-list figures last week and burnish his credentials as President Donald Trump’s most vocal critic.
He excoriated attendees at a New York Times-sponsored event for being too accommodating of Trump, whom he accused of undermining democracy. He even suggested they should acquire the parody kneepads he’s selling, for “groveling to Trump’s needs.”
“Some of you may need to buy them in bulk,” he said.
“Some of you are probably fine with it,” Newsom said as he ticked off Trump’s authoritarian policies. “A lot of people figured it out. They know the game, state capitalism, crony capitalism, the great grift. A lot of you are doing extraordinarily well.”
It was exactly what to expect from someone eyeing the White House, who hopes that positioning himself as Trump’s resistor-in-chief would give him a leg up on other Democratic contenders.
Politico, a website devoted to politics, quoted an unnamed Newsom advisor as saying his confrontational presentation was deliberate. “So he came prepared to tell the truth,” the advisor said.
A day later, Newsom landed in Washington, doffed his presidential candidate hat, donned his gubernatorial chapeau and asked Republicans who control Congress and the White House to give California $34 billion to help Los Angeles County communities recover from deadly wildfires that swept through the region nearly a year ago.
“As the fire response has shifted into long-term recovery, the focus now is on rebuilding homes, schools, utilities and critical infrastructure while also supporting small businesses and job growth in the impacted region,” Newsom told congressional leaders in a letter, adding, “As in past and current disasters, complete recovery is not possible without essential federal aid. The state of California continues to respectfully request a supplemental appropriation for disaster funding to support key programs to aid survivors.”
Respectfully? Newsom implies that he can portray Trump and other Republicans as agents of the devil and immediately ask them for many billions of dollars to help his very blue state recover from disaster.
The two days on the eastern seaboard encapsulate the bifurcated image Newsom will display during his final year as governor — aggressive candidate for the White House and chief executive of the nation’s largest state.
There are conflicts as Newsom juggles the two roles, with his pleas for wildfire aid being an obvious one.
He knows that Trump demands obsequiousness from anyone seeking  favors — exactly what Newsom cited in his New York presentation. The flip side of Trump’s alpha-male psyche is that if flattery is not forthcoming, the seeker will likely be shunned.

“Back in January, the president looked me in the eye on the tarmac at LAX and promised me, and the people of LA, that he’d ‘take care of it’ as we rebuild and recover,” Newsom said in a statement. “That commitment isn’t being met, and instead he’s leaving survivors behind. It’s time for Trump to wake up and do his job.”
Newsom knew that confronting Trump would probably doom any chance California had to get disaster aid. The White House even rebuffed Newsom’s request for a meeting with Trump or other high-ranking officials.
“The Trump Administration refused a routine wildfire recovery meeting — a rejection we’ve never seen before — even as LA families near a year without long-term federal financial help,” Newsom spokesperson Izzy Gardon said in a statement. “The message to survivors is unmistakable: Donald Trump doesn’t care about them.”
Newsom made a choice, and candidate Newsom prevailed over Governor Newsom. As 2026 unfolds, we will see many other conflicts between the two personages.  The candidate will probably continue to dominate.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/010725_Palisades-Fire_AP_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-09 08:56:12.068379

In S[...]","Technical assistance course participants at the networking event on June 27, 2025. (Photo courtesy UNR Extension)Federal funding for local food production was hit hard earlier this year when the Trump administration cut several agricultural programs supporting home-grown food and farm businesses. 
Despite those cuts, the University of Nevada, Reno says the local food systems built with Biden administration support before funding was stripped away are here to stay.
In September, the U.S. the Department of Agriculture (USDA) eliminated a $360 million Biden-era program that provided funding for 13 food business centers across the country to bolster rural development and build stronger food-supply networks in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The University of Nevada, Reno Extension lost $3 million in federal funding – which included direct grants to farmers and food businesses – when the program was cut three years ahead of schedule.
But the Southwest Regional Food Business Center – serving California, Arizona, Nevada and Utah – created foundational infrastructure that strengthened Nevada’s local food system during its two year run, and UNR is determined to build on it.
“It built a collaboration around four states and those partnerships don’t just go away because the money went away,” said Staci Emm, the Nevada state leader for the region’s food business center.
While Nevada lost more than half of the $5 million initially awarded through the local food program, the impacts of that funding have been significant, said Emm.
The Southwest Regional Food Business Center was able to help 170 Nevada businesses increase food production capacity and provided nearly $350,000 in direct grants to 18 farmers and food businesses in the state.
In Clark County alone 37 small and mid-sized food and farm businesses were provided technical assistance, including marketing, startup help, networking, and grant application support. Food businesses in the county were awarded more than $90,000 in capacity building funding.
Federal funding from the program reached every congressional district in Nevada, with the majority of capacity building funds – more than $212,000 – going to Congressional District 2, which covers nine counties in northern Nevada. 
About 80% of direct funds helped small and mid-sized food and farm businesses in Nevada pay for processing, packaging, and labeling equipment that will expand their reach and market for years to come. 
Another 30% of direct funding went to improving transportation systems in Nevada for home-grown produce and meats. 
Those impacts are expected to grow, said Becky DeForest, a grant writer for the food business center.
“We experienced some contracting delays from USDA and now more projects have been approved to move forward, so we hope to have more impacts to report in the next several months,” said Deforest.
Emm, the Nevada state leader for the region’s food business center, also works as a rancher and said one of the biggest impacts was the infrastructure funding for small meat processing businesses.
The Nevada Department of Agriculture, with the assistance of the Southwest Regional Food Business Center, established the first State Meat Inspection Program to reduce wait times and expand market access for local producers to reach local markets.
The program will help expand the number of in-state USDA inspected slaughter facilities, said Emm. Nevada only has four located in the state, all in the Northwestern region, forcing many producers to travel over 250 miles to process their animals. 
One of the big success stories of the Southwest Regional Food Business Center is CattleBros Steak and Seafood. 
Ryan Avila, founder of CattleBros Steak and Seafood, was able to scale his business with the help of the center by launching a marketing plan with website subscriptions, upgrade packaging, and streamline logistics. 
Avila found out about the center’s technical assistance program earlier this year and was one of 44 food business owners to participate in a 10-week virtual course hosted by the University of Nevada, Reno Extension through the Southwest Regional Food Business Center. 
After completing the technical assistance program Avila was awarded $10,000 in funding to capitalize on training the center provided. 
“These funds help level the playing field for small, independent businesses like ours,” Avila said.
UNR is now looking at different ways to restructure the center by emphasizing what worked best, including the technical assistance and direct grants to farmers and ranchers. 
In the two and a half months after the USDA cut funding Emm said her team worked around the clock to submit grant applications to cover the technical assistance funding UNR lost. 
“We probably won’t find out if we’re funded till 2026, but I’m very proud of my team, because we were able to submit grant (applications) for over $6 million to keep all of our programs going,” Emm said.
The center’s arrival on the scene was fortuitous for a state challenged by high food insecurity, vast geographic distribution, and fragmented infrastructure. Local farmers struggle to compete with large out-of-state producers, who offset long-distance transportation costs through economies of scale. Yet, having a local supply of produce is important for the state’s food security, and consumers and restaurants alike are seeking more fruits and vegetables produced locally.
“The center was an excellent start, and I think it showed us what works really well and what didn’t work,” Emm said. 
Emm said the importance of local producers became even clearer during the pandemic which exposed the fragility of regional food systems and left many Nevadans vulnerable to hunger. At its peak, nearly 30% of households in the state were food insecure, compared with 21% nationally, with underserved communities being hit hardest.
“I think if covid didn’t teach us anything else, it taught us that we need to have some type of support within our local food system,” she said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/514154700_1177310677758761_4692464632320965730_n-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-09 08:56:12.068379

Alabama's infant mortality rate has been higher than the nation's for decades.  (Jacob Wackerhausen/Getty Images)A group of Alabama nonprofits and women’s health advocates Tuesday are planning to launch a program to improve maternal and infant mortality rates.
The Alabama Birth Equity initiative is led by the Yellowhammer Fund and joined by Margins: Women Helping Black Women, Oasis Women’s Health, and Alabama Birth Center. Jenice Fountain, executive director of the Yellowhammer Fund, said the initiative will help midwives in Alabama pay for their training, which usually costs $4,000-8,000 per semester, and transportation to clinics.
“Acknowledging that the Alabama Birth Center has a lot going on outside of being a preceptor, and compensating them so that they can compensate their staff for those trainings,” Fountain said.

Fountain said the initiative’s goal is to have 10 midwives or doulas in Alabama within one year, and to meet any reproductive health needs.
“What we’re going to do is make some ground on midwifery policy. One of which being that midwives don’t count as guests when you’re at the hospital,” Fountain said. “The person that might not make the cut might be the person you really needed to make sure you have adequate care.” 
Alabama has long struggled with higher-than-average infant mortality rates.  According to ADPH, the state’s infant mortality rate were 7.1 babies per 1,000 live births that died within the first year of life in 2024. That was down from 7.8 deaths per 1,000 births in 2023, but still significantly higher than the national infant mortality rate of 5.5 deaths per 1,000 live births 
Infant mortality rates for Black Alabamians remain disproportionately high and racial disparities wide. According to the ADPH data, the infant mortality rate among white Alabamians was 5.4 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2024. For Black Alabamians, the rate was 11.8 per 1,000. In 2023, the rates were 5.7 and 13.1 deaths per 1,000 births, respectively. 
Dr. Yashica Robinson, an OB-GYN and founder of Alabama Birth Center in Huntsville, said that access to prenatal care in rural counties makes a major difference in infant mortality. 
“It doesn’t have to be a huge medical event,” Robinson said of giving birth. “It’s when we’re not properly prepared and properly educated, our moms aren’t healthy and they’re not getting prenatal care early enough. Then we miss the opportunities to intervene and make sure they get off to a good start.”
Part of the initiative also includes advocating for policy changes like funding for birth centers, Robinson and Fountain said. Robinson said a lack of support from the state for birth centers has also contributed to maternal and infant mortality rates.
She said that improving birth outcomes seems nonpartisan, but the path to fixing the problem is where partisan politics come in.
“It doesn’t matter what side you’re on, we want to see improved outcomes for both moms and babies,” Robinson said. “I think the problem ends up being lawmakers’ understanding of how we bring that change about.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/doctorpatient-2-1024x540-1.jpg,,,2025-12-09 08:56:12.068379

(Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)The various gun safety and violence prevention laws enacted in Michigan over the last several years, coupled with a new one passed this year, have received decent marks in a scorecard issued by Giffords Law Center, one of the key groups leading the national charge against gun violence.
The gun safety advocacy group, started by former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords, who survived an assassination attempt when she was shot while meeting with constituents, released its annual Gun Law Scorecard on Monday. It put Michigan’s gun safety law near the top of the pack with a B- grade due to its 2025 law mandating schools to notify parents about its previously passed safe storage requirements. The state has also invested $10 million toward community violence intervention programs.
Gun Law Scorecard from the Giffords Law Center
“There is no denying that strong gun laws save lives. This year, Michigan scored a B- on GIFFORDS’ Annual Scorecard, and while we celebrate the lifesaving laws that earned that grade, we can’t stop here,” Giffords Executive Director Emma Brown said in a statement. “The work ahead is urgent. Every day, gun violence takes the lives of over 125 people in the United States, each of them someone’s mother, father or child.

What had been a felony — having two ounces of cannabis flower in a car, enough for about 100 joints — became legal overnight when the law took effect on Aug. 1.
But legalization hasn’t ended marijuana prosecutions. Minnesota prosecutors have brought more than 3,500 charges and won more than 1,200 misdemeanor convictions against people with cannabis in their cars since legalization, according to a Minnesota Reformer analysis. Additionally, prosecutors have filed nearly 500 charges against people for consuming cannabis in vehicles, either as passengers or drivers.
That’s due to an important but unadvertised caveat: all cannabis products — including flower, vape pens, wax and edibles — must be in the trunk (or trunk area in the case of SUVs) unless they’re sealed in their original, labeled packaging from a dispensary.
The police stops and prosecutions have defense lawyers concerned about the threat of racial profiling and warrantless vehicle searches.
“Now there’s this whole entry point to all of these cars — officers are going to take it every time they get,” Amanda Brodhag, a Hennepin County public defender, said.
Law enforcement leaders and prosecutors say there’s an obvious public safety rationale for the law: driving under the influence of cannabis or any intoxicating substance is dangerous and they shouldn’t be easily accessible to the driver.
The packaging law has caught many consumers and even cannabis attorneys unawares.
“I’m surprised,” said Elliot Ginsburg, an attorney who helps marijuana growers, manufacturers and retailers comply with the new regulatory regime. “I suspect a lot of people don’t know that.”
The law prohibiting improperly packaged marijuana in vehicles isn’t mentioned on the state’s “need to know” page about adult-use cannabis, nor is it referenced anywhere in the chapter of laws governing recreational cannabis, including the lengthy section detailing limits on cannabis possession and the many things people may not do with it, like use it in a vehicle.
The rules are found in the lengthy chapter of traffic laws, next to the nearly identical section on open alcohol containers.
Violating the cannabis open package law is a misdemeanor, carrying a maximum penalty of $1,000 fine and 90 days in jail, although many people end up paying a few hundred dollars or less, according to the Reformer’s review of convictions.
In dozens of convictions reviewed by the Reformer, some cases included evidence that the driver had recently consumed, like a burnt roach in the ashtray or a vape pen tucked under the driver’s leg. In those cases, there were often additional charges such as driving under the influence, speeding or driving without a license.
In many other cases, however, the driver is not even suspected of being under the influence but simply had a jar of marijuana in the passenger area or in the center console. In those cases, drivers often freely showed officers their bag of weed, seemingly unaware they had done anything wrong.
Brodhag, the Hennepin County public defender, said the people she’s represented charged with marijuana packaging violations have been surprised to learn they did anything wrong.
She and other criminal defense attorneys have also seen officers use it to search vehicles without a warrant or the driver’s consent, which they say is a troubling trend. They worry police may use the ban on improperly packaged cannabis as part of a strategy that targets people of color and people in low-income neighborhoods in hopes of turning up illegal guns, drugs or other contraband.
In 2023, the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled that the odor of marijuana alone did not give police officers enough probable cause to search a vehicle without a warrant or the owner’s consent. But if drivers admit to having marijuana in the passenger area or a police officer sees it, that could justify a warrantless search.
There are apparent racial disparities in some counties, according to data obtained by the Reformer through a public records request. In the state’s most populous Hennepin County, for instance, around 42% of people charged with having open cannabis packages or using in their vehicles were Black despite making up roughly 13% of the population. In Ramsey and Dakota counties, roughly a third of people charged since legalization were Black.
“We’re just switching how we’re criminalizing the same exact plant,” Brodhag said. “And it’s going to hit the same communities that the criminalization of marijuana did.”
Brodhag serves on the state’s Cannabis Expungement Board, which was created by the Legislature to review more than 100,000 past marijuana-related cases. Sen. Lindsey Port, DFL-Minneapolis, a lead author of the bill said the aim is to “undo that harm” of cannabis prohibition.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Brodhag finds it hard to reconcile her work on that board expunging low-level cannabis offenses with defending people who continue to be charged with the low-level cannabis offense of having an improperly sealed bag or vape pen in the car.
“These cases are not going to be up for expungement in the same way, and these people are going to have convictions that could still impact their future,” Brodhag said.
How often people are charged for improperly stored marijuana varies widely across the state. For instance, there were more charges brought in McLeod County, population 36,771, since legalization than Ramsey County, population 552,352 — 128 to 120.
Since misdemeanor charges are usually brought by city attorneys, charging rates can differ greatly across city lines. Prosecutors in Edina, population 53,494, have brought 93 charges since legalization compared to 87 brought in Minneapolis, population 429,954.
Ginsburg, the cannabis business attorney, says it doesn’t make sense to treat a resealed jar of marijuana in the glove compartment the same as an open beer can in the driver’s cupholder.
“If you have a can of beer open, it’s in the process of being consumed. But a broken seal on a package means you maybe used some two weeks ago,” Ginsburg said. “I don’t see why that should be a crime.”
A resealed jar of marijuana seems akin to a case of beer with a few cans missing, which is not a crime to have in the passenger area of a car in Minnesota. (At least, prosecutors and members of the Minnesota Supreme Court agreed it was not a crime in 2021 case.) Law enforcement leaders counter it’s also like having a half-full handle of vodka or bottle of wine, which is a crime.
Another important distinction is that virtually all beer, wine and other spirits that people have in their cars came sealed from a store, whereas the vast majority of cannabis, at least for now, is either purchased on the black market or grown at home. Until recently there were only a handful of dispensaries in Minnesota where people could buy cannabis in the required “child-resistant, tamper-evident and opaque” packages.
Ginsburg also pointed out that consumers could face misdemeanor charges if manufacturers don’t package their product according to strict state standards and they happen to have it in the passenger area of their cars.
“The vast, vast, vast majority are doing their best to comply… but during this awkward transition period, there is confusion in the market,” Ginsburg said.
McLeod County Attorney Ryan Hansch, whose office has brought 72 charges since legalization, said open cannabis package violations are hardly a priority for his office compared with more serious crimes. But when law enforcement brings him a case, his job is fairly straightforward.
“If the evidence supports criminal charges — absent some other considerations — it is typically going to be charged,” Hansch said.
Law enforcement officers have broad discretion over whether to refer charges, and Hansch said he’s confident officers are choosing to educate people about the law and let them go with a warning in a fair number of cases.
Edina Police Sgt. Mike Sussman said he isn’t surprised by his city’s relatively high charging rate and doesn’t think it’s a particularly enlightening statistic.
Edina has major highways crossing through their jurisdiction connecting Minneapolis to outer-ring suburbs. Plus, the Minneapolis Police Department is short hundreds of officers and likely busier answering 911 calls. (Minneapolis police are also barred from pulling people over for equipment violations like broken taillights and tinted windows following federal and state investigations that found they had a pattern of racial discrimination.)
“We are heavily traffic-focused,” Sussman said.
He said they’re not interested in “nitpicking” small amounts of cannabis, but they try to follow the letter of the law.
“The citation is what changes the driving behavior,” Sussman said. “And consistency is usually the key when it comes to some of these enforcements because otherwise you could be accused of favoritism.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2214419003-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-09 07:56:27.557591

(Photo via Collins’ X account)Washington state mistakenly issued nearly 700 licenses to drive trucks and buses to noncitizens who don’t qualify over the past seven years. 
This issue has drawn heavy criticism from the Trump administration and others after a semitruck driver, Harjinder Singh, allegedly made an illegal U-turn and killed three people in Florida. Singh wrongfully received a standard commercial driver’s license from Washington state, the state Department of Licensing concluded. 
U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has since threatened to withhold federal highway funding from states that issue these licenses to immigrants who don’t qualify. He has also tried to restrict who qualifies for commercial licenses, a move that is being litigated.
The growing attention led Washington’s licensing department to discover 685 other errors of the same kind over the course of seven years. All of those licenses were active when the mistakes were found. That figure doesn’t account for errors with credentials that had already lapsed. 
A U.S. Department of Transportation spokesperson said Washington’s “failure to follow federal law is a blatant breakdown in its responsibility to protect the public.”
“By handing out standard CDLs to drivers who were never eligible, Washington sent unsafe foreign drivers onto highways across America and put countless families in danger,” the spokesperson said in an email. “This is exactly the kind of negligence Secretary Duffy is working to eliminate. Following the law is not optional.”
Washington Department of Licensing spokesperson Nathan Olson said in an email that the “Errors have been addressed, and DOL is working to make changes in our system, process, procedures, and training to prevent mis-issuances in the future.” 
Singh and others should have received what is called a non-domiciled commercial driver’s license, meant for noncitizens with valid work authorization. Citizens and lawful permanent residents get standard licenses, which is what Singh received. 
Standard licenses expire at the same time as the driver’s regular driving credential, while non-domiciled ones lapse when their work authorization expires. It’s unclear how many of the 685 drivers in Washington were issued commercial licenses that went beyond their work authorization due to the mistake, Olson said. 
The state submitted its investigation into its mistakes to the federal government last month.
Before the Florida crash, Singh also wrongfully received a credential from California. Because of this, his Washington license was invalid at the time of the crash this year, Olson said.
Earlier this year, Duffy launched a nationwide audit of the states that issue these non-domiciled licenses to immigrants. President Donald Trump also signed an executive order that says truckers without English proficiency should be kept off the roads.
Duffy has pushed new rules limiting the types of visas that allow noncitizens to qualify for trucking licenses. Only those with H-2A, H-2B or E-2 visas would be allowed to get credentials. These visas make up just 10,000 of the 200,000 noncitizen license holders. 
King County, where Seattle is located, asked a Washington, D.C., appeals court to review the policy shift, noting it would cost the county’s bus fleet some drivers. In response, the court last month temporarily halted these restrictions. 
Also last month, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, announced the state was revoking 17,000 commercial driver’s licenses issued to immigrants because the licenses had expiration dates later than the drivers were allowed to remain in the country.
In Washington, the 685 license holders at issue have been given a chance to update their legal status if, for example, they’ve since received their green cards. It’s unclear how many credentials the state has revoked.

The state licensing department has stopped processing all non-domiciled commercial driver’s licenses and learner permits.
Last week, Duffy said one-third of non-domiciled commercial driver’s licenses issued in Minnesota were illegal. He gave Minnesota an ultimatum: Get in compliance within 30 days or risk losing $30 million in federal highway funding. In November, Duffy threatened nearly $75 million earmarked for Pennsylvania for similar problems.
Washington faces ire from another direction. After the fatal crash in August, Florida’s attorney general moved to sue Washington and California at the U.S. Supreme Court, seeking a permanent ban on both states issuing commercial driver’s licenses to noncitizens. Washington has until Jan. 27 to respond to Florida’s filing.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/harjinder-singh-1024x576.jpeg,,,2025-12-09 07:56:27.557591

Most parents I know feel the same way.
Among the thousands of bills pre-filed for the next legislative session, Missouri lawmakers are targeting some of the ugliest corners of digital life: rules on AI chatbots, penalties for distributing intimate images and — getting the most attention — age-verification for accessing online pornography.
Missouri recently began enforcing age checks for sites when at least a third of the content is pornographic. Attorney General Catherine Hanaway has promised vigorous enforcement, but legislators want to codify the rule into law to defend it against legal challenges.
The case for these laws isn’t hard to grasp. Age verification seems to offer something simple and enforceable: a line between adult content and kids, and a requirement that platforms respect it. In theory, it creates parity between the expectations we already place on brick-and-mortar adult businesses.
But I’m not convinced it will accomplish what supporters hope, at least not without serious drawbacks.
First, the technological reality is messy. Determined minors can bypass age checks with VPNs, mirror sites or offshore platforms that have no reason to comply with Missouri law. Pretending otherwise underestimates the way the internet actually works.
Platforms that do comply, like Pornhub, have simply blocked access entirely — while less reputable, unregulated sites remain. That risks pushing kids not toward safety, but toward predators.
Second, every age-verification system comes with privacy tradeoffs. Whether a site uses an ID check, a third-party age-token service or biometric estimation, records are created — maybe minimal, maybe encrypted, but never risk-free. No database is breach-proof, and concentrating sensitive data creates an enticing target for hackers.
Third, we should take seriously what it means to normalize government-mandated identity checks for accessing legal content. The intention may be narrow, but the mechanism is broad: a state-enforced requirement to prove who you are before viewing lawful speech.
Even if courts set limits, creating the infrastructure makes future expansion easier to other categories of information a government may deem objectionable.
Finally, there’s the hard truth that no digital gate will solve what is ultimately a behavioral and educational problem. Kids don’t seek explicit content only because it’s available. They seek it because no one has helped them understand what healthy boundaries, consent and sexuality look like in a digital world.
Age-verification laws may be part of a response, but they are not close to a full one.
There’s no perfect answer to this challenge. But we can start by investing in better digital literacy education for both kids and parents. Like it or not, our kids are digital natives. We must teach them how to live safely online.
At the same time, public officials can push tech companies to build platforms that default to safety and make shielding kids from harmful content a priority instead of an afterthought.
Wanting to protect children online is the most reasonable instinct in the world. But we shouldn’t trade privacy and free expression for a system that, in practice, may block the biggest players while leaving a maze of dangerous alternatives wide open.
If we’re going to intervene, we owe families solutions that actually reduce harm — not just ones that sound tough on paper.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/child-on-computer.jpeg,,,2025-12-09 06:57:27.290444

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)A panel of New Jersey lawmakers advanced legislation Monday that would give state health officials — instead of the feds — the final word on immunization schedules and recommendations in the Garden State.
Legislators were driven to act after a Centers for Disease Control committee on Friday reversed its decades-long recommendation that all newborns get hepatitis B vaccines at birth to protect Americans from the incurable liver disease, said Sen. Joseph Vitale (D-Middlesex), the legislation’s prime sponsor and chair of the Senate’s health committee.
“We here in New Jersey have the opportunity and obligation to protect our families,” Vitale said.
Federal judges affirm residency requirement in NJ’s assisted suicide law

Lawmakers merged the bill with another that would require insurers to cover, with no copay, the cost of vaccines the state Department of Health recommends. Supporters say the move is intended to eliminate any confusion among the public, physicians, and insurers that has resulted from the CDC’s changing recommendations and put health guidance from New Jersey’s health officials “at the forefront,” Vitale said.
His committee advanced the bill along party lines, after almost two hours of testimony in a packed Statehouse committee room that pitted doctors and other health professionals who support the bill against anti-vaccine advocates.
The physicians testified that vaccines save lives and are endorsed by all major medical associations.
The decision by the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to reverse its hepatitis B vaccine “caused great alarm throughout the medical community,” Dr. Jennifer H. Chuang told lawmakers.
The vaccine helped reduce the annual hepatitis B infection rate for infants and children from 16,000 cases when the vaccine was first recommended in 1991 to less than 20 now, said Chuang, a pediatrician, medical educator, and director of the residency program at St. Joseph’s Children’s Hospital in Paterson.
Chuang ticked off a grisly list of what people with liver disease endure, including abdominal pain, encephalopathy, and “bleeding from everywhere” because blood loses its ability to clot.
“Liver failure is a horrible disease. It strips one of dignity, and it is a horrible death. I cannot bear the thought of a young, innocent child needlessly carrying the burden of this awful disease,” Chuang said.
Anti-vaccine advocates accused the legislation’s supporters of playing politics and predicted state vaccine recommendations would become mandatory. They pointed to New Jersey’s nursing home deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic as a reason why they do not trust state health officials.
Alexandra Bougher, who heads a Bergen County Moms for Liberty chapter, warned that state vaccine recommendations would become “a standard families are expected to follow.”
“We cannot accept a system where one department can expand vaccine guidance or alter requirements without public debate, without scientific consensus, and without any built-in oversight. This is not good public health. This is unchecked power,” Bougher said, adding, “Parents deserve stability, not surprise mandates. They deserve informed consent, not forced compliance through bureaucratic shortcuts.”
Jeff Brown, New Jersey’s acting health commissioner, and his deputy, Novneet Sahu, who oversees public health services, said federal health officials are the ones changing vaccine guidance without scientific consensus or oversight.

Brown signed a directive Friday saying his department continues to recommend that all newborns receive a dose of the hepatitis B vaccine.
He told lawmakers Monday that the CDC’s immunization advisory committee had made “a departure from considering science and evidence and a movement towards, frankly, embracing pseudoscience.”
Sahu echoed that concern.
“We’re at a very critical moment in public health. Lies, pseudoscience, the spread of misinformation are major threats in our ability to protect the public’s health,” Sahu said. “When federal leaders fail and misinformation spreads, state policies must empower New Jerseyans.”
The committee’s three Republicans voted against the bill, with Sen. Holly Schepisi (R-Bergen) voicing concerns about state health guidance becoming mandatory as it did during the pandemic.
“We all just came out of the pandemic. Our governor has the strongest executive power in the nation. And during that period of time, there were mandates on vaccines. We saw nurses, police, prison guards, school teachers get fired, told they couldn’t go. Our own colleagues were threatened that they may not be able to come and do their job if they didn’t receive vaccines and show their vaccine cards,” Schepisi said. “I’m a no.”
The committee’s Democrats supported the legislation. Sen. John McKeon (D-Essex) told critics the bill is needed because federal health officials have abandoned “mainstream science.”
“I can go through the graveyards, before several vaccines were ever put into place, and look at the children that died, going back in the ’50s and early ‘60s,” McKeon said, prompting critics to grumble loudly in complaint.
He responded: “Well, those are facts. You know, facts are stubborn things.”
Monday was the legislation’s first hearing. Lawmakers have a narrow window to get it to Gov. Phil Murphy’s desk, because the current legislative session ends in mid-January.

Without the stewardship fund, projects to conserve 1,300 acres of Northwoods forest near the headwaters of the Wisconsin River in Vilas County, hundreds of acres of “ecologically significant” wetlands in Door County and dozens of acres of prairie and grassland in Dane County could go unfinished. 
“It’s a bit bleak and it’s so disheartening to know that there’s so many beautiful, wonderful places kind of on the chopping block right now all across the state,” says Emily Wood, executive director of the Door County Land Trust. “It’s not just us. We hear from our partners that there are hundreds and thousands of acres that are just not going to be protected if [the program] goes away, and that’s going to have such an impact, domino effect, on future generations.” 
The Knowles-Nelson Stewardship fund was created in 1989 to fund land conservation in Wisconsin. The program provides grants to local governments and non-profits to cover some of the costs for purchasing and conserving land that can be used for recreation, preserving animal habitats and supporting local industries such as forestry. 
The program enjoys massive bipartisan support, yet in recent years, some Republicans in the state Legislature — largely from communities in the northern part of the state — have grown hostile to it, claiming that the program has too often been used to fund the purchase of land up north, depleting local tax bases. 
Republican legislators have also complained that they no longer have oversight over the Department of Natural Resource’s management of the program after a Wisconsin Supreme Court decision last year found that the Legislature had given itself an unconstitutional veto authority over the DNR’s grant decisions. 
Several attempts have been made to save the program from expiring next summer. In his initial state budget proposal, Gov. Tony Evers asked to extend the program for ten years with $100 million in annual funding. Republicans stripped that provision from the budget immediately. 
Rep. Tony Kurtz (R-Wonewoc) and Sen. Patrick Testin (R-Stevens Point) have authored a bill that would extend the program for four years at $28 million per year. The bill also includes a provision that would require the full Legislature to approve any land purchases that cost more than $1 million — a proposal that critics say would be far too slow for the speed at which real estate transactions need to move. 
A separate proposal from Sen. Jodi Habush Sinykin (D-Whitefish Bay) would re-authorize the program for six years at $72 million per year and create an independent board made up of members appointed by the Legislature to approve large land purchases through the program. 
But there has been little progress made on advancing either proposal and now conservation groups are trying to plan for the next year without the support that Knowles-Nelson has traditionally provided.

Wood says that her organization is trying to protect the landscape in one of the most ecologically significant parts of the state. The challenge for her group is that Door County’s natural beauty draws tourists and increased development, yet too much development would damage the natural beauty. 
The Door County Land Trust has protected more than 5,000 acres of land in the county and Knowles-Nelson has covered half the cost in nearly every transaction, according to Wood. With the program shuttering next year, three projects totaling about $1 million — all of which scored highly on the DNR criteria — are at risk. 
“The county as a whole receives a ton of money from the Knowles-Nelson stewardship fund, because we are so geared towards tourism and access to natural resources,” she says.  The stewardship fund is critical for Door County to continue “to be the county that you know, everyone expects us to be when they get in the car and come up here.” 
Near the southern border of Dane County, Filip Sanna and the BadgerLand Foundation are working with the Driftless Area Land Conservancy and The Prairie Enthusiasts to protect and restore vital oak savannah and prairie in southern Wisconsin. 
Hundreds of years of agriculture have all but destroyed the native prairies in what was once one of the most ecologically diverse regions in the world.
The foundation has already conserved and gifted to the Driftless Area Land Conservancy hundreds of acres between Belleville and New Glarus that will soon be open to the public for hiking and hunting and used for sustainable practices such as regenerative agriculture. But future plans are threatened by the looming loss of stewardship funds. 
Recently, a tract of about 30 acres became available on the market within an area environmental groups have targeted as important for protecting grassland bird habitat. The Prairie Enthusiasts wanted to conserve the land but funds through the stewardship program wouldn’t be available fast enough. So the BadgerLand Foundation and the Prairie Enthusiasts reached an agreement in which the foundation would purchase the land and then sell it to the Prairie Enthusiasts once the stewardship grant comes through. 
Now those funds are uncertain and Sanna says it could sidetrack future plans.
One of the arguments Republican legislators have often made against the Knowles-Nelson program is that more populated areas in the southern part of the state should bear more of the land conservation burden. 
But the program dying off could jeopardize land conservation in the population centers because land is more expensive there. Dane County’s recently enacted 2026 budget doubled the size of the county’s conservation fund from $5 million to $10 million. That, Sanna says, can be a Band-aid for now. But county and local governments are facing their own budget challenges and smaller counties won’t be able to step into the DNR’s conservation shoes. In many places, the local governments are also dependent on stewardship program funds to conserve and maintain public land. 
“One of the responses we have to the uncertainty about Knowles-Nelson is to try to look to the county level and then some combination of county funding and private donations,” Sanna says. “That might work in Dane County, where we have a relatively strong tax base. But if you go to the neighboring counties around, Green and Iowa and Lafayette and all of those counties, that’s probably not an option.” 
“if [Knowles-Nelson] dies, the next step is going to be, now you’re going to have nice parks around all the wealthy people, but all the rest of Wisconsin that is smaller population centers that’ll just be like towns, rural housing, farmland, private land,” he continues. “There won’t be public land.” 
Way up in Vilas County, in the part of the state where the fight over land conservation has been most heated, a handful of administrative delays might end up killing a 1,300 acre conservation project because stewardship funds will no longer be available. 
The Northwoods Alliance and Partners in Forestry are working together to use federal and Knowles-Nelson funds to preserve two tracts of land west of the town of Land O’ Lakes. Joe Hovel, director of Partners in Forestry, says the project would include trails as part of the extensive Wilderness Lakes bike path system. 
Because the real estate deal on the project got delayed, and the slow speed at which the state and federal government have moved, it’s likely that the chance to use Knowles-Nelson dollars has already passed. 
Hovel says the complaints about land conservation up north discount the economic value of protecting the land for recreational uses. 
“It’s really short sighted in a sense that there isn’t enough respect for the recreational value of this land conservation stuff,” Hovel says. “The value of public access conservation land dwarfs, I mean it literally dwarfs, the value that timber revenue brings in.” 
A report from the Outdoor Recreation Roundtable found that recreation on federal public lands generates $128.5 billion in economic activity every year. All the logging on federal land generates $200-300 million per year.

The Legislature has just over six months to extend the program. Wood says it would be a self-inflicted wound if elected officials allow a program that other states look to as a model to expire. 
“It’s so disheartening to hear that the fund that has had so much success over the years, that other states look to how to fund conservation, they look to Wisconsin’s model on how to do it, and that we as a state, that same model is going to go down just because of partisan gridlock,” she says. “We really just need to keep it alive because funding it in a later year, or coming back and making changes to make it better are way more possible if it’s an existing program.” 
“But coming up with another one from scratch, it just seems like it would be an impossibility. So right now, it does feel like we are just screaming to keep it, just keep it alive. Just don’t kill it.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_1351-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-09 06:57:27.290444

DemasThe Michigan Department of Corrections has established a new policy to provide all confidential and legal mail sent to incarcerated individuals as photocopies in an attempt to stop drug smuggling, the department announced on Monday.
The policy is intended to stop incidents where drugs and contraband are smuggled to incarcerated people through tainted paper, envelopes, stickers or other means. 
“Illicit drugs have fundamentally changed over recent years to include synthetic sprays and strips which are easily added to paper and concealed in mail,” said Department of Corrections Director Heidi E. Washington in a release from the department. “These drugs pose a great risk to our staff and those living in our facilities; this is a commonsense policy that will reduce the chance of sickness and death by those who come in contact with these substances.”
A similar policy making it so all standard mail was photocopied was put into place in 2020, but up to now, legal and confidential mail — generally used by attorneys and legal organizations — was not included in that policy.

Last year, the Department of Corrections began using an online registration system for attorneys to send legal mail, known as TextBehind, where each piece of mail would have a unique QR code indicating that it was actually coming from an attorney.
Under the prior policies, the Michigan Bar Association wrote, “MDOC cannot open an inmate’s legal mail and must provide inmates with originals.” This update changes that, and correctional officers will open all mail and create a photocopy in front of the intended recipient before shredding the original. 
Legal mail, which has more protections than standard mail, will continue to meet confidentiality requirements, the Department of Corrections said. 
According to the ACLU, “Officials may open incoming privileged mail to check it for contraband, but must do so in your presence. They are not allowed to open outgoing privileged mail. Privileged mail ordinarily cannot be read unless prison officials obtain a warrant allowing them to do so.”
The new policy will go into effect on Jan. 5, 2026.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_2381-768x1024.jpg,,,2025-12-09 06:57:27.290444

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)A judge’s order blocking the Indiana Department of Health from releasing the reports that doctors file about individual abortions will remain in place under a state Court of Appeals decision.
A panel of three appeals court judges agreed unanimously with a Marion County judge that the records — known as terminated pregnancy reports — should be protected as confidential medical records.
Dr. Caitlin Bernard and Dr. Caroline Rouse, both Indianapolis OB-GYNs, sued in February to block release of the documents after the state healthy agency entered into a settlement agreement with South Bend-based Voices for Life. That agreement came out of the anti-abortion organization’s 2024 lawsuit against the Health Department, filed when the agency stopped releasing the individual reports but reversed itself after Gov. Mike Braun took office this year.
The decision written by Judge Mark Bailey cited the reprimand Bernard received in 2023 from the state Medical Licensing Board for publicly discussing the abortion she provided for a 10-year-old rape victim. 
Bernard’s statements then shared some of the same information, such as age, state of residence, gestational age and approximate date of treatment, that would be available from the terminated pregnancy reports.
“Defendants contend that TPRs are not patient medical records because they do not include the patient’s name,” the decision released Friday said of the Health Department. “But the absence of a patient’s name from a TPR does not make it something other than a patient medical record, just as the absence of a driver’s name from a Bureau of Motor Vehicles driving record does not make it something other than a driving record.”
Marion County judge blocks release of abortion records

Bernard and Rouse said in a statement released by their lawyers that they welcomed the court’s decision and its affirmation of our patients’ right to privacy.”
“Doctors cannot provide safe, ethical care when patients’ personal health information is at risk of being exposed,” their statement said. “This decision strengthens the safeguards that allow us to continue to provide evidence-based reproductive healthcare. We will continue to stand against any state or federal attempts to undermine the rights of patients and the doctors who care for them.” 
The state attorney general’s office, which is representing the Health Department in the case, did not immediately reply Monday to a request seeking comment.
The decision could be appealed to the Indiana Supreme Court.
The reports — redacted to protect patients — were released for years. Anti-abortion groups have filed complaints with the attorney general’s office based on the abortion reports, including if a doctor filed a report late. But the Health Department stopped releasing them after a near-total abortion ban meant far fewer abortions. They feared a woman could be identified, and instead released aggregate data released in quarterly reports. Those do not include the names of the doctors or dates of procedure.
Voices for Life argued that it was seeking the reports in order to monitor whether doctors were abiding by the state’s near-total abortion ban that was enacted in 2022.

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Immigration and Customs Enforcement has become the nation’s most expensive embarrassment — a bloated ($45 billion) bureaucracy that tears families apart, squanders millions, and undermines real law enforcement, all while pretending it’s “keeping us safe.” Spoiler alert: As everyone is witnessing in real time on the streets of Los Angeles, Chicago, Minneapolis, and New Orleans, it isn’t. Washington won’t fix this. If justice is coming, it will have to be delivered by people who actually care about our communities, not politicians polishing their egos.
  ICE’s Dangerous Overreach 

Let’s get real. ICE isn’t hunting violent criminals. Less than one percent of its arrests involve rape, kidnapping, or homicide. The rest? Students, children, farmworkers, parents, veterans’ family members — basically anyone inconvenient enough to get in the way of headline-grabbing deportations. This is political theater, neither law enforcement nor justice.
This isn’t “law and order.” It’s cruelty with a badge. Meanwhile, the truly dangerous — drug lords, human traffickers, organized criminals,— keep doing their thing while ICE plays detention bingo. If there were a trophy for the most misdirected law enforcement agency, ICE would win by a landslide.
  A Culture of Corruption 

Inside ICE, misconduct is practically a perk. Officers have been arrested for assault, sexual assault, and child pornography. Senior officials? Accused of bribery and cover-ups. And yet Washington showers them with billions of taxpayer dollars, as if bad behavior deserves a bonus.
Imagine a local police department with that record. Would we put up with it for a second? Of course not. But ICE hides behind federal power, while politicians look away and mutter prayers for “law and order.” They call this oversight. In reality, it is a daily denial of justice.  It’s fascism with gusto.
  Detention for Profit 

Before 1983, the U.S. detained about 35 immigrants a year. Today, ICE plans to cage 107,000 at a cost of $15 billion. Ninety percent of these beds are run by private prison companies like GEO Group and CoreCivic, whose lucrative business model ($1.5 billion in revenue) depends on no-bid contracts keeping cells full.
Most detainees — more than 70 percent — have no criminal record. But who cares when misery is profitable? America has become the land of the fee, where suffering is commodified and corporate boards cheer.
  What States and Cities Can Do 

Here’s the kicker: We don’t have to wait for Congress to grow a spine. Local and state governments have the power — and the moral duty — to act:


Prosecute ICE misconduct. Assault, kidnapping, false imprisonment? Charge them like the New York Attorney General and San Francisco District Attorney promise to do. No badge should be a free pass.


Restrict operations.  Ban masked agents like California, limit guns near schools, hospitals, and churches, and outlaw the feds from buying warrantless cell phone data.  In March 2025, Trump directed Palantir to provide its data profiles on all Americans to federal agencies.  In May, Montana banned its state law enforcement from buying this data.  Every state should ban the feds from having our data, too.


Use zoning and taxes. Regulate leases with ICE like Portland. Pass new “nuisance” ordinances to bar the use of tear gas and bar the congregation of any groups in excess of three people in masks. Deny permits for detention centers, hit landlords who lease to ICE with steep fines, and use the funds for legal defense for detainees.


Cut off the profit. End contracts with private prisons. Divest public funds from companies profiting from human misery.


  What We Must Do 

Every level of government has a role. Every citizen has a responsibility. Demand action from your attorney general, county attorney, and city council. Push your representatives to slash ICE’s budget and inspect detention centers without warning.
And if local leaders shrug? Remind them that silence isn’t neutrality — it’s complicity. ICE isn’t just violating laws; it’s trampling on morality, decency, and basic human dignity.
The tools exist. The moral imperative is obvious. The only question: Do we have the guts to use them?
Because when Washington hides under its desk, it falls to us to stand up. And if ICE won’t melt from shame, we’ll just turn up the heat — preferably to a level that makes everyone in the bureaucracy sweat.
After all, ICE may be full of hot air, but our communities have the fire.

(Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A Democratic candidate in eastern Nebraska’s 1st Congressional District brought in a six-figure fundraising haul in the first 30 days of the campaign, Chris Backemeyer’s campaign announced Tuesday.
The $120,000 haul is $8,547 less than former State Sen. Carol Blood of Bellevue raised for her 2024 bid against incumbent Republican U.S. Rep. Mike Flood. Blood raised $29,203 in her first fundraising quarter during that race.

The former U.S. State Department diplomat, who now lives in Lincoln, entered the race last month. He is in a Democratic primary with Lincoln resident and renewable energy advocate Eric Moyer. The winner likely faces Flood in November. Flood hasn’t drawn a GOP challenger. 
“Nebraskans are ready for new leadership, and this early response shows we have the team, the momentum, and the pathway to flip this seat,” Backemeyer said in a statement. 
The 1st District comprises 12 Nebraska counties, including heavily Democratic Lincoln in Lancaster County, the votes of which are often overcome by the region’s more conservative rural areas. 
Flood has won his past two elections by 20 and roughly 16 percentage points, in a seat considered safely Republican by the nonpartisan Center for Politics, The Cook Political Report and Inside Elections.

Moyer told the Examiner that people “should be skeptical of any unofficial ‘boasts’ about fundraising.” Moyer said his campaign “is completely funded by small donations and zero PAC money,” which allows him “to be a truly independent voice for the people of Nebraska.” 
“Money doesn’t vote,” Moyer said. “People do.”
Both Moyer and Flood declined to show their current fundraising numbers as fundraising reports are still being finalized with the Federal Election Commission. The next FEC deadline is the end of the first month of 2026. 
According to the latest federal campaign finance reports filed last month, Moyer raised $5,496 and had $3,848 in cash on hand. Flood’s last filings listed  $1 million cash on hand, according to his campaign finance reports. The most recent reports have not yet been filed. 
Daniel Bass, a spokesperson for the Flood campaign, said Backemeyer’s “neighbors in Washington are funding his run for Congress because they know he will fight for D.C. values: high crime, high taxes and out-of-touch leadership.”
The primary election is on May 12.

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Even with a crowded Democratic primary field, gubernatorial hopeful Mandela Barnes told reporters Monday that he is focusing his efforts on the Republican candidate he might face in November 2026 and he has raised a “strong haul” in the first week of his campaign.
Barnes, a former lieutenant governor and U.S. Senate candidate, visited Black Saddle Bike Shop (where he said he’s often had his bike serviced) on the North Side of Madison. The stop was part of Barnes’ “Wisconsin Way” tour, launched last week after he announced his campaign. He has joined a field of candidates in the Democratic primary that includes Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez, Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley, Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation Missy Hughes, state Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison), state Rep. Francesca Hong (D-Madison) and former state Rep. Brett Hulsey.
Barnes said his fundraising so far is “something that’ll make my mom proud,” though he wouldn’t expand on how much money he has raised. He said his goal will be to raise $50 million in the race overall, though he also criticized the need to raise so much. 
Barnes noted that during Gov. Tony Evers’ successful second bid for the office, Evers spent around $42 million to defeat Republican businessman Tim Michels, who spent $28.48 million. A record-breaking $164 million was spent in 2022 on Wisconsin’s gubernatorial race.
“It’s not a good sign for things. I wish that were not the case. The goal is to get big money out of politics. The goal is for campaign and ethics reform,” Barnes said, adding that reform is needed at both  the state and federal levels. “We should be taking more steps to reduce the impact of money in politics,” he said.
Barnes said the first week of the campaign has been exciting, and he has been trying to talk to as many people as possible. He spoke with bike shop owner Mitch Pilon about rising costs under President Donald Trump and the effects of tariffs. 
“With an absence of support from the federal government, even if the state doesn’t have all the resources to make it better, at least staving off some of the worst from happening, I fully believe that’s a responsibility of state government,” he told Pilon, adding that he wants to help “tip the scales back into the favor of working people.” 
Pilon, who opened the shop in February 2020, said making ends meet has been a challenge for him and his partner, who is a social worker.
“In Wisconsin, after 10 years, your student loans should be absolved, which they’re not going to be now, and she has a master’s degree… that’s $100,000 in debt at social worker’s compensation,” Pilon said. The Trump administration has sought to upend student loan forgiveness programs this year. “I own a small business. I work really hard… we can’t afford a house.” 
“[Trump] promised to lower costs for people,” Barnes told reporters after the conversation. “He said he was going to bring back manufacturing to this country, specifically to this state. It hasn’t happened. As people continue to feel the pinch, tough decisions are being made.” 
Barnes said he got into the race because of the urgency of those sorts of challenges. 
“It’s a critical moment that calls for leadership. It calls for boldness, to not just take on the president, but to also offer real solutions for the problems that people are facing,” Barnes said. “So this is one of many small businesses that we’ll be showing up to… over the course of this campaign.” 
Pilon also asked Barnes about one of the obstacles that his campaign will need to overcome — his failed challenge to U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson in 2022. Barnes has faced pushback to his campaign due to that loss. 
“We lost the Senate race…” Pilon said. “How do you get over that? How do you rise above that?”
Barnes responded that he didn’t get into the race for “personal reasons.”
“I got into it because there was work that needed to be done,” Barnes said. “I don’t feel like the job is being done and, alright, that’s a wakeup call to go out there and raise my hand and do the job.” 
“How do you change people’s minds?” Pilon asked. 
“A lot of it is personal stories and experience,” Barnes said. 
It has been rare for candidates in Wisconsin to succeed in winning a statewide race after an earlier loss. Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette Law School poll, found in an analysis of previous governor and U.S. Senate election results that the last time a candidate won one of those statewide campaigns after losing a previous one was in the 1970s. Examples of failed second chances include Tom Barrett, who lost bids for governor in 2010 and 2012, Tim Michels, who lost to Evers in 2022 after he lost a bid for the Senate in 2004, and Russ Feingold, who lost Senate races in 2010 and 2016.
Barnes is undeterred by the precedent. 
“There’s a lot of history that would suggest I wouldn’t ever become lieutenant governor,” Barnes said in answer to a question about Franklin’s second-change analysis. “There’s also, you know, in terms of historical precedent, I don’t know that there is a precedent that suggests anybody on the Democratic or Republican side has a better chance of winning.”
Barnes ran for the Democratic lieutenant governor nomination in 2018 in a two-person race, going on to win on the same ticket as Gov. Tony Evers. He was elected and served as the state’s youngest and first Black lieutenant governor from 2019 to 2023. 
Wisconsin’s gubernatorial race next year is wide open for the first time since 2010.
During the 2022 Senate race, Barnes became the Democratic nominee after other high-profile candidates dropped out weeks before the primary.
Barnes denied he helped push the other Democrats out of the race then. He also said primaries are good for democracy when asked whether he wants other candidates to coalesce around him.
“I think it should be a battle of ideas, whether it’s a large primary or not, but would never that’s never been my style to try to get anybody out of any race,” Barnes said. “As you know, from the way I got in, I showed up by challenging someone in a primary election, so it’d be very hypocritical of me to suggest anybody get out.”
Barnes previously served in the Wisconsin State Assembly for two terms from 2013 to 2017. He gave up his seat in the state Assembly in 2016 to challenge former State Sen. Lena Taylor (D-Milwaukee). He lost the primary by more than 11,000 votes.
Barnes said his campaign will be focused not just on unifying Democrats but on a “unifying message to defeat extremists and extremism.” 
“It does not matter what your favorite ideology might be, there’s a place for you in this campaign because it is about improving quality of life for everybody,” Barnes said. 
With about 10 months until the primary, Barnes said he’ll be focused on the Republican candidates in the race. U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany is the presumed frontrunner for the Republican nomination. 
“This is about pointing out flaws and failures, and Tom Tiffany as he stands as the front runner, his failures and leadership, his decisions to go lock-step with the president who has made things worse for Wisconsin,” Barnes said. “Tom Tiffany didn’t go to Washington to make things better for us, and we shouldn’t expect him to improve things for us as governor.” 
The primary election is scheduled for Aug. 11, 2026.

(Getty Images)Indiana officials on Thursday announced a nearly $75 million public–private investment aimed at strengthening literacy, STEM education, summer learning and career pathways for Hoosier students.
The effort includes $40 million from Lilly Endowment Inc. and $35 million in state funding. Indiana Secretary of Education Katie Jenner described the initiative as one of the largest combined education commitments in state history.
“This funding will yield tremendous value for Hoosier students, educators, and families,” Jenner said in the announcement. “By aligning public dollars with funds from Lilly Endowment, we are better able to scale what works, address persistent challenges, and build the statewide infrastructure our students deserve. This funding will help our efforts to ensure that every child — no matter their ZIP code — has access to the high-quality learning opportunities that set them up for future success.”
Much of the investment targets literacy. Ten million dollars from the Lilly Endowment will expand the state’s K-5 Literacy Cadre, a program state officials credit, in part, with helping drive recent improvements in third-grade I-READ scores.

The new funding will support staffing for the Indiana Department of Education’s Literacy Center; recruitment and training of instructional coaches; statewide professional development; and research and evaluation. The Lilly Endowment previously provided a $60 million grant for similar literacy work in 2022.
Another $5 million will go toward adolescent literacy through “outcomes-based contracting,” allowing schools to partner with vendors that specialize in evidence-based reading interventions for grades 6–8.
The plan also includes $1 million for a statewide STEM “Landscape Analysis” to assess strengths and gaps in STEM education and develop recommendations to improve Indiana’s workforce pipeline, as well as $500,000 for a career-advising study to evaluate existing practices and design updated tools to help students explore career options.
Summer Learning Labs, a statewide network focused on academic recovery and enrichment, will receive $15 million to expand regional coordination, professional development, data systems and other supports during the next two years. Indiana Learns, the state’s microgrant program for individualized tutoring and enrichment in reading and math, will additionally receive $5 million in continued support.
Another $2 million will sustain INSPIRE, Indiana’s free statewide digital library, and a separate $1.5 million will strengthen IDOE’s capacity to implement these initiatives.
Indiana’s $35 million match comes from the Freedom and Opportunity Fund — a $50 million-per-year education fund created by the Indiana Legislature earlier this year to support literacy, tutoring, STEM and other high-priority student initiatives.
The state portion includes $10 million for elementary literacy; $1.5 million for adolescent literacy; $14.5 million for Summer Learning Labs; and $9 million for Indiana Learns.
“Lilly Endowment is especially pleased to help build on the momentum of efforts to enhance reading instruction in Indiana … ,” said N. Clay Robbins, the foundation’s chairman and CEO. “We are encouraged by the state’s commitment to improving STEM education and career advising and expanding effective year-round tutoring programs to improve student learning in reading and math.”

Proponents see Bridger-Teton National Forest project as a novel approach to keep vital forest workers close to the lands they manage. Critics see a “slippery slope.”
The post Forest Service looks to public land, local tax dollars to house its workers appeared first on WyoFile .","The Bridger-Teton National Forest has had so much trouble housing workers that it once considered moving its headquarters out of Jackson to escape the tight, high-priced real estate market. 
Now, the Forest Service is partnering with a nonprofit to build affordable rentals on 3.15 acres owned by the forest, an approach supporters say could serve as a national model for how to house federal workers on the lands they manage.
“I think the sense of urgency right now is greater than it’s ever been,” said Chad Hudson, supervisor of the Bridger-Teton National Forest.
While many embrace the concept as a way to keep vital workers in the valley with roughly half-priced rent, some worry it opens the door to privatizing cherished public lands. 
“The slippery slope of using federally protected wildland to expand the urban boundary of Jackson in order to subsidize housing that includes private sector employees is frankly terrifying for the future of Jackson Hole,” said Judd Grossman, a neighbor to the project, former Jackson Town Council candidate and self-described “no-growth libertarian.”
Grossman shared his concerns with a full room at the Jackson Town Council’s Nov. 30 meeting. But his resistance stood in stark contrast to the council, whose members signaled support for investing a little over $4 million of sales tax funds, earmarked for housing, in exchange for the right to rent six of 36 proposed units to town employees. Teton County has the same offer but has yet to consider the project, which sits next to existing Forest Service housing, the National Elk Refuge and a popular trailhead on the eastern edge of Jackson.
The Jackson Hole Community Housing Trust touts the project as a first of its kind in the nation and much-needed. Of more than 1,500 people on the affordable housing nonprofit’s waitlist, 114 are town or county employees.
Housing Trust Director Anne Cresswell said the project could break ground in April 2026 with modular units delivered by October. That timeline would be more likely if the housing nonprofit secures a combined $8.1 million from the town and county. It’s the last bit of funding needed to push the $33 million development over the finish line, she said.

The project will move forward with or without funds from the town and county, Cresswell said, albeit more slowly. 
She’s eyeing funds restricted to rentals for town and county employees. 
In 2022, Teton County voters passed a record-breaking $166 million in Specific Purpose Excise Tax initiatives to be collected over about 10 years in the tourism-driven county. About half — $80 million — in sales tax revenue is going to housing in some form. For example, St. John’s Health will receive $24 million, with half of that going to a nearly $54 million project to build 72 apartments for employees across from the hospital. 
Voters also approved $20 million for town and county employee housing — $10 million for each entity. The request to support the Bridger-Teton project comes as the same pot of money is being mulled for a much larger housing complex, this one from the town and county’s housing department. 
“So any money we allocate to this project would not be available to the Virginian Lane project or other projects,” Town Manager Tyler Sinclair said.
But Housing Director April Norton said there’s a good chance that over 200 homes planned for 90 Virginian Lane, which is facing a $17 million funding gap, would not require Specific Purpose Excise Tax funds. And if “The Virg” does need to dip into the same pool, she said the department would ask for a maximum of $5 million each from the town and county. Funding both projects would leave just shy of $1 million in SPET for each. 
“It could be ‘both, and,’” Norton said.  
Steep cost to stay put
Since at least 2008, the Forest Service has considered building office space and additional employee housing at Nelson Drive next to existing homes for federal workers. Around the same time, the agency was debating whether to keep its main office building in Jackson or move the headquarters to Alpine, Pinedale or Afton where workers would have better odds of securing housing. 
In 2012, the Forest Service chose to build its new administrative building in Jackson on the same site where the old building stood, nestled against the National Elk Refuge at the northern entrance into town. It’s locked them into figuring out how to house their workforce in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, where real estate prices have only become more extreme.
But Hudson, leading the Bridger-Teton National Forest, said it’s a price they’re willing to pay. 
“I think that’s where we belong,” Hudson said.
Hudson said the more than 3-million-acre forest is key to one of the last nearly intact temperate ecosystems in the world. 
“We’re a big player,” Hudson said. 
Being in Jackson allows managers to form relationships across state and federal agencies in the Greater Yellowstone area.
To pay for a new administrative building, the Forest Service sold 10 acres of its public land to private developers for $12 million. Brothers Jim and Kirk Hansen, of the Idaho Falls company Conrad and Bischoff, bought the land and built Hidden Hollow, Jackson’s largest planned development since Cottonwood Park. Over time, the project morphed from ownership units to rentals, many deed-restricted as workforce or affordable.
“But we did not make much progress when it came to our housing, and we’re in a situation now where we’re struggling to maintain a viable workforce,” Hudson said. 
Today, many Bridger-Teton employees continue to commute to Jackson. Others, who should work in Jackson but can’t afford housing, crowd the Pinedale district office.
“If we don’t look outside the box, these kinds of housing units won’t get built.” Jackson Mayor Arne Jorgensen
Proponents see housing on the eastern edge of Jackson as part of the solution.
The Forest Service and Housing Trust unveiled plans for 36 modular rentals at the Nelson Drive trailhead for the first time this fall. The Forest Service issued a 30-year special-use permit for the Housing Trust to construct and manage the modular homes on the federally protected public land.
The permit is an alternative to an outright sale.
“Just like we do for ski resorts,” Hudson said, “they submit an annual operating plan that we approve every year. So we’re still actively engaged in the management of those particular lands.”
Why now?
The Bridger-Teton first approved housing at the Nelson Drive trailhead over a decade ago as part of an environmental review of the sale to Hidden Hollow developers. It’s taken this long to find the right partners and raise the capital, according to Hudson.
“Any kind of affordable housing project in Jackson is incredibly challenging,” Hudson said. “So it has to be subsidized to a certain extent, in this case quite a bit.”
Political will, at least for the town council’s part, also seems strong. 
“This is something novel and exciting,” Councilor Kevin Regan said. “It’s a chance for the Forest Service and Community Housing Trust to serve as thought leaders for this community, this region, and potentially nationally.”
Mayor Arne Jorgensen, a founding board member of the Housing Trust, called the project an innovative solution to leverage local dollars to provide housing for an underfunded Forest Service.
“If we don’t look outside the box, these kinds of housing units won’t get built,” Jorgensen said.
Last chance to weigh in
The federal project is exempt from local development regulations or public comment processes. Recent public reaction has come out in the conversation about financing and it’s been mixed. 
This summer’s congressional effort to sell Western federal public lands, which sparked nationwide pushback, has many leery of private influence on public lands. 
Jackson Hole Conservation Alliance Advocacy Director Catherine Hughes noted the debate at the November meeting, where the town council was poised to vote on spending $4.05 million on the development.
“This project risks paving the way for the same solution just starting at a smaller scale,” Hughes said. “Our community can respond to the need for housing responsibly and protect public lands from a death by a thousand cuts.”
Others have cited traffic, environmental degradation and a potential precedent of sacrificing public lands for development. Grossman said neighbors had long been told the housing would be for federal workers, but the current proposal includes private sector employees too.
If the town and county don’t opt in, the number of private-sector employees could be even greater. One nonprofit, which Cresswell declined to name last week, has committed $3.5 million to the project for its employees. Eligible families still have to meet income and asset limits.
Proponents see the project as a model for housing public employees on the lands they steward. Chris Finlay serves on the Jackson Hole Community Housing Trust board and recently retired after a 32-year career with the National Park Service, over half of that time managing facilities in Grand Teton National Park. During his tenure, the Park Service struggled to build new facilities due to a multi-million-dollar maintenance backlog, he said. 
“Every time we build a new facility, we typically don’t get enough money to maintain those facilities,” Finlay said. “We’re contributing to this deferred maintenance backlog and that’s really why the Park Service is pretty opposed to developing new facilities.”
With the Housing Trust as the permit holder, the Forest Service wouldn’t have to worry about maintenance costs piling up. 
The Jackson Town Council will revisit whether to spend $4.05 million on the project when it meets Dec. 15.

Churches can and should serve those in need, but as a supplement to state-funded programs that help people regardless of their faith, writes columnist Kerry Drake. 
The post Beware of budget cuts that envision churches in charge of social safety net appeared first on WyoFile .","It’s no secret the Wyoming Freedom Caucus wants to slash the state Department of Health’s budget. Now, thanks to a Wyoming Public Radio interview with Rep. John Bear, R-Gillette, we know precisely why.

Opinion

As “chairman emeritus” of the far-right Freedom Caucus that controls the House, Bear’s religious roadmap to change some of the Department of Health’s core missions is frightening.
Bear is also co-chairman of the Joint Appropriations Committee, the powerful panel that oversees the state budget.
He apparently thinks there’s no wall of separation between the church and state that’s guaranteed in the First Amendment, at least not in Wyoming. Bear believes the Legislature would benefit from more Christian lawmakers who think alike and share his moral values.
Bear wants churches to lead some aspects of state government, like mental health and welfare programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. He also thinks churches would do a bang-up job on other government responsibilities such as unemployment benefits.
“When I look at the secular effort for suicide prevention today, it is woefully inadequate,” Bear said. “Woefully inadequate. The reason is because it’s never bringing in that truth that creates hope. Suicide comes from hopelessness.”
Bear voted against a 2021 bill that would have required schools to adopt suicide prevention training. He also opposed a 2023 bill that established a trust fund for the new “988” suicide lifeline.
I’m not suggesting that churches don’t have an important role in helping people who are considering taking their own lives. Churches also distribute food to those who need it, and that’s a great use of their resources.
But the religious community shouldn’t have control over SNAP, unemployment benefits or mental health programs. The fact that Bear and so many members of the Freedom Caucus voted against putting more mental health counselors in schools  is outrageous, especially in light of his comments to WPR.

Bear said in an ideal world, he’d like Wyoming to focus less on mental health programs and psychiatry. He claimed the latter takes “a Marxist view of humanity.”
I don’t know why Bear has it in for the Department of Health. He appointed a three-person JAC subcommittee to examine the department’s budget at a series of public meetings and report back to the full panel.
The subcommittee was chaired by a Freedom Caucus member, Rep. Ken Pendergraft, R-Sheridan, and had a Senate ally of the caucus, Sen. Dan Laursen, R-Powell. With the department’s $2.2 billion biennial budget targeted by Bear, I shudder to think about potentially devastating cuts to health services.
There will be time to focus on the Appropriation Committee’s version of the budget from now through the next session, which convenes Feb. 9. Wyomingites should share any concerns to the committee and their legislators.
But voters should pay attention to how Bear views Wyoming’s government and how it could be improved if only more people would go to church (as long as it’s a Christian church with God-fearing people) to keep the devil at bay.
“Number one, we need to draw a line in the sand,” Bear said. “We’re not going to go down this path any further.”
What guides his decision-making?
“Number one is morality,” Bear explained. “And then if it’s not a moral issue, then I go with the constitution. Is it constitutional or not?”
If there’s no issue with those two, he said he goes “with the preponderance of my constituency.”
Does Bear give any weight to the concerns of anyone but Christians who share his views? According to him, it’s the Freedom Caucus members’ alignment on moral values that gives the group its power.
“You need to have good Christians in office,” Bear said. “Not that to be in office, you have to be a Christian, but as Christians, we should try to get as many Christians in office as possible.”

When Bear describes state government, he sees a straight path to the Freedom Caucus obtaining the ability to pass its conservative agenda, and it begins with more people attending church.
“From my point of view, we’ve taken 100 years to get to this point,” Bear said. “That’s not going to be an easy, quick solution, because basically you’ve got to cut taxes and put the money back in people’s pockets, right? Those people have to actually start going to church. So there needs to be revival.”
How about a revival of the separation of church and state? The United States was not, as Bear and many others believe, founded as a Christian nation. Freedom of religion guarantees the right to freely exercise one’s faith and to be free from government imposition of religion.
What former President Jimmy Carter said gets to the heart of the influence of the Freedom Caucus: “There’s no doubt that the Christian right has gone to bed with the more conservative elements of the Republican Party. And there’s been a melding in their goals when it comes to the separation of church and state.”
And from constitutional scholar and comedian George Carlin: “I’m completely in favor of the separation of church and state. My idea is that these two institutions screw us up on their own, so both of them together is certain death.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)The pieces are coming together for work to start on a new Tennessee Performing Arts Center as part of a massive project on Nashville’s East Bank.
Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell and TPAC, a nonprofit entity, recently reached an agreement enabling the arts center to relocate from the James K. Polk Building at the corner of Deaderick Boulevard across from the War Memorial Plaza to Metro property at the base of the Seigenthaler Pedestrian Bridge, an area now used for Tennessee Titans parking.
The State Building Commission approved a $200 million grant for the TPAC project in 2023 and is expected to authorize another $300 million for the job now that a deal has been reached. TPAC is to raise another $100 million from private sources.
A Piedmont Gas pipeline is to be moved before ground work can start on the building in early 2027 with completion slated around 2030.
“This agreement ensures Metro and TPAC will partner on related infrastructure costs and advances a key piece of the East Bank redevelopment,” O’Connell said in a statement.
TPAC, which will be an anchor for the East Bank area along the Cumberland River, will share infrastructure costs with Metro and allow it to use the center for educational purposes under the agreement. 
Outgoing Nashville official defends East Bank development contract

House Speaker Cameron Sexton, who serves on the East Bank Development Authority Board, urged a 2030 completion date.
“I appreciate Mayor O’Connell personally taking over the negotiations with TPAC and getting a deal done,” Sexton said in a statement. “This is a significant milestone for our state and Nashville to compete as a vibrant performing arts community. TPAC will be a valued addition to the East Bank and Lower Broad area that will enhance the entertainment district.”
Sexton this fall criticized Metro Nashville chief development officer Bob Mendes’ negotiation of a development contract with Boston-based Fallon Company that he said was too favorable to the company and cost the local government money. Mendes left the post in late October.
TPAC is contributing $24 million to infrastructure costs, including $15.8 million for Victory Drive and Davidson Road improvements, utilities and connection to the pedestrian bridge. Metro will cover other infrastructure expenses related to the pedestrian bridge and a greenway connector.
Previous estimates had TPAC’s share of expenses at $67.6 million.
Cost overruns are to be paid by TPAC, which is being required to meet project deadlines. The arts center also will use Metro-owned parking at market rates.
Amid the TPAC-Metro deal, construction workers recently raised the final beam on a $2.1 billion enclosed stadium being built next to the old Titans stadium. It is to open in 2027. 
The Metro Nashville Council unanimously approved a 99-year lease deal with Fallon for 30 city-owned acres in April 2024. The property could have reverted to Fallon if Metro Nashville and TPAC hadn’t reached an agreement.
In addition, tech giant Oracle is to build a campus on 60 acres in the area after receiving a $175 million economic incentive grant from Metro.
Fallon is responsible for building 1,550 residential units on the property, 695 of which are to be designated as “affordable,” meaning they will be priced for those at 30-80% of the median income.

(Courtesy photos)A decorated West Virginia veteran has called for the two National Guard members shot in Washington, D.C., to receive a Purple Heart award.
U.S. Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died on Thanksgiving as a result of her injuries, and U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, remains in the hospital with severe wounds.  
The pair were ambushed Nov. 25 while on duty blocks from the White House while hundreds of Guard members were in D.C. for President Donald Trump’s “Operation D.C. Safe and Beautiful.” 
“This was an act of terrorism. This was premeditated,” said Retired U.S. Army Capt. James L. McCormick, a three-time Purple Heart recipient from New Haven, West Virginia, who is making a push for Beckstrom and Wolfe to receive the award.
“I pray to God Almighty that they get the Purple Heart, and that those that heroically stood up and fought off this guy that they’re properly recognized,” he said.
McCormick believes that the nature of the targeted attack on Beckstrom and Wolfe makes them worthy of receiving the Purple Heart, a military honor given to military members injured or killed while serving.
An Afghan national, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, 29, was charged with one count of murder after the attack on the Guard members, as well as two counts of assault with the intent to kill, and a count of possession of a firearm during a crime of violence. Lakanwal pleaded not guilty.
McCormick received his Purple Hearts while participating in Operation Iraqi Freedom II and III in 2004. He suffered multiple gunshot wounds and injuries from a roadside bomb blast within five months. 
He previously served as the national commander of the Military Order of the Purple Heart and now sits on the organization’s board. 
A Purple Heart designation comes with benefits that include priority for medical care from the VA, home loan benefits, employment preference and more. McCormick noted that a Purple Heart award includes benefits for deceased veterans’ families, which could be used by Beckstrom’s family.
As Gov. Patrick Morrisey has come under scrutiny for deploying Guard members to D.C., McCormick said the debate about the mission shouldn’t detract from honoring Beckstrom and Wolfe. 
“People like Sarah Beckstrom were defending not only the rights of the innocent people here, but she was also defending the rights of these people to be able to peacefully protest,” McCormick said.
Public or elected officials could reach out to the Department of War to push for the Purple Heart designation, McCormick said. Trump and military department secretaries have the authority to award the Purple Heart. 
“They did a great service. Who knows how many lives that they saved?” McCormick said. 
Beckstrom’s family has asked that in lieu of flowers to remember her life, donations be made to the Nicholas County Humane Society or the Wounded Warrior Project.
Funeral services for Beckstrom will be private.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)A coalition dubbed Restore Our Fairgrounds is calling for a voter referendum to block NASCAR-style racing in favor of affordable housing and green space at the Fairgrounds in South Nashville, the latest measure in a two-decade effort to strip auto racing from the property.
The group said it filed paperwork Monday with the Metro Clerk to start a charter amendment ending auto racing at the Metro Nashville Fairgrounds amid rumors about Mayor Freddie O’Connell and Speedway Motorsports negotiating a deal for NASCAR-type expansion. The group says resumption of car races would hurt local taxpayers and cause more traffic and noise. 
If successful, the amendment would undo a 2011 referendum that amended the charter to protect existing uses of the Fairgrounds, including auto racing. The measure passed with 72% of voters approving it. 
That’s lawsuit number four: Metro Nashville draws another lawsuit in Fairgrounds Speedway deal

Metro Nashville voters would have to vote in favor of a referendum to end racing at the Fairgrounds, which was home to different types of racing for more than 100 years.
The group supports the preservation of green space, development of affordable housing and improvements to nearby Brown’s Creek, a tributary to Cumberland River on the federal EPA list of polluted waterways.
Multiple Nashville groups, such as Belmont Hillsboro Neighbors, NOAH Economic Equity, Jobs & Transportation Task Force and South Nashville Action People (SNAP) are part of the coalition.
Mike Kopp, co-founder of Fairgrounds Preservation Partners, is among those signing the petition, along with Metro Council member Terry Vo, Heidi Basgall-Favorite, founder of Neighbors Opposing Track Expansion, and Jose Gonzales, co-found of Conexion Americas.
Cars raced on a dirt track at the Fairgrounds into the late 1950s until NASCAR’s Cup Series ran there until 1984. Xfinity and Truck races remained until 25 years ago.

(Photo courtesy of Panhandle Special Needs Inc.)Andrew Rogers is 33 years old, lives in an apartment in Sandpoint, works at the local Safeway store and is self-sufficient.
It’s a “normal” lifestyle by any measure – something that didn’t appear to be possible 12 years ago. Autism didn’t hold back Andrew, and his life changed for the better when Panhandle Special Needs Inc. entered the picture.
As he explains, “It opened doors for things I couldn’t do. I learned how to manage a budget, shop, do housecleaning, how to cook different foods and how to do laundry.”
Megan Albertson, administrative assistant for Panhandle Special Needs, saw a much different person in 2013.
“When he first came to us, he struggled with anxiety, depression, low self-esteem and a fear of anything new. And that was in addition to his diagnosis of mild intellectual disability with a development age of about eight and a half years,” she said. “His parents were convinced he faced significant barriers to independence and would never be able to live on his own.”
Living on his own didn’t happen overnight – the Panhandle Special Needs staff spent many hours, and Andrew spent a lot of classroom time, learning the basics of independent living. In 2017, he moved into his own apartment – beaming with pride – and by 2018 his goal was met.
“He proved to himself, his parents and our staff that he was fully capable of independent living, just like we knew he could,” says Albertson. “We continued to challenge him with more advanced skills – things like portion control, problem solving and cooking complex meals.”
Andrew’s parents moved to Arizona three years ago, and Andrew went with them for a brief period. He decided that he wanted to move back to Sandpoint.
“I couldn’t get into an apartment – it was literally impossible,” he said. “I couldn’t get a job and they didn’t have services for people with my level of disability. Here, they have everything.”
Look at him now, says Albertson. “He’s here, living 100 percent independently.”
Andrew’s is not the only success story within Panhandle Special Needs. The Sandpoint-based nonprofit organization has been around for 50 years, serving people with disabilities in Bonner and Boundary counties. Trinity Nicholson, the executive director for 25 years, has on file a long list of testimonials from participants, caregivers and even staff members who sing praises about the work environment. It all speaks well of the value of Panhandle Special Needs and Nicholson’s leadership.
PSNI serves about 200 clients a year, offering a wide range of services and employment opportunities. There are not a lot of places like this. Board members are unpaid and funding predominantly comes from Medicaid, with in-house programs providing some revenue. As with nonprofits in general, private donations play a big part in the service’s viability.
“We see people moving here from other states to get services,” Nicholson says. “We serve families, not just individuals. As demands grow, we don’t want to be just OK in doing a lot of things. We want to be really good at providing services.”
In the process, Bonner and Boundary counties are a better place to live. Over decades, Panhandle Special Needs has served scores of disabled people and, in many cases, sparing families from severe financial hardships. Andrew Rogers has an idea how his life would be without this service.
“I’d be living with my parents for the rest of my life.”

The North Dakota Constitution requires at least four of five justices to find a state law unconstitutional. (Pool photo by Tanner Ecker/Bismarck Tribune)An unusual clause in the North Dakota Constitution that limits the power of the courts kept the state’s near-total abortion ban from being struck down last month.
Most state Supreme Courts require a majority vote to declare a law unconstitutional. But in North Dakota, it takes a supermajority — a vote of at least four justices — for the Supreme Court to strike down a law. That’s why the state’s 2023 abortion law remains on the books even though three of five justices on the high court found it unconstitutionally vague under the North Dakota Constitution.
The only other state that requires a judicial supermajority to find a state law unconstitutional is Nebraska.
North Dakota voters adopted the rule into the state constitution in 1918 as a way to temper the power of the courts. It was established through a constitutional amendment put on the ballot by lawmakers affiliated with the nascent North Dakota Nonpartisan League.
The party pushed for the supermajority amendment out of fear that the Supreme Court would undermine its legal reforms, according to a 2015 academic article published in the University of Toledo Law Review. The Nonpartisan League spearheaded several Progressive Era changes to state government, including the creation of the Bank of North Dakota and the North Dakota Mill and Elevator.
North Dakota abortion ban deemed constitutional in split opinion from state Supreme Court

North Dakota Supreme Court Chief Justice Jon Jensen in a January dissenting opinion called the five-justice rule an important part of the court’s duty to be deferential to decisions made by the legislative branch.
Douglas Keith, a legal expert at the Brennan Center for Justice, said while courts in some other countries also have supermajority requirements, it’s practically unheard of in the United States.
“Likely, it stems from how odd it looks to the public,” said Keith, who researches state courts.
The rule enables minority views to decide the outcome of cases, which some could view as undemocratic, Keith said.
“It creates this strange imbalance where you need a much smaller number of justices to uphold a law,” he said.
On the other hand, some have criticized simple majority requirements as vulnerable to political polarization.
“Judicial decisions should take into account the full range of considerations, not just one side or the other,” said David Orentlicher, a professor at the University of Nevada Las Vegas School of Law and a Democratic member of the Nevada Legislature. 
Orentlicher authored a 2022 academic article arguing for the U.S. Supreme Court to decide all of its cases unanimously. He said that this would force it to make fairer decisions that balance the viewpoints of all justices.
Unpacking North Dakota’s gender-affirming care ruling

North Dakota’s supermajority rule doesn’t impact most of the court’s business. It only applies when it reviews a constitutional challenge to a state law.
“Until this particular ruling, I hadn’t even heard of it,” said Bradley Myers, interim dean of the University of North Dakota School of Law.
The North Dakota Supreme Court handed down another split decision on another state abortion policy about a decade ago.
The lawsuit challenged part of the law that regulates medication abortion. It survived a constitutional challenge in 2014 despite three justices voting that it violated the federal Constitution. The three justices concluded that the law places an undue burden on women’s ability to obtain an abortion before the point of fetal viability, which at the time was a federally recognized right.
In that case, two justices declared that the law violates the North Dakota Constitution, two found it does not and the fifth justice found that the law should only be analyzed under the federal Constitution and declined to take a position.
When the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, control over abortion access was handed back to state governments.
The North Dakota Supreme Court also handed down a split ruling on the state’s K-12 funding formula in 1994. Three of five justices found the formula violated the state constitution by funding school districts unequally.
If North Dakotans wanted to change the supermajority rule, voters could circulate a petition to put a constitutional amendment on the election ballot.
The Legislature could also vote to refer the matter to the ballot.
North Dakota’s abortion law makes abortion illegal in all cases except rape or incest if the mother has been pregnant less than six weeks, or when the pregnancy presents a serious physical health threat. The law was passed by overwhelming support by both chambers of the Legislature. A North Dakota News Cooperative poll from late 2024 found that 55% of North Dakotans surveyed opposed the ban.

(Photo by Elaine S. Povich/Stateline)In West Virginia, we talk a lot about work. We want people to show up, punch the clock and pull their weight. But there is an uncomfortable truth we keep dodging: you can’t have a strong workforce if parents have no safe, reliable, high-quality places to leave their children.
That’s why it’s time for West Virginia to pay the true cost of child care for families who use the state child care subsidy.
Right now, our subsidy system is built on wishful thinking. The state reimburses child care programs at rates that are well below what it actually costs to provide minimal care. National estimates of the “true cost” of high-quality care show the gap clearly: caring for an infant at a high-quality level can cost more than $25,400 per year, but the average subsidized rate for infant care in West Virginia is only about $9,079. 
That difference doesn’t magically disappear. Someone is paying for it — and right now, it’s a toxic mix of underpaid educators, struggling programs, and parents who don’t receive subsidies being charged more to make up the gap.
High quality early care isn’t a luxury
High-quality early childhood education is not “babysitting.” It’s skilled work that shapes the brain development, social skills, and school readiness of our youngest West Virginians. When classrooms are staffed with stable, trained teachers; when ratios are low enough for children to get real attention; when environments are safe and rich with learning — children do better in school, need fewer special education services, and are more likely to graduate and find good jobs later in life. That’s not ideology; it’s decades of research. But quality costs money:

Living wages and benefits for staff so they stay in the field 
Safe, licensed facilities that meet health and safety standards
Training, curriculum, screenings, and family support

If the state only pays a “discount” rate through subsidy, providers have two choices: cut quality or find the money somewhere else. Too often, they’re forced to do both.
How underpaying the child care subsidy hurts private-pay parents
The child care subsidy is supposed to help low- and moderate-income families afford child care. But when the state rate is below the true cost, programs must fill the hole.
That usually looks like:

Raising tuition on families who pay out-of-pocket to offset the shortfall
Packing more children into classrooms or cutting corners to cut costs 
Keeping wages low, causing constant turnover and burnout

In practice, this means a family just over the subsidy income cutoff — or a family who can’t access subsidy for other reasons — may end up paying more than they should, simply because the program is trying to survive on inadequate public funding.
So instead of subsidy leveling the playing field, it creates financial hardships:

Subsidy families are in programs that are financially fragile
Non-subsidy families are charged higher rates to cover the gap
Both groups experience staff turnover, closures, or waiting lists.

When we talk about “paying the true cost of child care,” we’re saying the state should stop quietly shifting its responsibility onto parents and educators.
Child care closures are a workforce crisis
West Virginia already has one of the lowest labor force participation rates in the country — about 54.3% as of August 2025, compared to over 69% in some other states. Business leaders have raised the alarm about our shrinking workforce and what it means for economic growth.
You cannot fix that without fixing child care.
Across the state, we’re seeing:

Roughly 1,200 licensed child care providers, yet more than 25,000 children who still don’t have access to care because there simply aren’t enough slots.
Reports that hundreds of child care providers have left the industry since early 2023 as federal relief funds ended and costs rose.

When a child care program closes or shrinks, parents don’t just lose a service — many lose the ability to work. Moms, in particular, are often pushed out of jobs or forced into part-time work when they can’t find or afford care. Employers struggle to fill openings and retain staff. Communities lose both jobs at the child care center and productivity in other industries.
This is not just a “family issue.” It is the core economic infrastructure. If we allowed this to happen to our roads or electric grid, we’d call it what it is: a statewide crisis.
Market rates don’t reflect reality — true cost modeling does
Historically, many states, including West Virginia, have set child care subsidy rates based on market rate surveys — essentially, “what are providers charging now?” The problem is that these prices are already constrained by what parents can pay, not what it actually costs to run a high-quality program. National analysis shows that the true cost of providing care exceeds not only subsidy rates but often the price charged to families as well.
Paying the true cost of child care for subsidy means:

 Basing reimbursement on cost models, not just market rates, and updating them regularly. 
 Recognizing higher costs for infants, toddlers, and rural programs, where staffing and transportation challenges are different. 
 Ensuring rates support living wages and benefits for early educators, so we stop losing them to less stressful, higher-paying jobs in retail or fast food.

When subsidy pays the true cost, programs no longer need to overcharge private-pay families or cut quality just to keep the lights on.
This is a smart economic development strategy
West Virginia pours time and money into trying to attract businesses and grow jobs. But businesses look for a stable, dependable workforce — and they know childcare is a huge part of that.
We’re already experimenting with promising models like cost-sharing “tri-share” programs, where employers, parents and the state each pay a portion of child care costs. Those efforts are helpful, but they are small and limited in geography. They also allow winners and losers across the state based on what employers can afford AND choose to participate. They will never allow for parents working state or government jobs to participate and benefit. Think teachers, police, emergency service personnel, VA employees, CPS workers, etc. Tri-Share cannot replace a strong, statewide subsidy system that pays the true cost of care.
If lawmakers are serious about boosting labor force participation, they should treat child care:

Like public infrastructure, not a private luxury service 
Like a workforce investment, not a line item to squeeze 
Like education, because that’s what it is for our youngest children

Paying the true cost of child care through subsidy is one of the most direct, targeted economic development policies we can enact.
More parents can work. More child care programs can stay open and expand. More early educators can afford to stay in the field. More children enter school ready to learn, forming the future workforce our economy will depend on.

Kennedy Jr. is undermining vaccine protections for children and reversing historic public health gains. (Getty Images)Three Kentucky babies are dead from whooping cough, a disease we know how to prevent. What kind of society lets children die from a solved problem? Their deaths were not inevitable. 
In Kentucky, we know what vaccine-preventable disease looks like. Our own Sen. Mitch McConnell lives with the lifelong effects of childhood polio. Public health once eliminated diseases like polio, but today that legacy is beginning to unravel. U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is the one pulling at the threads. 
As families grieve the unthinkable, Kennedy’s handpicked vaccine panel weakened hepatitis B protections for newborns. 
During his confirmation hearing, Kennedy explicitly told senators, “I support the measles vaccine, I support the polio vaccines, I will do nothing as HHS secretary that makes it difficult or discourages people taking them.”
He pledged to Sen. Bill Cassidy that he would maintain the Centers for Disease Control’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) “without changes.”
Secretary of U.S. Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. speaks at the Rx and Illicit Drug Summit at the Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center in Nashville, Tennessee, on April 24, 2025. (John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
He committed to Sen. Todd Young to prioritize funding for long COVID research. 
These statements were made under oath before the U.S. Senate. They weren’t vague campaign promises; they were direct assurances to senators whose votes secured his confirmation.
Less than a year later,  Kennedy has broken each one of these commitments.  
In June, he fired all 17 members of ACIP, the independent expert panel that sets national vaccine recommendations, and replaced them with anti-vaccine activists. His picks include Robert Malone, known for spreading COVID misinformation, and Vicky Pebsworth, a board member of an anti-vaccine organization. Four appointees are even listed in the dedication of Kennedy’s anti-vaccine book, a move that puts allies over experts.

The American Academy of Pediatrics responded with alarm, warning, “families and children will be the ones to pay the price.”
Kentucky families are already paying it. We have recorded 566 pertussis (whooping cough) cases this year. The most recent death will be recorded as a statistic, but that baby had a name, a story, a family. Politicians claim to care about children, but caring means telling the truth. Whooping cough is deadly to infants, and vaccines in pregnancy and early childhood are how we keep them alive. 
Vaccines are not the only part of public health under attack. Kennedy eliminated the HHS Office of Long COVID even as new research shows it has overtaken asthma as the most common chronic illness in children. He shut down the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration during an overdose crisis. In Kentucky, where rural hospitals are stretched thin and addiction is a leading cause of premature death, these cuts are deadly. 
Kennedy is reviving the long-debunked claim that vaccines cause autism. To do this, he hired David Geier, who was fined for practicing medicine without a license by the state of Maryland after he and his father gave autistic children dangerous hormone injections without informed consent. Now Kennedy has put him in charge of a federal study designed to “prove” that vaccines are dangerous. 
Recklessness like this has already caused harm. During the worst measles resurgence in decades, with 17 outbreaks across the U.S., including two in Kentucky, Kennedy promoted vitamin A as a treatment. Shortly after, Texas doctors treated children for vitamin A toxicity and liver damage.  
RFK Jr. has broken his promises, undermined science and jeopardized the health of millions.
Kentucky’s McConnell put it plainly during Kennedy’s confirmation: “I will not condone the re-litigation of proven cures, and neither will millions of Americans who credit their survival and quality of life to scientific miracles.” 
The question now is whether we will allow a fourth Kentucky infant to die from a preventable disease. 
Three Kentucky families are living every parent’s worst nightmare, and Kennedy’s panel just voted to put more infants at risk by dismantling the hepatitis B birth-dose recommendation. The birth dose exists because screening alone fails; thousands of pregnant patients are never tested, and their newborns become infected before anyone realizes they’re at risk. When infants contract hepatitis B, nearly 90% become chronic carriers, condemned to a lifetime threatened by cirrhosis and liver cancer. Decades of data show exactly what happens when the birth dose is limited to “high-risk” infants — infection rates rise, and children pay the price. 
This reversal undermines the 99% decline in childhood hepatitis B that public health achieved. It was a political decision with medical consequences for babies who haven’t even taken their first steps. The senators who confirmed Kennedy on the strength of his promises now have a responsibility to act. 
When someone breaks sworn commitments and endangers children, there must be consequences. Kentucky’s congressional delegation can lead that response by demanding Kennedy’s immediate resignation from office.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/baby-hand-700x467-1.jpeg,,,2025-12-09 05:58:23.819005

(Photo by  Aaron Sutch/Solar United Neighbors)With Democrats in full control of the General Assembly and Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger preparing to take office, lawmakers are reviving familiar proposals they hope will finally earn a governor’s signature. Chief among them are bills aimed at expanding renewable energy use and strengthening Virginia’s clean-energy workforce.
Sen. Jennifer Carroll Foy, D-Prince William, has filed Senate Bill 26, which would allow localities to require developers to build solar canopies over parking lots as part of their development ordinances.
“I think that solar canopies can go far in ensuring that we have more accessible space to have solar and to get developers, and not only suburban, but rural areas as well, to do their part to help us with our expansion into more clean energy,” Carroll Foy said.
The requirement would apply only to nonresidential parking lots with more than 100 spaces, and localities could mandate canopies on up to 50% of the lot, according to the bill. It also gives localities flexibility to waive the requirement if the added cost would be prohibitive for companies building initial projects.
Carroll Foy said she wants to give individual counties more tools to help the state meet its Virginia Clean Economy Act targets while getting as many kilowatts on the grid as possible without sacrificing agricultural land for utility-scale solar projects.
“I think this is low hanging fruit,” Carroll Foy said. “If we can put as many solar panels as possible on top of schools, on top of parking garages, on space that’s available but unusable for pretty much anything else, I think that makes total sense, and it also helps us preserve our farmland.”
A similar measure passed the General Assembly during the 2025 regular session, but Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed it, arguing that parking lot solar is too expensive and that “if it were economically viable, developers would already be incorporating it into their projects.”
Across the aisle, Del. Delores Oates, R-Warren, is introducing a bill that would allow the use of small solar panels that plug directly into a home outlet and can be set up on a balcony without a utility contract. The goal is to help homeowners offset some of their electricity use when they are unable to participate in rooftop solar programs.
“Right now, solar is something you can only do if you own a house and have the right kind of roof,” Oates said. “This bill opens the door for everyone else: apartment-dwellers, condo owners, and people in homes shaded by trees. It’s a small change that helps a lot of people.”
The small portable panels are estimated to cost $600-1200 and can offset an estimated $10-20 on utility bills, according to Oates.
Carroll Foy is also again pushing to strengthen the offshore wind workforce in Virginia with Senate Bill 25. 
Despite the Trump Administration pulling funding for several offshore wind projects, Dominion Energy’s major project off Virginia’s coast remains on track to begin operating in 2026. Carroll Foy said she wants to ensure workers are trained for the offshore wind sector and the broader renewable energy industry.
“Unfortunately, we have a federal administration and we had some Republicans who don’t believe in the climate crisis, but I believe in science backed and not science fiction,” Carroll Foy said. “And whatever we can do to ensure that we can continue to build our clean energy projects, while also putting Virginians to work and addressing any shortage that we may have in this industry or in the Department of Energy, then that’s exactly what we want to do.”
The bill directs the Virginia Department of Energy to establish training programs for the offshore wind industry and to prioritize veterans, local workers, and disadvantaged communities.
Youngkin vetoed the same bill last year, saying that rising project costs and project cancellations made additional workforce investment unwise.
Both bills will be taken up during the 2026 regular session, which begins Jan. 14.

Choe’s appointment comes as VRE — which connects Northern and Central Virginia with Washington, D.C. — continues advancing its modernization plans outlined in the system’s long-term strategy, aimed at adapting to changing travel patterns, maximizing daily ridership and adding non-peak and weekend service.
Choe was appointed last week by VRE’s governing bodies — the Northern Virginia Transportation Commission and the Potomac Rappahannock Transportation Commission — replacing Rich Dalton, who served the agency for 16 years.
“I am honored to join VRE at such a significant moment for regional mobility,” Choe said in a statement. “VRE plays a critical role in connecting communities and supporting economic growth across Northern and Central Virginia and the greater Washington region.”

Choe joins VRE after holding several senior roles, most recently serving in Massachusetts as chief of staff to the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, chief engineer for Boston Public Works and program manager at the Massachusetts Port Authority. 
She has overseen major infrastructure projects focused on safety and quality and was named WTS-Boston’s Woman of the Year in 2022.
Choe has worked in program management and safety oversight leadership in the transportation sector for 25 years.
Choe will take the helm as VRE prepares for a series of infrastructure projects scheduled over the next five years, including the Virginia Passenger Rail Authority’s Long Bridge improvement project. The expansion will add new rail capacity for freight and passenger service between Washington, D.C. and Virginia, easing the longstanding bottleneck that has slowed travel times across the region.
“The VRE Operations Board believes Ms. Choe is uniquely qualified as VRE’s next CEO,” said VRE Operations Board Chair and Alexandria Vice Mayor Sarah Bagley in a statement. “Her record of delivering transformative results for organizations through innovative, safety-oriented, and people-first leadership reflects the core values held dear at VRE.”

ICE arrests in the Pittsburgh region reached a high point in July and August at around 140 each month — more than double the number logged during any month for two years prior.
That arrest level appears to have tapered off slightly in September, as the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown approaches the end of its first year.
Since January, there have been at least 948 immigration-related arrests in the Pittsburgh region, defined as a 50-mile radius from Downtown, according to the data, which ends in mid-October. That is more than triple the same period in 2024, during which the agency made 275 arrests.

Prior to President Donald Trump’s inauguration and his Immigration and Customs Enforcement surge, the number of ICE arrests in Allegheny County and nearby counties in a given month was sometimes as low as a dozen or as high as 65. The range this year has been a low of 48 in April before the summer peak, according to data made available by the Deportation Data Project and analyzed by Pittsburgh’s Public Source.
The data shows the vast majority of the ICE arrests as occurring in or close to Pittsburgh and is only more specific in regard to pickups at county jails. Just one of this year’s ICE arrests is listed as occurring at the Allegheny County Jail, with outlying county lockups logging larger tallies, led by Beaver (23), Washington (18) and Butler (10).
The region has not seen the kind of highly publicized ICE surges experienced by numerous other cities, including recent pushes in and around Minneapolis, Charlotte and Chicago.

But Southwestern Pennsylvania hasn’t been ignored by the rapidly expanding agency. The administration’s immigration-related activities have reached the area in many ways throughout the year, including:

November efforts to enlist local law enforcement agencies in enforcement activity, some of which were recently reversed after Public Source inquiries
September moves to deport Guatemalan children, which were stalled by court decisions but caused local advocates to scramble over Labor Day weekend
August arrests of workers at local restaurants
A midsummer blitz in Ambridge that some advocates for immigrants characterized as the most aggressive they’d seen
Winter disruptions of funding for refugee resettlement and for legal representation of immigrant children
A January pause in refugee entry, which has since morphed nationally into a halt to processing of applications from 19 countries following the November shooting of two National Guard members — one fatally — in Washington, D.C.

ICE’s increased activity has been met locally with vigorous countermeasures, notably including a Rapid Response Network that has frequently deployed volunteers to document enforcement actions. Anti-Trump protests and other activism in the region have sometimes focused tightly on immigration policy, highlighted the importance of immigrants to the economy or included those themes in broad critiques of the administration. Churches, meanwhile, have attempted to serve as spiritual sanctuaries for the region’s Latino population, even as attendance has sometimes been depressed by fear.
Other local effects of administration action to curb the flow of people from other countries to the U.S. include a reduced international student population at Carnegie Mellon University and measures by the University of Pittsburgh and potentially other large employers to adjust to a new fee on visas used by many skilled workers from abroad.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ice-arrests-ambridge-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-12-09 05:58:23.819005

With similarly sporadic precipitation trends predicted to continue, what that means for drinking water reliability in the state is still unclear — and the cost of coping is continuing to rise.
In response to widespread reports of dry wells and associated financial hardship, the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services is set to restart a financial assistance program to aid qualifying low-income households who have lost access to drinking water due to drought conditions. The Drinking Water and Groundwater Trust Fund Advisory Commission voted in November to allocate just under $2 million to this phase of the program, which has run twice before, both times within the last five years. 
The funds will help some residents with steep costs associated with drilling new, more reliable wells. But as significant droughts become increasingly common, some experts said it would take more investment and more creativity to make New Hampshire’s drinking water supplies more resilient into the future.
Ensuring a reliable drinking water supply is a significant concern for the state, said Ted Diers, assistant water division director at the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services, in an interview. “It’s pretty hard to think of anything more fundamental,” he said.
A report released Dec. 4 by the U.S. Drought Monitor shows a majority of New Hampshire remaining in “severe drought” status. While precipitation has begun to increase in most areas, it will take time for groundwater to recharge — and it’s difficult to say just how long that might take, experts said. “This drought, it was a doozy,” said Ted Diers, assistant water division director with the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services.

Drought cycles put periodic pressure on aquifers
This season’s rash of dry wells accompanied the state’s driest summer on record. While New Hampshire’s annual precipitation totals are increasing with climate change, precipitation events are also becoming more unevenly distributed throughout the year. This means that long periods without any rain are becoming typical for summer and early fall, New Hampshire State Climatologist Mary Stampone said in October. 
These cycles are predicted to continue, something groundwater experts said could affect drinking water supplies, too, though exactly how will vary across the state.
Snowmelt and rain feed the aquifers that, in turn, feed drinking water wells, said Mike Howley, senior geoscientist with the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services and program manager of the state’s Groundwater Measuring Network. But the dozens of monitoring wells that NHDES and the New Hampshire Geological Survey maintain across the state show how that happens is variable. In some places, fresh rainfall will recharge groundwater in a matter of hours; in others, it might take three to six months for water to work its way through the soil, Howley said.
Similarly, the effects of a drought might not be immediately ameliorated when precipitation begins to fall again. This means that even once a dry spell ends, the time it will take for some aquifers to recover can be substantial, Howley said. This can make it difficult to help those with dry wells predict when or if their issues will resolve.
In New England, it is common for aquifers to show the effects of precipitation trends within a relatively short period, according to Joseph Ayotte, hydrologic investigative branch chief with the United States Geological Survey’s New England Water Science Center. This, he said, is because aquifers in our area have “relatively low storage” compared to those in other regions of the country. 
“When precipitation tails off, water levels in our aquifers can start to decline, and that is usually concerning for folks,” he said, noting that an example of such a decline occurred this summer and fall.
Meanwhile, however, lower-capacity aquifers also take less time to refill when rain does fall again. Ayotte said this can occur even throughout the winter months, when groundwater typically continues to work its way through the portions of the ground that do not freeze.
Ayotte added he had not seen research directly assessing whether groundwater was becoming increasingly unreliable in New Hampshire. More data is needed, he said, to assess how changing surface weather patterns are reflected below ground. But the relatively fast reactivity of New England’s aquifers is a reason that increasingly uneven precipitation patterns could strain groundwater, he said, even while precipitation becomes more abundant overall.
“The trick is that those precipitation amounts vary seasonally. There may be periods of time where we have a fairly long window without precipitation, which could potentially affect the reliability of the water supply,” Ayotte said.
Regional water cycles
The historic drought that occurred in New Hampshire this year engulfed, at its worst, the entire state. The region most affected (and, according to data released by the U.S. Drought Monitor, still almost entirely in “severe drought” as of Dec. 4) was central and northern New Hampshire.
Data collected by the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services in summer and fall 2025 show recent well reports per 10,000 residents, broken down by county. The areas with the highest proportions of dry wells were concentrated in the North Country due to a deep drought across the region, according to Ted Diers, Assistant Water Division Director at the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services. (Chart courtesy of the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services)
This is reflected in the distribution of dry wells reported throughout the state, Diers said. The Department of Environmental Services set up an online dry well reporting form in September and had received 201 reports of completely or intermittently dry wells as of Dec. 4. Adjusted by population, rates of dry wells were highest in the North Country. Coös County had the highest dry well-to-resident ratio, with 10.2 dry wells reported per 10,000 residents; Grafton and Carroll counties reported the next highest rates.
Reporting is entirely voluntary, said Diers, who speculated that not everyone whose well has gone dry in the state ultimately knew about the reporting system and filled out the survey. 
“My guess is the number is four or five times that, but I don’t really have a way of documenting that,” he said in an interview.
Though the state is small, diversity in topography and weather patterns mean that precipitation often varies widely across regions, Diers said.
“What we’ve seen is that these droughts tend to go in cycles in different parts of the state,” he said. Dry conditions in the Seacoast within the last decade led many residents there to confront well supply issues. Now, he said, the North Country is being forced down the same path.
Confronting high costs
About half of New Hampshire residents get their water from private wells, according to the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services. For these individuals, water supply issues can present a significant financial challenge, as costs to drill new wells are rising fast. The department now considers the average cost for a new bedrock well to be $30,000, Diers said. 
“If you’re a very low-income person, this is how you lose a house,” he said at the Nov. 17 meeting of the Drinking Water and Groundwater Advisory Commission.
The emergency assistance program, as approved by the commission that day, will pay the entire cost of a new well for households earning less than half of their area’s median household income. For households earning between half and 80% of their area’s median household income, the program will cover half the total cost of a new well; in both cases, the funding will be released as a reimbursement to the well driller from the Drinking Water and Groundwater Trust Fund.
The commission allocated $1.5 million in trust dollars to the program Nov. 17, and agreed to reallocate $300,000 remaining from a similar program activated in response to dry well reports in 2021 and 2023, Diers said. The $1.8 million total allocated to this cycle could finance approximately 60 average wells.
In addition to rising costs, Diers pointed to New Hampshire’s aging population as another factor making the emergency assistance program necessary. Older residents on fixed incomes may not be able to spring for a new well, leaving them without water, he said. 
Long wait times for well drilling and a high level of need are two challenges that the department anticipates the program will be faced with again this year, Diers said. Applications for assistance will open in the new year, he said at the meeting.

Getting creative
Ayotte, Howley, and Diers stressed the importance of long-term monitoring in efforts to build a deeper understanding of how surface weather patterns affect groundwater. Building rich data sets with the 48 monitoring wells the N.H. Geological Survey manages across the state will help inform efforts to understand regional differences in groundwater availability, the effects of severe weather events, and the effects of water use, Howley said.
“Long-term data is a real gem. It’s something that we all need, and it’s the only real way to evaluate change,” Ayotte said
Additionally, as the pressures on groundwater evolve, making water supplies more reliable in the long term might take more than a series of existing well replacements. With more precipitation expected to continue falling overall, finding ways to tap into this sporadic but increasing supply could be a path to resilience, Ayotte said.
“Perhaps there will need to be changes in how we access that water, because it should be there,” he said.
As an example, Ayotte pointed to a collaboration between the New England Water Science Center and the University of Maine exploring changes to standard wells that could make them more resilient. One project looks at expanding shallow, dug wells, which are less expensive but considered less reliable, and more susceptible to contamination, than drilled bedrock wells.
A typical dug well might be three feet across and 20 feet deep, Ayotte said. But by increasing the width of the well to as much as 30 feet across, the team increased both the storage capacity and surface area of the well, creating a more reliable water supply. 
“That seems to make all the difference,” Ayotte said.
This finding will likely be most applicable to farmers, Ayotte said, but it is an example of how rethinking existing technology could help make wells more secure even in times of drought.
“It seems like we’re going to remain water-rich,” Ayotte said. “We just may need to rethink how we produce water for the water supply.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Adrinkingwater-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-09 05:58:23.819005

As the nonpartisan clerk of Harney County, a vast, rural expanse larger than Massachusetts, Robinson oversees elections with about 6,000 registered voters. Oregon has exclusively conducted elections by mail since 2000, a system he thinks works well, requires fewer staff and doesn’t force voters to travel through treacherous weather to reach a polling place.
“As you can tell, I’m not an advocate for going back,” Robinson said.
Not everyone agrees. An Oregon Republican lawmaker has introduced legislation to end the state’s mail voting law, and organizers of a ballot measure campaign seeking to ban mail-in voting say they have gathered thousands of signatures.
Across the United States, voting by mail faces a moment of uncertainty ahead of the midterm elections next year.
President Donald Trump has assailed mail-in voting and vowed this summer to lead a movement to eliminate the practice, promoting baseless claims that mailed ballots are linked to widespread fraud. Some states are also reevaluating their mail-in voting laws, including shortening or ending grace periods that now require election officials to count mailed ballots that arrive after Election Day.
The U.S. Supreme Court in November agreed to take a case that could end ballot grace periods nationwide. A decision by the justices late next spring or early summer striking them down could affect 16 states and the District of Columbia, potentially upending the rules of elections as states prepare to hold primaries ahead of the November midterm elections that will determine control of Congress.
The midterm ballot measure battles have already begun

Mail-in voting surged in 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic, when 43% of voters cast their votes by mail. The percentage of voters mailing their ballots has fallen from that peak but remains above pre-pandemic levels. About 30% of voters cast mail ballots in 2024, according to data gathered by the U.S. Election Assistance Commission.
That’s 46.8 million voters, underscoring the electoral and political stakes involved in any major change to mail-in voting.
“THE MAIL-IN BALLOT HOAX, USING VOTING MACHINES THAT ARE A COMPLETE AND TOTAL DISASTER, MUST END, NOW!!!” Trump posted in August on his social media site, Truth Social.
Trump promised in the post to issue an executive order that would bring “HONESTY” to the midterm elections, but none has been forthcoming. In response to questions, the White House referred Stateline back to the president’s post.
Robinson, the president of the Oregon Association of County Clerks, emphasized the security of mail-in ballots, but acknowledged that the message has become a “hard sell.”
“We’ve done everything in our power to try to squash the myths and disinformation that it’s wrought with fraud, because it is not,” he said.
Ballot deadlines targeted
Amid scrutiny of mail-in ballots, Ohio is on the verge of eliminating its ballot grace period, potentially becoming at least the fifth state to tighten ballot arrival deadlines this year, along with Kansas, Minnesota, North Dakota and Utah.
The Republican-controlled Ohio legislature last month passed a bill that would require all ballots to be returned to election officials by the close of polls on Election Day to count, with exceptions for late-arriving military and overseas ballots. Under current law, the ballots must arrive by the fourth day after the election.
Ohio Republican Secretary of State Frank LaRose spearheaded the push for the change. He has argued that setting an Election Day deadline for the arrival of mailed ballots will minimize voter confusion and that uncertainty surrounding late-arriving ballots in a close contest risks damaging voter confidence.
LaRose has also suggested the U.S. Department of Justice would sue Ohio if it didn’t change its deadline.
GOP backs voting by mail, yet turns to courts to restrict it in battleground states

During a legislative hearing in late October, LaRose told lawmakers that Assistant U.S. Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon, who leads the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, wrote in a Sept. 29 letter to Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost that Ohio should take immediate action to comply with federal law and “avoid costly litigation” in federal court.
“They identified what they consider to be a conflict between state and federal law as to the deadline for which absentee ballots must be returned by mail,” LaRose testified
The Justice Department indicated that Ohio law should match that of other states that require ballots to be returned by the close of polls on Election Day, LaRose said. He added that he asked for the opportunity to work with lawmakers to change the law in lieu of a lawsuit.
LaRose’s office didn’t respond to Stateline’s interview request. The Justice Department and Yost didn’t respond to requests for comment and for a copy of the September letter.
Ohio Republican Gov. Mike DeWine hasn’t said whether he will sign or veto the bill eliminating the grace period. A spokesperson for the governor said Monday that DeWine hadn’t yet received it.
During the 2024 election in Ohio, 8,335 mail ballots weren’t counted, or 0.8% of all mail ballots returned to election officials, according to the U.S. Election Assistance Commission. Nationwide, 584,463 mail ballots weren’t counted, 1.2% of those returned.
Nearly 18% of rejected mail ballots were rejected because they weren’t received on time, according to the commission’s data.
Debra Shankland, a 66-year-old Democrat in the Cleveland suburb of Brecksville, said she’s worked to register voters in public housing and other apartment buildings, giving her experience talking with people about voting by mail. Many people like mail ballots, she said, but want to drop them off instead of mailing them.
Shankland, who submitted written testimony to the state legislature opposing the elimination of Ohio’s grace period, wrote that she votes absentee because she’s a poll worker and therefore unavailable on Election Day. Instead, she places her ballot in a drop box (Ohio law limits drop boxes to one per county).
“I do know a lot of people are very leery of the mail and I am, too,” Shankland said in an interview, adding that she’s had mail stolen in the past.
The United States Postal Service has battled declining performance for years. Ahead of the 2020 election, then-Postmaster General Louis DeJoy rolled out a series of changes to mail service, including the removal of some mail-sorting machines and cuts to the number of the service’s ubiquitous blue public mailboxes. Amid criticism, DeJoy backed off the changes a few months before the election; he resigned earlier this year.
During peak mail season last year — Thanksgiving through New Year’s Eve — USPS missed five of six service performance targets, despite lowering the targets, according to a USPS Office of Inspector General report released in July.
But the postal service has touted its efforts to ensure rapid delivery of election mail, including ballots, during the 2024 election. USPS has said it delivered 99.88% of ballots to election officials within seven days, and 97.73% of ballots within three days. A USPS Office of Inspector General report from April found that the postal service “significantly exceeded service performance goals” for election mail and most political mail.
USPS has previously noted that election laws and procedures vary among the 50 states and the nearly 8,000 election jurisdictions in the country. “This can result in a mismatch of timeframes, deadlines, ballot return suggestions and the practical reality of using the mail,” the postal service said in a November 2024 report.
Supreme Court case looms
The U.S. Supreme Court may soon set a nationwide mail ballot arrival deadline.
The court will consider a dispute between the Republican National Committee and Mississippi, which requires mailed ballots to be counted if they are received within five business days of the election and are postmarked on or before Election Day. Postmarks act as a check against fraud, helping to ensure that ballots were placed in the mail before the end of the election — and not afterward in an attempt to alter the outcome.
The case cuts across partisan lines. Mississippi Secretary of State Michael Watson, a Republican who is defending the law, declined to comment, citing pending litigation. But in September, Watson told the Mississippi newspaper The Dispatch that “the policy decision should be made at the state level.”
At the core of the case is a question of whether a longstanding federal law that sets the Tuesday after the first Monday in November as Election Day for federal offices, preempts state laws that allow ballots cast by Election Day, but received later, to count.
And at the same time, the case asks: What does it mean to cast a ballot? Is putting it in the mail enough, or does it need to reach election officials?
The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in October 2024 that the law requires ballots to be received by Election Day. Trump likewise issued an executive order in March that attempted to require that mail ballots be received by the end of Election Day and to impose other election changes, but much of the order has been blocked by federal courts.
Deep red Utah wants to keep voting by mail

Caleb Hays, chief policy counsel at the Center for Election Confidence, a conservative-leaning legal advocacy group that opposes ballot grace periods, said Congress has the authority to set the date of congressional and presidential elections and had spoken. The center has filed court papers urging the Supreme Court to strike down the Mississippi law.
A requirement that all ballots must be received by the close of polls sets a “bright line rule” for election officials and voters, Hays said, making sure everyone has the same expectation about when ballots must be in.
“In this case, Election Day means Election Day,” Hays said.
In West Virginia, less than 3% of voters cast their ballots by mail in the 2024 election, according to the U.S. Election Assistance Commission. Only 247 mail ballots weren’t counted — 1.1% of the mail ballots received by election officials.
Still, West Virginia Republican Secretary of State Kris Warner said mail ballot arrival deadlines should be left to the states. In his state, ballots postmarked on or before Election Day must be received before the start of the canvass. He said the grace period is “working just fine the way it is right now.”
Warner said he would follow the law as interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court but warned Trump against attempting to unilaterally change election procedures in West Virginia, where the president enjoyed a nearly 41% margin of victory in 2024.
“You know, across the bottom of my state flag is ‘Montani Semper Liberi’ and Mountaineers are always free and they’re not going to take kindly to an executive order by the president changing how we’re going to do our elections,” Warner said.
Back in Oregon, Robinson, the Harney County clerk, said he personally wouldn’t mind if the grace period goes away. Oregon currently counts ballots received within seven days of the election if they were postmarked by Election Day. More and more ballots are arriving during the grace period, he said.
“But we do what we’re told and follow the Constitution,” Robinson said.

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)With health insurance costs poised to spike for more than a half-million Ohioans, U.S. Sen. Jon Husted offered a compromise. It consists mostly of raising costs or cutting benefits for low and middle-income consumers whose pay and insurance plans aren’t as good as his own.
The 43-day government shutdown that ended Nov. 13 was primarily over subsidies created in 2021 to help people purchase health insurance on exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act. 
They’re set to expire in less than three weeks, which would cause premiums to more than double on average for nearly 600,000 Ohioans and 23 million Americans.
With the country mired in an affordability crisis, large majorities of Americans want to see the subsidies extended. 
Congressional Democrats refused to sign on to a spending bill reopening the government unless Republicans agreed to such an extension.
The impasse was broken when a small group of Democrats in the Senate agreed to support a spending bill in exchange for a promise from Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D. He said he would bring an extension to a vote before the subsidies expire. 
A vote on a three-year extension is expected this week. But it’s likely to fail amid Republican opposition.
That leaves the GOP with a political imperative to come up with an alternative. 
On Nov. 20, Husted took to the Senate floor to offer his.
Formerly Ohio’s lieutenant governor, he was appointed to fill the seat vacated by JD Vance when Vance assumed the vice presidency in January. 
Husted has to run for his Senate seat next November, and affordable health care is likely to be a big issue.
Husted has been highly critical of the ACA subsidies, which are credited with helping to bring down the rate of uninsured Americans to an all-time low. He voted repeatedly against extending them.
In his Nov. 20 floor speech, Husted called them, “Another $350 billion on the national credit card for a program that we know is dysfunctional.” 
He was citing the estimated cost over 10 years if the insurance subsidies are made permanent, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
Husted’s office didn’t respond last week when asked why he was against extending that program as is, while he was OK with voting last summer for President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

That law extended the 2017 Trump tax cuts, providing a $1 trillion windfall to the richest 1% of Americans over the coming decade. It also cut nearly $1 trillion from Medicaid, the federal health program for the poor, and another $186 billion in federal food assistance.
Even though it slashes programs for the needy, the law Husted voted for still adds $3.4 trillion to the deficit, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center.
About 64% of Americans now view the Affordable Care Act — or Obamacare — favorably. But as with many Republican officials, Husted still doesn’t like it.
“I wasn’t here when Congress passed Obamacare or the Biden covid subsidies that have been used to prop up the ACA exchanges, but I want to be part of the solution,” he said. “Didn’t create the problem, but I’m here to be part of the solution.” 
To do so, he proposed a “fraud, freeze and fix approach.” 
Most pertinent to Ohioans who get their insurance on the ACA exchanges is the “freeze” portion of the formula.
“We need to freeze the subsidies to where they are right now, so it doesn’t become a growing burden for the American taxpayer,” Husted said.
The freeze would fall on people using the exchanges. They would either see their costs go up with health-sector inflation, or some would be locked out of the program. 
The subsidies in 2024 saved the average recipient about $700 a year, but savings can be nearly $20,000 for some households. 
If the ACA subsidies are allowed to expire, marketplace recipients will lose those savings. 
That would create large numbers of uninsured people who would still get sick, but couldn’t pay for their care — a matter Husted didn’t discuss. 
Taking away insurance from an estimated 4 million Americans, the Trump law Husted supported is expected to force health care costs even higher, the University of California at Berkeley reported in July.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
If subsidies are frozen as Husted proposes, marketplace participants will also lose, just not as much.
According to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, the cost of the subsidies has risen from about $92 billion in 2023 to an estimated $138 billion this year.
 At the same time, enrollment has grown from 16 million Americans to an estimated 23 million over the same period.
In other words the patient base has grown about 44% since 2023, while costs have grown about 50%. 
Freezing the amount spent on the program would require some mix of reducing eligibility and increasing participants’ costs.
As for the “fraud” piece of his proposal, Husted cited pandemic-era abuses in which brokers fraudulently enrolled people or changed their coverage without their permission. 
His solution is to make people using the “Bronze”  — or lowest — tier of coverage with no premiums to pay at least a token amount. 
“Requiring everyone receiving a premium tax credit to pay a small amount — at least a small amount — toward their health care insurance will help realign the incentives and reduce fraud,” he said. 
“It will make certain that Americans cannot be enrolled in plans without their knowledge and consent.” 
However, he didn’t note that those plans carry high deductibles and often coinsurance, which requires patients to pay a percentage of the cost of treatment. 
So people using bronze plans usually end up paying more for care than others on the ACA exchanges.
In addition, the Commonwealth Fund reported, safeguards implemented last year appear to be helping to solve the problem with fraud.
“Following implementation of this safeguard, broker-initiated plan changes dropped nearly 70% and changes that redirect a commission from a consumer’s original broker to a new one — an indicator of potential misconduct — fell almost 90%,” it said. 
Husted also complained about costs associated with the marketplace’s midlevel, or “Silver” plan. 
The way the subsidies work, people with the least money are incentivized to participate in those plans. 
Overall, nearly 60% of people using the ACA exchanges buy Silver plans.
Husted called the incentives “Silver loading” and charged that it improperly inflates expenses.
“It supercharged the federal subsidy spending,” he said. “It created a system that got gamed.”  
But is it fair to imply that it’s somehow a scam to encourage people to use plans that cover 70% of “actuarial value” — the amount of medical expenses a person is likely to have? 
The bronze plans cover just 60% of actuarial value and, if they include coinsurance, can expose people to catastrophic expenses.
Meanwhile, according to Physicians for a National Health Program, Husted and his colleagues enjoy much better plans, compliments of the taxpayers. 
Physicians and Students for a National Health Program is a group of 20,000 doctors and medical students who advocate for a single-payer system such as those in other developed countries. 
They pay far less per person for health care and have far better outcomes.
It said congressional plans cover 80% of actuarial value, while “the 60% to 70% actuarial value plans for the general public (on the ACA exchanges) are considered to be underinsurance — plans that do not provide adequate financial security in the face of medical need.”
There’s also the issue of relative income. As a senator, Husted makes $175,000 a year. 
About 70% of the people using the ACA exchanges make 250% or less of federal poverty guidelines. 
For a family of four, that’s $80,375 a year, or a little more than half of what Husted makes. 
Husted did advocate three reforms that have considerable support in health policy circles:

Price transparency so patients and health plans can be informed shoppers
Reform of the opaque practices of middlemen known as pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs. The biggest three are owned by giant health conglomerates and control nearly 80% of the marketplace. They’re suspected of driving up drug prices through anticompetitive practices.
Reform of the 340B program. Designed to subsidize care for the poor, the cost has exploded. And a lack of regulations has allowed hospitals to draw funds even as they use  of that money to pay lavish salaries and buy things like stadium-naming rights.

Last month, the Department of Social Services requested roughly $938 million from the federal government for the effort. The funding would come from the Rural Health Transformation Program — created as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, or H.R. 1, that President Donald Trump signed into law in July.
Connecticut’s sprawling plan includes 31 different initiatives focused on increasing care options in rural areas and facilitating access to that care, Kyle Kramer, CEO of Day Kimball Hospital in Putnam, said. Day Kimball, one of Connecticut’s four rural hospitals, is currently independent, but working through the details of an acquisition by UConn Health, the state’s flagship medical institution. 
“If we’re really focused on improving health, it starts with access,” Kramer, who worked closely with DSS to put together the state’s application, said. “Are there enough options and opportunities for people to get to care? And, if they exist, can they actually get to those locations from a transportation standpoint?”

The state’s pitch includes several programs aimed at strengthening the rural health care workforce, including provider incentives, residency grants, expanded training opportunities and implementing interstate licensure compacts. 
The plan includes initiatives meant to reduce or eliminate travel times for accessing care, like rolling out mobile medical and dental vans, as well as expanding telehealth options. There are also programs that seek to improve overall wellness: bringing evidence-based exercise classes to senior centers and making upgrades to existing trail systems. 
A handful of the proposed initiatives would require sign-off from state lawmakers, including streamlining the state’s “certificate of need” approval process for major hospital transactions — such as mergers, acquisitions, and unit closures — and seeking a SNAP waiver to bar the purchase of energy drinks and candy.
The $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program fund was added to the legislation, known as OBBBA, amid concerns about how the bill’s Medicaid cuts would impact rural facilities. Mehmet Oz, the administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services called the program “a spaceshot that will allow us to completely re-envision how rural health care is offered in this country.”
Half of the $50 billion grant will be evenly divided among all approved states. The other $25 billion will be based on the sole discretion of CMS and will take into account the rural makeup of states plus other factors “the administrator determines appropriate.”
A DSS spokesperson said the agency hopes to hear next month regarding the state’s application but won’t know until then how much funding Connecticut will get.
Rural health care has long faced a complex combination of challenges. People living in rural areas of the country are at higher risk for certain conditions, like fatal heart disease and stroke. At the same time, serving small populations makes it difficult for these facilities to generate scale and recruit doctors, nurses and hospital staff.
Connecticut’s rural hospitals are all underperforming financially when compared to the state’s hospitals overall. Rural residents face a median drive time of 32 minutes to a trauma center and 26 minutes to a stroke center, according to the state’s application. Since 2023, the state has approved the closure of two of its four rural maternity units — at Johnson Memorial and Windham Hospitals.
Even with a $50 billion funding opportunity, providers around the country are expressing concern about the impact of anticipated Medicaid changes in H.R. 1. Nonprofit research organization KFF estimates the law will result in a $137 billion hit to Medicaid funding in rural areas over 10 years — “about $87 billion more than is appropriated for the rural health fund,” researchers note.
“For rural hospital systems that are already facing strain or operating on thin margins, there’s been a really widespread concern that decreased revenue and increasing costs related to uncompensated care will put additional pressure on those health systems,” Katie Greene, director of population and public health at the National Academy for State Health Policy, said. 
A spokesperson for the federal Department of Health and Human Services referred to comments by Mehmet Oz, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, who said the Rural Health Transformation Program would increase health funding to rural Americans by 50%.
“To put it in perspective, about 7% of Medicaid dollars go to rural health care. That’s about $19 billion a year. This fund is $10 billion a year for 5 years. So [that’s] a 50% increase in the amount of money that Medicaid will pay into rural health care,” Oz said during a September Senate Republican leadership press conference. 
Multiple health policy researchers have called Oz’s assertion misleading.
Paul Kidwell, senior vice president of policy at the Connecticut Hospital Association, called the Rural Health Transformation Program “a positive measure” to address rural health challenges, but added that “it will not do enough to make up for the harmful impacts” of H.R. 1.
“Nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts will cause significant harm to healthcare access and affordability in every state and strain the nation’s entire healthcare delivery system hurting hospitals and patients in every community, including rural communities, all the same,” Kidwell wrote in emailed comments.
Day Kimball CEO Kramer said the Medicaid cuts keep him up at night. But, he’s still excited about the opportunity the program presents to reassess how they deliver health care in their rural community and address health needs before they become emergencies.
“The American health care system is one of the absolute best in the world at treating patients with complex diseases. We earn that reputation for treating people once they’ve gotten to the point where they have these very serious illnesses,” Kramer said. “[What] if we flip the script a bit and start to think about ‘What could we do to potentially prevent some of that risk?’”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/20220608_DayKimball_Putnam_YK_030.jpg,,,2025-12-09 05:58:23.819005

(Photo by AnnMarie Hilton/ Maine Morning Star)In 1996, Matt Dunlap was a soon-to-be married bar manager at Pat’s Pizza in Orono and doubled as a proofreader at the University of Maine print shop. It was the first year his salary crested $30,000.
That same year, Dunlap, a Democrat, made a successful run for the Maine Legislature. After finding out he won, he remembers feeling terrified because his new gig would mean a pay cut. 
“How the hell am I going to pay the bills?” Dunlap wondered at the time.
Twenty years later, Dunlap told Maine Morning Star in an interview that he is running for national office because he wants to help the people in his community who tell him they are buckling under rising costs and frustrated with the status quo that is not doing enough to address them. This desire to help working families, as well as his ability to listen to people, is what the residents of Maine’s 2nd Congressional District need in their next representative to the U.S. House of Representatives.
For those reasons, the Old Town resident has gained the support of many prominent 2nd District Democrats, who say he’s earned the trust of his neighbors and would work with anyone — regardless of party — who wants to help Maine people. However, with the primary still more than six months away, the national party says it is still searching for the right candidate because they aren’t convinced Dunlap is it.
In early November, U.S. Rep. Jared Golden, who has held the seat for the last eight years, announced he would not seek re-election. His decision was attributed to increased incivility and political violence that made him reassess the risk for him and his family. 
Golden won’t seek reelection in 2026

His departure created an open race for one of the most hotly contested U.S. House seats in the country. In the 2nd District, which comprises the geographic majority of the state north of Augusta, voters have routinely split tickets, reelecting Golden while backing President Donald Trump each time he has run for president. 
But Dunlap, who announced his run in early October, decided to run even before he knew Golden was out. It was a decision that former state lawmaker Thom Harnett said deserves respect and recognition. To him, it shows Dunlap is running because he believes he’s the best person for the job. 
Harnett, who lives in Gardiner, endorsed Dunlap before Golden dropped out.
Betsy Sweet, who has been an advocate in the state for more than 40 years, said Mainers know their neighbors and are equipped to decide who is best to represent them in Congress. Like Harnett, she thinks Dunlap is that person for the 2nd District. 
She praised Dunlap for having “a true north,” which she compared to criticism from Republicans and some Democrats that Golden would too frequently change his mind on policies. 
Beyond his years as a state lawmaker, Sweet said Dunlap has proven himself politically with multiple terms as secretary of state and now serving as state auditor.
But as of early last week, a source familiar with Democratic recruiting efforts said the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee continues to look for the “strongest possible” candidate to represent Maine. They said they want “someone who truly reflects the district and will fight every day for the people who call it home.”
Likewise, Golden doesn’t see Dunlap as his appropriate successor. When announcing his decision not to run, Golden said he hoped his exit would clear the way for competitive primaries for both parties, arguing that Dunlap and presumptive Republican candidate Paul LePage are “a far cry from being standard bearers of the generations that will inherit the legacy of today’s Congress.”
Prior to that, when the two seemed to be headed for a primary, Golden also called Dunlap a “30-year party crony” and doubted the district, which leans conservative, would choose him over LePage, the former two-term governor. 
Throughout his time in Congress, Golden was frequently ranked as one of the most centrist Democrats and many believe his willingness to break from the party is what helped win him support among CD2 voters.
Last summer, Golden’s campaign released an internal poll showing the congressman leading LePage by a single point in a hypothetical matchup; the same survey shows Dunlap trailing by 10 points, according to reporting from NOTUS.  
Since Golden dropped out, more contenders have entered the race, including Jordan Wood who pivoted his Democratic bid to unseat U.S. Sen. Susan Collins and Republican political newcomer James Clark. 
National Dems criticized for being out of touch
The chorus of Dunlap supporters would tell you that the national skepticism over his candidacy comes from a lack of understanding what Mainers in the 2nd District value and what concerns they have. 
Maine Rep. Laura Supica (D-Bangor) said she believes national Democrats have come to rely on money in politics to win, which leaves them out of touch with the values and voters who actually live there. 
Supica, who also works as a barista, said she isn’t sure how she will pay her heating oil bill every month this winter. She knows others in the 2nd District who can buy groceries in the summer months, but rely on food banks when it gets cold because they can’t swing the cost of both food and heat. 
That struggle, she said, Dunlap understands, which is partly why she is co-chairing the Women for Dunlap coalition. At a news conference with the coalition Monday, Supica highlighted Dunlap’s promise to help working families by fighting for an expanded child tax credit and universal childcare. 
Harnett also rejects the idea that Democrats outside of Maine need to pick the candidate. As he sees it, that is the purpose of the primary election: for Maine voters to decide who they think is the most appropriate candidate.
Harnett and Sweet also both pointed out that the national party often gets it wrong in Maine.
“We have seen in prior races that the candidates anointed in Washington D.C. don’t necessarily do very well with Maine voters and that’s because Maine voters know what they care about and the issues that are important to them,” Harnett said.










We have seen in prior races that the candidates anointed in Washington D.C. don’t necessarily do very well with Maine voters and that’s because Maine voters know what they care about and the issues that are important to them.


– Thom Harnett


Dunlap similarly pointed to the national party’s failed attempt to have former Democratic Speaker of the Maine House of Representatives Sara Gideon challenge Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins in 2020. He said the Freeport resident was not well positioned to run statewide but picked for her ability to raise money. 
“They thought all you need to do is raise money and you can beat Susan Collins because people in Napa Valley hate Susan Collins. Well, you know, St. John Valley, not so much,” he said.
On Monday, Dunlap’s campaign said it isn’t releasing specific information about how much money has been raised until the next quarterly filing deadline with the Federal Election Commission, which is in late January, but said that they are positioned to be competitive. 
Meanwhile, Wood has raised $4 million since April, which includes his time as a Senate candidate, according to a news release from his campaign last week. Additionally, filings with the Federal Elections Commission show Golden having raised $2.3 million before exiting the race and LePage bringing in a little more than $900,000.
As secretary of state, Dunlap made a national name for himself by serving on Trump’s voter fraud commission during the president’s first term and refusing to hand over sensitive Maine voter information that the commission requested.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_7439-scaled-e1765227378619-1024x682.jpeg,,,2025-12-09 05:58:23.819005

(Photo by Megan Varner/Getty Images)A new multi-state coalition is pushing for federal funding and support for Ohio and other Appalachian states as major flooding events increase in the region.
The Appalachian Flood Resilience Coalition spent its first meeting dissecting the federal battles to fund the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the future of flood-related advocacy.
Brendan Muckian-Bates, policy and advocacy associate with the Appalachian Citizens’ Law Center, said the coalition began forming after the July 2022 floods that hit eastern Kentucky and southwestern Virginia. The group united around “resiliency in Appalachia and understanding that these hundred-year, thousand-year flooding events were becoming more common.”
“They were becoming more frequent, deadlier, and the communities where we live and work were really underprepared for the increased devastation that we were witnessing first-hand,” Muckian-Bates said.
  Tracking flooding events 
Natalie Kruse Daniels, professor at Ohio University and director of the environmental studies program, presented a new project on the importance of collecting data through stream gages in Appalachia to help predict future disasters. Stream gages are devices that study water conditions and river flow. Being able to predict and study floods can not only help with disaster cleanup and mitigation, but also the factors that come along with floods, like infrastructure damage and “social vulnerability.”
“Personally … finding good data is one of the biggest challenges when we’re looking at how we practically work on flood damages,” Daniels said.
According to the study conducted by Daniels and Chloe Partlow, rural areas that have a lack of local funding and population density have fewer stream gages to gather data the researchers said is “essential for flood modeling, prediction and warnings.”

The U.S. Geological Survey, which operates more than 11,000 stream gages across the country, is underfunded, hampering its ability to collect more data, the research stated. That struggle comes amid more and more flood events in Appalachia.
“The Central Appalachian region has seen repeated severe flood events that have led to federal disaster declarations and activated FEMA response,” according to Daniels and Partlow’s research.
In some places, up to 16 disasters have been declared between 2011 and 2024.
The attendees of the coalition’s first meeting, which included advocates and regional representatives, were asked what they would fix about natural disaster response and recovery if they had a magic wand. Overwhelmingly, the votes went to funding and communication, along with collaboration and development in the floodplain.
The group was also asked what they wish policymakers knew about flooding in Appalachia, and proactive action rather than a focus on clean up came up several times, along with acknowledgment of how susceptible Appalachian communities are to major flooding.
“Eventually it can affect you, and I think that’s something that does get lost for policymakers,” Muckian-Bates said.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThe law center is working on a project to record the “lessons learned” from Hurricane Helene. In talking with affected communities, Erin Savage, Central Appalachian program manager for the law center, said it was clear that anticipation and intensity of flooding events were becoming more and more challenging, and the enormity of the events is adding to the problems.
“(Hurricane Helene) occurred over such a huge area that there was just a lot of confusion,” Savage said. “Usually counties would be able to assist each other, maybe if one county wasn’t hit so bad it could help a neighboring county, but it was so widespread that there was just no extra capacity.”
  Where’s the funding? 
Appalachian regions are hoping disaster support at the federal level will start improving, but they are cautiously optimistic about the possibilities coming in the next appropriations bill, along with separate efforts currently sitting in Congress.
Federal appropriations related to flooding support for fiscal year 2026 “did not experience the really drastic cuts proposed by the President’s budget request from earlier in the spring,” according to Jessica Arriens, of the National Wildlife Federation. She also said $500,000 appeared in the newest House appropriation proposal for the Appalachian Regional Reforestation Initiative. The federation had requested $5 million in congressional outreach efforts.
“Certainly a lot lower than our request, but if that does pass, it would be the first time that (the initiative) ever got federal funding, so we’d love to see it higher because that program’s really impactful, but we’ll certainly take what we can get,” Arriens said.
Appropriations are unfortunately still imaginary money until passed on Capitol Hill, and even then, convincing higher-ups in the Trump administration to release the money could be another challenge.
“It doesn’t necessarily matter how much gets appropriated if President Trump and cabinet secretaries won’t allow federal agencies like FEMA to spend the money that’s appropriated,” Arriens said.
FEMA has already seen funding get blocked by Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, to the tune of more than $100,000, according to Kevin Zedak, government affairs specialist for Appalachian Voices.
“We’ve seen this impacting community projects directly, holding up that funding from approval,” Zedak said. “So this has been a big hurdle in communities accessing that funding, whether it’s hazard mitigation assistance that was previously distributed, or public assistance.”
Grants from the federal Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program saw $882 million rescinded by FEMA leaders as well, Zedak said, but there are efforts in Congress to “reinstall” that program.
With FEMA reducing their staff by about one-third, and hazard mitigation funding not being consistently awarded after a disaster, the state of Appalachian recovery from flooding and other natural occurrences could become tenuous.
Federal efforts to help the situation exist, but are sitting on a shelf awaiting congressional action.
New legislation was introduced to simplify the process of accessing assistance and create a universal disaster assistance application passed a House committee in September. The bill would also increase transparency on decisions regarding assistance eligibility, according to Rebecca Shelton, director of policy for the Appalachian Citizens’ Law Center.
“(In applying for FEMA assistance) there’s often multiple rounds of rejections from FEMA and appeals from households, and it’s a long and drawn out and challenging, and it’s not very transparent,” Shelton said.
The bill would help bring clarity to the process and transition the public assistance funding model from a reimbursement process to a grant model, something Shelton said advocates support.
While the Chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee expressed confidence in the bill, “currently there’s not a clear vehicle in the House, there’s not yet a companion bill in the Senate, and President Trump is not indicating any support for the bill,” Shelton said.
There’s also a provision in the “ROAD to Housing Act,” passed in a Senate committee in October, that would permanently authorize grants for disaster recovery. Though the provision made it into an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act in the Senate, the provision wasn’t included in the House’s version, leaving the fate of the provision in limbo.
So, the path forward isn’t clear, but Shelton said the remedy is “continued support and advocacy from stakeholders in Appalachia and across the country.”

When the olive green charter bus pulled into the suburban civic center in a conservative area east of Cincinnati just after 9 p.m. on Friday, the women were ready.
They loaded duffels and coolers and bags of snacks into the bus. They carried handmade “Impeach, Convict, Remove” signs, transgender pride flags, and the red hooded cloaks and white bonnets made famous by “The Handmaid’s Tale,” the dystopian feminist novel adapted into a popular Hulu series.
Cincinnati was the first of three stops in a “turn and burn” trip from Ohio to the nation’s capital for a “Remove the Regime” protest — and it didn’t follow the most logical route. Stops in suburbs outside Columbus and Cleveland added hours to the drive. The women didn’t seem to care.
The passengers piled into the dark bus — a dozen or so in Cincinnati, 14 near Columbus, 20 on the outskirts of Cleveland. Some of the women brought along friends, a few came with their spouses and others traveled on their own. There were brief introductions among seatmates as each new group boarded and everyone settled in; a couple of them built blanket tents to block the cold air that seeped in and the lights from cars passing the bus on the highway.
They would need all the rest they could get. This protest trip would involve two overnight bus trips in 36 hours and just 12 hours on the ground.
For people like Judy Routhier, who boarded in Cleveland, the trip to Washington was the latest in a string of public efforts to oppose the Trump administration. This mother of four married to a military veteran said it was her 72nd protest since February. She brought laminated signs that read, “Hump-y Trump-y Must Fall! He’s on the Epstein List” and “This ‘Piggy’ Won’t be Quiet! IMPEACH. CONVICT. REMOVE.”
Deann Ragsdale, who boarded in Cincinnati, was embarking on her first public action despite her opposition to just about every facet of Republican Donald Trump’s presidency from its start. The longtime labor-and-delivery nurse and mother of three teenagers — one of them transgender — keeps a grueling hospital schedule. The protest happened to fall on a weekend off. “Something has to change, and we have to start somewhere,” she said.
Like at many events opposing Trump and his administration, the majority of the bus passengers were women, though a couple who spoke to The 19th noted that men are increasingly joining them in their local protest efforts. The women said they were spurred into action by the administration’s moves to restrict reproductive rights, its attacks on the rights of LGBTQ+ people, its hostility to immigrants and its disregard for the rule of law.
The “Remove the Regime” event was organized by member organizations of the Removal Coalition, a grassroots effort just like the Ohio bus trip. The trip had come together just days earlier, when a woman from Florida raised more than $30,000 through crowdfunding to “find affordable buses and coordinate seats so that no one is left behind just because they can’t pay for a ticket.” Someone else created a “Get to DC” page on Facebook to connect travelers. There were also local events in places like Charleston, South Carolina, and Fairmont, West Virginia, for those who could not make it to Washington.

When the bus pulled into Union Station, near the Capitol building, just before 9 a.m. on Saturday, Jen Mazzuckelli, who acted as point person for the Cincinnati group, changed into her Handmaid cloak and headed to the Lincoln Memorial. Like many on the bus and at the larger protest, Mazzuckelli is involved with a grassroots political movement known as 50501 — as in 50 protests, 50 states, one movement.
“If somebody says ‘50501,’ you know they’re in the fight, you know they’re in the resistance,”  Mazzuckelli, 52, said. “I feel like we’re in Star Wars.”
Mazzuckelli, a mother of three who extracted herself from an abusive marriage, knows on a personal level how looming Republican cuts to social safety net programs like Medicaid health insurance and SNAP nutrition assistance might impact her exurban Ohio community. After her divorce, she said she relied on Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF, which provided cash assistance for necessities until she started receiving child support. She currently receives disability benefits due to a multiple sclerosis diagnosis. She spends more and more of her time protesting the Trump administration and is weighing another run for office after an unsuccessful bid last year for her county’s GOP-dominated board of commissioners. For now, she tries to be a thorn in their side, showing up to meetings.
As Mazzuckelli and other women dressed like Handmaids sat on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial alongside a massive copy of the U.S. Constitution, she thought to herself: “This will probably end up in history books, if we have real history books … It’s a historical moment, and I’m glad I was able to be a part of it instead of watching it on TV.”
“Remove the Regime” was a three-day action that included lobbying, trainings, an event honoring the military and its veterans, then the rally and a march. There were music performances from the Dropkick Murphys, among others, and a sold-out “Comedy Church” fundraiser with a set from North Carolina’s Cliff Cash, who is known for humor skewering Southern conservatism. Cash was one of the first to join the Removal Coalition, founded by Jessica Denson, a former staffer on Trump’s 2016 campaign who brought a class-action lawsuit over its use of nondisclosure agreements. Rep. Al Green, a Texas progressive, spoke at the rally, as did House of Representatives contender Kat Abughazaleh from Illinois.

The protest events came after a particularly tumultuous week for Trump that highlighted his past treatment of and continued hostile rhetoric directed at women. After months of delay tactics on behalf of GOP leaders, Congress voted on Tuesday to compel the Justice Department to release its files on disgraced financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Trump snapped, “Quiet! Quiet, piggy,” at a female Bloomberg News reporter who asked about releasing the Epstein files aboard Air Force One. But then he reversed course, writing on his social media platform, Truth Social: “I DON’T CARE! All I do care about is that Republicans get BACK ON POINT.”
Epstein references abounded on signs at the rally; Routhier, who was also wearing a fuzzy pig hat, was one of hundreds who had worked Trump’s exchange with the reporter into their protest gear. A woman from Northern Virginia carried a “Quiet, Piggy, lil’ fascist piggy” sign. A woman in a Trump mask with pig ears and a snout held a sign that urged “IMPEACH the Piggy!!” as she stood next to her Air Force veteran husband. At least a half dozen protesters were dressed up as Miss Piggy from The Muppet Show.
It wasn’t the largest event opposing Trump, but it was meaningful for those in attendance.
Amber Curry, a 36-year-old from Georgia, said the president’s treatment of women was a big factor in drawing her to Washington for her first-ever protest. Her husband is a disabled veteran and her family of six relies on programs like SNAP — which disproportionately serves women, children and older and disabled Americans — to feed themselves and make ends meet. Their benefits, disrupted during the record-breaking government shutdown that ended earlier this month, still aren’t back to normal. Curry warned that she might cry when talking about her reasons for attending the protest. “It’s so beautiful, people here are listening, because no one around me listens,” she said.
After the speakers and musical performances wrapped, the Miss Piggies and the inflatable eagles, polar bears, frogs, sharks, foxes and at least one Cookie Monster lined up behind the Handmaids and began to march. When Marine Force One flew directly overhead as Trump returned to the White House from an aerial tour with Jack Nicklaus of a planned golf course near Joint Base Andrews, fists and middle fingers rose into the air.

At the end of the day, the women from Ohio made their way back to Union Station, convening in the basement food court to wait for the bus. They rolled up their signs ahead of the journey back to America’s Heartland. There was a buzz of excitement as they shared their experiences.
Erin Nezi, 45, said she was initially drawn to protest the Trump administration because she “felt a camaraderie with all of these women,” referring to the Handmaids, who had by then changed out of their cloaks. Nezi’s first local protest was in February; in recent weeks, she’d begun making trips to the nation’s capital. She is part of a group of women trying to build a Handmaid “army” in rural and exurban southern Ohio.
Nezi is currently unemployed after spending years on an assembly line building steering wheels for Ford vehicles. Her husband is a fully disabled Navy veteran dependent on benefits from Veterans Affairs. She said she is protesting for him — and also for other women like her, for her LGBTQ+ family members, for immigrants in her community and for her 69-year-old mother, who relies on subsidized housing. A constant question that runs through her mind, she said, is, “When is it going to come for me?”
The women boarded just after 9 p.m. The bus made its way out of Washington, crossed Maryland and Pennsylvania, and then stopped in Cleveland, Columbus and finally Cincinnati as the sun rose over the horizon. They thanked the bus driver, also a woman. She thanked them for going to the protest.
Routhier said her 73rd protest is already planned.
Ragsdale is considering making a video to share about how she assembled her sturdy, reusable sign.
Mazzuckelli wants to pursue “deep organizing” in rural, conservative pockets of Ohio, perhaps in conjunction with the Working Families Party.
“My idea is to get a committed group here in Clermont [County] and start pushing eastward,” she said.

(Photo by Maya Smith for Kansas Reflector)Consider these chilling numbers regarding the age of homeowners in the past versus today: In 1965, the typical homeowner was in their 20s or 30s. Today, the median age for all home buyers sits at 59.
Data show that nearly half of the people born in the 1960s bought a home by 30. By the 1980s, that number sank to 35%. The average first-time buyer today is 40, the highest on record. The average repeat buyer’s age has climbed to 62, also the highest ever. 
As more people rent rather than buy, movements in Topeka and Wichita protecting renters from abusive landlords have become more important than ever.
Kevin Myles, former head of the Wichita branch NAACP, hosted a town hall Dec. 6 in Wichita where people shared their rental experiences. That information will populate a brief he’s preparing for city officials in January. 
“Wichita is in the midst of a serious housing affordability and stability crisis, where too many families are spending a disproportionate share of their income just to keep a roof overhead,” said Myles, founder and executive director of Community First. “According to city’s own Consolidated Plan, a large share of renter households spends more than 30%, and some are even spending more than 50% of their income on housing costs.” 
That, he said, combined with the recent rejection by the city council of proposals to create a landlord registry or ban discrimination based on source of income, leaves families and youths vulnerable to substandard housing, discrimination and retaliatory eviction. 
He said a strong, codified tenants bill of rights could help protect the dignity, health and stability of families in Wichita. It would guarantee that landlords can’t refuse deny applicants because of income supports.
Myles said these provisions can ensure that landlords with a history of violations are held accountable, and that rental homes meet basic standards, so children don’t live in unsafe conditions.
“In a city where some families already struggle under cost burdens and where renters often lack leverage, codifying these protections can mean the difference between a stable, nurturing home and a cycle of insecurity, eviction risk, and trauma,” Myles said. 
Anyone who ever has rented an apartment or house has a horror story about landlords keeping deposits for dust on windowsills or paint improvements. Landlords certainly also have tenant horror stories of their own, from having to rip up pet-stained carpet, repairing bowling-ball sized holes in walls, and mountains of debris that they have to collect and dump.
After years of renting out property, they would like to retain the right to choose renters that their experience tells them would make for good tenants and reject those more likely to pay late or to damage property.
A tenant’s bill of rights could make life easier for everyone, said Rep. Alexis Simmons, D-Topeka.
“An enforced tenant’s bill of rights protects both tenants and landlords by providing clear expectations, empowering everyone involved,” Simmons said. “The inherently unequal tenant-landlord relationship makes these ordinances particularly important.”
Kansas Legal Services includes resources on its website about tenant rights. 
“This webpage is dedicated to explaining the issues that Kansas tenants might face, as well as their legal rights before, during and after tenancy,” according to the site.
Simmons said the struggling economy may have shifted renter’s attention to mere affordability, but that ignores other important factors.
“Affordable housing means nothing if that housing is not also safe, reliable, and up to code,” she said. “We know from both the hard data and just common sense that tenants with lower incomes and fewer resources are subjected to exploitation and abuse by landlords at a greater rate than everyone else. This can also mean they don’t realize their landlords are breaking the law or know about the avenues through which they can seek remediation and accountability.”

(Photo by David DeWitt, Ohio Capital Journal.)We’re coming close to the point that I wouldn’t want my son to attend college in the United States.
Granted, he’s seven. We have 10 years to turn it around. It’s essential for the health of our nation that we do. 
College is a time when you should be able to think big thoughts and explore challenging ideas. 
As an English and government major, I took courses that may not have taught me how to code, but they did teach me how to think. 
I believe that’s worth fighting for, which is why I’ve joined a growing movement of alumni that are calling on our alma maters to stand strong against ascendant fascism and the Trump regime. 
To make a difference, we need to build a powerful coalition representing alumni from the Ivy Leagues, state schools, and community colleges. 
Because the assaults on academic freedom are well underway within state capitals and inside university administrations, few institutions will be spared. 
Lawmakers in 26 states have introduced more than 70 bills to censure state colleges and universities; 22 have become law in 16 states. 
In Ohio, lawmakers passed Senate Bill 1 to root out “woke ideology” at state colleges and universities. 
It ensures professors teach “both sides” of issues. It also contains provisions to weaken unions’ collective bargaining power. 
Funny how those two things often seem to go together, isn’t it?
It’s troubling to consider how this law would have affected my studies at Cleveland State University’s Maxine Goodman Levin College of Urban Affairs where I received a Master of Public Administration. 
We grappled with redlining, segregation, broken windows policing, welfare reform, and many other difficult topics. 
What do these discussions look like under Senate Bill 1?
Meanwhile, one institution after another is giving in to Trump’s blackmail. 
Northwestern agreed to a $75 million payoff and Brown forked over $50 million. 
The University of Virginia and University of Pennsylvania made a host of concessions about student data and DEI to protect their federal research funding. 
Columbia University was the first to fall with a $200 million payoff to atone for allegations of antisemitism within student Gaza protests. 
Last month, my alma mater, Cornell University, agreed to pay the administration $60 million for similar reasons. 
It agreed to hand over student demographic data to prove admissions aren’t being made based on race. But based on my experience (and the data), it seems legacy students and those from wealthy families are the ones with the real advantage. 
Yet even before they gave Trump his kickback, Cornell discontinued cultural housing such as Ujamaa House for Black students. 
Last year, the administration started cracking down on campus dissent. 
They prohibit students from protesting during “business hours” or after 9 p.m. If a student is caught protesting outside that window, they can be temporarily suspended as they await investigations that may take as long as two semesters. 
Meanwhile, they still owe tuition and must pay back financial aid. 
That’s a costly proposition that seems especially designed to silence the very students most harmed by the Trump extortion deal: first-generation students who are most likely to be students of color or immigrants. 
Combine these developments with the eye-popping cost of college and Trump’s further dismantling of our already flawed student loan program and I return to my original statement: If my son decides to go to college, I’m not sure he should stick around here. 
Most alumni are busy working, raising families, enjoying retirement or panicking about the many other horrors President Trump is unleashing. 
Many of us have been slow to comprehend what has happened on the campuses that shaped us. I’m paying attention now, and closely following the work of Students for a Democratic Cornell, who are leading the charge to give students a voice in the disciplinary process. 
Students can vote for 36 hours starting December 12. 
Back at home, we’re getting organized. 
Groups like Crimson Courage, Stand Strong Brown, Longhorns for Liberty and Stand For Campus Freedom are coming together. 
Members of Cornell Courage recently sent a letter to President Michael Kotlikoff and the Board of Trustees calling on them to take measures to increase transparency and protect student privacy. 
Alumni like me are fighting back in part to protect the legacy of the institutions that we love. 
After all, many of us studied authoritarianism in college. 
We understand why Trump wants to destroy anyone or anything that encourages free thinking. 
For that reason, the fight is about much more than our colleges’ good name: it’s about our future.

Jeff Landry's administration has abruptly cut two contracts with private companies who provide Medicaid health care plans.  (Photo by Michelle Liu/Verite News)Gov. Jeff Landry’s administration is abruptly ending contracts with two of the six companies that provide Medicaid insurance in Louisiana, a move that could leave 488,500 residents uncertain of what health care they will have starting Jan. 1. 
Seth Gold, Louisiana’s Medicaid director, sent short letters last week to the CEOs of Aetna Better Health of Louisiana and UnitedHealthCare of Louisiana announcing their contract extensions with the state had been dropped for 2026. The Illuminator obtained copies of the letters Monday from the Louisiana Department of Health. 
“LDH will begin the transition process of moving your Medicaid members to other contracted Medicaid Managed Care Plans for a Jan. 1 effective date,” Gold wrote in the letters to the companies dated Dec. 2. 

The news came as a surprise to state lawmakers, who voted less than two weeks ago to extend the state’s agreements with both companies at the urging of the Landry administration. 

Attorney General Liz Murrill and other state officials said litigation over pharmacy benefit managers affiliated with Aetna and UnitedHealthCare were factors in stepping away from agreements with the companies. 
Spokespeople for the companies did not respond to requests for comment Monday evening. 
Aetna and UnitedHealthCare provide Medicaid insurance for 157,800 and 330,700 Louisiana residents, respectively, covering one-third of its 1.53 million enrollees.   
Aetna’s contract for the fiscal years 2026 and 2027  –  a time period which started July 1 and ends June 30, 2027 – is $2.59 billion. The UnitedHealthCare contract for the same time period is $2.06 billion, according to documents posted publicly in November. 
In an interview Monday night, Louisiana Health Secretary Bruce Greenstein said his department plans to move the enrollees with Aetna and UniteHealthCare coverage to new health plans before the end of the year. He’s confident the four other companies offering Medicaid plans will be able to handle the influx of new patients. 
AmeriHealth Caritas, Elevance Health, Humana and Louisiana Healthcare Connections are the other private companies who provide Medicaid plans in the state.

The health department is going to use an algorithm to help pick a plan for each person who needs to switch from Aetna or UnitedHealthCare, according to Greenstein. It will prioritize keeping families together with the same health care company and making sure the doctors and other medical professionals a person sees most frequently take their new insurance.

“This will take place over the next two weeks, so it will take place over Christmas,” Greenstein said. “I feel confident that we will be able to execute on this.” 

If a Medicaid recipient is unhappy with their new health care coverage, they will have 90 days starting Jan. 1 to switch into another plan, Greenstein said.

The state’s ongoing litigation with Aetna and UnitedHealthCare over their pharmacy benefit managers pushed the state to end their contracts with the companies, Greenstein and Murrill confirmed. 
In a text message Monday afternoon, Murrill said the companies “are not compliant with [state law] and until they are, they are ineligible for contract extensions.”

Pharmacy benefit managers are middlemen who negotiate prescription drug plans with insurers and drug manufacturers. Murrill and Landry have repeatedly criticized these entities, which are often owned by large health care corporations, of unfair business practices that undercut locally owned pharmacies. 
The attorney general was in Rome Monday preparing for a conference at the Vatican on human trafficking and said she was unavailable for a phone interview. In her text message responses, she did not identify which laws Aetna and UnitedHealthCare are allegedly breaking. 

“They are violating the contracts and have refused to provide us with [documents] we have requested,” the attorney general wrote. “United has engaged in frivolous attacks on the AGs contracting authority as well.” 

“They cannot expect to have a discretionary renewal when they are currently non-compliant,” Murrill said. 
She indicated the state is at more of an impasse with UnitedHealthCare than Aetna. Her office is in settlement discussions with CVS, which is Aetna’s parent company, she added.

In June, Murrill filed three lawsuits against CVS claiming its pharmacy benefit manager, CVS Caremark, operates in ways that discourage competition, particularly from the state’s independent pharmacists. 

She also alleged CVS inappropriately used customer information to launch a text message campaign to defeat state legislation that would have made it difficult for CVS Caremark to work in Louisiana. Landry, who is close to Murrill, was an enthusiastic supporter of the bill, which failed to pass. 
As attorney general in 2022, Landry launched a separate lawsuit against pharmacy benefit manager OptumRx and UnitedHealthCare, which are owned by the same parent company. He alleged they overcharged the state’s Medicaid plan for prescription drugs. 
In that case, which Murrill has since been taken over, the Louisiana First Circuit Court of Appeal recently sided with UnitedHealthCare over the state. 
The court’s ruling for UnitedHealthCare was released Nov. 21, the day after lawmakers signed off the company’s 2026 contract extension. A little over a week later, the health department appeared to reverse course and sent out a notice indicating they weren’t renewing the UnitedHealth agreement. 
The day before the court’s decision came out, the Landry administration had recommended to lawmakers that they allow the Aetna and UnitedHealthCare contractsto  go forward. 

During a nearly three-hour hearing, Greenstein and health department undersecretary Drew Maranto, both Landry appointees, answered dozens of questions from legislators and never expressed reservations about continuing to work with Aetna or UnitedHealthCare. 

Greenstein even pushed back when legislators suggested the state cut its number of Medicaid managed care contracts with private companies. Lawmakers believe working with fewer businesses could lower the administrative costs in the Medicaid program. But Greenstein cast doubt on whether those benefits would be worth the upheaval in the program. 
“Each of the plans brings a different way of envisioning how to engage patients with certain medical complexities,” Greenstein told legislators. “Patients don’t generally switch their health plan very often.”

His remarks are likely why several lawmakers, reached Monday, said they were blindsided when they discovered the health department had canceled the contract extensions. 
The governor and the health department didn’t give the legislators advance notice before they reversed course with Aetna and UnitedHealthCare.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Medicaid-navigators-1-1024x768.webp,,,2025-12-09 01:56:42.872523

(Tero Vesalainen/Getty Images)A fight between President Donald Trump and Gov. Ron DeSantis threatens to blow up Florida House Speaker Danny Perez’s planned “artificial intelligence week” in the Legislature, intended to set policy for the technology.
Although Perez, a Miami Republican, had planned for weeks to use Dec. 8-12 committee hearings to analyze the effects of AI in different Florida industries, the topic took on a national angle when Trump announced early Monday that he would sign an executive order creating a national rule preventing states from handing down their own regulations.
That put him in direct conflict with DeSantis, who’s long-railed against the dangers of AI and last week rolled out a proposal called the “Artificial Intelligence Bill of Rights.”
“There must be only One Rulebook if we are going to continue to lead in AI,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “I will be doing a ONE RULE Executive Order this week. You can’t expect a company to get 50 Approvals every time they want to do something.”
Hours later, DeSantis indirectly responded on X, asserting, “An executive order doesn’t/can’t preempt state legislative action. Congress could, theoretically, preempt states through legislation…I doubt Congress has the votes to pass this because it is so unpopular with the public.”
He referenced the U.S. House passing the “One Big Beautiful Bill” over the summer with a clause banning states from regulating AI for 10 years. The Senate voted 99-1 to strip that section out.
This is the latest — and most blatant — escalation in GOP politicos’ dispute over AI. DeSantis worries that unmonitored AI could usher in an age of “darkness and deceit” while Trump — allied with technology titans like Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg — has for months toyed with banning state-level AI regulations.
This fiscal year alone, massive companies like Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft are expected to invest more than $364 billion in the industry. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is pulling in roughly $13 billion in annual revenue while enjoying more than 800 million regular users.
And although the governor hopes lawmakers will crack down on AI data centers and “grooming” chatbots, and will protect consumer data from AI companies, a nationwide moratorium would severely limit the Legislature’s ability to do so.
Senate President Ben Albritton expressed support for the governor’s position but said he’ll wait and see what’s in Trump’s executive order before acting, he told reporters on Monday.
What can we expect this week?
The Florida House has scheduled 14 committee hearings from Tuesday through Thursday to discuss AI use in different facets of the Sunshine State’s industries.
It’s not clear whether the House meetings will lead to concrete proposals but multiple committees will weigh in on the repercussions of data centers on utility rates and use of artificial intelligence in emergency management, agriculture, education, health, criminal justice, and more.

 Housing First is the only approach proven to significantly reduce the number of people living on the streets, and it is actually more cost-effective than leaving people outside.   
Research shows that supportive housing dramatically lowers hospitalizations, emergency room use, psychiatric crises, and shelter stays, which creates net savings for taxpayers. It is the humane approach and the financially responsible one.
With the exception of promising a pilot program for portable showers and laundry services, Connecticut’s new housing bill (HB 8002) offers nothing to the 500+  people sleeping outside tonight. These are people who cannot wait for zoning reforms, planning committees, or long-term market shifts.
 HB 8002 may reshape how development occurs and create a savings account for middle-class home-buyers, but none of its provisions will bring unsheltered homelessness down and help people trapped in a vicious cycle of trauma. Only    Housing First    could do that.  
 I know this not just from policy research, but also from seeing it affect the lives of people I love.  
I was grateful to meet a woman in recovery who shared with me her incredible story. She told me about how she once lived unsheltered for over a year. While on the streets, she became a victim of human trafficking, was sexually assaulted by a group of men, and fell deeply into addiction and psychosis, which layered trauma on top of already existing complex post-traumatic stress disorder and schizoaffective disorder. 
 This wasn’t the result of laziness on her part. She was set up for failure from childhood after being abused by her family, and later faced more abuse in romantic relationships. She bounced around from one unsafe situation to another, without the tools to get help or help herself.  
 The turning point in her life did not come from punishment, policing, or incarceration. It came when she was enrolled in a free, stable housing program funded through the state’s Department of Rehabilitation.
 Having a door that locked, a safe place to sleep, and supportive services, as well as just one supportive person in her life, empowered her to stabilize and probably saved her life.
 After a few years of stable housing, safety, and trauma therapy, she found the strength to get sober and pursue higher education and a good career. She is still healing, but she is alive today because someone believed she deserved housing first.  
 I think about her every time I hear about some new catastrophe with my younger brother, who lives with his partner in Hartford. He is also struggling with addiction and mental illness, and is always one crisis away from getting kicked to the street.
 If that happens, he will not qualify for most housing programs because he is unwilling to give up drugs and alcohol at this time and has behavioral problems. This would exclude him from qualifying for disability or for a sober living home. And shelters, as we know, can be dangerous places where violence and assault are far too common. On top of that, the waiting lists are long.  
 As the state of Connecticut stands currently, if my brother ends up on the street, he is far more likely to die than to get better.
 “   Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the poor and needy” (Proverbs 31:9).  
How we treat the people with the least in our society says everything about who we are. Connecticut calls itself compassionate and justice-driven, yet we allow hundreds of people to sleep outside every night, including in winter, because it’s easier to ignore what makes us uncomfortable. 
 The reality of high unsheltered numbers results in    real effects    on our communities. We see increased emergency calls, more unsafe encampments and public places, higher public health costs, an increase in policing and incarceration, and a greater risk for violence.
 If Connecticut wants to address housing, I believe it must adopt solutions that actually address homelessness.  Housing First is an effective method that has been tested in cities all over the    United States and Canada   , as well as in countries like    Finland  .
 Housing First looks like: permanent supportive housing on a statewide scale, deeply affordable units, not just more market-rate buildings, mental health, harm-reduction, and trauma-informed services, and strong community bonds between service recipients and providers.  
 What does HB 8002 do for the unsheltered homeless population in our state? Nothing.  
 A bill cannot be called “housing reform” when it ignores the people with no housing at all.  
 If Connecticut wants cities that are safer, more stable, cost-effective, and more reflective of our values, the way forward is Housing First. 
 Everything else is neglecting the human rights and safety of our most vulnerable nutmeggers.

We must empower organizations committed to thoughtful, community-based change.","This summer, with the support of Wesleyan University’s “Planting Seeds Program”, I had the opportunity to spend eight weeks working at the wonderful organization of New Britain ROOTS, a food justice non-profit organization located in New Britain, Connecticut. 
While working at ROOTS it became abundantly clear to me that other cities around Connecticut, and throughout the rest of the country, need support in terms of food security. All around America, families, children, and entire communities are facing the negative impacts of food insecurity. To address this challenge, federal, state, and local level systems must empower organizations like ROOTS– ones committed to thoughtful, caring, community-based change. It is imperative that this kind of work is implemented everywhere in order to encourage health and well-being throughout the country. 



Specifically, ROOTS has a mission to “cultivate community connections and equitable access to quality food through empowerment and learning with the people who grow, prepare, and eat food in New Britain.”
Their vision is promoted throughout the New Britain community via three key concepts: food access, urban agriculture, and education. 
Earlier this fall, ROOTS was able to run school-based farmers markets with 3rd and 4th grade classrooms. This was possible thanks to a grant from the Community Foundation of Greater New Britain and to partnerships formed with the New Britain school district.  
Program Manager Jenna VanDonselaar expressed what a “joyful experience [it is] to see young people shop at the market” as ROOTS is deeply committed to “immersing children in gardening, cooking and nutrition literacy at a young age”. 

Lennon Favreau

Jenna also gave insight into the community that ROOTS works with as many of their students face food insecurity and were happy to bring market food home to support their families in a time when the SNAP program is at risk due to decisions being made at the national level under the current administration.  
It is unfair to expect a child to carry the burden of providing this kind of support for their families, yet so many children throughout the country face this challenge. Jenna emphasizes that “decisionmakers… owe it to our young people” to prioritize food security at the federal and state levels– it’s all a big puzzle, and Jenna says it best: “School food is a big piece of that puzzle” 
Based on these goals and strategies, ROOTS is part of the larger, national effort to build farm-to-school initiatives. Another special part of ROOTS that helps execute these goals is school gardens located at schools around the city. 
ROOTS Community Project Manager, Alex McHardy, acknowledges that children come from diverse backgrounds and that there is importance in “helping them reconnect with their own culture through conversations centered around produce and dishes”. A large part of this goal can be done through school food.  
Farm-to-school missions ensure that students are receiving access to fresh, healthy, local, and culturally relevant food through stronger partnerships between education, agricultural, and community-based systems. In order to achieve farm-to-school goals, there has to be thoughtful collaboration amongst students, parents, school staff, nonprofit organizations, and farmers to prioritize an empowered, sustainable system in which children can thrive. 
When students face food insecurity firsthand, and are challenged with the expectation to grapple with its effects, it becomes impossible for students to learn, socialize, and maintain health. They need support from federal, state, and local systems to relieve some of this pressure. ROOTS is a huge step in the right direction in terms of mitigating the harmful impact of food insecurity. That is why we need more ROOTS, everywhere. 
In Middletown, Randall Mel Jr., the Director of Food, Nutrition and Wellness Services in Middletown Public Schools is doing an extensive amount of work to increase students’ access to fresh and nutritious foods. Randall notes that he “would love to see a similar program” to ROOTS “in Middletown–one that uplifts students and the community while leading the way in farm-to-school initiatives.” 
The love that community members and farm-to-school advocates have for ROOTS is abundantly clear. It is time that federal and state decisionmakers realize food insecurity in the United States is an issue that cannot be ignored any longer. This state and this country needs to support, uplift, and empower more organizations like ROOTS in order for our nation’s students to grow into healthier, happier, and more connected individuals.

(Photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)A coalition representing at least two Eastern Shore counties has appealed the water quality certification Maryland issued to the Conowingo Dam in September, potentially threatening a $340 million settlement with the dam’s owners.
The Clean Chesapeake Coalition’s administrative appeal, filed Nov. 14 with the Maryland Department of the Environment, argues that the years of contentious negotiations that led to the settlement were conducted behind closed doors, freezing out groups like the coalition. That has enraged the county leaders backing Clean Chesapeake’s complaint.
“That’s really why this appeal was filed, is because we heard nothing about this until the deal was done,” said Charles “Chip” MacLeod, the attorney who filed the complaint. “We don’t know whose comments they considered and to what extent they considered [them]. None of that. We’re totally outside the process.”
MacLeod argues that MDE’s procedure violated state law, rendering the certification invalid. And he said the counties also believe that the resulting agreement will not protect the health of the bay, in part because it does not require dredging behind the dam.
State environmental officials, however, argue that the agreement has tremendous implications for the bay, and the discussions had to be confidential because they concerned litigation brought against the state by groups opposed to an earlier agreement, in 2018. The officials highlight the fact that the state solicited public comment about the dam in 2023 — and took those comments into account.

“We are puzzled by the timing of this submission, as public comment occurred in 2023 as part of a seven-year effort over two administrations,” wrote Department of the Environment spokesperson Jay Apperson. “The input from county partners led to the provisions that address dredging that did not exist in the previous agreement.”
MDE officials will evaluate the complaint and “respond as appropriate,” Apperson said.
At issue is the water quality certification the state issued Constellation Energy, which owns the hydroelectric dam spanning the Susquehanna River just north of where it enters the bay. Without the certification from the state, Constellation cannot pursue a 50-year license from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission needed to operate the hydropower plant.
The nearly century-old dam once helped the ecosystem by trapping harmful sediments rushing downstream. But the pool behind the dam has become full, so it no longer has trapping capacity. That means a severe storm could unleash large quantities of sediment into the bay at once, which could smother critical underwater life.
The certification from the state — and the multimillion-dollar pledge from Constellation — was the result of several years’ worth of contentious negotiations between the state and the parties that had challenged the 2018 version of the certification, Constellation and two local waterkeepers’ groups.
Under the latest deal, Constellation agreed to pay the state about $340 million over the years for a variety of environmental initiatives, supporting everything from a new mussel hatchery to debris clean-ups and $18.7 million for dredging studies.
Appeal could slow dam’s pursuit of 50-year license from the feds
“The agreement came after years of difficult negotiations that brought the Conowingo Dam’s water quality certification process to a conclusion in a manner that protects the Chesapeake Bay and ensures the continued operation of Maryland’s largest renewable energy source,” wrote Paul Adams, a spokesman for Constellation. “MacLeod’s filing risks to delay the implementation of this historic agreement and the many investments to protect Chesapeake Bay.”
Apperson called it “reckless” for the coalition to “come in at the end of the process and try to halt real progress for Maryland.”
“Disrupting this process will only delay or possibly remove dredging and other water quality projects because it will plunge us back into even more years of delay with no action,” Apperson wrote.
In his filing, MacLeod raised other deficiencies with MDE’s certification.

He said that the department failed to adequately explain the departure from the 2018 agreement, which would have required the dam owner (then Exelon, Constellation’s former parent company) to pay up to $172 million each year, if it could not meet requirements to reduce sediment overflows.
He also wrote that MDE failed to sufficiently consider the effects of climate change, or new information like the recent decline of the Chesapeake Bay’s striped bass population, when it issued the certification to Constellation.
“Who, with a straight face, can’t say there isn’t a lot of new data and information to consider since 2018, as it relates to Chesapeake Bay water quality issues, right?” MacLeod said. “We know a lot more.”
He wrote that MDE should have considered the dam’s structural integrity when it issued the certification, pointing to FERC documents “addressing structural and monitoring issues,” including some faulty piezometers, which measure pressure on the dam, and vegetation growing in inappropriate areas.
Despite that, an August report from a FERC engineer said that, “No signs of immediate dam safety concerns were observed,” during a late-July inspection.
Constellation argues that recent inspections show Conowingo is structurally sound. The company conducts careful maintenance of the dam, Adams said, which was “built to last,” and has 93 “fully operational” piezometers. He said Constellation is consulting with FERC on a plan to add 32 more.
“FERC and Constellation regularly correspond on the subject of dam safety, which is a sign of a regulatory process that is working well and as intended,” Adams wrote.
MacLeod said that if MDE rejects the appeal, he would consider a court challenge, if he got adequate support from the counties.
He said officials in Cecil, Dorchester, Kent and Queen Anne’s counties support his petition. Leading officials in Cecil and Dorchester confirmed their support. Queen Anne’s did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The Kent County Commissioners, meanwhile, have yet to vote. But Ronald Fithian, president of the commissioners, said Kent has been a longtime supporter of the Clean Chesapeake Coalition, and he expects the three commissioners to support MacLeod’s complaint when the item hits their agenda in the coming weeks — along with a $5,000 payment to MacLeod to support the effort.
MDE tries to sway reluctant officials
With the administrative appeal under consideration, MDE officials are lobbying at least one of the opposing counties to back down.
On Tuesday, MDE officials traveled to Dorchester’s County Council meeting to advocate for the agreement — and warn about the negative consequences of an appeal.
“Any legal challenge doesn’t just pause the paperwork,” said Heather Nelson, Wetlands & Waterways Protection Program manager at MDE. “It’s freezing the funding. So all payments for mussel restoration, dredging analysis and mitigation projects are going to be stayed.”
State officials are also concerned that the Environmental Protection Agency appears very close to making changes to Section 401 of the Clean Water Act, which gives state governments the authority to issue certifications like the one issued to Constellation.
If the federal government restricts states’ authority, and the Conowingo certification is hung up by appeals, it could put the agreement at risk, meaning Constellation wouldn’t be required to make any payments to Maryland.










How many years have we been waiting to know the dredge is a problem behind the dam? But we’re going to study it, and they’ve got another 50 years before they’ve got to dredge. So guys, I am not for this program right now that you’ve got. I’m sorry.


– Dorchester County Councilman Richard Travers.


Delays could also cause FERC to issue the 50-year license with none of Maryland’s conditions, Nelson said.
“That’s a very real risk,” Nelson said. “So the legal stakes are incredibly high, and the delays risk that we end up with just years of litigation and zero environmental improvements at the dam.”
But MDE’s arguments did not seem to resonate with Dorchester officials, most of whom continued to oppose the agreement.
“How many years have we been waiting to know the dredge is a problem behind the dam? But we’re going to study it, and they’ve got another 50 years before they’ve got to dredge,” said Councilman Richard Travers. “So guys, I am not for this program right now that you’ve got. I’m sorry.”
Deputy Environment Secretary Adam Ortiz told the council that the additional studies are likely needed to try and lower the cost of dredging behind the dam, including by studying beneficial reuse for the sediment and heavy metals stuck in the reservoir. For example, Ortiz said that, with a lowered price, the federal government could be swayed to contribute.
“I wish we could get it out of Constellation. We did not have the legal authority to do that. So, this is the path: To make sure it’s economically viable, to see what’s in the sediment that is of value, that we’re able to extract and then resell,” Ortiz said.

The agreement between MDE and Constellation lets the department use the $18 million to conduct studies, or to take other actions, like to begin evaluating a dredging permit for the site. All parties are waiting for a key study from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, expected in late 2026 or early 2027.
Cecil County spokesperson Robert Royster said in a statement that the county is “extremely troubled by both the lack of transparency in these negotiations and the pressure being applied by the state to accept the agreement before we fully understand its implications.”
“Cecil County is deeply concerned that this settlement was negotiated in secret, without any consultation or input from the counties most directly affected,” Royster wrote.
He added that the county’s water intakes south of the dam, including in Perryville, Port Deposit and Havre de Grace, “continue to experience significant impacts from sediment and debris trapped behind the Conowingo Dam.”
Kent County Commission President Ronald Fithian said his personal experience as a waterman tells him that more needs to be done at the dam. He still remembers Hurricane Agnes in 1973, when the dam opened its gates and clouded the bay in massive quantities of sediment.
“That thing shut the bay down for probably at least three months after the storm, for any type of harvesting,” Fithian said. “The sediment that come down was just unbelievable.”
But the issues didn’t stop with Agnes. Especially now that the dam’s reservoir is full, he fears that it is continuing to unnaturally eject sediment into the Upper Bay — diminishing the area’s oyster industry.
He thinks Constellation should be compelled to dredge behind the dam. And he balks at the $18 million allotment to study the idea, because prior studies have come and gone with no action.
“It’s gone unattended. They’ve let it fill up. So now, we get all of the sediment, nutrients — all the nasty things that might be coming down the Susquehanna River,” Fithian said. “We get it all. And the bay just can’t keep up with it.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/HEADSHOT-198-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-09 00:57:17.654934

Ford/Maryland Matters)The Maryland General Assembly voted to include a statewide professional teacher development program known as “coaching” in the final version of the Excellence in Maryland Public Schools Act.
What lawmakers didn’t include in the act, to the dismay of education advocates, was money for the program.
So the state’s top education cheerleaders, including State Superintendent Carey Wright, will once again try to convince state legislators of the importance of coaching when the General Assembly returns next month for its 2026 session.
Wright said coaches are knowledgeable in many aspects of education such as the science of reading. In addition, they are good at working with adults and can model lessons.
“They don’t do recess duty. They don’t do bus duty. They’re not assigned to cover assessments. They’re there to work with teachers each and every day,” Wright said Monday at the Maryland READS third annual event at Maple Springs Baptist Church in Prince George’s County. More than 130 other state education officials, educators, nonprofit and community leaders and advocates turned out for the event.
The nonprofit organization’s event coincided with a report it released last month titled, “What are the Stories Behind the Scores?” that includes data from the Maryland Comprehensive Assessment Program., including results from tests students took this spring. While that program saw a third straight year of overall improvements in language arts scores, test results also showed that significant gaps remain between demographic groups, such as Black, Latino and students with disabilities.
Blueprint board approves legislative recommendations for 2026 session

In following its mantra in READS – Reading Education Aligned to Data and Science – the group released a brief Monday that said investing in sustained coaching improves literacy.
To amplify its point, it noted how Georgia students made a 15% improvement in reading scores after the state implemented a literacy coaching program to begin the 2024-25 school year. According to that state’s Department of Education, full-time literacy coaches were placed in 60 of the state’s lowest-performing elementary schools, impacting more than 18,000 students.
The Maryland READS brief summarized the importance of coaching through six pillars: trust, content focus, active learning, coherence, sustained duration and collective participation.
“This is the legislature’s opportunity to show the Nation that Maryland is committed to making the necessary investments to realize the promise of the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future” education reform plan, according to the brief. “If we make only one new investment in education, we should place our bets here.”
It could be a tough sell, as lawmakers face a potential a $1.5 billion budget deficit when they convene Jan. 14 for the 2026 legislative session.
But a few legislators did travel to Maple Springs Baptist Church in Capitol Heights, including Sen. Malcolm Augustine (D-Prince George’s) and Dels. Andrea Fletcher Harrison (D-Prince George’s), Jared Solomon (D-Montgomery), April Miller (R-Frederick) and Eric Ebersole (D-Baltimore County).
Three of the lawmakers serve on committees that review and draft education policy. Augustine serves on the Senate Education, Energy, and the Environment Committee; Ebersole and Miller serve on the House Ways and Means Committee.
Solomon, who serves on the House Appropriations Committee, which assesses the state budget, offered some advice for attendees as they try to explain to his colleagues why coaching matters.
“We need to hear from all of the folks in your network that coaching is a non-negotiable,” said Solomon, one of the legislative leaders in early childhood education. “This needs to be included in the budget. That this needs to be an investment, otherwise the Blueprint will not [work].”

School board association looking for new CEO
Milton (Milt) Nagel is leaving his job as executive director of the Maryland Association of Boards of Education to become vice president for administrative services at Chesapeake College in Wye Mills, the association has announced.
Nagel will stay on board until late spring to help with transition for a new executive director. The MABE board plans to launch a search for his replacement next month.
Nagel joined the association as deputy director in 2021. MABE President Diana Hawley, who also serves as president of the Cecil County Board of Education, said Nagel has modernized MABE during his time there, singling out his ability to expand programs and cost-saving services for school board members throughout the state while keeping dues stable.
“He’s leaving MABE in great shape for our next Executive Director. To that end, we expect to launch a search for MABE’s new Executive Director in January 2026,” Hawley stated. “We will be searching for a strategic, experienced leader who will continue to strengthen the positive culture Milt grew, and ensure MABE remains the ‘go-to’ entity for sustaining and improving public education throughout our state.”
Before MABE, Nagel spent nearly three decades with Caroline County Public Schools. for nearly three decades; as a Staff Accountant with Jefferson, Urian, Doane & Sterner, P.A.; and for eight years as a U.S. Army Reserve Officer.
“I love everything about what MABE does and stands for,” he said in a statement from the association. “Stepping away is not easy, but it’s time for me to focus more on my family, and I couldn’t pass up the opportunity presented by Chesapeake College.”

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden, who has his own idea to reduce property taxes, does not sound impressed with 19 recommendations from a legislative task force.
“I’ve realized that there’s not much I’ve seen that I could support,” Rhoden told South Dakota Searchlight during a visit to Rapid City last week.
The governor’s own proposal, which he announced in March, would authorize an optional sales tax for counties. The revenue would be used to reduce property taxes for homeowners. 
“And I’ll say this, too: I’m not done yet,” Rhoden added. “We’re still looking at some other ideas.”
Lower spending, higher sales tax, revenue shifts: A closer look at 19 ways to reduce property taxes

Proposals from the governor and lawmakers will be debated during the annual legislative session at the Capitol in Pierre, which begins Jan. 13 and continues until March.
The legislative task force compiled its 19 recommendations throughout the summer. They include tweaks to existing practices, like creating an online system for property tax relief applications from elderly and disabled people, instead of requiring paper forms. Other recommendations would require major policy changes, such as cutting state spending and using the savings to reduce property taxes, capturing proceeds from a higher state sales tax rate for property tax relief, and taking money from the state’s reserve accounts and a housing infrastructure fund to provide property tax credits for homeowners.
The speaker of the state House of Representatives, Jon Hansen, R-Dell Rapids, co-chaired the Legislature’s Comprehensive Property Tax Task Force. He’s also one of the candidates challenging Rhoden for the Republican nomination for governor next year.
When the task force announced its 19 recommendations in October, Hansen framed high property taxes as a government spending problem. He authored two of the recommendations, including a request for the governor’s cooperation in cutting 5% of the spending from the state’s general fund.
“Real tax relief begins with right-sizing government,” Hansen said in a news release at the time.
Rhoden challenged that framing last week during his annual budget address to the Legislature, saying there’s little room for cuts in his lean budget proposal.
“I share the desire to cut property taxes,” Rhoden said in the speech. “But slashing health care, education and public safety is not the way to do it.”
Pressure to address rising taxes is coming from South Dakota homeowners, whose property tax payments increased nearly 40% during the past four years.
State government does not receive any property tax revenue. It relies mostly on sales taxes.
Property tax revenue goes primarily to schools and counties, with lesser amounts to cities and other local taxing entities. Cities can also impose sales taxes.

Rhoden’s proposal would give counties the option to impose a half-percent sales tax. Revenue would be used to reduce the county portion of property taxes on owner-occupied homes. Any excess revenue would be used to reduce commercial and agricultural property taxes.
Because sales taxes apply to anyone spending money in the state, Rhoden has said his plan would “shift a portion of the county tax burden to out-of-state visitors.”
County commissioners could impose the sales tax, and citizens could gather petition signatures to send the decision to local voters. The tax would be limited to a five-year renewable term.
It’s the second property tax relief idea from Rhoden since he was elevated from lieutenant governor in January, after Gov. Kristi Noem’s departure to run the federal Department of Homeland Security.
Lawmakers approved the first idea in March, and it took effect on July 1. The multifaceted law is intended to slow property tax increases. It places tighter limits on the growth of property assessments and local government budgets for five years, exempts some home improvements from affecting assessments, and makes more elderly and disabled people eligible for property tax assessment freezes by raising program limits on their income and home values.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Members of a state board overseeing charter schools said they’re running out of patience with a local high school facing allegations of alarmingly low staff levels, weak finances and poor organization.
A corrective action plan from Proud To Partner Leadership Academy, an Oklahoma City charter high school known as PTPLA, “raised more questions than answers,” Statewide Charter School Board member Damon Gardenhire said.
Starting the process to close the school is “the mood I’m in,” Gardenhire said after hearing a presentation from PTPLA’s superintendent on Monday. Ultimately, he and the rest of the board voted to give school officials until January to provide more documents and allow site visits.
That extra month is “a lifeline” for PTPLA, the statewide board’s chairperson, Brian Shellem, said. The school will remain on probation in the meantime.

As the charter authorizer for PTPLA, the statewide board has the authority to cancel the school’s founding contract, which would effectively shut down the school and cut off its state funding.
The board placed PTPLA on probation, one step away from closure, on Nov. 10 and demanded a corrective action plan. It did so after board staff reported observing only one teacher working at the school and a lack of rigorous instruction for PTPLA’s 100 students. School officials have said those reports were inaccurate.
Board staff also raised financial concerns after the school laid off teachers in October and finished the previous fiscal year with a budget deficit.
PTPLA Superintendent Dawn Bowles said she maintained a full teaching staff despite the layoffs because the affected teachers agreed to work as unpaid volunteers and for part-time pay. They could return to full-time status once the school receives additional state funding in January, she said.
Multiple statewide board members said they were still unsatisfied with Bowles’ response after listening to her present for nearly 2 1/2 hours on Monday. After her presentation, she told news reporters that her school has “no unresolved deficiencies.”

PTPLA leaders haven’t turned over even basic documents like the school’s current budget, Shellem and statewide board staff said. 
Email records, which Oklahoma Voice obtained, show PTPLA received repeated requests for all of its budgets since July 2024, the daily schedules and duties of its staff, and employee and volunteer sign-in sheets from July 1 to present.
“We’re hunting for information, and it shouldn’t be that hard,” Shellem said.
The school so far has turned over mid-to-late November timesheets for its part-time workers, its enrollment counts, details on its reduction in force and a letter state officials requested that confirmed PTPLA received a $400,000 grant this summer, according to records Oklahoma Voice received from the state board.
Bowles said she and other school leaders are willing to cooperate with the statewide board. She said “all that has been requested, we have provided.” 
“We’ll be always willing to work together, as we say, in the spirit of cooperation and partnership with transparency,” she said. “We have nothing to hide.”
Email records show PTPLA’s school board chairperson, Sharri Coleman, wrote to state officials Nov. 30 to inform them the school would not provide any documents before Monday’s meeting beyond what it submitted with its corrective action plan. 
“Our priority for the remainder of the semester is serving our Ambassadors,” Coleman wrote using the school’s term for its students, “so the Superintendent and PTPLA staff will devote their time to instruction and end-of-semester responsibilities rather than gathering new materials ahead of the Board’s review.”
On Friday, the school’s attorney sent a letter threatening legal action. 
The statewide board breached PTPLA’s charter contract by not giving sufficient notice, failing to properly evaluate the school and relying on “unverified assumptions” before placing the school on probation, according to the letter, which Oklahoma Voice obtained.
Shellem said the accusations in the letter are “baseless.”

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)LOUISVILLE — Republican leaders in the Kentucky legislature say that Medicaid, the state income tax and housing are on their minds as they prepare for the 2026 legislative session and debating the next state budget. 
The lawmakers — Senate President Robert Stivers, Sen. Julie Raque Adams, House Majority Floor Leader Steven Rudy and House Majority Whip Jason Nemes — spoke to a crowd that included many of their legislative colleagues and Louisville business leaders during a Monday panel hosted by Greater Louisville Inc., the local chamber of commerce. 
In the months since the last regular session, lawmakers serving on interim committees and task forces have examined issues and made recommendations. Next month, the Kentucky General Assembly will convene again in regular session in Frankfort. 
“I think you will see something, if not a lot, from virtually every task force we have had, because that’s the purpose,” Stivers, of Manchester, said at the beginning of the panel. He added that some of interim committees and task forces might be extended to review issues again.
Adams, co-chair of the Medicaid Oversight and Advisory Board, said it has been reviewing changes required of states by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed by Congress and signed by President Donald Trump earlier this year. The measure is expected to cut federal Medicaid spending by $900 billion over 10 years. 
“Our objective here is to make sure that the Medicaid program in the state of Kentucky is not only sustainable, but is going to take care of those people who truly need it because it is our moral obligation to make sure that we care for those most vulnerable,” said Adams, of Louisville. 
With clear supermajorities in the House and Senate, Kentucky Republicans passed a law at the end of the 2025 legislative session that makes several changes to Medicaid, including a mandated work requirement for Kentuckians between the ages of 18 and 60 who don’t have dependents and are “physically and mentally able to work.” The new federal law also mandates a Medicaid work requirement.
Meanwhile, some lawmakers have been pushing for continuing to lower the state income tax despite not meeting some fiscal benchmarks in the most recent fiscal year. A 2022 Republican-backed law that reduced the individual income tax rate by a half-percentage point also created  “triggers” based on state revenues and the size of the “rainy day” fund to determine when the state can afford another half-percentage point cut. Republicans’ goal is to eventually end the state’s individual income tax altogether.
Adams said Senate Republicans discussed the issue during a recent caucus retreat and said Kentucky “didn’t miss it by a lot, but it still technically didn’t hit the formula.” 
“Our objective is to get to zero, but in the most responsible way possible,” she added. “And I think that that behooves everybody in this room, every business in this room, that we continue to maintain that responsible course.”
Stivers later said that lawmakers will have more information within the next couple of days once receipts come in for taxes paid in November. Earlier this year, the Beshear administration delayed the filing deadline for 2024 taxes to November following floods and severe storms in the winter and spring. 
Nemes, of Louisville, has argued that the delays in tax filing have delayed revenue that the state typically would have collected by now and that the state has met the legislature’s requirements for another tax cut.
“I’m going to advocate to reduce it every chance I possibly can see an opening, but if we don’t do that, I do think that being very disciplined in our budgeting is the way forward,” Nemes said, who has been one of the most vocal supporters of continuing to lower the income tax. 
As for housing needs, Adams said that a “one-size-fits-all” approach may not work statewide, as Louisville, the state’s largest city, has different needs than smaller towns. She praised some strategies underway in Louisville, such as a program introduced by Mayor Craig Greenberg for developers to turn vacant downtown office buildings into residential and mixed-use properties. 
Rudy, of Paducah, said that lawmakers will likely look at pushing back against local ordinances they believe inhibit growth, but city and county officials who “don’t have dumb policies” won’t have to worry about that. 
“We typically believe in home rule and don’t want to get involved, but sometimes some municipalities in this state kind of can’t get out of their own way, so we might get out of their own way,” Rudy said, vaguely referring to a city “60 or so miles east of here,” seemingly Lexington. 
In addition to hosting the Monday panel, Greater Louisville Inc. presented “Most Valuable Policymakers” to several lawmakers, all of whom were Republicans.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_5468-e1765248725794-1024x746.jpg,,,2025-12-08 21:56:30.886771

State officials say the Canton school has a day’s worth of money on hand. 
The school, which opened in August 2023 and is located in the metro area north of Jackson, will undergo a corrective action plan after its leaders meet with members of the authorizer board. The school can salvage its charter by proving it’s financially sound.
The school “continues to fail to comply with applicable laws, regulations and the terms of the charter contract based on the framework,” authorizer board Chair Candace Hunt read from the motion to start the revocation process.
It was the only charter school with “material weaknesses” tied to late financial reporting, according to an audit by Letitia Johnson, bureau director of the Mississippi Department of Education Office of School Financial Services. The school had turned in its most recent audit 23 days late, which does not meet the standard set by the authorizer board.
“This is a really big issue,” said board member Erin Meyer. It’s an issue, she said, because school boards “are not holding themselves accountable.”
The school has $24,000 of cash on hand, according to the audit. The authorizer board recommends that charter schools have between 30 to 60 days of cash.

Leaders of SR1 (Scientific Research), the Ridgeland-based organization that operates the school, disputed the audit findings. School business manager Iraiz Gonzaga sent Mississippi Today a screenshot of the school’s November bank statement from Trustmark, which showed a $171,079 balance.
Authorizer board members also criticized the school for projecting a 300 student enrollment for 2027, which would be an increase in 225 students from its current enrollment of 103. The school had already amended its enrollment target for the past year’s financial paperwork.
If the Mississippi Board of Education finds SR1 didn’t meet its enrollment target, the school could lose funding. Funding is tied to enrollment, and can be taken back by the Education Department in future budget allocations.
“They have not met their enrollment target since they’ve been operational,” authorizer board Executive Director Lisa Karmacharya said. “This is not just about the (performance) framework. These are continuing concerns around enrollment.”
In 2023, just months after the school opened, state officials considered pulling its charter because it had enrolled 15 students instead of the 150 students in kindergarten and first grade projected to attend in the school’s approved charter application. 
On Monday, Karmacharya also raised concerns that enrollment dropped from 23 students in first grade to 16 in second grade the next school year. Overall enrollment rose from 12 students in 2023-24 to 84 in 2024-25. 
“So what that says to me is potentially they’re not staying,” Karmacharya said. “You want your kiddos to matriculate through and stay over time.”
The school introduces courses in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) at the elementary level. Its curriculum was set up to be informed by “the latest in neuroscience, psychology, and other fields,” embracing principles of “biophilic design” and “neuroarchitecture.”
SR1 College Preparatory and STEM Academy is not the only school in Mississippi that officials say is in financial trouble. In November, the state Department of Education voted to take over the Okolona Municipal Separate School District for the second time in 15 years. District officials couldn’t make the school system’s November payroll.
But leadership for the Canton charter school denied that they are unable to pay staff like Okolona schools. 
Gonzaga, the school’s business manager, challenged the inability to fact check claims made during the authorizer board’s discussion about the motion. The Mississippi Charter Authorizer Board allows school representatives to make speeches during a designated public comment period, but does not allow representatives to fact check claims during debates surrounding votes.
“SR1 CPSA remains committed to transparency, academic excellence, and respectful collaboration,” Gonzaga said.

U.S. District Judge Zachary Bluestone ruled he had no jurisdiction over the lawsuit brought on behalf of Secretary of State Denny Hoskins and the General Assembly claiming the U.S. Constitution bars state referendums on Congressional district plans.
The decision came just a few hours after Cole County Circuit Judge Christopher Limbaugh conducted a three-hour trial over when a referendum petition drive can begin and which signatures should be counted when petitions are submitted.
Limbaugh did not issue a ruling Monday and gave attorneys until Wednesday afternoon to file proposed judgments.
Dark money groups pour cash into fight over gerrymandered Missouri congressional map

The redistricting bill forced through in September by Republicans at the insistence of President Donald Trump is scheduled to take effect Thursday for use in the 2026 elections.
Republicans hope to win seven of the state’s eight congressional seats by adding enough GOP votes to flip the 5th District, currently held by Democratic U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver of Kansas City. 
If referendum petitions with sufficient signatures are submitted, the map will take effect only if it is upheld in a statewide vote in November.
The issues in the now-dismissed federal case can all be decided in state court, wrote Bluestone, a recent Trump appointee. All Hoskins has to do, he said, is reject the petitions gathered by People Not Politicians, the campaign committee seeking the referendum.
The deadline for submitting signatures is Thursday.
“Fortunately for the state, Secretary Hoskins has a tool at his disposal that almost no other litigant could boast — the power to declare the petition unconstitutional himself,” Bluestone wrote.
That would trigger litigation over the main question, he wrote.
“A decision that the Missouri Constitution does not permit a redistricting referendum would moot the state’s federal constitutional claims, while a decision that it does clearly permit them would significantly narrow the issues,” Bluestone wrote. “Further, abstaining here would avoid federal interference in a referendum process created entirely by the Missouri Constitution and state law.”
 State lawsuit over signatures

The main question in the lawsuit heard Monday afternoon by Limbaugh is when a referendum petition drive can begin.
Attorney Chuck Hatfield, representing People Not Politicians, said the Missouri Constitution’s clause giving the people the “power to approve or reject by referendum any act of the general assembly” means signature gathering can begin as soon as lawmakers hold the final vote on a bill. 
“We don’t need the governor’s signature on something to seek a referendum on it,” Hatfield said. “Nor do we need the secretary of state’s approval to gather signatures.”
Deputy Solicitor General William Seidleck, arguing for the state, said a referendum can only be held on a law. No bill, he said, even if passed by lawmakers, is a law until it is signed by the governor. And a law giving the secretary of state authority to approve or reject the form of a referendum petition, he said, means no signatures can be gathered until the approval is received.
“You can only have a referendum on an enacted law,” Seidleck said. “We submit that there’s no law without the governor’s signature.”
Marc Ellinger, who represents a campaign committee set up to defend the map, Put Missouri First, asked Limbaugh to throw the whole case out as premature. No signatures have been submitted, he said, so there’s no true controversy over which are being counted.
“They’re trying to get an answer on the validity of signatures before the statutory process is completed,” Ellinger said.
To force a referendum on a new law, petitioners must get signatures from 5% of voters in six of the state’s eight congressional districts. That is about 110,000 signatures.
People Not Politicians has enlisted more than 2,000 volunteers and gathered more than 300,000 signatures, including 12,000 last week, campaign Director Richard von Glahn said during a Monday morning conference call with the Missouri Voter Protection Coalition.
“We are going to continue to fight to make sure every Missourian’s voice is heard,” von Glahn said to coalition members.
Missouri GOP goes scorched earth to keep its gerrymandered map off the 2026 ballot

In the afternoon, von Glahn was in a Cole County courtroom while Chrissy Peters, state elections director since 2017, testified that unless a court order says otherwise, no signatures collected before Oct. 14 will be checked against voter registration rolls.
That is a key date because it’s the day Hoskins approved the form of the petition. In the lawsuit, People Not Politicians is arguing that signatures gathered after Sept. 15, when the petition form was submitted, should be checked.
Of the 300,000 signatures the campaign says it has collected, the outcome of Monday’s hearing would only impact an estimated 92,000 that were pre-emptively rejected by Hoskins. 
Limbaugh has another decision pending that will impact whether or not the referendum occurs. He heard arguments Nov. 12 in a lawsuit brought by opponents of redistricting over the state Constitution’s directive on when and how to draw congressional district maps. 
If Limbaugh rules lawmakers did not have power to redraw the districts between census reports, the law would not take effect. 
The Missouri redistricting fight is part of a national debate over when states can redraw congressional district boundaries for partisan advantage.
Republicans hold a 220-213 edge in the U.S. House, with two vacant seats previously held by Democrats. Six states, including Missouri, have enacted new congressional maps this year in response to the push initiated when Texas redrew its district lines to flip five Democratic seats. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the new Texas map last week.
California countered and revised its maps to move five seats to the Democratic Party,
North Carolina’s new map is intended to net one seat for Republicans, Ohio has passed a new map to add two GOP seats and a nonpartisan redistricting commission in Utah revised that state’s four districts in a way likely to favor a Democratic candidate in one.
Other redistricting efforts are underway. In Indiana, the legislature is meeting in special session to help the GOP gain two seats. Democrats who took supermajorities in the Virginia legislature this year are considering whether to revise lines in that state, where Democrats currently hold a 6-5 edge in the delegation.
As the date for delivering signatures in Missouri approaches, attacks on the petitioners and von Glahn have intensified. Hanaway is demanding personnel records from Advanced Micro Targeting of Dallas, Texas, which is being paid to help with the signature campaign. And Advanced Micro Targeting is suing other political consulting firms, accusing them of paying large sums to sabotage the petition drive.
Donald Trump Jr. led the attacks on von Glahn on social media, calling him a “leftist nut job” who is “trying to STEAL a GOP house seat in Missouri through an unlawful referendum.”
Trump Jr. included a link to a website that called von Glahn a communist.
Denise Lieberman, executive director of the Missouri Voter Protection coalition, called the attacks “absolutely disgusting and inexcusable” during the conference call.
Von Glahn said the insults are generating a counter-reaction.
“These are meant to be sort of psychological warfare, to make me and my family feel isolated and feel threatened,” he said. “It has been a complete backfire. I have gotten more messages of love and support across this state and across the country this week that I could have possibly imagined.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2302-e1755617763363.jpg,,,2025-12-08 21:56:30.886771

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Republican officials in the Matanuska-Susitna Borough have proposed a field of six conservative Alaskans for two vacant seats in the Alaska House of Representatives.
On Sunday, local Republican Party officials delivered their suggestions to replace Cathy Tilton and George Rauscher, whom Gov. Mike Dunleavy appointed to fill two vacancies in the Alaska Senate.
Those Senate vacancies occurred when Sen. Mike Shower, R-Wasilla, resigned to run for lieutenant governor and Sen. Shelley Hughes, R-Palmer, resigned to run for governor.
To replace Tilton, the Republican leaders of House District 26 nominated Chickaloon tribal police chief Donna Anthony, veterinarian Sean McPeck, and a former Tilton aide, Steve St. Clair.
Anthony, McPeck and St. Clair have each filed to run for the seat in next year’s elections. 
For Rauscher’s former seat, Republican leaders for House District 29 picked Chikaloon tribal police officer Lucas Howard, local community council member Gerald Garret Nelson, and former police officer John James. 
Nelson had previously filed a letter of intent to run for the seat next year. 
The nominations are advisory only; Dunleavy may pick anyone who is a Republican, lives in the appropriate district and meets the constitutional requirements for state House.
Under state law, the governor has until Dec. 29 to make his picks. Anyone he chooses must be approved by a majority of the House’s 21 Republicans in order to be seated. 
The governor is expected to act well before the deadline in order to allow time for that confirmation vote and for the new legislators to hire staff and prepare to move to Juneau for the five-month regular legislative session, which begins Jan. 20.
House Minority Leader DeLena Johnson, R-Palmer, is in charge of the House’s all-Republican minority caucus. 
Through a spokesperson, Johnson said the timing of a confirmation vote is dependent upon the governor, but that she is tentatively planning a vote for the upcoming weekend.

It's never a good idea, but particularly so now when the multiyear plan's school reform measures are just starting to pay off.","Elementary school students take a standardized test in this file photo. (Photo by Will and Deni McIntyre/Getty Stock Photo)Every time Maryland’s budget woes make headlines, the same tired scapegoat gets dragged out: the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future, which is Maryland’s plan and funding system for public education. State spokespeople and some media outlets keep repeating that our fiscal challenges stem from “too much spending on education.” It’s an easy line. It’s also wrong—and it ignores what cuts would mean for kids, families, and entire school communities.
When someone says we should “cut the Blueprint,” they aren’t talking about trimming a line on a spreadsheet. The Blueprint is not a separate program. It is the state’s commitment to public schools. They are talking about eliminating legally required services for children: fewer reading specialists, counselors, tutors, college and career pathways, and fewer supports for the students who need them most. Stripping money from the Blueprint means taking resources out of public schools, classrooms, and communities. It’s not abstract. It’s kids who pay.
Yes, the Blueprint is ambitious. Yes, it invests more money than the state was spending before. But that investment was necessary because Maryland allowed its education system to slide from first in the nation to the middle of the pack. The Blueprint was born of a crisis lawmakers could no longer ignore. Maryland voters overwhelmingly support education and want this kind of long-term, systemic improvement.
Now we’re finally seeing progress on early literacy, college- and career-readiness pathways, staffing, and student supports. More kindergartners are entering school ready to learn, attendance is improving, and test scores are moving in the right direction. Cutting or stalling now would mean walking away just as the work is beginning to pay off.

More importantly, funding education isn’t optional. It’s the law—and it’s the only constitutional requirement our state has around budgeting. The legislature passed the Blueprint,  overrode a governor’s veto, and has had four years to shore up the Blueprint fund. They have known about the structural gaps. They have seen the fiscal forecasts. And year after year, they’ve chosen not to act with the urgency required.
Instead, every session follows the same pattern: the Fair Share Maryland coalition brings forward a sensible package of revenue solutions that don’t put more responsibility on working families—closing loopholes, modernizing outdated tax structures, and asking ultra-wealthy corporations and individuals to pay their fair share. And every year, lawmakers nibble at the edges, doing just enough to keep the ship afloat for another year. That isn’t leadership. It’s procrastination.
And let’s be clear: the Blueprint isn’t the only pressure point in the budget. The Transportation Trust Fund has been structurally out of balance for years. Child care scholarships are frozen. Much-needed environmental investments have been cut. The developmental disabilities community must annually fight just to maintain underfunded services.
Delaying hard revenue decisions affects every corner of state government — yet education keeps taking the blame even when it isn’t the only driver. The truth is, Maryland doesn’t have a spending problem; it has a courage problem. We can support schools, transportation, and everything else in the budget — if we choose to.
If the governor and legislature want to meet their legal and moral obligations, it’s time to get serious about revenue. There are real, workable proposals on the table: Closing loopholes that let massive multistate corporations pay less than local small businesses, and strengthening enforcement to ensure the state actually collects money already owed. And we don’t have to guess whether these strategies work. Look at Massachusetts: its millionaire’s tax has generated more than $5 billion in just three years, funding state-supported health care and universal free school meals. Its public schools continue to rank #1 or #2 nationally—and far from driving wealthy residents away, the number of millionaires in Massachusetts actually grew.
Education is an investment, not a liability. A fully funded Blueprint strengthens Maryland’s workforce, attracts families and employers, and grows our tax base. Shortchanging schools today guarantees a weaker economy tomorrow.
We are only five years away from full Blueprint phase-in. Maryland’s children, families, and educators have held up their end of the bargain. Now it’s time for the Governor and legislature to hold up theirs—and finish what they started.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-523290806-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-12-08 21:56:30.886771

Campbell County legal case adds to the list of disputes challenging the public’s ability to access and go hunting on public land, access advocates say. 
The post A Wyoming man can legally reach his land, but a lawsuit contends he can’t stop to hunt public land along the way. appeared first on WyoFile .","A large landowner is suing his Wyoming neighbor in an effort to stop him from hunting thousands of acres of “landlocked” public land that he crosses to reach his cabin in the Powder River Basin. 
The lawsuit by Frank and Michael Maestri argues that Rozet resident Calvin Ten Braak has been violating the terms of a road easement leading to his property by hunting on public land along the approximately 10-mile-long route. The dispute came to light in June, when Ten Braak was sent a cease-and-desist letter from the Maestris, who had recently purchased thousands of acres of private land that Ten Braak’s easement also cuts through. 
“The purpose of the Easement is to allow access to the grantees’ property, not public property,” states the cease-and-desist letter, signed by Sheridan attorney Cole Gustafson. “The Easement shall solely be used for ingress and egress.”
“Simply put,” the letter goes on, “this Easement does not give you a right to cross private land as a thoroughfare to public land for hunting.” 
Calvin Ten Braak’s easement to his southeastern Campbell County Land is marked in dark gray on the lower left portion of this map. (Campbell County)
Ten Braak lawyered up. In July, Laramie attorney Alan Harding sent a letter back on Ten Braak’s behalf, arguing that the cease-and-desist letter and trespass notice were “baseless and in bad faith.” 
“The Easement does not confer upon your clients any authority to regulate or limit the use of public lands,” reads the retort. “Public lands are held in trust for the benefit of the public, and access to such lands cannot be curtailed by private parties absent statutory authority or ownership interest.”
The exchange precipitated a lawsuit, which was filed less than three weeks later. The case is still in the early stages. Harding filed a motion to dismiss in August and the plaintiffs responded in September. Then last week, Campbell County District Court Judge Mike McGrady held a hearing on the matter. A trial has been scheduled for December 2026.
Reached by WyoFile, Ten Braak declined an interview for this story under the guidance of his attorney, Harding, who also declined.
Frank Maestri, whose family owns Big Horn Spirits and a Mexican tequila distillery, returned WyoFile’s call and said he wanted to make a “short and simple” point.
“I just want to be clear: This is a private land case,” he said. “It has nothing to do with access to public land.”
A map of Ten Braak’s easement, which was recorded in November 2024, shows that his access road cuts through Maestri’s and both state-owned and Bureau of Land Management property. 
The otherwise inaccessible BLM parcel accessed via the easement totals more than 16,500 acres, according to the GPS mapping app OnX Hunt.

For the past seven years, Ten Braak has shared access to his easement with Hunting with Heroes, a Casper-based nonprofit that takes disabled veterans hunting, fishing and into the outdoors. 
Sundance resident Terry Wilkerson has guided the outings, taking combat veterans onto state and BLM land via Ten Braak’s road. 
“The first hunt we took out there, he was a 90-year-old Korean War vet,” Wilkerson told WyoFile on Monday. “Couldn’t hardly walk, but we were able to get him a nice bull. We had a 100% disabled Air Force vet that had terminal cancer of the brain, and he got a nice bull. So we’ve done a lot of great things for 100% disabled vets through the years.” 
Wilkerson has been paying attention to the legal proceedings. He was surprised that the lawsuit wasn’t immediately dismissed, and he worries about the precedent it’ll create if the judge rules in the Maestri family’s favor. 
“I would think it would be a no-brainer that the judge would say, ‘You can’t keep them from going on public land,’” Wilkerson said. “If this is upheld, I think it’s going to have a tremendous negative impact on access to a lot of public land.” 
The Campbell County dispute over easement-granted access to public land follows the high-profile years-long legal fight in Carbon County over “corner crossing,” which is stepping from one public parcel to the next where public land meets at the corner. Ultimately, the dispute, which became an international story, shook out in the public’s favor. 
This new dispute in northeast Wyoming is also starting to attract attention. It’s come across the radar of Laramie Democratic Rep. Karlee Provenza, who often advocates for state policies encouraging public access to public land.
“This is a demonstration of the lengths that someone will go to, to block access to public land,” Provenza said of the Campbell County dispute. “I’m grateful for Mr. Ten Braak standing up to this and saying no.”

(Photo by Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — CoreCivic gave up its fight to avoid following the city of Leavenworth’s development process and applied for a special use permit.
In a news release on its website, the city said Monday it received the application but did not say when it was filed.
“City Staff and the City’s legal team are currently reviewing the application and anticipate working with CoreCivic’s representatives on the public process,” the news release said.
Tentative public hearing dates are set for the planning commission, Feb. 2; first consideration by the Leavenworth City Commission, Feb. 24; and second consideration by the city commission, March 10. Hearings are broadcast on the city’s YouTube channel.
The city of Leavenworth and CoreCivic, a Tennessee-based private prison company, have been fighting in court since early this year over whether CoreCivic needed to follow the city’s special use permit process.
The company in September signed a contract with U.S. Immigration and Custums Enforcement valued at $60 million a year to house immigrant detainees at its Leavenworth facility, but the agreement doesn’t take effect until legal issues are resolved. A turning point in the court cases seemed to come when CoreCivic lost a legal battle last week in which it asked a judge to allow it to begin holding prisoners. At the time, a CoreCivic spokesman indicated the company was considering all paths to move forward, including bowing to the city’s demands that it follow the permit process.
Scott Peterson, Leavenworth city manager, said after the court loss that the city is willing to work on the special permitting process with CoreCivic. The company had been four months into the process when it decided to withdraw, he said.
“We’d had significant conversations, met with them multiple times,” Peterson said, adding that he and his assistant had toured the facility. “We were prepared to put together a packet for presentation to the planning commission, so we were ready to go.”
But CoreCivic decided not to continue the permit process and instead sought to reopen the facility without getting the permit.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/city-officials-attorneys-1024x703.jpg,,,2025-12-08 20:57:06.590425

BOSTON — A federal judge on Monday ruled in favor of Massachusetts and more than a dozen states that sued the Trump administration in May over President Donald Trump’s day-one offshore wind memo. The directive has frozen permitting since January, pending a comprehensive review by federal agencies.
The states argued the memo is unlawful and has caused significant harm – stymieing domestic investment, jeopardizing states’ abilities to supply enough electricity, and creating an “existential threat” to the industry.
Judge Patti B. Saris seemed to agree with their legal claims: “The State Plaintiffs have produced ample evidence demonstrating that they face ongoing or imminent injuries due to the Wind Order.”
On the flip side, she delivered sharp criticism of the federal government’s arguments and the wind memo itself, writing that it fails to adequately explain or support such a significant change in course from the agencies’ prior permitting practices.
“Whatever level of explanation is required when deviating from longstanding agency practice, this is not it,” Judge Saris wrote.
“The Court concludes that the Wind Order constitutes a final agency action that is arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law,” she wrote. “Accordingly, the Court allows Plaintiffs’ motions… denies the Agency Defendants’ motion…, and declares unlawful and vacates the Wind Order” in its entirety.
Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell in a statement Monday called the ruling a “critical victory.”
“Massachusetts has invested hundreds of millions of dollars into offshore wind, and today, we successfully protected those important investments from the Trump Administration’s unlawful order,” Campbell wrote.
During a hearing last month, the federal government provided no end date for this project-wide review prescribed by the memo, which is going on 11 months and counting while permitting remains paused.
“The Agency Defendants have represented that the Comprehensive Assessment is ‘underway’ but have provided no information about its timeline,” wrote Judge Saris in the 47-page ruling.
“Until full processing of applications related to wind energy projects resumes, no such project can move forward,” she continued. “Indeed, as was previously held in this litigation, the Wind Order amounts to a ‘de facto suspension of the law with respect to wind energy development.’”



The memo ordered the Interior Department to review the “ecological, economic, and environmental necessity of terminating or amending any existing wind energy … and submit a report with recommendations to the President.”
The federal government asked that if the judge were to rule in the states’ favor, that it be limited only for certain projects, not all projects. Judge Saris, however, wrote that a project-specific “vacatur” is not feasible due to the breadth of the wind memo.
A status conference has been set for next week for the parties to meet before Judge Saris.
It is unclear what relief such a ruling will bring to the wind projects and the states, who want to see the federal agencies issue pending permits to the projects.
The ruling does not order a particular outcome, such as the agencies issuing the permit approvals, Judge Saris notes. Rather, her order regards agencies processing permits and making a determination within a reasonable time, as required under statute.

“The Agency Defendants may not, as they have done here, decline to adjudicate applications altogether, for an unspecified time,” she wrote. “The proof is in the pudding: No permits have issued since the Wind Order was promulgated, and the Agency Defendants acknowledge that they will not issue any permits at least until they complete the Comprehensive Assessment, for which there is no timeline.”
Gov. Maura Healey in a statement said the commonwealth needs offshore wind to “meet demand, create jobs and lower costs,” and thanked the AG’s office for its work to “defend this crucial energy source, protecting jobs and economic activity across the country and here in Massachusetts.”
Erica Fuller, senior counsel at the Conservation Law Foundation, said the ruling is a “victory for offshore wind but also the rule of law.”
“This unlawful moratorium was meant to be a gift to polluting fossil fuel companies from the Trump administration,” Fuller said. “It’s unclear what the Trump administration will do with this ruling. It is appealable. And the impact of it on any particular project is also determined by many factors but could become more clear after the status conference.”
The Light contacted the Interior Department Monday night for comment.

The health benefit plan is designed to prevent financial ruin from catastrophic illness or injury, such as a car crash or bear attack.
The post Wyoming health department pitches ‘BearCare’ for medical emergencies. Lawmakers are skeptical. appeared first on WyoFile .","As Wyoming residents brace for the country’s highest jump in Obamacare insurance premium costs, the Wyoming Department of Health is proposing an alternative to prevent the kind of financial ruin that can result from catastrophic illness or injury. 
The proposal would establish a state-operated public benefit plan, dubbed “BearCare,” that would cover health care emergencies, such as a car crash or a bear attack, for dues-paying members. 
State lawmakers, however, expressed concern over costs, sustainability and even the name of the program as the Wyoming Legislature’s Joint Appropriations Committee met Monday in Cheyenne. 
“I don’t think we’re supposed to create programs that can’t be sustained,” Appropriations Committee Co-Chairman John Bear, R-Gillette, said at the meeting. 
Initially, the program would rely on federal funds currently up for grabs and earmarked to transform rural health care, but it would ultimately be self-funded via members’ monthly enrollment fees. Based on the Department of Health’s description, it would be somewhat akin to private catastrophic insurance plans, where people pay low premiums for high-deductible coverage that’s useful for major health emergencies, but doesn’t cover typical care.
“We have a very unique year this year, given the opportunity from the Trump administration and Congress with the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act and the Rural Health Transformation Program funding that’s currently in process,” Department of Health Director Stefan Johansson told lawmakers Monday. 
The federal program is designed to funnel $50 billion to state-designed programs meant to improve rural health care, and Wyoming stands to receive up to $800 million. The state submitted its application in November, which included BearCare in addition to plans to stabilize hospitals, bolster preventative health care, grow the workforce and use technology to improve access. The funding will be doled out over five years. 
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services expect to announce winners Dec. 31. In the meantime, the Department of Health is asking lawmakers to include a placeholder in the state budget bill.

“We don’t know what our ultimate award — if we get an award — from the federal government would be in that program,” Johansson said at the meeting. “So in full transparency, we wanted to bring that request for spending authority, should we be approved in that program and should the state want to accept those funds.” 
The BearCare portion of the application, however, gave several committee members heartburn. 
“I just don’t see how this is the proper role of government,” Rep. Ken Pendergraft, R-Sheridan, said, echoing the committee’s discussion last week regarding the Wyoming Business Council’s efforts to improve the state’s economy. 
This fall, the department surveyed residents and held 11 public meetings across the state to collect input for its federal application. 
“We did not hear back a wish list of all the expensive, short-term things that every community wanted,” Johansson told lawmakers. What the department heard instead included a desire for emergency services at critical access hospitals, regional access to OB-GYN and maternity care and “an ambulance that shows up relatively quick when you call 911.
“Those things that we heard, we really designed the application around,” he  said. 
Monday marked the second week of the committee’s budget hearings ahead of the 2026 legislative session. 
Ahead of budget hearings, the Wyoming Freedom Caucus — a group of Republicans who control the House — pledged to cut the budget, citing “pre-pandemic spending levels” as a general target. And over the legislative off-season, lawmakers took extra steps to scrutinize the Department of Health’s budget by forming a subcommittee. 
BearCare
While the name is a nod to “Wyoming’s deeply forested areas and bear population,” Johansson said, “it kind of hearkens back to what some people knew health insurance to be in previous decades.”
By offering small employers and individuals an affordable benefit plan that is closer in spirit to auto insurance — it covers collisions, but won’t pay for basic maintenance — the plan would provide the “bare necessities,” Johansson said. 
The lawmaker who shares his last name with the program did not back the effort, suggesting two alternatives, including a different name. 
“Without your objection, I’m going to call it ‘GordonCare,’” Rep. Bear said, presumably in reference to Gov. Mark Gordon, who lauded the proposal in his budget letter. 
BearCare is “an innovative, but basic, health benefit plan that offers individuals and small businesses a practical alternative to costly ObamaCare insurance,” Gordon wrote. 
Instead of a health benefit plan, Bear suggested the state consider tackling the problem “from the other side” by creating a “perpetuity fund” to help cover hospitals’ unpaid bills. 
But that likely wouldn’t work within the confines of the Rural Health Transformation Program, Johansson said. 
“In fact, a lot of the guidance from the federal government when it came specifically just to fixing or correcting balance sheets, [it] will likely not be allowable,” he said. 
Rep. Bill Allemand, R-Casper, said he was concerned the program would force the state into an income tax. Johansson was clear that wouldn’t be the case.
“Mr. Chairman, Rep. Allemand, my answer would be unequivocally no,” Johansson said. 
Sen. Mike Gierau, D-Jackson, was the one committee member to speak in favor of BearCare.
“I’m a small business person, so I’m kind of keen on this,” Gierau said. “What you’re trying to do isn’t trying to provide that big of a social [safety] net. You’re just trying to give a hand up to help small businesses [to] be able to handle a problem that I have to face every single day in my business.” 
Gierau also said he expected to see increased interest in such a program.
“If the increases in the ACA kick in the way they’re going to kick in,” he said, “I got a hunch you may hear some more clamoring, but that’s just a guess.” 
Roughly 45,000 Wyoming residents who get health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace are set to experience the highest price jumps in the nation, as WyoFile previously reported. In Wyoming, a 60-year-old person earning roughly $63,000 annually could face a 421% increase in average monthly premium costs on the ACA marketplace, according to reporting by KFF, a nonprofit that writes about health care.
Budget hearings will continue through this week before resuming Jan. 5. The committee is not expected to take any formal action on the budget bill until the week of Jan. 12.

(Photo by Will Price/West Virginia Legislative Photography)State lawmakers are entering the upcoming legislative session hoping to make improvements to West Virginia’s overwhelmed foster care system, announcing 16 bills so far to fix long-standing problems. One measure would put body cameras on Child Protective Services workers, and another bill would require some counties to use artificial intelligence to help CPS with high case loads.
Republican lawmakers also want to increase in-state facilities for foster children with the goal of bringing 543 foster children who are in out-of-state group homes back to West Virginia. 
West Virginia spent nearly $70 million last fiscal year to house foster children in out-of-state facilities, and some children kept in-state end up living in hotels. The state could funnel that money to in-state facilities.
“When it comes to foster care, time is always of the essence. We’re talking about kids that are not getting younger, and so every day of a child’s life means something,” said Del. Adam Burkhammer, R-Lewis, a foster parent who is spearheading child welfare legislation. “I am an impatient person that wants results now, but I understand government doesn’t move as fast as I would like, but I’m still going to push that we get results as soon as possible.”

Foster care reform was a major theme for lawmakers’ December interim meetings this week at the state Capitol. The part-time Legislature is grappling with how to make improvements to the struggling foster care system run by the executive branch. 
Many of lawmakers’ proposed foster care bills will take state funds and buy-in from the Department of Human Services, both of which could be an uphill battle. 
“We’re trying to build a collaborative approach, because it does truly take all three branches of government to make the child welfare system function well,” Burkhammer said. 
Sen. Vince Deeds, who is also sponsoring child welfare legislation, said the bills have followed conversations with constituents about problems in the child welfare system.
“We don’t want [the Department of] Human Services to think that we’re Big Brother, and we’re really going to beat them down all the time,” said Deeds, R-Greenbrier. “We want to support them and lift them up and try to help them in any way we possibly can.”
Tiffany Wilson, a foster parent in Parkersburg, hopes lawmakers will consider changes to help families caring for children who often need behavioral support and medical help. 
She has four foster children ages 1 to 7 and has adopted a 12 year old. One child needs out-of-state medical testing; another child attends a doctor’s appointment hours away from her home. 
“We need more support with that stuff and more understanding,” Wilson said. “We need to meet kids where they are and not causing more trauma.”
The stipend for foster families doesn’t go far with soaring grocery prices, she added.
Gov. Patrick Morrisey has announced his own plans to reform the long-troubled foster care system, saying he would end “years of bureaucratic stonewalling” that the system saw under Gov. Jim Justice and improve outcomes for kids. 
Earlier this year, Morrisey vetoed child welfare-related legislation, including a bill that would have provided pay raises for attorneys representing foster children. He also slashed lawmakers’ funding for a nonprofit that helps foster children. 
Del. Elliott Pritt, R-Fayette, said that he will vote no on tax cut legislation, spending bills and the state budget until lawmakers put forth a funding plan to address inadequacies in the child welfare system.
His announcement came after the Barboursville School, an in-patient children’s psychiatric facility, announced it will close.
“I think this just has to be our biggest priority,” said Pritt, who is a public school teacher. “Our funds are healthy, our [Rainy Day Fund] is healthy … Let’s do what we need to do for kids.”

Republicans unveil 16 foster care bills for 2026 legislative session
Last November, a trio of Republican lawmakers, including Burkhamer and Deeds, stood before their colleagues in the Senate Chamber and provided a grim look at the foster care system. There weren’t enough in-state homes, workers or programs to help 6,000 vulnerable children in state care.
“I think we’re exactly where we were last year, and the numbers would show that we’re still hovering around that 6,000 kids in care, so we’re not improving on that,” Burkhammer said. 
A report from a $348,000 foster care listening tour, spearheaded by DoHS, showed there was “more focus on blame than solving problems” in the state’s child welfare system.
At the Capitol this week, Republican lawmakers unveiled 16 bills after a child welfare work group spent the last year crafting ideas to improve foster care.
“[The kids] are victims of sometimes terrible circumstances,” Deeds said. “I think with some of the initiatives we have this year, they’ll be passed and become effective legislation.”
One bill would require CPS workers to wear a body camera while investigation reports of child abuse and neglect. The legislation, as written, would require CPS workers to obtain consent from the person being investigated in certain circumstances. The video footage could not be obtained through the Freedom of Information Act.
“We believe in building trust back in a system that has lost trust throughout our state, and we believe that this will be very transparent in what we do,” Burkhammer said. “We can see the success that law enforcement has and wearing their body cameras and the trust that was rebuilt in all the communities.”
Wilson, a former CPS worker, said a social worker hadn’t been to her home since four boys were placed there in September.
 “First of all, a CPS worker has to come into the home,” she said. 
Lawmakers also want to create a pilot program in two counties that would require the “use of mobile devices, including tablets, to assist CPS workers in conducting child abuse and neglect investigations in most cases. The technology price isn’t known at this time.
High caseloads continue to be a problem for CPS workers, lawmakers said.
Deeds, a former police officer, said AI has assisted law enforcement by reducing paperwork.
“The technology is there, and it’s proven,” he said. 
Other bills would: create a pay raise for public defenders working on child abuse and neglect cases; require that Bureau of Social Services’ rules about child welfare go through legislative review for approval; shortening the timeline that courts can consider terminating parental rights to prevent cases from lingering in the system.
Another measure would require DoHS to develop a statewide prevention plan and implement it with lawmaker oversight.
Bills will be more thoroughly discussed during the session, which begins Jan. 14, 2026.

(Photo by Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)North Arkansas’ Blanchard Springs Caverns is in the process of becoming Arkansas’ 53rd state park, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced Monday.
Sanders and Parks, Heritage and Tourism Secretary Shea Lewis signed a memorandum of understanding with the U.S. Forest Service to begin redesignating Arkansas’ second-largest cave system, which sits in the Ozark-St. Francis National Forest in Stone County.
The cave system includes eight and a half miles of explorable limestone caverns and access to a creek that flows into the White River. It has been open to the public since 1973, and Sanders said at Monday’s news conference that more than 70,000 people visit the caves per year.
Sanders said Blanchard Springs Caverns “will elevate the best state parks in America” and “can rival Carlsbad Caverns or Mammoth Cave,” national parks in New Mexico and Kentucky, respectively.
In 1996, Arkansas voters approved a constitutional amendment that increased the state sales tax by one-eighth of one cent to fund land conservation. Sanders noted that this occurred during the administration of her father, former Gov. Mike Huckabee.
Reinvesting this revenue in parks like Blanchard Springs Caverns bolsters Arkansas’ multibillion-dollar tourism industry, Sanders said.
Her husband, First Gentleman Bryan Sanders, chairs the Natural State Initiative, which the governor launched shortly after taking office in 2023 in an effort to expand Arkansas’ outdoor economy.
“Arkansas’ natural beauty is one of our greatest competitive advantages, and places like Blanchard Springs shows why,” Bryan Sanders said in a Monday news release from the governor’s office. “Designating it as a state park will not only protect this incredible place but also open the door to more adventure, exploration, and the kind of outdoor experiences that support families and local communities.”

The redesignation of Blanchard Springs Caverns “is what the Natural State Initiative looks like in action” and hopefully “will make Arkansas a place people want to return to again and again,” Lewis said at the news conference.
Deputy Regional Forester Mary Moore of the U.S. Forest Service praised the agency’s “positive, collaborative” relationship with the state’s parks department.
“The partnership we have is reliable and trustworthy, and our agencies share common goals for the mutual benefit of residents and visitors alike,” Moore said.
Sanders and state Sen. Missy Irvin, a Republican representing Stone County, credited President Donald Trump and U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins with facilitating the process of redesignating Blanchard Springs Caverns.
Sanders thanked leaders of the Caddo, Osage and Quapaw nations of Indigenous communities for being “very helpful in this process.”
The Osage Nation considers Blanchard Springs Caverns a sacred location, and the park’s annual Christmas caroling in the caverns went on hiatus in 2019 due to the tribe’s disapproval.
The event resumed in 2023 after state officials and Osage leaders compromised to allow caroling in an aboveground auditorium instead of the underground Cathedral Room, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Blanchard-Springs-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-08 19:57:40.173667

(Pool photo by Francisco Kjolseth/The Salt Lake Tribune) The Utah judge who has caught the ire of many Utah Republican lawmakers for her repeated rulings against them in the state’s yearslong redistricting legal battle issued a legal analysis Friday explaining why she has denied lawmakers’ request to push pause on the state’s new court-ordered congressional map. 
In her 11-page decision, 3rd District Judge Dianna Gibson wrote she rejected the Utah Legislature’s preferred map C because it not only failed to adhere to neutral map-drawing criteria under Proposition 4 (a 2018 voter-approved ballot initiative that created an independent redistricting process) to the greatest extent practicable, but also because it was drawn with political data — which is also a violation of Proposition 4. 
In redistricting fight, Utah Republican lawmakers will appeal to Utah Supreme Court

“The undisputed evidence presented in this case showed that the Legislative Defendants’ own expert, Dr. Sean Trende, exclusively used (Dave’s Redistricting Application) when he was drawing Map C and that partisan data was displayed on the screen during the map-drawing process,” Gibson wrote. 
“Even by the Legislature’s own professed standards and course of conduct Map C should have been rejected by the Legislative Redistricting Committee because Dr. Trende used DRA to create it,” she continued, adding that “none of these facts were disputed during the evidentiary hearings” and that the Legislature’s attorneys “failed to show that the Court clearly erred in making these findings.” 
Ultimately, Gibson found the Legislature’s map C — which would have created four safe Republican districts — was an “extreme partisan gerrymander” that violated Proposition 4 by “both unduly and purposefully favoring” the Republican party “at the expense of minority voters,” Democrats. 
“The Legislative Defendants fail to address, let alone show, that the Court erred in making these findings,” she wrote. 
Gibson also wrote that the Legislature’s requests — both for a stay on the new congressional map and requests for Gibson to reconsider all of her previous rulings — were “procedurally improper.”

“They argue this relief is justified because the Court’s previous rulings are unconstitutional, they have effectively been denied the opportunity to appeal, and the Court has no authority over the remedial process,” she wrote, but she rejected those arguments for multiple reasons. 
Among them was that when the Legislature failed to enact a map that complied with Proposition 4, Gibson “was required to consider the only other maps submitted to the court — those submitted by the plaintiffs — and determine if they comply with Proposition 4.” 
The judge ultimately decided that the plaintiffs’ Map 1, which creates a Democratic-leaning district in the northern part of Salt Lake County, best complied with Proposition 4’s criteria. 
Court’s authority to pick a map ‘rooted firmly in the law’
Gibson wrote that the court’s “authority to adopt a lawful congressional map — where the Legislature’s Map C fails to comply with Proposition 4 — is rooted firmly in the law.” 
After previously agreeing to participate in the court-ordered process, the Legislature “cannot now assert that the Court lacked authority to preside over the remedial proceedings.” 
“Now, for the first time and despite the plain language of the stipulation that contemplates this exact possibility, the Legislative Defendants contend that this Court only had the authority to enjoin Map C, but not to adopt a remedial,” Gibson wrote. 
Redistricting ruling: Utah judge picks plaintiffs’ congressional map, blocks Legislature’s

The judge asserted that the court-ordered congressional map “does not exceed the ordinary bounds of judicial review and does not violate separation of powers,” as lawmakers have repeatedly argued. 
She pointed to the previous U.S. Supreme Court rulings and proceedings in other states like Florida that have selected and affirmed remedial maps proposed by plaintiffs after the state legislature’s maps were found to violate the state’s ban on partisan favoritism. 
“While a state court’s role in redistricting is new to Utah, this judicial function is neither new nor novel,” Gibson wrote. “It is well settled that when the political branches fail to enact lawful electoral maps, the judiciary’s duty to provide an effective remedy is not discretionary.”
Instead, Gibson wrote the courts “have a fundamental obligation to uphold constitutional rights and to ensure a lawful electoral map is in place, including by adopting one proposed by a party in the proceedings.” 
“This authority is firmly rooted in both federal and state court precedent,” she wrote. “Without the court’s remedial power, the right to vote could be rendered illusory and the constitutional guarantee of free and lawful elections would go unfulfilled.”
Allegations that timing was intentional are ‘unfounded,’ judge says
In her analysis, Gibson also addressed lawmakers’ public criticisms of her handling of the case — including allegations that the timing of her ruling (which came at 11:41 p.m. on the last possible day state elections officials had set to choose a new congressional map, Nov. 10) was intentional to undermine lawmakers’ ability to appeal. 
“Any suggestion that this Court delayed issuing any ruling to force compliance with the remedial process or to preclude an appeal is unfounded,” Gibson wrote. 
Utah Legislature’s special session will tackle redistricting, repeal public union bill

She added that a “simple review” of the court docket and past hearings shows she “invited discussion” and input from all of the parties involved in the lawsuit to set the court-ordered redistricting process’ schedule — which legislative attorneys agreed to.
“While no Utah court has engaged in a remedial process related to redistricting, both counsel indicated that they have litigated against each other in other states and are familiar with these types of remedial procedure,” Gibson wrote. “As a result, the Court requested the Lieutenant Governor’s office set the deadline and respectfully requested as much time as possible for the parties and the Court.”
Gibson also noted that she extended deadlines for the lawsuit’s parties “at every opportunity,” including requests for additional time made by the Legislature’s attorneys. She noted the complex case was complicated further by lawmakers’ attempts to enact a new law, HB1011 (which she ultimately blocked) that would have required Utah’s new congressional map to pass a set of prescriptive statistical tests that plaintiffs successfully argued would have resulted in a map that favored Republicans. 
Ultimately, Gibson was left with only six days to finalize what turned out to be an 89-page ruling on a complex case. 
“This Court did not intentionally delay any decision to foreclose the Legislative Defendants’ appeal rights or force them to participate in the remedial process,” she wrote. “Any such assertion is simply not supported by the record in this case.”

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)Washington state Sen. Rebecca Saldaña said Monday she would run for an open seat on the King County Council and forgo reelection to the state Senate. 
“This will be my last legislative session as a State Senator,” Saldaña said in a text message Monday afternoon.
Rep. Chipalo Street, D-Seattle, will run to replace her in the 37th Legislative District. He said running “would be very interesting.”
“Now that she’s made it official, I’m happy to make it official,” he said Monday. “I have the session to worry about, but I will take the steps to declare and file before the session even happens.”
The 37th District covers south Seattle neighborhoods like Beacon Hill, the Central District, Rainier Valley, Columbia City and the city of Renton. 
Saldaña is aiming to replace newly elected King County Executive Girmay Zahilay on the County Council. Zahilay has chosen three options to replace him on the council until voters weigh in on a permanent successor next year. The council is expected to choose the temporary seatholder Tuesday.
Saldaña, who chairs the Labor and Commerce Committee, has been a leading voice in the Legislature on worker and immigrant rights. She joined the Legislature in 2016, upon appointment by the King County Council when then-state Sen. Pramila Jayapal won election to Congress.
Before that, she was executive director of Puget Sound Sage, an advocacy organization focused on racial justice, the climate and the economy.
Saldaña previously ran to be the state’s commissioner of public lands, but dropped out before a packed Democratic primary amid a cancer diagnosis and fundraising woes. During that run, Street and his seatmate, Rep. Sharon Tomiko Santos, D-Seattle, discussed who might run to replace Saldaña if she won. They agreed it should be Street, he said.
Street, a Microsoft program manager who joined the Legislature in 2023, has focused on changing the state’s regressive tax structure while in Olympia. 
This year, for example, he led a House effort on the controversial “wealth tax.” His bill made no progress, but another version passed the Senate in a largely symbolic move on the final day of this year’s session. The proposal, which targets taxpayers holding sizable amounts of assets like stocks and bonds, is expected to be a hot topic again in 2026 with another budget shortfall to grapple with.
Saldaña is the second Democratic senator to announce she won’t run for reelection in as many as weeks. Sen. Sharon Shewmake, D-Bellingham, said last week she will serve through her term, but won’t run next year to retain her seat. 
Both Democratic representatives from Shewmake’s district have said they’re not interested in running for the upper chamber. A local Democratic port commissioner announced his run Monday.

(Photo by Laura Guido/Idaho Capital Sun) An influential conservative think tank is urging the Idaho Legislature to cut Medicaid expansion, public school funding and other programs to balance the state budget. 
Idaho is projected to face a between a $600 million and $1 billion budget deficit in fiscal year 2027, which begins July 1. It is already facing a roughly $58 million deficit in the current fiscal year. 
Idaho may need to find $600 million to $1 billion for next year’s state budget

Leaders from the Idaho Freedom Foundation — a nonprofit organization that scores legislators based on their votes and frequently lobbies on bills — said Monday at a press conference at the Capitol building in Boise the state’s problems were “self-inflicted.” 
“Idaho does not have a budget problem,” Idaho Freedom Foundation President Ron Nate said. “We have a budgeting problem.” 
The organization, known as IFF, called for nearly $1.9 billion in cuts to the state budget next year, including state general funds, dedicated funds and federal money. 
Nate emphasized that the problem wasn’t from the several income tax cuts or rebates approved in the last five years, which the Idaho Fiscal Policy Center estimated to have reduced revenue by a total of $4 billion dollars.
The speakers Monday blamed the deficit on increased spending amid the influx of federal pandemic relief funds since 2020. In 2022, the state ended the fiscal year with a record $1.4 billion surplus. 
Fred Birnbaum, IFF senior policy fellow, said revenue has continued to grow despite the tax cuts. He said the state could support more cuts if it constrained its spending. 
 Cutting Medicaid expansion central to IFF’s budget proposal 

The biggest cut proposed would be to eliminate Idaho’s Medicaid expansion program. Idaho voters in 2018 approved a ballot initiative to expand Medicaid eligibility to adults who earned too much to qualify for traditional Medicaid but not enough for premium credits to afford private coverage through the state health insurance marketplace. 
The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare in fiscal year 2026 had requested around $1.3 billion from all funding sources to fund the program; the services are 90% covered by the federal government and the state covers the remaining 10%. 
As of October, which is three months into the fiscal year, the program had spent around $339 million from all funds, which was around 4% less than was budgeted for, according to the agency’s most recent Medicaid budget report. 
There have been multiple efforts in the Legislature to repeal the program, which covered about 85,000 Idahoans as of Nov. 14. Those who support its repeal said the program is too expensive. Many of those who opposed repeal have said that uninsured people delaying care and ending up in emergency rooms would result in even higher costs. Previous funds to cover indigent care were eliminated upon approval of Medicaid expansion. 
The group also called for an additional $100.5 million in cuts to Idaho Health and Welfare, or a 15% cut from the agency’s prior year budget.

 Group calls for $166 million cut in Idaho public school spending

Gov. Brad Little in September called for state agencies nearly across the board to permanently cut their budgets by 3%, but he exempted K-12 public schools. 
IFF leaders on Monday said that the K-12 budget should be held to the same cutbacks, and proposed a $166.5 million cut to the state’s public school support budget. 
“If we’re really in a fiscal deficit, we should be cutting back across all agencies and programs,” said Brett Farruggia, IFF policy analyst. “There should be no exemptions from any agency or program, especially unmerited ones.” 
The group also asked for the repeal of Idaho Launch, a $75 million grant program for graduating high school seniors to use toward university and college tuition or work training and apprenticeships in in-demand fields. 
The IFF leaders did not recommend cutting the $50 million private school choice tax credit, which allows state money to go to parents for private education, including private school tuition. 
The group asked for various other cuts to agencies, targeting especially ones that have grown more quickly. 
A handful of legislators attended Monday’s press conference. Ultimately, lawmakers and the state budget writers on the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee will decide how to balance the budget for next year. The legislative session will begin Jan. 12.

Michelle Lujan Grisham asking her to include public safety matters on the upcoming legislative session’s agenda.,"Bernalillo County Sheriff John Allen speaks before the New Mexico GOP-led Public Safety Legislative Task Force on Dec. 1, 2025. (Courtesy of Public Safety Legislative Task Force)Republicans in the New Mexico Legislature on Monday sent a letter to Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham asking her to include public safety matters on the upcoming legislative session’s agenda.
The 30-day session scheduled for January is for lawmakers to propose and vote on fiscal matters. If lawmakers want to file bills unrelated to the budget, the matter must be on the governor’s legislative agenda, known as a “call,” for the session.
“Over the past several years, your administration has taken steps to support law enforcement, strengthen behavioral-health resources, and address some of the complex drivers of crime. Unfortunately, the progressive-controlled Legislature has failed to advance substantial, commonsense solutions to New Mexico’s crime epidemic,” the letter, signed by Rep. Andrea Reeb (R-Clovis) and Sen. Crystal Brantley (R-Elephant Butte), said.
Jodi McGinnis Porter, a spokesperson for the governor, told Source NM that Lujan Grisham is out of town and has not yet reviewed the letter. But, public safety will be on the call for the 2026 legislative session, she said.
“The governor has consistently prioritized this issue, as demonstrated by her recent declarations of emergencies in Albuquerque and Española and her previous declarations addressing gun violence and the drug crisis,” she wrote in an email to Source. “She welcomes collaboration with legislators from both parties who share her commitment to keeping New Mexicans safe.”
The Republicans’ request comes one week after the governor’s senior public safety adviser attended an event for the New Mexico GOP-led Public Safety Legislative Task Force, at which he told lawmakers that a New Mexican child or teenager is arrested while possessing a firearm three out of four days. 
The task force subsequently issued on Monday a 35-page report titled “A State in Crisis: Confronting New Mexico’s Crime Epidemic and Restoring Public Safety,” which lays out several legislative priorities Republicans hope to pursue in the upcoming session.
The report contains proposals to:

Expand the definition of “fentanyl” in state law to include “fentanyl-related substances”
Establish a “clear and convincing” burden of proof for a judge to decrease a criminal sentence
Create a minimum period of incarceration for people facing a second, or subsequent, felony conviction
Create a minimum period of incarceration for drug trafficking that results in death
Allow prosecuting attorneys to seek enhancements to criminal sentences for prior felony convictions beyond the current 10-year window allowed under state law
Increase penalties for distributing Schedule 1 or 2 narcotics or methamphetamine to children
Increase penalties for a felon in possession of a firearm
Create statutory requirements for the New Mexico All Source Intelligence Center, including requirements to provide threat management and community engagement resources across the state
Shift burden to the defendant, rather than prosecutors, on issues of bail reform and release from jail
Create a constitution provision to return property taxes paid by someone whose property was damaged “by a county or municipality’s failure to enforce their nuisance ordinances”

Likewise, two Democrat lawmakers recently said they’d ask the governor to include public safety matters on the upcoming session’s agenda. Rep. Andrea Romero (D-Santa Fe) and Sen. Heather Berghmans (D-Albuquerque) last week announced their plans to propose legislation that would require intensive training for firearms dealers across the state.
Lujan Grisham has focused intensely on public safety in recent years. In 2023, she called on lawmakers to pass a ban on assault rifles and in 2024 she called firearm legislation “the most important work” before New Mexico’s elected leaders. 
She called a special legislative session last year to address “urgent public safety issues.” At the time, she requested legislative proposals on criminal competency, crime reporting, gun violence, drug overdoses and more. The special session adjourned after a matter of hours without any such bills.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/KEC5800-Edit-copy-2-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-12-08 18:58:55.166539

(Jordan Hansen / Daily Montanan)In an effort to reduce delays associated with road construction, the Montana Department of Transportation is taking public comment on new rules for utility companies that need to relocate pipes, lines and cables to make room for state projects.
The proposed rules follow the passage of House Bill 672, brought by Rep. Courtenay Sprunger, a Kalispell Republican, this past Legislative session. Contractors, the Department of Transportation and utility companies worked together on language for the legislation.
Utility relocation during road projects can be slow, and the new rules seek to set clear expectations for companies.
“The proposed rule sets consistent standards for notifying facility owners, firm deadlines for relocation, clear guidelines for handling delays or noncompliance, and explains penalties when moves aren’t completed on time,” the proposed rules say.
Sprunger said the process for the bill was how legislation should work and complimented the process. The legislation passed through both chambers with no votes against and was signed by Gov. Greg Gianforte days after the 2025 session ended. 
“To have these folks, sit down around the table and instead of pointing fingers, say, ‘This is my part, and here’s how I think we can collaborate to make this better,’ that’s how we got to the final product … that’s powerful,” Sprunger said in an interview on Monday.
It’s been a long running issue — decades, Sprunger said — and includes multiple, sometimes cascading problems.
Sprunger said there was a project that sat for six weeks in the middle of the summer and used it to illustrate the issue the legislation and proposed rules are trying to solve.
The contractor for the project doesn’t know when the utility company is going to make the move, and the people on the road work can’t really be moved. In this way, it’s a labor issue too, Sprunger explained, as those same workers will be needed at the site when the utility company completes its work. 
These delays cause risk for contractors, she said, making things more expensive and can also push projects into the next construction season. Montana’s weather plays a part too, as precipitation and cold also can be a factor.
“It ultimately solves the time is money problem,” Sprunger said. “From a practical standpoint, the longer it goes, the more it costs. You’re talking about more risk for a contractor if it’s unpredictable when the utilities are able to get in there and move their utilities, which has to happen before that roadway can be reconstructed or redesigned.”
The state reimburses utility companies 75% of the cost for them to relocate when they’re impacted by a state transportation project, MDT’s chief engineer, Dustin Rouse, said in an interview last week.
“This bill puts a little more pressure on the utilities to complete those relocations in a timely manner, so we don’t have contractors out there waiting trying to get utilities moved, and the public is inconvenienced,” Rouse said.
Importantly, though, he added, the bill and proposed rules are also guidelines for how MDT will operate, too.
“It also holds MDT accountable to making sure that we give early notification to the utilities,” Rouse said.
The proposed rules say a written notice for relocation will be issued that allows a “reasonable amount” of time for relocation, which the rules say will be no less than 90 days. That’s “in addition to the 90 days following the preliminary notice” the proposed rules say.
There is a penalty for not cooperating and a rule allowing for utility companies to get an extension to complete the move if something goes wrong.
A hearing for the proposed rule is set for 10 a.m,. Friday, and public comment is being taken until 5 p.m., Dec. 19.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/RoadClosedStock-1024x678.jpg,,,2025-12-08 18:58:55.166539

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)A federal magistrate judge in Colorado on Monday dismissed former Mesa County clerk Tina Peters’ petition for a writ of habeas corpus, one of several long-shot legal maneuvers Peters’ attorneys and allies in the election-denial movement have sought to use to secure her release from state prison.
Peters is serving a nine-year sentence for her role in a breach of her office’s election systems, part of an attempt to find evidence of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election. She has appealed her August 2024 conviction in state court, arguing that her imprisonment violates her First Amendment right of free speech, and separately filed a habeas corpus petition in federal court, seeking her release on bond while the state appeal is pending.
Scott T. Varholak, chief magistrate judge of the U.S. District Court of Colorado, wrote in a 12-page order that Peters had raised “important constitutional questions concerning whether the trial court improperly punished her more severely because of her protected First Amendment speech.” But in dismissing her petition, he sided with arguments made in the federal case by the Colorado attorney general’s office, which cited longstanding precedent against “federal court interference with state court proceedings.”

“Because Ms. Peters’ appeal remains pending in state court, where she argues that the trial court violated her First Amendment rights by punishing her based upon her speech, any First Amendment error can be corrected through the state appeal,” Varholak wrote.
“Because this question remains pending before Colorado courts, this Court must abstain from answering that question until after the Colorado courts have decided the issue,” he added.
Peters’ petition was dismissed without prejudice, meaning it could be filed again at a later date.
President Donald Trump, senior officials in his administration and a host of far-right media figures have stepped up their campaign for Peters’ release in recent weeks. In a series of filings in the habeas corpus case, Peters’ attorneys have stated that she is in “declining health” and alleged that she had been temporarily placed in solitary confinement after objecting to a corrections officer’s treatment of her.
On Nov. 12, at the urging of Office of Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, the Federal Bureau of Prisons sent a letter to the Colorado Department of Corrections requests Peters’ transfer “for the purpose of serving a state-imposed sentence within a federal correctional institution.” The DOC and Gov. Jared Polis have affirmed that they are not seeking such a transfer.
Trump does not have the power to pardon Peters, who was convicted on state charges. Despite this, her attorney, Peter Ticktin, said last week that he has submitted an application for a presidential pardon of Peters, arguing in a subsequent letter that the president “has the power to grant a pardon in any of the states of the United States.” Such an outcome would violate centuries of legal consensus and the longstanding dual-sovereignty doctrine that the U.S. Supreme Court upheld in criminal matters as recently as 2019.
In an appearance on longtime Trump ally Steve Bannon’s podcast last month, Ticktin also said he thinks the Trump administration should use the U.S. military to free Peters from the Colorado prison by force.
Trump himself has repeatedly called on Polis to “free” Peters, most recently in a Dec. 3 social media post in which Trump wrote that the governor “refuses to allow an elderly woman, Tina Peters, who was unfairly convicted of what the Democrats do, cheating on Elections, out of jail!” In August, he threatened “harsh measures” if Peters wasn’t released.
Claims that the 2020 election was fraudulent or compromised have been debunked by elections officials, experts, media investigations, law enforcement, the courts and Trump’s own campaign and administration officials.

Critics say it would lower standards.,"Supporters say the bill would eliminate just one of many tests students take to gauge their proficiency. Critics say the move would lower standards. (Photo by Alexander Castro)High school juniors could see a test required for graduation eliminated under a bill approved by the Assembly Monday.
The bill to eliminate the test, which is called the New Jersey Graduation Proficiency Assessment, passed 55-17. Supporters called the exam just one of many tests high schoolers are forced to take before graduation, while several Republicans said the measure would lower educational standards. 
“Do not hand out a diploma disconnected from proficiency. I think it’s a huge error,” said Assemblywoman Dawn Fantasia (R-Sussex). “Students in New Jersey can do it — our policy cannot reflect that they can’t.”
NJ bill that would mandate school mergers gets mixed reception

Fantasia said students who are about to enter the workforce or pursue higher education should be held to a high standard, and she claimed employers are already seeing a decline in the readiness of entry-level employees.
“If anything, we’re going to widen the gap between the diploma we hand them and their actual preparedness,” she said.
Assemblywoman Aura Dunn (R-Morris) said she understands the argument that a single test is not the perfect tool to determine whether a student is ready to graduate. But Dunn said eliminating it without a replacement only solves half of the problem.
“If we are serious about improving outcomes, then we must be serious about accountability. We cannot fix what we refuse to measure,” she said.
Gov. Phil Murphy in 2022 signed a law waiving the test requirement in the 2022-2023 school year, and lawmakers have subsequently tried to make that permanent.
Bill sponsor Assemblywoman Michele Matsikoudis (R-Union) said the data collected from the test doesn’t meaningfully reflect students’ learning, and she noted that other states have moved away from requiring students to pass a standardized test to graduate.
“New Jersey already gathers extensive student performance data through a multitude of other, more informative assessments and graduation standards,” she said. “This exam adds very little insight.”
Assemblywoman Rosy Bagolie (D-Essex) said her son, who sat next to her during Monday’s voting session, failed the math portion of the exam, graduated high school after passing the PSATs, and then finished his first semester of college with a 4.0 grade point average.
“Exit exams do not measure readiness for college, careers, or life. They measure testing under pressure,” said Bagolie, the superintendent of East Newark’s school district. “These exams disproportionately harm students with disabilities, multi-lingual learners, students from low-income families, many of whom have met every graduation requirement only to be blocked by one single exam.”
A companion bill was introduced in the Senate in January 2024, but it has yet to be scheduled for a hearing before the chamber’s education committee. The Legislature has until Jan. 13 to pass any bills under consideration before a new session begins.

Free.,Trump to send $12 billion in one-time payments to farmers to offset ag losses,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-send-12-billion-one-time-payments-farmers-offset-ag-losses,,"The federal government will provide $12 billion to U.S. farmers who have been hurt by “unfair market disruption,” President Donald Trump said at a White House roundtable event Monday.Trump said repeatedly the funding was available thanks to tariff revenues, framing his aggressive trade policy as a boon to farmers rather than a drag on their global market share as critics of the policy suggest. “I'm delighted to announce this afternoon that the United States will be taking a small portion of the hundreds of billions of dollars we receive in tariffs…  and we're going to be giving and providing it to the farmers in economic assistance,” Trump said.U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, though, told reporters following the event that the money came from the department’s Commodity Credit Corporation, which is funded through regular appropriations from Congress, according to a White House pool report.The money, which the administration officials described as “bridge payments,” would be in farmers’ hands by the end of February, Rollins said. While not officially marketed as a part of a series of Trump events spotlighting affordability issues, the president said several times he was addressing an affordability crisis he “inherited” from President Joe Biden, a Democrat.“The Democrats cause the affordability problem,” Trump said. “And we're the ones that are fixing it.” The bulk of the funding, $11 billion, would go to row crop farmers who grow barley, chickpeas, corn, cotton, lentils, oats, peanuts, peas, rice, sorghum, soybeans, wheat, canola, crambe, flax, mustard, rapeseed, safflower, sesame and sunflower, according to a USDA statement. The department was planning to reserve $1 billion for unnamed specialty crops, Rollins said.Payments to arrive before GOP law kicks inTrump, Rollins and other Cabinet-level officials said the payments were to be used as a “bridge” before policies enacted in Republicans’ massive spending and tax cuts law this year are implemented.“This bridge is absolutely necessary based on where we are right now,” Rollins said.They blamed the Biden administration for a more negative outlook for farmers. Biden failed to close trade deals and a focus on environmental policy led to increased costs for the agriculture industry, they said.The package limits payments to $155,000 per recipient, USDA Undersecretary for Farm Production and Conservation Richard Fordyce told reporters on a conference call late Monday afternoon.Iowa farmer Cordt Holub spoke at the White House event, where he thanked Trump for the package.“I want to say thank you for this bridge payment,” he said. “It's Christmas early for farmers.”Louisiana rice farmer Meryl Kennedy said the industry was struggling, but thanked Trump for the aid funding and changes to reference prices in the Republican megabill. “Our farmers can feed this nation and many nations abroad, but we need fair trade, not free trade,” she said. Tariff impact ignoredBut they did not mention the effects of tariffs, which critics of the president have said are responsible for diminishing agricultural exports and hurting farmers’ bottom lines.House Agriculture Committee ranking Democrat Angie Craig of Minnesota said in a statement the package “picks winners and losers in the farm economy,” and would not provide certainty to farmers or reduce high operational costs.“It will not bring U.S. agricultural exports back to pre-trade war levels,” she said. “It also ignores (the) fact that the president’s tariffs are responsible for the immense financial strain felt not just by America’s farmers, but also working people, manufacturers, retailers and small businesses. All Americans are tired of the affordability crisis created by this administration and congressional Republicans. We will be right back here a year from now unless the administration changes its policies.”Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, also slammed the program.“The reason farmers need relief at all is largely because Donald Trump betrayed them and decimated their businesses with his disastrous tariffs,” Schumer said in a floor speech Monday. “Now, Donald Trump is patting himself on the back, acting like a hero to farmers while using taxpayer dollars to clean up the mess he created. It’s textbook Donald Trump incompetence.”Another round?Asked by a reporter during the roundtable if he would be open to another round of relief for farmers, Trump said it would depend on how international trade develops and said farmers would not want further aid.“It depends on where we go,” he said. “China is buying a lot. Other countries are buying a lot. And you know, the interesting thing about the farmers, they don't want aid. They want to just have a level playing field.”He later indicated it would be unnecessary.“We're going to make the farmers so strong — and I'm not even talking about financially, because they just want to be able to produce what they can produce,” he said. “We're going to make them so strong that it will be, indeed, a golden age for farmers.”Rollins told reporters following the event that Trump was “open to more.”",,,,2025-12-08 18:58:55.166539

(Photo by Nadia Engenheiro, Half Street Group) An hour before a scheduled court hearing on two federal lawsuits over recent changes to a key federal homelessness and housing funding program, the Trump administration withdrew the funding notice that prompted the litigation.
The move came as a surprise to the attorneys for plaintiffs who were initially scheduled to make their case for a temporary restraining order before Rhode Island Judge Mary S. McElroy. 
“It feels like intentional chaos,” McElroy said.
In a message to Continuum of Care networks, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced Monday afternoon that officials rescinded its Nov. 13 Notice of Funding Opportunity for federal fiscal 2025 grants to “make appropriate revisions.” The notice had set Jan. 14 as the deadline for applications for Continuum of Care funds, which address homelessness.
Rhode Island’s Continuum of Care gave the state’s homeless care a deadline of Dec. 12 to get their applications done to give to HUD, according to one of the lawsuits.
“We received notice first through our providers and [electronic filing], not through opposing counsel,” Zane Muller, assistant attorney general for the state of Washington, said during the 25-minute virtual hearing that began at 3:30 p.m.
HUD’s policy rescission too was news for McElroy, who called it a “haphazard approach to administrative law.” 
“There’s a process and procedure that’s laid out,” said McElroy, a first-term Trump appointee. “It’s not by tweets or by last-minute orders or last-minute withdrawals.”
Pardis Gheibi, a U.S. Department of Justice attorney representing HUD, told McElroy the notice was filed with the court as soon as it was published. She did not have the answer when McElroy wanted to know who at HUD made the decision to rescind the funding notice and when.
“We didn’t have the chance to confer with plaintiffs’ counsel — but the rescission happened this afternoon,” Gheibi said.
The Trump administration had planned to slash the amount of grant funds that can be spent on permanent housing — subsidized units that provide a stable residence for formerly homeless people, often those who have experienced mental illness or spent years on the streets — and instead focus on transitional housing.










There’s a process and procedure that’s laid out. It’s not by tweets or by last-minute orders or last-minute withdrawals.


– Rhode Island U.S. District Court Judge Mary S. McElroy


Grant rules also would have eliminated funding for diversity and inclusion efforts, support of transgender clients and use of “harm reduction” strategies that seek to reduce overdose deaths by helping people in active addiction use drugs more safely.
HUD wrote in its update that it still intends to make changes to the policy for awarding funds for addressing homelessness.
A coalition of states co-led by Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha filed suit over HUD’s latest Notice of Funding Opportunity on Nov. 25. On Dec. 1, a group of cities and nonprofits led by the National Alliance to End Homelessness and the National Low Income Housing Coalition filed a separate 85-page lawsuit.
Both complaints had similar requests for the court to declare the new conditions unlawful and reinstate language from prior funding notices, which is why McElroy opted to combine them into one hearing.
But with the funding notice now withdrawn, Gheibi argued there was no need for immediate relief.
Kristin Bateman, an attorney representing local communities and nonprofits and a senior counsel with Democracy Forward, argued court action is still needed. She said HUD’s rescission still leaves a critical funding gap for homeless services starting early next year since most federal fiscal 2024 grants start to expire in January.
“Those gaps in funding mean that they will not have the money to continue supporting the permanent housing that they fund for people to live in,” Bateman said. “People are going to be displaced, put back into homelessness in the middle of winter and face all the harms that come with that.”
McElroy scheduled the next hearing for 10 a.m. Friday, Dec. 19. She also tasked HUD with producing the administrative record on the grant funding policy, ideally within a week — though Gheibi had asked if it could wait until after the holidays.
McElroy said if the administration could work quickly to rescind the funding notice, they can work quickly to give the court the documents she requested.
“People can work overtime if they need to,” McElroy said. “I do, they do, I’m sure you do.”

(Photo by Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas Department of Human Services needs to reduce its rate of erroneous nutrition benefit payments in order to minimize the cost of the program in the coming years, DHS officials and state lawmakers agreed Monday.
The federal One Big, Beautiful Bill Act extended a series of tax cuts by reducing several benefit programs, including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). States will have to share some of the cost of the program for the first time in the program’s 86-year history, and each state’s share will depend on how often it overpays or underpays SNAP benefits.
The law incentivizes states to keep their error rates below 6% in order for the federal government to continue to pay 100% of the cost of SNAP benefits. States with error rates above 6% will pay at least 5% of SNAP benefit costs starting in fiscal year 2028, which begins Oct. 1, 2027.
Arkansas’ current error rate is 7.01%, DHS Division of County Operations Director Mary Franklin told the Joint Public Health, Welfare and Labor Committee Monday. The rate has decreased by 0.28% since July, when the Advocate calculated that the most expensive potential outcome of the cost-shifting would be just over $100 million based on the rate at the time.
The One Big, Beautiful Bill Act’s changes to SNAP could hit Arkansas’ already-dwindling surplus

Franklin said the state’s error rate in October 2024 was 9.56%, so the state has been “making improvements” and will work to bring the rate down further.
“We have reached out to other states that have lower error rates to inquire what they are doing [and] how they are doing things differently to see if there’s a process or a procedure that we are not doing or paying attention to,” DHS Secretary Janet Mann told the committee.
The two most common areas of error in calculating SNAP benefits are in recording recipients’ income and calculating shelter deductions for homeless households, Franklin said.
Rep. Howard Beaty, R-Crossett (Courtesy of the Arkansas Secretary of State)
Rep. Howard Beaty, R-Crossett, asked if errors are more frequently the responsibility of SNAP recipients providing their information or DHS employees recording it.
Franklin said there are more “agency errors than client errors.” Beaty called it “a huge problem that we need to address, because in the end, it’s going to cost the state money.”
More than 222,000 Arkansas individuals and over 118,000 households received SNAP benefits as of Sept. 1, according to DHS. Arkansas usually receives roughly $41 million in SNAP funds per month, Mann told the Joint Public Health committee in November.
Regardless of error rates, all states’ share of the administrative cost of SNAP will increase from 50% to 75% in October 2026.
Democrats in Congress have expressed concerns that some states will cut SNAP benefits in their efforts to comply with the new program requirements.
The One Big, Beautiful Bill Act also requires non-disabled adults without dependents up to the age of 64 to work in order to receive SNAP benefits unless they are exempted due to disability, substance abuse disorder treatment or attending school. The requirement is to work a minimum of 30 hours per week or earn the equivalent of minimum wage for at least 20 hours per week.

The head of the Vermont Democratic Party is calling on Addison County State’s Attorney Eva Vekos to resign after VTDigger published a story Monday in which sexual assault survivors criticized her handling of their cases and described ethics complaints filed against her.
“Eva Vekos is unfit to serve as State’s Attorney, and she should resign from her office immediately — as a majority of Addison County legislators called for last year, even before the latest ethics complaints and allegations of bullying crime victims came to light,” Vermont Democratic Party Chair Lachlan Francis said in a statement Monday afternoon. 
If Vekos decides to seek reelection to another four-year term, Francis added, the party would not support her candidacy.

“She will not have access to our resources or infrastructure, and we will work to recruit and support a strong primary opponent,” Francis said in the statement. “Addison County deserves law enforcement leaders capable of holding the public’s trust, and that will never be Eva Vekos.”
VTDigger’s Monday story described Vekos’ conduct that led to two formal ethics complaints filed against her regarding her treatment of sexual assault survivors. 
In a statement to VTDigger late Monday afternoon, Vekos, a Democrat, challenged the allegations made against her and criticized the state Democratic Party.
“The Democratic Party doesn’t know anything about me or the successes of my office,” Vekos said in the email. “They have never shown any interest in the work of the criminal court in Addison. So their opinion means little to me.”
Political leaders have called for Vekos’ resignation before. Following her arrest for alleged drunken driving in January 2024, several lawmakers called for her to step down, though she did not. Vekos is up for reelection in November 2026.
Vekos was arrested on a drunken driving charge after she allegedly drove to a suspicious death investigation in Bridport intoxicated. She has since pleaded not guilty to that charge, which remains pending.
Since Vekos’s arrest, detectives with the Vermont State Police New Haven barracks in Addison County have sent cases they investigate to the Vermont Attorney General’s office, rather than Vekos’ office, to avoid a conflict of interest.

Henderson was scheduled to appear before U.S. Magistrate Judge Justin Anand on Monday afternoon. She did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

Blocking public access is legal, but has been a point of contention for decades.
The post Jackson Hole cyclist resuscitates 40-year debate over public access to Snake River levees appeared first on WyoFile .","JACKSON—A longtime Teton County resident is resuscitating a decades-long debate over public access to levees on the Snake River.
When Scott Bradley moved to Jackson 23 years ago, he could ride his bike up and down the levees on the west bank of the Snake River, all the way up to Snake River Ranch. Then, he started to see construction along the river. As new homes went up, so did gates.
“It ruined my favorite Jackson Hole activity,” Bradley said. “It killed the most healthy, soul-shaping activity I had in my daily routine.”
Bradley has been reaching out to county officials and nonprofit groups to see what can be done to open the levees to the public.
In a town where many residents don’t lock their bikes, cars and homes, the gates can come as a surprise. The proliferation of gates is perplexing even to those who maintain the levees.
“For whatever reason, some of your county inhabitants don’t like people walking in front of them,” said Kenny Koebberling, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Jackson levee project manager.
Property owners putting up gates on the levees is unambiguously legal, though the phenomenon has been a matter of consternation for some since the 1980s. The levees are public infrastructure — in that Teton County and the Army Corps maintain them using tax dollars — but often they are on private property.
That explanation isn’t satisfying to some. In 2025, the Corps’ budget for Snake levee maintenance is $357,000, of which Teton County must pay $117,000. Building and maintaining the levees has cost tens of millions of dollars — if not hundreds of millions, when adjusted for inflation — over the years.
“To exclude the public from a facility that the public paid to be built and paid to maintain, that’s a bad deal,” said Teton County Commissioner Len Carlman.
But those who support private property rights on the levees say that, even gated, the levees serve the public good by preventing Wilson from flooding. That, they argue, is what taxpayers are paying for.
“It doesn’t only protect the homeowners that are there,” Koebberling said. “Everything on the west side is protected by those levees, pretty much.”
While property owners have been putting gates up on the levees for more than 40 years, it has picked up in the last decade or so.
It ruined my favorite Jackson Hole activity.Scott Bradley
“In the ‘60s, anybody could drive anywhere on those levees,” Koebberling said. “In general, as the parcels have been sold off and subdivided, more people are wanting to restrict access.”
Koebberling and Tony Havel, manager of the county’s Road and Levee Department, said the northwest stretch of levees has the highest concentration of gates. A reporter counted 10 gates in the 7-mile stretch of levees from the Wilson Boat Ramp upstream to the Snake River Ranch during a ride-along with Road and Levee.
The southeast side also is gated near Highway 22. A subdivision on the southwest levee, however, has decided that it is okay with public use of the levee, leading to about 2.5 miles of public access. The northeast portion of the levee has public access on U.S. Bureau of Land Management parcels.
A levee is born
There are 33 miles of federally managed levees on the Snake. The federal government originally built the levees to protect ranch land, of which not much remains. The government obtained easements from landowners for construction, which took place between 1962 and 1964. The county and the Army Corps have easements to maintain them.
The levees created buildable land that was once floodplain. Before the levees, some people grazed cattle by the river, but no one was particularly concerned about ownership.
“Before they built the levees, people didn’t really care too much,” said Rich Greenwood, who built Teton County’s original GIS. “Then all of a sudden there was a whole bunch of land that could be developed.”
Litigation began shortly thereafter and continued for almost 20 years.
In the West, the “thread” — or center line — of the river is traditionally the boundary line for riverside properties. This concept, known as riparian law, meant that even if the river naturally meandered away from a property, a landowner wouldn’t lose access to a river that he might be depending on for agriculture or commerce.
In the 1960s, the government began resurveying land along the Snake River, claiming that the original survey was erroneous and calling into question the ownership of about 7,000 acres of land along a 22-mile stretch of the river, from Grand Teton National Park to the South Park Bridge.
Before they built the levees, people didn’t really care too much.Rich Greenwood
The government claimed that the lands touching the meander line of the river actually belonged to the government, arguing that the original surveyors omitted riparian land because it was policy at the time to survey only land with agricultural value.
In 1966, the BLM sued Paul Walton, of the Walton Ranch, for quiet title to lands on the east bank of the Snake. In 1969, Judge Ewing Kerr ruled in favor of the BLM, which is why there is public land on the east bank of the river.
“All the BLM parcels were a result of litigation between the United States and private landowners,” Greenwood said.
In 1974, Snake River Ranch sued the government for quiet title to 55 acres of land that the owners feared the government would come after. Kerr ruled in the ranch’s favor, based on riparian law.
Despite the ruling, the government still believed it had a shot of taking ownership of thousands acres of riparian land along the Snake. U.S. Attorney Tosh Suyematsu said there were distinctive features of the Snake River Ranch case that would not come up in other cases. At the time of the Snake River Ranch decision, the government was in the process of suing more than 100 landowners for ownership of 3,236 acres along 22 miles of river.
Landowners claimed that they owned the land through riparian law, as their property ran to the center line of the river before the levees were built and controlled the meandering nature of the river, creating dry areas where land once flooded periodically.

Department of Justice attorneys claimed that the land existed in its present form when the original survey took place in 1893 and had been excluded from the survey, making it federal property. Attorneys for the government used trees, rocks and silt as evidence to try to prove that the lands existed before the survey.
In 1983, Judge Kerr determined that 400 acres of the land did belong to the government, and the rest belonged to landowners. The government spent nearly $1 million on the case and could have been on the hook for $400,000 in landowners’ legal fees if the verdict was appealed.
Teton County Deputy Attorney Keith Gingery said the government’s case had legs.
“The U.S. government would have probably won in the end,” he said. “If they had won, there would have been no big homes along the Snake River. There would have been no John Dodge. It would have been one big national park that would go down into the center of the valley.”
The case went up to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit a few times and was sent back to the district court each time, Gingery said. The appeals court kept saying that the land plausibly could be government property, but attorneys for the government needed to make a better case for its position.
“Depending on who you ask, it was a real miss from the judges who interpreted legal access,” said Orion Hatch, executive director of the Snake River Fund.
The case led to settlements with the landowners to allow for recreational easements that permit river users to get out of their boats, walk around on sand and gravel bars and anchor their boats. But the easements specifically prohibited levee-top access.
“Really what the federal government was after was making sure the public had access to the river,” Gingery said.
Levee wars
Property owners began gating off the levees soon after, emboldened by the ruling in favor of property rights.
In January 1984, State Sen. Tom Stroock, a Casper Republican and chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, started a movement to cut state funding for levee maintenance until landowners removed “no trespassing” signs from the levees.
He said it was unconstitutional for the state to appropriate funds for private entities.
“If the dikes are private property, then there is a constitutional question,” he told the Jackson Hole News at the time. “If the dikes are public, it is appropriate for public money to be spent on them and I will support it. If they are public, they shouldn’t be posted and there shouldn’t be barbed wire fences.”
Teton County officials and state representatives were concerned that if the state withheld funding, the federal government would follow suit. Stroock relinquished his position after county leaders convinced him that without maintenance, floods could impact many landowners, not just those with riverfront properties.
Stroock owned a place in Teton Village and had encountered the signs himself while fishing, said John Turner, who represented Moose in the state Senate at the time.
“We went to battle over this,” Turner said. “Landowners had a right, as they do to any of their lands. Maintaining those dikes did not give access for skiing, biking and whatever. That did not grant us the right to traipse around on private property.”
Turner felt strongly about the funding issue because of the potential for damage across the entire floodplain.
Until the early 1990s, the levees were still open to cars. In 1991, landowners on the south side of the river began organizing to get the levees shut off to traffic, arguing that cars were turning the levees into a tent village and landfill.
At the time, the Jackson Hole News wrote an editorial in favor of keeping the levees open to traffic.
“In the course of the past decade public access to the levees along the Snake and Gros Ventre rivers has been systematically eliminated,” the editorial stated. “Although the dikes were built with public money to protect private lands from flooding, a series of court rulings awarded control of the levees to landowners who quickly slapped up gates and no trespassing signs.”
Gates beget gates
The rise of gates can be attributed to greater landowner confidence in their own property lines, an uptick in subdivided property and increased development generally.
Landowner Tom Kalishman declined to comment on his rationale for putting up a gate.
Landowners originally wanted gates on the levees to keep their cattle from wandering, Turner said. There aren’t many cows on the West Bank anymore, and the only large cattle operation left is Snake River Ranch, according to the Road and Levee Department. But the decrease in cattle actually has led to an increase in gates.
The number of gates on the levees has doubled in the past 20 years, according to Road and Levee estimates.

The Corps is trying to dissuade landowners from installing gates in the most-gated sections of river, such as the northwest levees. The county and the Corps have keys to all the gates, but the proliferation of obstacles could hinder their ability to respond to an emergency.
“I don’t want 1,000 gates on the levee because when I’m doing emergency repairs, my truck drivers have to get in and out,” Koebberling said. “At some point, it’s not that beneficial, anyway.”
Koebberling has been reluctant to impose an outright ban on gates, fearing that a “blanket rule” would provoke litigious landowners. But he has been trying to persuade landowners with security concerns that there are “different ways to skin a cat than putting up another gate.
“The county and I have had discussions that if the top of the levee is secured and the bottom of the levee is secured, why do we need all these gates in between?” Koebberling said. “There’s plenty in that John Dodge area, there’s more than enough.”
Some landowners do not even want government employees on their property to conduct maintenance. “There have been people who have made attempts at impeding us,” Koebberling said. “The county attorney gets involved and straightens it up pretty quick.”
Up by Solitude, property owners take care of their own maintenance, which some attribute to those property owners’ desire to steer clear of the government altogether. Some of the levees in that area also were built privately.
Gingery has encountered landowners who are upset when they see river users outside their properties.
“As more and more wealthy people buy into our valley, they think they bought the river,” Gingery said, citing an interaction with a property owner who was angry about seeing “a bunch of regular Jackson people hanging out and fishing” on the river near his home.
“He thought he had his own little private river,” Gingery said.
Paths forward
Besides Bradley’s one-man crusade against gates on the levees, there isn’t much of an appetite to try to overturn the 40-year-old legal precedent on the matter.
“It would be an amazing resource to be able to head north all the way up to Grand Teton National Park,” the Snake River Fund’s Hatch said. “Unfortunately, that’s not the reality.”
The status quo is rooted in litigation, not public policy, Commissioner Carlman said.
Granting public access to the levees either would require federal legislation, litigation or landowners coming together to provide recreational easements for levee-top access — all of which would take a lot of money, effort or both.
“My experience is that many of these landowners don’t have the appetite for increasing public access,” Hatch said. “When you have private landowners putting up gates, it’s not the best start.”

(Capital-Star/Peter Hall)More than 42% of registered voters in Pennsylvania cast ballots in last month’s election, marking a significant jump in participation over turnout in the last municipal election in 2023.
Secretary of the Commonwealth Al Schmidt certified the results of the Nov. 4 election, which featured a retention vote for three state Supreme Court justices and races for mayor in several of the state’s largest cities, county executives and Philadelphia’s district attorney.
Schmidt said he had reviewed results certified in each of the 67 counties and formally certified the statewide results. 
“I extend my thanks to county election officials, who spent the last few weeks diligently counting eligible votes and confirming that Pennsylvania held yet another free, fair, safe, and secure election,” he said.

Last month’s election also included statewide races for positions on the state’s appellate courts including Commonwealth Court and Superior Court. Nearly 42.5% of voters cast ballots, compared to about 37% in the last municipal election in 2023, when there was also a state Supreme Court position on the ballot.
The retention race for Supreme Court Justices Christine Donohue, Kevin Dougherty and David Wecht dominated the election cycle. Third-party spending aimed at unseating the three justices transformed the usually quiet municipal election into a media blitz to persuade voters either to boot or keep them.
Donohue, Dougherty and Wecht, who were first elected in 2015 as Democrats, won by the broad margins common in judicial retentions. Their results maintain the court’s 5-2 Democratic majority, although Donohue, 72, will be able to serve only three years before reaching the mandatory retirement age for state judges.
Chris Borick, director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion, said the high turnout was the result of a combination of attention heaped on the Supreme Court race and voters’ response to the turmoil that followed President Donald Trump’s return to office.
Many voters, Borick said, were “highly energized for their first opportunity to express their views” on Trump’s first nine months in office.

“You put those things together and it’s a recipe for the higher than average turnout we experienced in 2025,” he said, adding that while it’s likely some of that effect would carry over to the 2026 midterm elections, it would be unwise for Democrats to rely on a repeat next year.
Before the Department of State can certify statewide election results, counties must complete two audits of their results, Schmidt’s office said.
By law, each county must perform a recount of at least 2% of all ballots cast or 2,000 ballots, whichever is less.
The other audit is a statistically based risk-limiting audit, which involves randomly selected counties hand-tallying votes for a randomly chosen statewide race in randomly selected batches of ballots.
The department livestreamed the random contest selection process and the one  to randomly select which counties were selected to audit random batches of ballots. 
Superior Court Judge Alice Beck Dubow’s retention race was selected and auditors in nine counties manually reviewed 4,343 ballots to confirm the reported results were correct, the department said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DSC_7449-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-08 18:58:55.166539

The onslaught of messages came as a number of prominent right-wing social media accounts posted videos of the flag-raising on Monday.

The Winooski School District took down its website and disconnected many of its office phones Monday after receiving what its superintendent described as a flood of racist and violent messages in response to the district’s decision to raise a Somali flag.
Many of the messages appear to be part of a coordinated effort to target the district, where about 9% of students are Somali, spurred by prominent right-wing social media accounts, according to Wilmer Chavarria, the Winooski schools superintendent.
The district was forwarding messages it received on Monday to state law enforcement officials. A spokesperson for the Vermont State Police said investigators had been sent more than 200 such messages as of Monday afternoon and said their content so far appeared to be part of a “coordinated national campaign” against the district.
So far, none of the messages state investigators had reviewed seemed to present a credible threat of violence, Adam Silverman, the state police spokesperson, said in an email.
District leaders hosted a Somali flag-raising ceremony on Friday at the city’s combined elementary, middle and high school campus. The district later posted images and a video of the event, showing some of the students attending it, to its social media feeds.
The flag-raising was one of several actions the district has planned to show support for its Somali community in response to President Donald Trump’s tirade last week during a Cabinet meeting against Somali people living in Minnesota, according to Chavarria.
Trump called Somalis “garbage” that he said he did not want to have in the country and later ordered immigration agents into Minnesota. Officials from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security then touted the arrest of several Somali men, calling them the “worst of the worst.” The president has pointed to a sweeping fraud scandal in Minnesota that prosecutors allege largely involved Somali people as a justification for his actions.

“It’s almost marching orders for a large part of the U.S. population to go and harass our community,” Chavarria said, of the president’s comments, in an interview.
Starting Monday morning, the Winooski School District’s phone lines started “blowing up,” Chavarria said. He said some people were calling district employees the N-word, among other offensive names. Some calls included phrases such as “We’re coming for you. You don’t know what’s coming. You’re about to find out,” he said.
The messages coincided with posts on a number of popular right-wing social media pages that included the video of the flag-raising, contact information for the district and photos of its school board members, Chavarria said. He said he believed the posts were the reason for the sudden onslaught of calls, as well as a torrent of emails. 
The video being spread online shows only a Somali flag, which Chavarria said seems to have given the false impression that the school was flying it in place of a U.S. flag. He said that notion was reflected in the messages district employees received Monday.
In a post to its own social media feeds Monday, the district said it wanted “to assure our community” that the Somali flag was being flown on one of three flagpoles outside the city’s school, next to a U.S. flag and Vermont flag. The U.S. flag “remains in its proper place at the highest point,” the post stated. It also said the Somali flag would be flown for only one week.
As of Monday afternoon, posts were visible on the X accounts “End Wokeness” and “Libs of TikTok,” which together have more than 8 million followers, including the video of the flag-raising and text directing followers to call the school district’s central office.
Benny Johnson, a pro-Trump political commentator with 4 million X followers who is a former executive at Turning Point USA, the organization founded by the late Charlie Kirk, shared the flag-raising video Monday with the message, “I’ve got a suggestion for ICE’s next stop.”
(Federal immigration agents have already arrested immigrants living in Winooski, though the city, like the rest of the state, has not been the focus of one of Trump’s large-scale enforcement operations such as those in Los Angeles or New York.)

The right-wing X account “Libs of TikTok” posted a video Monday of the Somali flag being raised on the Winooski school campus and urged people to contact school leaders about it. Screenshot

“It’s pretty scary,” Chavarria said. But he said he and other district leaders think the reaction to the flag-raising shows the importance of the action in the first place.
“It’s given us even more of a mission to continue doing the right thing,” he said. “Because if they are willing to attack our employees to that extent, I don’t want to find out what they’re willing to do to our most vulnerable students in the building who just happen to be of a different color, speak a different language, have a different family story.”
Chavarria said the district had police patrolling its school Monday and that staff planned to take additional precautions such as keeping close tabs on students when they were outside.
On Monday afternoon, the Winooski schools’ website directed users to a page stating the site was offline while staff “address and mitigate an unprecedented volume of illegitimate traffic targeting our services.” 
The district was slated to host another gathering for its Somali community on Monday afternoon as part of its response to Trump’s comments last week, Chavarria said.

A Vermont Superior Court Judge dismissed a wrongful termination lawsuit filed by a former Brattleboro Union High School principal against his former school district.
Principal Steve Perrin was fired in November 2022 after the Windham Southeast School District accused him of mishandling an investigation into a sexual assault. A former student also accused him of harassing her and making inappropriate advances, according to court documents.
Perrin first appealed his termination to the school board following his firing. After school board members affirmed their decision to terminate him, he filed the lawsuit in March 2023.

Perrin vehemently denied the claims and alleged that the school board had wrongfully terminated him, defamed him and denied him his due process.
Superior Court Judge David Berra, in a Nov. 26 ruling, granted summary judgement to the defendants, including the Windham Southeast Supervisory Union, the Windham Southeast School District, and the 10 individuals serving as members of the board at the time of Perrin’s termination.
The decision was first reported by the Brattleboro Reformer.
Perrin could not be reached for comment. His attorney, Theodore Kramer, said in an email that “from time to time a case comes along that shakes your faith in fairness and our system of justice.”
“In the process of defending him, many educators confided in us that ‘there but for the grace of God go I,'” Kramer wrote. “That is to say, one accuser can end a career.”
Kramer added that Perrin was “undeterred, and determined to secure justice” and said he planned on appealing to the Vermont Supreme Court.
Perrin first started as principal of the Brattleboro school in 2011 but was fired in November 2022 after a decision of the school board. The board determined that it was “more likely than not” that Perrin had conducted an “inappropriate and harmful investigation” of a student’s sexual assault, according to court documents.
An independent investigator hired by the school district after the allegations surfaced found a “pattern of harassment, abuse, and unprofessional conduct” by Perrin, court documents read.
The former student, named Jane Doe in court documents, said that Perrin had interviewed her about a sexual assault off campus while she was a student at Brattleboro Union High School.
According to court documents, the former principal interviewed the student alone and behind closed doors in his office. He did not notify her parents of the interview despite her request to do so.
“Perrin persisted in questioning her despite her reluctance to answer and threatened her with an accusation of filing a false report,” court documents read.
Perrin then allegedly instructed a staff member not to file a report about the sexual assault with the Vermont Department for Children and Families that the staff member felt was required, according to court documents. (A report was eventually filed.)
Following the interview, Perrin had several more “uncomfortable interactions” with Doe — calling her into his office to interview her alone again, walking her between classes and making “uncomfortable and unwelcome remarks” about her appearance, according to court documents.
Perrin “touched Doe’s hair on one occasion” and “took a sexual interest in Doe,” according to court documents and transcripts.
Kramer, in an email, dismissed the allegations as “the most incredible and nonsensical of accusations.”
The school board, Kramer said in court documents, failed to “properly weigh the evidence,” and he said conflicting testimony was not considered. He further argued the student’s testimony lacked any corroborating evidence.
Judge Berra disagreed, writing in his decision that there was “sufficient evidence to make the findings the Board made.”
In weighing the school board’s decision to terminate Perrin, Berra wrote that it was not the role of the Superior Court to weigh the strength of testimony or corroboration, but to weigh whether the board’s decision was appropriate given the available evidence.
The “existence of conflicting testimony is not grounds for overturning the Board Decision,” he wrote.
Berra said he found nothing to support Perrin’s argument that his due process rights were violated. He similarly denied other allegations aired by Perrin, including defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress.
“Perrin spends much time attacking Doe’s credibility, but not the sufficiency of the Board’s findings if her testimony is believed,” Berra wrote in his dismissal. “Witness after witness when questioned confirmed the simple truth that if Doe’s testimony were true the Board Decision was proper.”
“The question for the court to consider is whether there was sufficient basis in the testimony to support the findings and conclusions,” Berra wrote. “There is.”

It’s decorated with over 2,400 lights and roughly 1,700 ornaments handmade by children and seniors across the commonwealth.

Shapiro called it the tallest tree to adorn the rotunda in more than a decade.
“I want you to know it just fills my heart with joy,” Shapiro said. “It reminds me I’m part of a broader community, and I think it puts a smile on people’s faces.”
Shapiro is the first Jewish governor of Pennsylvania. He and his family have continued the tradition of decorating the Governor’s Residence for Christmas.
“While our family celebrates Hanukkah this time of year, it was really important to us to continue the tradition of transforming the governor’s residence into a home filled with Christmas cheer,” Lori Shapiro said. “Christmas brings joy and we love being a part of it.”
The Central Dauphin High School Choir sang, and Rev. Anjel Scarborough, rector of All Saints Episcopal Church in Hershey, provided an invocation.
Scarborough began by noting the “challenges” 2025 has brought — uncertainty, polarization, and violence. That included the firebombing of the governor’s residence on the Jewish Passover holiday in April, which was not mentioned directly.
“In a season with these kinds of challenges, it’s important to lean into two things,” she said. “The power of hope and the necessity of courage.”
Lt. Gov. Austin Davis also spoke, imploring Pennsylvanians to be kind to those, regardless of their faith, who may be alone, struggling or grieving through the holidays.
“That’s the true spirit of Christmas,” he said. “I hope you all will join me in that spirit.”
Scarborough ended the ceremony with a reading of the Franciscan Benediction.

“May God bless you with discomfort at easy answers, half-truths and superficial relationships, so that you may live deep within your heart,” she said. “May God bless you with anger at injustice, oppression and exploitation of people, so that you may work for justice, freedom and peace.”

(File photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — A South Carolina law meant to prevent election fraud makes it harder for people with disabilities to vote, civil rights groups claimed in a federal lawsuit.
Under a 2022 law, anyone can vote early with no excuse necessary or request an absentee ballot to vote by mail. To prevent the possibility of fraud, legislators added a limit of five ballots that any one person could request or submit for someone else.
In nursing homes and residential care settings, where residents often rely on a single staff member to help them vote, that makes voting difficult, attorneys for the state American Civil Liberties Union argued in a lawsuit filed in federal court Friday.
Three nursing home residents sued alongside the state NAACP, contending the law violates the federal Voting Rights Act.
Robert Caldwell, a 74-year-old resident of a Chester nursing home, has relied on a single social worker, Barvette Gaither, to help him vote in years past. According to the lawsuit, Gaither is a popular choice for assistance at the nursing home, since she has a good rapport with residents and knows a lot about the voting process.
Before the law, she submitted between 10 and 25 ballots for residents each election. Since the law passed, she has had to choose five residents and hand the rest off to other staff members or the residents’ family members, according to the lawsuit.
The same is true for 60-year-old Jonathan Bell and 75-year-old Sherry Jenkins, who live at a nursing home in Union. Deborah Allen, who oversees activities for Union Post Acute nursing home, helped most of its 25 residents submit ballots because she knew the process and deadlines, the lawsuit claims.
After the 2022 changes to state law, Allen had to prioritize who to help and Bell was not among them, since he has immediate family members nearby. But Bell worries he can’t rely on his family to help him fill out the ballot correctly and get it submitted on time, according to the lawsuit.
“These laws target some of our state’s most vulnerable voters and make it harder — sometimes even impossible —to cast a ballot,” Allen Chaney, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of South Carolina, said in a release. “Voters who need help voting deserve to receive that help from someone they trust, without worrying that the state might arrest the person they choose.”
Nursing homes could assign other staff members to help residents. But, according to the legal challenge, the Voting Rights Act guarantees voters help from the person of their choice, even if that person is the choice of more than five residents.
Voting rights advocates raised similar concerns when the law passed in 2022. Some members of the League of Women Voters have stepped in to help people who can no longer rely on nursing home staff to help them vote, said Lynn Teague, the state chapter’s vice president.
“People in nursing homes are very often dependent on staff for their assistance,” Teague said Monday.
The June 2022 primaries were the first election under the law, which was widely praised at its ceremonial signing by lawmakers and leaders of both parties.
Although voting rights activists knew that section of the law might cause problems, it took several years for the stories of people in nursing homes struggling to vote since its passage to reach people who could file a lawsuit on their behalf, Chaney said.
“The voters being harmed are pretty far from the limelight,” Chaney said.
The five-ballot limitation was a compromise.
The cap was meant to prevent people from collecting a massive number of ballots, which they could then tamper with or discard, skewing the results one way or another, said Rep. Brandon Newton, a Lancaster Republican who shepherded the bill through the House.
“That’s when you have the opportunity for shenanigans, when someone is handling someone else’s ballots,” Newton said.
State law already banned volunteers or employees for a candidate from collecting heaps of ballots, a practice often called ballot harvesting. Legislators still worried about the potential for fraud if a single person turned in a large number of ballots, Newton said.
Some lawmakers wanted to allow only immediate family members to return an absentee ballot. Others wanted no cap at all. They settled on five after considering likely family scenarios, Newton said.
People who care for their elderly parents, parents-in-law and a homebound spouse, for instance, might need to submit five ballots in addition to their own. Any more ballots than six total per election cycle gets fishy, Newton said.
“We did not want to inconvenience anyone, but there needs to be a reasonable limit,” Newton said.
Beyond capping the number of ballots an “authorized representative” can turn in, the law limits who can be assisted. Voters can be helped by people who aren’t immediate family members if they’re physically unable to go to a polling place. According to the law’s definition of “authorized representative,” assisted voters must be ill or have a physical disability that confines them to a long-term care facility, hospital or their own home.
According to the lawsuit, that can leave people with cognitive disabilities unable to vote. They might rely on people who aren’t immediate family members for day-to-day help, which could include completing the absentee ballot process, the lawsuit claims.
State law also requires anyone helping a voter be registered to vote in South Carolina as well, which can cause problems for people living in facilities bordering state lines, since staff members might travel from North Carolina or Georgia, according to the lawsuit.
The ACLU is asking a federal judge to instruct the state attorney general to immediately stop enforcing the law, then throw it out entirely, according to the filing.

DemasA last-ditch appeal to the Michigan Supreme Court was filed Monday in the state Senate’s lawsuit against the House of Representatives, which sought court intervention over nine bills that never reached the governor’s desk after they passed the Senate at the end of the 2024 session.
The Court of Appeals in October ordered the Court of Claims to enter a writ of mandamus for the upper chamber in Michigan Senate v. Michigan House of Representatives. The lower court previously ruled that the House had an obligation to present the bills to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, even though the 2024 session was over, never ordered the House to do so because Court of Claims Judge Sima Patel worried about separation of powers constraints.
House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) has long held that the 2024 Legislature had the obligation to present the bills, which was under the leadership of a different House speaker and political party control, and that the obligation did not extend to his 2025 legislature and speakership.
Court of Appeals: Withheld Michigan House bills must be presented to the governor

State Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids) called foul and sued Hall and the House over the lack of movement on the bills after they were passed by the Senate but not presented for Whitmer’s signature.
After losing in the Court of Appeals, the House is asking the state’s high court, which has a 6-1 majority of justices appointed or nominated by Democrats, to settle the dispute.
In the request for leave to appeal filed Monday, the House again argued that the issues revolve around the validity of legislative actions, and how those actions could be negatively impacted by what it labeled as a bad call from the Court of Appeals.
“The Court of Appeals erred … first erred in reaching the merits of the Senate’s claims against the House, given that the claims are not justiciable and the Senate lacks standing,” the House wrote in its filing. “It compounded that error when interpreting the constitutional text at issue to require the 103rd House to present bills passed by the 102nd Legislature. Last, it erred in the relief it ordered, by directing the Court of Claims to issue a writ of mandamus against the Legislature.”
The bills in question – House Bills 4177, 4665, 4666, 4667 [which passed in the lower chamber in 2023] and House Bills 4900, 4901, 5817, 5818 and 6058 [which were passed by the House in 2024] –  were passed by the Senate during a marathon lame duck session of the upper chamber at the tail end of 2024.
The House, then under Democratic control, was in a state of disarray when state Rep. Karen Whitsett (D-Detroit) joined a mutiny of sorts staged by Hall, who led a GOP walk out and locked up the lower chamber from passing any of the Senate’s bills in the final days of lame duck.
Michigan House adjourns after again failing to get a quorum, stranding legislative priorities

Undeterred, the Democratic-controlled Senate under Brinks pushed on and passed as many of the House bills as it could before the clock ran out on the 2024 term. That included the nine bills at the center of the current presentment battle.
When the Senate voted on the bills, it sent them back to the House to enroll them for presentation to the governor. The House under former Speaker Joe Tate (D-Detroit) and the House clerk did not complete that task before the end of the term and have never offered an explanation as to why.
That caused a legal controversy over whether the new House, under Hall’s leadership, had an inherent duty to present the bills – which passed both chambers – to Whitmer. Hall’s legal team said it did not have that duty, to which the Senate bristled.
Michigan Supreme Court orders lower court to decide stalled-bill deadlock

Patel ultimately ruled for both parties in a confusing decision. Patel’s ruling also landed on the separation of powers doctrine, noting the lower court did not have the authority to tell the legislative branch how to function.
Both sides claimed victory even though the ruling did not grant mandamus relief – or a specific order from the court compelling an elected official to fulfill their duties – and the bills were no closer to Whitmer’s desk and pen.
The House appealed to the Court of Appeals for greater clarity, to which the Senate filed a cross-appeal asking if the lower court had erred when it failed to grant mandamus relief.
In the opinion issued by the Court of Appeals, Judge Thomas Cameron wrote  that the House failed to show that the Senate lacked standing to bring the case. He also disagreed with the House in its assertion that the Senate’s legal challenge was unclear enough and unable to seek relief from the court.
Now it is up to the state’s high court to decide the matter and the fate of the bills at hand.
The court has not issued a decision on whether it would take up the matter. If it does, the court could decide the matter on the pleadings already filed with the court, or place the case on its upcoming oral arguments schedule to hear both sides in its own chambers. The court could decide not to hear the case at all, letting the Court of Appeals opinion stand if it takes no further action.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_9166-1024x699.jpg,,,2025-12-08 17:57:08.017363

The estate, represented by Torres-García’s father Victor Torres, seeks $100 million in damages — $75 million in Torres-García’s case and an additional $25 million in her sister’s case. The paperwork includes a long list of allegations of negligence on the part of DCF, including a failure to protect the girl from her mother, Karla García, and her mother’s ex-boyfriend, Jonatan Nanita, who have since been charged in her death.
Connecticut’s chief medical examiner found that the cause of the 11-year-old’s death was fatal child abuse with starvation, and a homicide.
Ken Mysogland, the bureau chief of external affairs for DCF, said in a statement that the department hasn’t yet “been formally notified of the claim and when it is received, we will assess it to determine the most appropriate course of action.”
According to paperwork filed on Thursday with Connecticut’s claims commissioner, the lawsuit will argue, in part, that DCF failed to perform adequate wellness checks on Torres-García. That allegation is made in light of information released by DCF that another child had impersonated Torres-García during a wellness check conducted via Zoom in early 2025. 
At the time, DCF said that its caseworker was notified that Torres-García was visiting a relative out of state, and because the primary abuse allegation being investigated regarded her sibling, the agency allowed the wellness check of Torres-García to be made via Zoom. DCF welfare checks on children are normally conducted in person, with few exceptions, according to the agency. Lawmakers and advocates have demanded answers as to why the wellness check occurred via Zoom, and how the agency could have been fooled.
In the document, the estate also accuses DCF of negligence in its training and supervision of employees, officers, agents and/or servants of DCF who were involved in the case, and also accuses DCF of prematurely closing the case involving Torres-García and her family.
Paperwork was also filed by Connecticut’s Department of Administrative Services on Thursday that indicates that the state is investigating whether the heirs of Torres-García could owe funds to reimburse “for aid, care or services provided by the State of Connecticut.”
According to Leigh Appleby, a spokesman for DAS, such a letter is routinely sent “when DAS is in the process of investigating whether the estate or any of the estate’s beneficiaries has a debt,” to any of the agencies, like DCF, that DAS is responsible for collecting.

American democracy is straining under countless pressures, many of them rooted in structural problems that go back to the nation’s founding. Chief among them is the “pick one” plurality voting system – also called winner-take-all – used to elect nearly all of the 520,000 government officials in the United States.
In this system, voters select one candidate, and the candidate who receives the highest number of votes wins.
Plurality voting is notorious for producing winners without majority support in races that have more than two candidates. It can also create spoilers, or losing candidates whose presence in a race alters the outcome, as Ralph Nader’s did in the 2000 presidential election. And it can result in vote-splitting, where similar candidates divide support, paving the way for a less popular winner. This happened in the 2016 Republican primaries when Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz and John Kasich split the anti-Donald Trump vote.
Plurality can also encourage dishonest voting. That happens when voters are pressured to abandon their favorite candidate for one they like less but think can win. In the 2024 elections, for example, voters whose preference for president was Jill Stein, the Green Party nominee, might have instead cast their vote for Democrat Kamala Harris.
An increasingly well-known alternative to plurality voting is ranked choice voting. It’s used statewide in Maine and Alaska and in dozens of municipalities, including New York City.
 Better performance

Whereas plurality voting allows voters to select only one candidate, ranked choice lets them rank candidates. If a candidate secures a majority of first-place rankings, they are the winner just like they would be under plurality.
But the two systems diverge when there is no majority winner. Plurality simply chooses the candidates with the most first-place votes, while ranked choice voting eliminates the person with the fewest first-place votes and transfers their votes to the next candidate on each ballot. The process is repeated until there is a majority winner.
Ranked choice voting makes use of more information from the voters than plurality, but does it avoid some of the problems plurality suffers from?
We are a team of mathematicians who recently concluded a study aimed at answering this and related questions. We analyzed some 2,000 ranked choice elections from the U.S., Australia and Scotland. We supplemented those real-world results with 60 million simulated elections.
The results were clear: Ranked choice voting performed much better across all the measures we tested, including spoiler, vote-splitting, strength of candidates and strategic voting.

 Empowering voters

Plurality voting produced a spoiler up to 15 times more often than ranked choice voting. And it was 50% more likely to elect an extreme candidate. Plurality, furthermore, was highly susceptible to vote-splitting, while ranked choice voting was nearly impervious to it.
Ranked choice voting picked strong candidates up to 18 times more frequently than plurality voting, where by “strong” we mean candidates who received many first-place votes and also had broad support, even among their noncore supporters. This method also rarely elects a weak or fringe candidate and typically elects a candidate near the electorate’s ideological center.
Ranked choice voting is also more resistant to various forms of strategic behavior such as bullet voting, where voters choose only one candidate despite the ability to rank more, and burying, where voters disingenuously rank an alternative candidate lower in the hopes of defeating them.
Our research also studied the ways in which election systems can influence behavior. In a plurality election, voters are afraid that their ballot could be “wasted” on a candidate who doesn’t have a shot at winning, or that they might contribute to a spoiler. Our study shows that ranked choice voting largely avoids these pitfalls, empowering voters to express their true preferences rather than being strategic.
We found that candidates in ranked choice voting elections do best when they adopt the policies the greatest number of people support, meeting the voters where they are.
In Alaska’s 2022 special U.S. House election, for example, Democrat Mary Peltola positioned herself firmly within Alaska’s center-left base – while still embracing some positions considered conservative outside of Alaska. She won by garnering enough second-place votes from supporters of Republican Nick Begich.
And in the New York mayoral primary in June 2025, Zohran Mamdani won by creating a coalition with another progressive candidate, Brad Lander, and occupying a progressive space representing a range of voters.
The Alaska and New York examples highlight some differences with plurality voting, which often favors appealing to a narrow base without the necessity of reaching out beyond it.
 Mending a broken system

A mathematically interesting feature of Alaska’s 2022 special U.S. House election is that Begich beat both Peltola and Republican Sarah Palin in head-to-head contests – meaning that more people ranked Begich above Peltola than the other way around – but lost the ranked choice voting election to Peltola.
Critics seize on such cases as reasons to avoid ranked choice voting. But our work shows that these are statistical outliers, occurring fewer than 1% of the time.
Overall, our research shows that ranked choice voting elects candidates with broader support and greater democratic legitimacy than plurality. It therefore seems sensible that voting reform advocates continue to pursue this method as an alternative to plurality voting.
At a time when Americans are losing faith in democracy, voters cannot afford systems that hand victory to unrepresentative candidates and force them to play tactical games. The math is in, and the evidence is overwhelming: Plurality voting is broken. Ranked choice voting will not solve every democratic ailment, but it is a good step toward mending them.

Hypoxia refers to low oxygen levels in waters near the sea floor, making affected areas uninhabitable for fish and other marine life. It can happen when there is excessive nitrogen in the water, which comes from stormwater runoff and wastewater.
A study from the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection found hypoxia covered only about 18 square miles of the Sound at the maximum. That number is down from 43 in 2024 and 127 in 2023.
“This year’s historic decrease in hypoxia illustrates 40 years of amazing progress through the Long Island Sound Partnership,” said EPA Region 2 Administrator Michael Martucci in a statement. “Dedicated efforts and investments by EPA, Connecticut, New York, and local governments have drastically reduced the amount of nitrogen pollution entering the Sound, resulting in smaller affected areas and fewer days of low oxygen.”
The Long Island Sound Partnership, which includes DEEP and the EPA, has also released a Hypoxia Forecasting Model and Toolkit to help folks better understand what’s happening below the surface.
They say the best ways for residents to help include reducing fertilizers, picking up after their pets, and clearing debris near storm drains.

(Sharon Sullivan for Colorado Newsline)An attorney for Tina Peters, the former Mesa County clerk who is serving a Colorado prison sentence, addressed President Donald Trump directly in a letter to make the case that he should grant Peters a pardon.
The Florida-based attorney, Peter Ticktin, had already said he applied to the Trump administration last month for a pardon, as first reported by Newsline. In a new 9-page letter to Trump, Ticktin details his argument that Trump should pardon Peters, whom he casts as a political prisoner, and his contention that Trump has the power to pardon her.
Presidential pardons are understood across the legal profession to apply only to federal cases. Peters was convicted on state charges. But Ticktin claims in the letter that the scope of a president’s pardon power as described in the Constitution has been broadly misunderstood. He argues that the Constitution’s references to the United States apply to the individual states as well as the country as a whole, concluding, “The President of the United States has the power to grant a pardon in any of the states of the United States.”

Ticktin acknowledges in the letter that “the question of whether a president can pardon for state offenses has never been raised in any court,” but he thinks the U.S. Supreme Court should consider the matter.
Asked about the pardon request and the letter to Trump, a White House official wrote in an email, “The White House does not comment on potential clemency requests. The President is the final decider on all pardons.”

Newsline has made several attempts to verify with the U.S. Department of Justice receipt of Peters’ clemency petition but has not received a response.
Ticktin said the pardon request was filed a little less than three weeks ago. The letter to Trump is dated Dec. 7, and a spokesperson for Ticktin said it has been sent to Trump and Ed Martin, the U.S. pardon attorney.
Trump has repeatedly demanded that Colorado release Peters, and Martin has indicated the administration is working on freeing her. Trump’s Department of Justice has taken an active role in the case.
Phil Weiser, the Democratic Colorado attorney general, said in a statement to Newsline last week that a presidential pardon for someone convicted in state court “has no precedent in American law, would be an outrageous departure from what our constitution requires, and will not hold up.”
Peters, 70, is incarcerated at La Vista Correctional Facility in Pueblo. The Republican was convicted by a Mesa County jury and sentenced in October 2024. She was convicted for her role in a scheme to breach the security of her own election equipment in 2021, part of an effort to find evidence that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. 
There is no credible evidence that the 2020 election results were compromised or that Peters’ prosecution, which was led by a Republican district attorney, was flawed.
Much of Ticktin’s letter to Trump repeats the kind of stolen-election claims that for years have circulated among Trump supporters since the president himself initiated the lie that the 2020 election was stolen.

Getty ImagesA federal judge has struck down Georgia’s ban on gender-affirming care for transgender inmates in state custody, but the state is appealing the decision.
Judge Victoria M. Calvert’s decision, which was issued last week, means that the approximately 340 people with gender dysphoria diagnoses in the custody of the Georgia Department of Corrections can receive treatments like hormone therapy if their doctors deem it necessary. The case was brought by five transgender people in state custody.
Senate Bill 185, which was passed during the 2025 legislative session received Gov. Brian Kemp’s signature and went into effect in May after sparking controversy in both chambers during this year’s legislative session.
In the Senate, three Democrats crossed party lines to support the measure along with all Republicans, while four other Democratic senators did not vote.
Nearly all House Democrats took part in a walkout over the bill, characterizing it as a waste of time and part of what they called a fixation on a vulnerable minority. Three Democrats voted for the bill, while two others stayed in the chamber and voted against it.
Calvert’s ruling makes a temporary block on the bill she signed in September permanent.
The law called on doctors to monitor patients already receiving the treatments and taper the drugs gradually, and to provide counseling. Based on testimony, Calvert said that was “an inadequate blanket substitute for hormone therapy.” She said there is “no genuine dispute” that gender dysphoria is a serious medical need and that removing the option for doctors to treat it with hormone therapy without a medical reason violates the law.
“The Court does not hold that the Constitution requires all inmates receive hormone therapy if they want it,” she wrote. “Rather, the Court requires healthcare decisions for prisoners to be made dispassionately, by physicians, based on individual determinations of medical need, and for reasons beyond the fact that the prisoners are prisoners.”
Attorney General Chris Carr’s office appealed the ruling Monday. Carr said in a statement that his office is willing to fight the case all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. Carr, a Republican, is running to be Georgia’s next governor.
The bill’s author, Cataula Republican Sen. Randy Robertson, said he’s not discouraged by the ruling.
“We planned this all along. We knew exactly how this was going to go, they were going to find a friendly judge, and Judge Calvert very much is that,” Robertson said of the Biden-nominated judge. ”
Robertson argued that Georgia taxpayers should not be on the hook for treatments he called not medically necessary, and he expressed confidence that his bill will be vindicated as it winds through the courts.
“I stand with Attorney General Carr in the belief that, at the end of the day, this will be in front of the U.S. Supreme Court, and it will quickly be upheld, the law will be established as constitutional and right, and we will be moving on to things that are more important in Georgia,” he added.
In June, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of a Tennessee law banning gender-affirming care for minors, though that case deals with different aspects of the law than medical treatment for incarcerated people.
For now, transgender rights advocates are celebrating the ruling as a win.
Human Rights Campaign’s Georgia Director Bentley Hudgins said HRC and other groups mobilized thousands to oppose the bill as unconstitutional and a waste of money.
“It will bring more financial burdens to the State of Georgia and take valuable time away from solving actual issues,” Hudgins said. “Over $4.1 million has already been paid to settle cases like these. The House Democrats walked out on this bill because they saw it for what it was – undignified, expensive discrimination. It is my hope that when we return to the Gold Dome in January that our colleagues of all parties focus on bringing solutions to keep the hungry fed, expand access to health care and address the ever-rising cost of living.”
On the first day of his second term in office, President Donald Trump issued an executive order targeting federal recognition of transgender rights across various fields, including within prisons. The order prevents transgender women from being housed in women’s detention facilities and stops federal funds from being used for gender-affirming treatments.
Those rulings are being challenged in multiple court cases.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-1245003810-scaled-1-1024x698.jpg,,,2025-12-08 17:57:08.017363

Chellie Pingree on Dec. 8, 2025. (Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree of Maine left a months-awaited tour of the U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement facility in Maine on Monday still without an answer as to why some attorneys have not been permitted to accompany their clients to routine check-ins at the facility.
ICE officials handed off these visits to an independent contractor called BI Incorporated, whose representatives were not present for the tour, though Pingree said she had requested the contractor be there. BI Incorporated supplies government agencies, including ICE, with electronic monitoring technology, such as GPS ankle monitors and the SmartLINK app to keep tabs on people via their phones.
“While we took all the time we possibly could to tour the facility, see the detention facilities, and ask every question we could, all of our questions have not been answered,” Pingree told press outside the facility in Scarborough, “and we will continue to pursue them.”
BI Incorporated did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In late September, the 1st District Democrat sent a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem requesting a tour of the field office — an administrative office building with three, short-term holding cells — following reports of attorneys being blocked from accompanying clients to routine ICE appointments there. Pingree is planning to send a follow up letter detailing her concerns after the visit on Monday. 
While the contractor was not in attendance, Pingree said she saw the office where the check-ins are held and was told by the ICE officials giving the tour that there were space limitations to bringing an attorney. “That’s just bullshit,” Pingree said. “There’s plenty of room in there.”
Melissa Brennan, co-legal director of the Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project, Maine’s only state-wide immigration legal services organization, was one of the attorneys who was denied access. 
“As has become the norm, there was a complete lack of transparency from ICE as to what the appointment was about and what my client and I could expect,” Brennan said of the appointment that occurred in early summer. “I had filed paperwork in advance identifying myself as his attorney, but when we arrived here at the ICE office, I was denied access to come inside with him.”
Brennan said her client was questioned despite her absence and ended up signing documents that enrolled him in an alternative to detention program in which he would have his whereabouts monitored. 
“He didn’t even understand what he was signing,” Brennan said. “I think what’s really most important is that people are deprived of that opportunity to consult with someone, to feel the assurance of having your legal counsel next to you just as much as it is about ultimate legal consequences.”
Brennan said she hopes Pingree’s oversight and the efforts of other elected officials across the country will help put an end to this type of unchecked power. Pingree said there are three documented cases of legal counsel being denied access to ICE check-ins at the Scarborough facility but noted the possibility of others. 
“People may not always report that they don’t get to bring in their attorney because they’re confused or baffled, or they’re moved to detention,” Pingree said. “One of the biggest challenges is that people are often moved to detention in another state and we aren’t able to track them down.” 
In response to a request for comment on the reports about attorneys being denied access, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin accused Pingree of “lying for likes and fundraising dollars.”
McLaughlin wrote in an emailed statement that allegations of attorneys being blocked from immigration appointments are false. “These types of smears are contributing to our officers facing a 1,000% increase in assaults against them,” McLaughlin wrote, repeating a figure often asserted by the Trump administration that is not backed up by court records.  
The number of assaults on ICE agents have increased, but there is no public evidence that the spike is as dramatic as the federal government has claimed.
Pingree also asked Noem in the letter whether a policy exists prohibiting legal counsel from attending routine ICE appointments, and if it does, its legal justification. DHS sent back what Pingree described as a “terse” response, comparable in content to the one the agency sent Maine Morning Star accusing Pingree of lying for political gain. 
When asked to comment on this part of the letter, McLaughlin said, “DHS responds to official correspondence through official channels.”

Dan McKee continues to attack his Democratic primary rival Helena Buonanno Foulkes over her professional and personal ties to pharmaceutical companies that contributed to the opioid crisis. (Left photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current; right photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee continues to attack 2026 Democratic rival Helena Buonanno Foulkes for her personal and professional ties to the pharmaceutical industry.
The latest jab from the McKee campaign came in the midst of a Monday luncheon fundraiser for Foulkes, hosted by her uncle, former U.S. Sen. Chris Dodd.
The private luncheon for Foulkes was held at The University Club on the East Side of Providence, with tickets for attendees ranging from $500 to $2,000 — the maximum annual contribution to political candidates under state law. Dodd was listed on the event flyer as a special guest, alongside dozens of other prominent names in state politics and business circles who are backing Foulkes in the 2026 Democratic gubernatorial primary. 
A fixture in Democratic politics, Dodd represented his home state of Connecticut for two decades in the U.S. Senate, until 2011, and is the partial namesake of the famous Wall Street reform law, the “Dodd-Frank Act.” 
But McKee’s campaign offers a different descriptor of Dodd: “Purdue Pharma ally.”
And the governor’s campaign says Dodd’s involvement in a fundraiser for Foulkes is further proof of her ties to the “very insiders who enabled Purdue’s rise.”
“Helena Foulkes and Chris Dodd both had a choice when it came to Purdue Pharma and the Sacklers — and they both chose profits over saving lives,” Christina Freundlich, McKee’s campaign spokesperson, said in a statement Monday. “This once again speaks to the troubling record of Helena Foulkes and her ties to the elite who defend the system that enabled heinous crimes. We deserve a governor who will stand up to corporate greed, protect lives and put the people of Rhode Island first.”
The opioid epidemic, and Foulkes’ potential involvement as a former CVS executive, was a central topic in the 2022 gubernatorial primary, which featured Foulkes, McKee and three other Democratic candidates. McKee bested Foulkes in the primary by a 3-percentage-point margin. 
But in the 2026 rematch, Foulkes appears to hold a slight advantage over McKee among prospective Democratic voters, according to preliminary polls. Foulkes also leads McKee in campaign fundraising as of Oct. 31, the most recent campaign finance reporting deadline. 
Jon Romano, a spokesperson for Foulkes’ campaign, pointed to McKee’s unfavorable polling numbers in a response to the criticism over the fundraiser.
“Dan McKee is polling at 11% because he has been a weak, incompetent governor who has no argument for why he deserves an unprecedented third term,” Romano said in an emailed response Monday. “So instead he attacks Helena’s uncle for hosting a fundraising event for her. McKee is once again disparaging CVS, Rhode Island’s largest employer, while deliberately ignoring the truth that under Helena’s leadership, CVS reduced opioid sales by nearly 40% and was a national leader in tackling the opioid epidemic.”
Recent voter surveys also reiterate McKee’s waning popularity and continued public dissatisfaction over his handling of the Washington Bridge project. 
Foulkes has made McKee’s perceived missteps over the infrastructure project a key point of her challenge against him.
Yet McKee’s campaign remains stuck on Foulkes’ ties to CVS, fueled by a federal lawsuit unsealed in late 2024 which alleges the pharmacy company worsened the opioid crisis by filling fake prescriptions for opioids and other controlled substances. The 97-page complaint never mentioned Foulkes by name. Hours before Foulkes’ 2026 campaign announcement in September, McKee’s campaign released a digital ad on YouTube, with a corresponding website, again centered on the Department of Justice lawsuit and Foulkes’ role in the opioid crisis. 
The 97-page federal lawsuit never mentions Foulkes by name. 
McKee’s latest attack against Foulkes and Dodd relies primarily on reporting by GoLocalProv, which claims to have been investigating the opioid crisis since 2017. The headlines are damning. A story from Jan. 21, 2025, declares “INVESTIGATION: Foulkes Made Tens of Millions at CVS While She Rode Profits From Opioid Epidemic. However, the public documents cited in the article do not directly link Foulkes to the legal allegations against Purdue Pharma or CVS over the opioid epidemic. Another GoLocal story about Dodd highlights a comment he made in defense of Purdue during a 2002 U.S. Senate hearing. 
McKee’s campaign also links to a 2009 New York Times article entitled “Dodd’s Uneasy Dance with Drug Lobbyists,” which scrutinizes his close relationship with pharmaceutical industry groups, including Purdue Pharma. Dodd received hundreds of thousands of dollars in advertisements for his political campaigns during his time in office, alongside attending swanky lobbyist-sponsored fundraising events. But, in the article, his campaign manager and aides said these relationships did not sway Dodd’s position on health care legislation. 
Gregory Stevens, who owns a trio of local Italian restaurants, has also filed paperwork to run in the 2026 Democratic gubernatorial primary.
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi is widely speculated as a fourth potential Democratic candidate for governor, although he has not confirmed it. Three Republicans —  Aaron Guckian, an aide to former Gov. Don Carcieri; retired comedian Elaine Pelino and local businessman Robert Raimondo — have also entered the 2026 gubernatorial race.

Andy Beshear to issue a moratorium on utility disconnections. (Provided)A coalition of advocacy groups is urging Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear to halt utility disconnections in Kentucky until March.
The groups, led by the advocacy campaign Kentuckians for Energy Democracy, gathered Monday morning in front of the state Capitol in Frankfort urging Beshear to issue a moratorium amid an uncertain future for federal funding for housing, heating and food assistance.
The groups made a similar call to action during the record-long federal government shutdown earlier this year. 
A release from the coalition — which includes the Metropolitan Housing Coalition, the Kentucky Conservation Committee, Sierra Club Kentucky, VOCAL-KY, Kentuckians for the Commonwealth and others — states “a reprieve from the recent government shutdown doesn’t change the dire situation that many people are facing this winter amidst rising electricity and other costs.”
“And no one should have to choose between groceries, buying medicine, or keeping the heat on. Yet, Kentucky continues to have no statewide utility disconnection policy for extreme weather conditions,” the coalition wrote in a media release. 
Some of the advocacy groups during past legislative sessions in Frankfort have been supporting state legislation that would prevent disconnections during extreme weather. During this year’s legislative session, a Democratic-sponsored bill to limit when utilities could disconnect a customer, including on what the temperature is outside, did not advance in the GOP-controlled legislature. 
Cara Cooper, the coordinator for Kentuckians for Energy Democracy, previously told the Lantern that Beshear has the power to issue a moratorium through executive order similar to an order he issued in the beginning months of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Cooper in a Lantern interview after the rally said the groups plan to advocate for utility disconnection protections heading into next year’s legislative session. 
“Every week that we stall on this, more people are at risk,” Cooper said, mentioning the cold weather Kentucky is experiencing this week. “We will continue to work on this issue because it remains really important.”
The amount of federal funding approved by the GOP-controlled Congress for various social safety net programs still remains to be seen, though the Trump administration has proposed eliminating a federal program that provides billions of dollars nationwide to help low-income people afford heating and cooling costs. Kentuckians received tens of millions of dollars in funding through the Low-income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP in the last fiscal year.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/8657713191777181706-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-08 17:57:08.017363

With costs increasing and revenues failing to meet projections, the state health plan’s reserve account will fall below its target in January 2028, consultants told health plan trustees last week. 
A looming deficit pushed the State Health Plan trustees to increase beneficiaries’ insurance premiums, out-of-pocket costs, and copays for 2026. The premium increase was the first in years. For the first time, premiums will be pegged to employee salaries. 
The health plan is still on firmer financial footing than it has been in the past, state officials told reporters last week. The plan won’t be running a deficit in 2026 or 2027 as was once projected, said Tom Friedman, State Health Plan executive administrator.
But more changes are coming to the insurance plan that covers about 750,000 state employees, teachers, retirees, and dependents. 
The health plan trustees are scheduled to vote on benefits changes in March and on premium increases for 2027 in July. 
The North Carolina Association of Educators opposed the 2026 premium hikes. Another increase for 2027 would amount to a pay cut for educators, President Tamika Walker Kelly said in a statement.
“Their wages have been stagnant for years—already lagging behind neighboring states and well below the national average,”her statement said.  “Now, on top of inflation and a rising cost of living, they’re being asked to shoulder yet another financial burden. Educators do exceptional work in our schools, and they deserve to see the value of that work reflected in both their pay and their benefits.”
After trustees heard a presentation on health plan finances Dec. 5, Friedman said the health plan needs to move more aggressively to lower costs for the plan and for beneficiaries.
“This is a cost problem,” he said. “We have to drive those costs down so we can continue to invest in health.”
Part of attacking that problem will involve creating more financial incentives for beneficiaries to use lower-cost providers, he said.
“There are a lot of areas where there are significant variants in cost that are not driven by quality,” he said. “We have to make it affordable and simple for members to go to lower-cost, high quality providers.”
Using medical imaging — MRIs and other diagnostic scans — as an example, the health plan could save money if more enrollees used free-standing radiology centers rather than getting those scans in hospitals, he said. The plan would have to offer financial incentives to beneficiaries to draw them to the free-standing offices, and would have to negotiate lower costs with the providers in exchange for higher patient volume. 
“We don’t need a lot of movement to save tens of millions of dollars in this area,” he said. 
That strategy could work in the Triangle, where free-standing medical imaging offices are clustered. But those independent offices aren’t available in and around Mecklenburg County, so health plan administrators will need to use a different strategy there.
 Some rural counties have no imaging options nearby. The health plan may need to contract with mobile imaging services to cover rural areas. 
The health plan started to build a “preferred provider” network this year, where hundreds of providers have agreed to bundled payments to cover costs of procedures, rather than billing separately for each step in medical treatment. Primary care is the best developed arm of the network, with providers statewide participating, according to a Health Plan map. 
An important step in broadening the network will be adding more OB-GYNs and making “better maternity bundles to make it more affordable to have a baby in North Carolina,” Friedman said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_4691-1-1024x591.jpg,,,2025-12-08 17:57:08.017363

(Jacob Reeder/LSU Sports Information)  A Louisiana Legislature task force on name, image and likeness deals for student-athletes is suggesting the state create new laws to regulate agents and sponsorships for high school athletes. 
Its members met Monday and recommended expanding the definition of an agent to include people involved in securing NIL deals for athletes. The group also recommended the Louisiana attorney general require background checks and mandatory training on NIL activities for registered agents. 
Name, image and likeness deals for high school athletes are currently not addressed in state law. The task force has suggested legislation to require parental consent for minors to sign sponsorships and prohibit deals with certain industries, such as adult entertainment and alcoholic beverages. The task force also recommended regulating the NIL-related work students can do during school hours and during school-related events. 
The task force also wants to pursue legislation that would require underaged athletes deposit a portion of their compensation into a protected trust account, similar to a current state law for child actors.

State Rep. Tehmi Chassion, D-Lafayette, who sits on the task force, said the legislation would likely be carried either by him or Rep. Rashid Young, D-Homer, a former Grambling State football player who chairs the task force and authored the resolution that created it. 
Chassion said any legislation would need the blessing of Gov. Jeff Landry and Republican legislators. 
The task force also recommended the creation of a separate study group to analyze the funding structures of athletics departments at Louisiana’s public colleges and universities. Although LSU earns enough money from its football program to finance the rest of its sports teams, athletics departments at every other state university operate at a loss. Their programs require financial support from the universities and, at times, contribute to severe financial problems at the schools. 
Lawmakers approved a bill this year that increases the state tax on sports gambling to give some of the money to state college athletics programs. Each school will receive approximately $2 million annually from the program starting next year. 
In addition to its legislative goals, the task force recommended universities educate student-athletes about mental health and create policies prohibiting international athletes from engaging in NIL deals until there is federal guidance on the topic. 
International student-athletes, who must obtain visas to attend school in the United States, have prohibitions against outside employment or participating in any income-generating activities. Those who receive sponsorship deals risk losing their legal status to be in the country. 
The task force also recommended that universities consider the Title IX implications when creating NIL policies and revenue sharing. This summer, a federal judge approved a settlement in the case House v. NCAA that will allow schools to pay their student-athletes directly. Many colleges that do not make a profit with their athletics program will still pay their players to maintain a competitive advantage. 
Title IX requires equity in educational access, including offering athletic scholarships proportionate to the gender balance in enrollment. It does not require equal spending on men’s and women’s programs. 
In Louisiana, LSU, Grambling, Northwestern, Southeastern and the University of Louisiana at Lafayette are participating in revenue sharing. 
The task force recommended schools update their NIL policies by August 2026. Any new legislation would likely be filed in the upcoming regular legislative session that begins March 9 and concludes June 1. Any legislation passed would likely be implemented the following August or January.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/LSU-CWS--1024x683.webp,,,2025-12-08 17:57:08.017363

Local communities around the country are seeking more input on where and how data centers are built. (Photo by Nathan Howard/Getty Images)Members of the public have until noon on Wednesday, Dec. 10 to submit public comments that could help shape how data centers and their connected microgrids operate in the state of West Virginia.
The public comment period on proposed rules for House Bill 2014 comes as the construction of several microgrid-powered data center complexes move forward in the state. Several of these proposals — including those in Mason, Mingo and Tucker counties — have sparked local pushback and community concerns over how the complexes could impact public health, air quality, water resources, tourism economies and more.
The influx in data center-related projects in West Virginia follows the passage of HB 2014 during the 2025 regular legislative session. That bill created a specialized tax structure to incentivize data center companies to locate in West Virginia and build their own power sources, most often through natural gas power plants. 
The legislation means that counties where a data center is located will only receive 30% of the property tax revenue from the facilities despite bearing the brunt of all environmental or economic impacts the data centers and power plants could bring. Another 50% of the property tax revenue will go to the state’s Personal Income Tax Reduction Fund, while 10% will be disbursed to the 54 other counties split on a per capita basis using the most recent U.S. Census, 5% will be placed in the Economic Enhancement Grant Fund administered by the Water Development Authority and the final 5% will be put in the newly created Electric Grid Stabilization and Security Fund.
In addition to diverting the property tax revenues, HB 2014 also allows companies to curtail local zoning ordinances, meaning local governments have no control or say in how the facilities operate within their communities. That provision has caused upset at the local level, and last month state Senate President Randy Smith told some of his constituents in Tucker County that the lack of local control is something his members “want to address” with legislation this upcoming session.
Smith voted in support of HB 2014. He said last month that while he had concerns over the legislation, it would have been “hard on [his] political career to kill a governor’s bill.”
Since HB 2014’s passage this April, environmental advocates from around the state have been organizing to understand more about proposed projects and push the state Department of Environmental Protection to practice transparency when companies apply for permits.
In the public comment period, advocates are urging the public to request that the state implement a public and transparent process for microgrids and data centers who apply for permitting to build and locate here. They want to see applicants publicly provide more detailed information regarding environmental and community impacts from the facilities, which is information that has often been redacted in air quality permit applications due to alleged trade secrets. These impact reports, they say, should be independently conducted and verified.
Advocates say the companies that apply to build and operate certified microgrids and data centers should also be required to negotiate directly with local governments over community benefit agreements. While broad, that could mean seeing the applicants support public services — including schools, police and emergency medical services — that they will also rely on if moving into the communities.
While the public comment period ends Wednesday, advocates are asking the state Division of Economic Development to hold an in-person, public hearing before the rules are finalized. 
Comments on the proposed rules can be emailed to the general counsel for the state Department of Commerce at Garner.Marks@WV.gov before noon on Wednesday. They can also be mailed to A. Garner Marks, 1900 Kanawha Blvd., Building 3, Suite 800, Charleston, WV 25305.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-08 21:56:51+00:00,CT Mirror,Lamont frames controversial housing bill as key to an affordable CT,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/08/lamont-housing-bill-8002/,The ceremonial signing of HB8002 was a part of a campaign narrative casting the governor’s June veto of a housing bill as key to its revision.,"At a ceremonial signing of an omnibus housing bill opposed by every Republican in the General Assembly and the two GOP candidates for governor, Gov. Ned Lamont embraced the measure Monday as a step toward addressing a housing crisis central to the high cost of living in Connecticut.
“Well, you’re not serious about affordability unless you’re serious about housing, and housing starts with a diversity of housing where all of our folks can afford to step up, step down, but have a place they can call home,” said Lamont, a Democrat seeking a third term in 2026.
Lamont spoke at Oak Grove, a new 69-unit apartment complex in Norwalk open to renters earning between $45,000 and $179,120 annually. With a community center that provides free after-school care to K-5 children, the complex caters to working parents in one of the most expensive corners of a high-cost state.
The ceremony was an element of a campaign narrative casting the governor’s surprising veto in June of an earlier version of the bill as key to the subsequent revisions drafted in consultation with Republican and Democratic municipal officials, several of whom stood with Lamont to praise the outcome.
After the opposing the original version, the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities and Council of Small Towns endorsed House Bill 8002, the version passed in a special session last month. Key provisions require municipalities to set goals for housing growth and provide incentives to meet them.
To lower costs and streamline permitting, the law eliminates minimum off-street parking requirements for new developments with up to 16 housing units and sets parameters allowing conversion of commercial properties to residential without special hearings before planning and zoning commissions.
State Sen. Ryan Fazio of Greenwich and former Mayor Erin Stewart of New Britain, who are competing for the GOP gubernatorial nomination, joined Republican lawmakers in branding the law as undermining local zoning control of the state’s 169 cities and towns.
“Look, it’s a political football for the candidates, no question about it,” Lamont said. “For me, it was important to get the mayors and first selectmen on board on a bipartisan basis. We got that done. And I think at the end of the day, you make the case to the people: this is really important for their kids, important for our economic future.”
Michael J. Freda, a Republican in his ninth term as first selectman of North Haven, said municipal officials of both parties accepted the governor’s invitation to negotiate a compromise that constructively encourages housing development without undermining local control.
“I’m starting to hear, even in my area, that the bill is a bad bill. ‘We’re going to lose local control.’ I can tell each and every one of you here, we’re not going to lose local control. I can guarantee you that,” Freda said. “And if anybody has any questions, you can call me at North Haven Town Hall.”
Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, a prominent force behind passage, as was House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford, said Republicans wrongly assume that the bill is a liability for Democrats.
“I think the Republicans are on the wrong side of this issue, because you see all across the nation where Republican legislatures are leading on housing, and they have done things that are far more radical than anything we would ever consider even doing,” Duff said.
More than a dozen states have enacted housing laws since 2022. 
Common provisions include mandates that limit local review by setting standards for what can be built as-right, a push to allow duplexes, triplexes and other modest multi-family housing in single-family zones, incentives for higher-density projects near transit lines, and rules easing the the redevelopment of underused commercial properties as housing.
“This is a political loser for anybody who voted against the bill,” Duff said “Housing is important for seniors. It’s important for our middle-class families, important for our recent college graduates.”
Some of the Democratic lawmakers attending the ceremony were from wealthy suburban districts, including Sen. Ceci Maher of Wilton and Reps. Lucy Dathan of New Canaan, Elena Kavros DeGraw of Avon and Cristin McCarthy Vahey of Fairfield.
Republican lawmakers remain opposed.
“Democrats have said this bill will make our state more affordable, jump-start our economy, and today even billed it as a solution to homelessness,” said House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford. “When you promise everything to everyone, the reality is nobody gets what they’re expecting. The idea that giving private equity developers free rein will solve these problems is wishful thinking.”
Rep. Tony Scott of Monroe, the ranking House Republican on the Housing Committee, said other housing measures are sure to follow.
“This is not the end of the discussion around housing reform. In a virtual conference last month, the committee chairs announced their intent to resurrect proposals on no-fault evictions and prohibiting landlords from reviewing a prospective tenant’s criminal history. Both measures could have a chilling effect on an already strained housing market,” he said.
Also in attendance were community housing advocates furious at Lamont’s veto, which they say was him bowing to opponents who organized opposition on social media.
“We’re not always the loudest people in the public hearing or on the Facebook page, but the pro-homes movement is strong and vibrant in Connecticut. Our voices matter,” said Peter Harrison, the Connecticut director of the tristate Regional Plan Association.
He thanked supporters who had lobbied the governor, as well as Lamont for delivering on a promise to produce a substantive law.
“This is your victory, as much as it is anyone behind you,” Harrison said to advocates, then glancing at Lamont. “I do want to thank the governor for keeping his word, for getting all of us back together and getting a compromise bill.”
The Regional Plan’s affiliate is Desegregate Connecticut, which made clear after the veto that Lamont was not welcome at a national “YIMBYtown” conference it hosted in September in New Haven.
Harrison smiled Monday and noted there was “a little bit of a detour where the governor, you know, couldn’t make it.” But he was happy to stand with him on Monday.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_9194-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-12-08 16:57:57.471005

“What we have seen is that we have a lame duck governor and I think that the Legislature has taken back some of its co-equal power as a branch of government,” Senate Democratic Leader Lori Berman, of Boca Raton, said during a news conference in the Capitol Monday. “And I’m hopeful that as this session goes on, we in the House and the Senate in both parties are able to work together and do things that really do affect affordability and that affect peoples’ lives.”

Berman called affordability her caucus’ top priority this session. With a Republican super-majority, Democrats can’t pass legislation on their own.
“Prices are rising, period. And we are seeing Republican politicians pander to D.C. and squabble amongst themselves instead of fixing the problem, so Democrats are offering ideas,” House Democratic Leader Fentrice Driskell, of Tampa, said.
The leaders laid out three bills as their priorities this session.
HB 319/SB 366 would create a property insurance compact between at least 14 states, forming a risk pool for coverage. Rep. Kelly Skidmore, a Democrat from Boca Raton and the House bill’s sponsor, compared it to the National Flood Insurance Program. 
“Families are struggling, some can’t afford the cost of home ownership anymore. If we don’t tackle the risk that is driving this crisis, we will threaten that home ownership, economic growth, and the stability of our entire insurance system,” Skidmore said. 
The other housing-focused bill is HB 675/SB 756. the Housing Options Made For Everyone (HOME) Act would eliminate documentary stamp taxes for certain first-time homebuyers and build off the Live Local Act from 2023, a more-than-$700 million bipartisan measure building more workforce housing. 
“By easing just one of the up-front costs, we’re giving people a fair shot at buying their first home and starting the next chapter of their lives,” Sen. Tracie Davis, a Democrat from Jacksonville and the Senate version’s sponsor, said.
SB 780 is the caucus’ third focus, which it says will “refocus Florida’s government” by identifying “wasteful spending.” 
The bill specifically asks for investigations into high-profile items including the Everglades immigrant detention facility also known as “Alligator Alcatraz”; per student spending at New College of Florida; state spending on campaigns against proposed constitutional amendments legalizing recreational marijuana and expanding abortion access; and Hope Florida.
The bill calls for the Auditor General, Government Efficiency Task Force, and the Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability to “prepare a report identifying fraud, waste, abuse of authority, malfeasance, mismanagement, and misconduct in state government.”
The bill calls for the attorney general to pursue legal remedies if the report finds wrongdoing. Attorney General James Uthmeier was appointed by DeSantis to that position and previously worked in the governor’s office.

Notably, Democrats do not include eliminating property taxes in their agenda. Republicans, including Gov. Ron DeSantis, are focusing heavily on crafting ballot language to eliminate or limit property taxes for homesteaded properties.
“What we feel is that people aren’t complaining about the property taxes, they’re complaining about the property insurance and about being able to afford things here in this state,” Berman said. “Property taxes are going to have a direct impact on the services people receive and we don’t want people to have less services here in this state.”
The session begins Jan. 13.
“Despite the president calling it a hoax, we all see with our own eyes that the affordability crisis is real, it’s hurting Floridians, and yes, it is getting worse,” Berman said.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_7905-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-12-08 16:57:57.471005

Unionized faculty had a two-day strike in November, a rarity for Pennsylvania's community colleges. (Whitney Downard/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)With frustration mounting, unionized faculty at a central Pennsylvania community college came to an unusual decision in the early days of November this year: they were going to pressure HACC administrators at the negotiating table by leaving their classrooms for a two-day strike.
But while nearly every community college in Pennsylvania has a union, picketing professors are a rarity in the commonwealth. 
Such collective action doesn’t happen on a whim, as Chris Lilienthal told the Capital-Star. Lilienthal works as the assistant director of communications with the Pennsylvania State Education Association, which represents roughly 1,000 local union associations at K-12 schools and community colleges. 
Harrisburg Area Community College
“Strikes are very rare, both in the community college setting or the higher education setting, as well as in the K-12 setting,” said Lilienthal, speaking generally. “It’s really a situation where the negotiators on the teachers (or) faculty side have really hit a wall and they’re not getting anywhere with the school or college.” 
The full union membership votes on whether to pursue a strike — a decision union chapters at HACC and Luzerne County Community College made last month. But while HACC’s professors spent two days striking, unionized faculty at Luzerne Community College avoided such action when contract negotiations restarted. 
Similarly, the Community College of Philadelphia was able to reach a contract with faculty before a strike occurred last spring. 
“Our members, they don’t want to go on strike; they want to be in the classroom,” said Lilienthal. 
Lilienthal said negotiations for first contracts with new unions can often be lengthy, but called the three-and-a-half year process at HACC “very unusual.” The community college has campuses in Harrisburg, Lancaster, York, Gettysburg and Lebanon.
Negotiations took several, contentious turns, including arrests, alleged violations of transparency laws and accusations of union-busting. 
Despite the rocky road, union president Christine Nowik said she’d do it again. 
“I would absolutely advise it. I advise it for any industry at this point. Collective power is, at this point, the only power,” Nowik told the Capital-Star. 
Nowik, an English professor at HACC’s York campus, became president roughly one month ago, just before the strike began.
For their part, HACC administrators said they were “grateful” to reach the agreement, which was unanimously approved by the Board of Trustees last week. Most releases since the Oct. 2 vote by the union authorizing the executive committee to strike have included minimal updates, instead emphasizing the following “core principles” in a contract:

Prioritizing student success
Supporting the affordability of its offerings
Providing all employees with comparable benefits
Increasing wages for all employees while ensuring fiscal stability, as outlined in the College’s strategic plan 

 Background

The National Center for the Study of Collective Bargaining in Higher Education and the Professions reports that the number of unionized faculty grew 7.5% between 2012 and 2024, while graduate student employee unionization increased by 133%.
The center, based out of Hunter College in New York City, tabulated 902 collective bargaining units in higher education into a lengthy directory, including student and staff agreements. Each state governs and funds their community college system in a unique manner, complicating efforts to neatly categorize schools. 
The states with the highest numbers of unionized faculty are California (93,705), New York (87,848) and New Jersey (25,549). Over three-quarters of Hawaii’s faculty (76%) have union representation. 
Pennsylvania has 17,786 faculty members that are part of a union, roughly 26% of all faculty. 
Faculty members at public, two-year institutions – like HACC – were slightly more likely to belong to a union than not — whereas public and private schools were the opposite. Fifty-two percent of faculty at two-year institutions belong to a union, compared to 33% of public, four-year faculty members and 8% of those teaching at private schools. 
According to the center’s directory, just one of the commonwealth’s 15 community colleges doesn’t have a faculty union: Erie County Community College.

The Pennsylvania State Education Association represents six community colleges, while the remaining eight schools have affiliates under the state chapter of the American Federation of Teachers.
Lilienthal said salaries and benefits were common motivations for organizing, whether at a community college or a K-12 school, alongside working conditions like classroom sizes. 
“They’ve put a lot of time and a lot of money into becoming those professionals and into building those professional credentials. They deserve to be paid commensurate with that,” said Lilienthal. 
The union at HACC represents faculty members at all five campuses. Though compensation and benefits played a role in the decision to form a collective bargaining unit, Nowik said working conditions became “untenable,” pointing at HACC administrators. 
“The trajectory of this style of leadership has not been a good fit for the organization,” said Nowik. “It’s morally injurious for us not to push back on the things that we know are directly harmful to students.”
 Moving forward

Pennsylvania has a long history with the labor movement and remains a strong union enclave, allowing for collective bargaining under both the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Act and the Public Employee Relations Act. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that 12.4% of working Pennsylvanians are represented by a union. 
Despite this familiarity, Nowik said that central Pennsylvania didn’t have the same approach, contributing to the list of reasons why HACC is one of the last schools to unionize, despite being the largest and oldest community college in the state.

Most peer schools appear to have established their collective bargaining units back in the 1970s. 
“This faculty here has been so beaten down and stripped of any voice and power. That feels very disconcerting; it feels very unsettling,” said Nowik. 
Union membership has been falling nationwide for decades, but Nowik said she believed that Generation Z would turn the tide, in part due to frustrations related to power inequality and wage disparities. 
“If you are not looking at that landscape and seeing that the only pathway to sustainability for our public institutions is through collective action, then you need to do your research,” said Nowik.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_7977-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-12-08 16:57:57.471005

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)After packing galleries and hallways at the Utah State Capitol, organizing and gathering signatures to repeal a law that would ban public unions from collective bargaining, unions shared a moment of relief Monday morning after Legislative leaders announced their intent to vote to repeal the controversial law in a special session on Tuesday. 
Surrounded by peers from different organizations representing Utah teachers, local government employees, police officers, municipal workers and more, Scott Stephenson, executive director of the Utah Fraternal Order of Police said he was “optimistically happy that this could potentially happen tomorrow.”

“The referendum. All the signatures. Over 5,000 volunteers, 320,000 signatures in 30 days. That’s awesome,” Stephenson said. “That’s not a message. That’s an indictment to the Legislature. Going into these negotiations, knowing that 320,000 people support us, gave us a lot of leverage.”
With enough signatures confirmed, controversial union law put on hold

Protect Utah Workers, a coalition of public and private unions that pushed hard to repeal the law, had been in negotiations with lawmakers for the past month and a half, Stephenson said.
“To their credit, they listened to us and they agreed with us that this is what needs to happen,” he said.
The legislation was scheduled to become effective in July, but was put on hold as unions quickly surpassed the signature threshold for a ballot initiative that could have repealed the bill. 
Gov. Spencer Cox signed the bill within days of it passing. However, in a social media post Sunday, Cox said he supports the repeal.
“(I) appreciate the Legislature’s work to refocus this conversation to ensure government is doing its best to support our first responders, educators, and all those who serve our state,” he wrote.
Utah Senate President Stuart Adams and House Speaker Mike Schultz announced Sunday night that the Legislature would consider repealing HB267, titled Public Sector Labor Union Amendments, during the special session scheduled Tuesday.
“It’s clear that the heated debate around these issues has created unnecessary division, which was never the intent,” Adams and Schultz said in a release. “Repealing the bill allows us to reset the discussion and move forward to ensure we get this right.”
Now, the release says, legislative leaders and the unions are committed to working together in good faith on future proposals. 



Let us know what you think...


 


If HB267 had become effective, it would have prohibited public sector unions from negotiating terms of employment with their employers, an action that union members described as an existential threat. Proponents, however, said the bill would protect taxpayer dollars and give all public employees a voice, not just union members. 
It was the third year legislators had made a proposal aiming to change how public unions negotiate contracts with their employers. 
Renée Pinkney, president of the Utah Education Association, the state’s largest teachers’ union, said on Monday she expects the Legislature to repeal the bill during the special session. However, she doesn’t think this will be the end of the unions’ fight.
“We’ll be working together (with legislators) in a work group in order to move forward,” Pinkney said. 
If lawmakers vote to repeal the bill on Tuesday, they will be doing the same thing that would have happened at the polls, Pinkney said. 
“We know that this is a win for the voters, and it’s a win for all of the volunteers. We had 5,000 volunteers who helped us gather signatures,” Pinkney said. “The resources that were expended, time, people and money, we are just incredibly appreciative of all of those people who helped us, and we are appreciative that the Legislature listened to those people.”
While union leaders are happy with the outcome, they have also received comments from concerned voters, who worry that had the question gone to the ballot in 2026, it would have provided stronger protections to unions, especially with the Utah Supreme Court decision on an anti-gerrymandering lawsuit, that said “an initiative is constitutionally protected from government infringement.”
“That’s some of the comments I’ve been given because you have the redistricting issue, that’s a very important issue for people to get involved in,” Stephenson said. “And they were just hoping that there’s one less thing that they have to worry about.”
The ballot initiative may no longer be an issue in the 2026 midterms, Stephenson said, but with other questions and elections on the line, he encourages Utahns to still show up at the polls to make their voices heard.

Jackley was chosen as president-elect Monday by the nation’s attorneys general at their annual meeting in Washington, D.C. He had been serving as vice president for the past year.
“I am honored to serve alongside my fellow attorneys general as we enforce our state laws and promote sound law enforcement policies for our communities,” Jackley said in a news release. “Serving in this leadership role will strengthen my ability to address issues on a national level that are important to South Dakota.”

Jackley was previously elected president of the group in 2015, and was the first South Dakota attorney general to lead the association. Members are the attorneys general of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, the commonwealths of Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands, and the territories of American Samoa, Guam and the Virgin Islands.
Connecticut Attorney General William Tong, who had been serving as president-elect, will be the association’s president for the coming year while Jackley serves as president-elect.
In the June 2026 primary election, Jackley is seeking the Republican nomination to run for South Dakota’s lone U.S. House seat. The current holder of the seat, Republican Rep. Dusty Johnson, is running for governor.
In a statement to South Dakota Searchlight, Jackley said he’s “focused on serving as the best attorney general I can be for South Dakota and president-elect of our nation’s attorneys general.” But, he added, “if blessed by the people of South Dakota, I will be a strong voice and leader for us in Congress.”
If Jackley wins the Republican nomination for U.S. House and also wins in the November 2026 general election, he would become a member of Congress in January 2027.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/NAAG-OFFICERS-2026-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-08 16:57:57.471005

(Getty Images)A startup that seeks to build the first-ever power grid in outer space has selected Albuquerque as its headquarters, the state Economic Development Department announced Monday.
Mantis Space, a Georgia-founded company that is backed by venture capital, plans to build orbital infrastructure capable of powering satellites and lunar operations, according to a news release. The new Albuquerque headquarters and research and development facilities are expected to generate as much as $480 million in economic impact over the next 10 years, the release said. Company officials expect to create more than 200 jobs with average annual salaries of more than $180,000. 
Company officials say they chose Albuquerque after a national search and weighed factors such as quality of life, access to talent and available economic incentives. The state is awarding the company $2.5 million under the Local Economic Development Act and Albuquerque is awarding it $500,000. 
“Albuquerque exceeded nearly all our criteria for our highly competitive selection and offered an extremely competitive package that was ultimately the key,” Mantis Space CEO Eric Truitt said in a statement. “We look forward to working together to make New Mexico a national leader in both space and advanced energy innovation.”
The state Economic Development Department in a release said orbital infrastructure is expected to pave the way for “off-planet data centers and manufacturing.”
High-tech projects have increasingly announced plans to open in New Mexico. In September, local officials approved plans for Project Jupiter, a campus of data centers planned to support the tech giants OpenAI and Oracle. That same month, Pacific Fusion, a California-based fusion energy company, announced plans to build a $1 billion research and manufacturing campus in Albuquerque. And in November, a California-based hypersonic missile company announced plans to open a 1,000-acre manufacturing plant in Sandoval County.
The state Economic Development Department in early December released a 158-page report that calls for further growth in science and technology fields including quantum systems, advanced energy and aerospace.
“New Mexico is rapidly becoming an anchor for our nation’s most advanced industries, as today’s exciting announcement demonstrates,” New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said in a statement. “With our world-class research institutions, unmatched talent, and growing network of innovative companies, our state is literally shaping the future.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/satelliteGettyImages-2198257968-1024x640.jpg,,,2025-12-08 16:57:57.471005

(Photo: charlottenc.gov)A second stabbing on Charlotte’s public transit system, this time by a man who was allegedly in the United States illegally, has drawn national attention as Republican leaders voice support for the immigration crackdown in the state.
On Dec. 5, Oscar Solarzano, 33, boarded a Blue Line light rail train at New Bern Station while intoxicated and began yelling at passengers, according to an arrest affidavit by Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police. When passenger Kenyon Dobie asked him to stop shouting, Solarzano allegedly confronted him and challenged him to a fight.
Dobie asked Solarzano to back away and then pushed him against a seat when he refused. Solarzano rose and drew a large knife from his pocket and allegedly stabbed Dobie in the chest, the affidavit states.
Solarzano allegedly fled the scene and was arrested shortly afterward, according to the affidavit. Officers stated that he confessed to the stabbing after being informed of his right to remain silent. Solarzano did not know Dobie prior to the incident.
Solarzano is charged with felony attempted murder and aggravated assault. The affidavit states that he was previously banned from Charlotte Area Transit System trains, resulting in an additional charge of breaking and entering.
The Charlotte Public Defender’s office, which is representing Solarzano, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Dobie wrote on a GoFundMe page that he has been hospitalized and the attack caused him to bleed into his lungs. “Luckily I survived but my body has taken plenty damage,” he wrote. “Please pray and help me with a better recovery.”
Dobie’s stabbing is the second high-profile act of violence on Charlotte’s transit system this year after the fatal stabbing of Ukrainian refugees Iryna Zarutska in September led to the passage of a strict crime bill known as “Iryna’s Law” tightening pre-trial release requirements and seeking to resume the death penalty.
That law took effect on Dec. 1, days before Dobie was stabbed. In a Monday morning order, a Mecklenburg County judge denied Solarzano bond and found that he could not be determined to have legal residence in the United States.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement issued a detainer order for Solarzano on the morning of Dec. 6, according to court records, finding that he is subject to a final order of removal and had illegally reentered the United States after a previous removal. A Mecklenburg County magistrate judge also noted that he had been deported previously.
The stabbing comes amid ongoing operations by Customs and Border Patrol and ICE throughout North Carolina, with more than 425 individuals detained in Charlotte since November. Republican leaders in the state and across the nation quickly circulated the story as proof of the need for better  immigration enforcement in the state.
“Another stabbing by an Illegal Migrant in Charlotte, North Carolina,” President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social Dec. 6. “What’s going on in Charlotte? Democrats are destroying it, like everything else, piece by piece!!!”
State Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) blamed Gov. Josh Stein for the attack, writing in a post on X that “Gov. Stein and the Democrats need to stop coddling criminal illegal aliens.”
North Carolina House Speaker Destin Hall said on social media that the attack is evidence Stein must do more to cooperate with Homeland Security operations in the state.
“The stabbing on the Charlotte light rail last night was committed by an illegal alien. @DHSgov is working to detain as many criminals as possible, but we need stronger cooperation from the “leaders” in our state,” Hall wrote. “@NC_Governor, it’s time to step up and do more to protect NC citizens.”
In a statement Monday afternoon, Stein spokesperson Olivia Weidie said that public safety is the Governor’s top priority and that he supports immigration enforcement.
“He has always said that violent criminals who entered our country illegally should be deported. This is no exception,” she wrote. “Governor Stein is committed to making sure people feel safe going about their daily lives, and he is grateful that Chief Patterson was already surging law enforcement throughout Charlotte with Operation Safe Season.”
Stein wrote in a social media post Dec. 5 that he has been in communication with Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police since the stabbing.
“Please join me in praying for the full recovery of the victim,” Stein wrote. “I am grateful to the state law enforcement agencies that are assisting the operation. Public safety is a top priority for us all.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/CATS-New-Bern-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-08 16:57:57.471005

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa Democrats largely agree that they want to return to their historical spot as an early state in the 2028 Democratic presidential nominating cycle, according to survey results released by the Iowa Democratic Party.
In August, IDP officials announced they were conducting a survey among Iowa Democratic voters about the future of the state’s Democratic presidential caucuses. The national party booted Iowa from its longtime first-in-the-nation position in the 2024 presidential nominating cycle. While Democratic National Committee officials have said they plan to change the nominating calendar ahead of 2028, 2020 reporting issues and Democrats’ concerns about caucuses being less accessible than primaries are hampering Iowa’s chances of regaining an early state spot in the new calendar.
But even if the DNC does not approve Iowa holding its caucuses early, the state party could still decide to hold an unsanctioned presidential nominating contest — a move New Hampshire, the longtime first-in-the-nation primary, took in 2024 when the national party had South Carolina lead the nominating calendar.

The results of the survey were released Saturday, when the IDP State Central Committee met to discuss the results as well as next steps for how to structure the caucuses in 2028 — and how to approach conversations with national Democrats about Iowa’s role in the nominating process. Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart thanked Iowans for participating in the survey in a video about the “first round”  of survey results.
“The bottom line is that Iowans must have an early role in the 2028 Democratic presidential nominating process,” Hart said. “And, our party-run process needs to be more accessible and inclusive. That’s what our fellow Democrats have said.”
According to the report submitted to the State Central Committee, 65.3% of the more than 750 Iowans surveyed said they want Iowa to be first or early in the nominating process. The largest portion of that group — 44.7% — said they want Iowa’s nominating contest to be first in the Democrats’ calendar, and 20.6% said they support Iowa being in the early window. The survey also found 12.6% Iowans said they support Iowa holding a contest on Super Tuesday or later, and 22% said they do not care when Iowa holds its contest.
Though the survey found Iowans want to hold a caucus early in the nominating cycle, 51.1% of Iowans said they do not believe Iowa should defy the DNC calendar, “even if it means Iowa is not in the early window.” Just over a third of respondents, 34.4%, said they support working through the DNC process of restructuring the nominating calendar but defying the calendar if Iowa’s plan is not accepted, similar to New Hampshire’s decision in 2024, while 14.4% said Iowa Democrats should give “no consideration” to the DNC process.
The report recommended the IDP seek a waiver to participate in the early contest window from the national party by Jan. 16, 2026 — the deadline for states to submit their request to the DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee — but details were not shared on further steps.
“There is still a long way to go before an early window calendar is finalized,” Hart said. “And there’s still a lot of conversations with the DNC and with my fellow Democrats that need to be had.”

Ann-Margaret Ferrante intends to run for the open 5th Essex District seat and a former Rockport selectwoman also plans to jump into the race.
Both Democrats filed papers Monday to set up candidate committees in the House district that includes Essex, Rockport, Manchester-by-the Sea and Gloucester. 
Ferrante, 53, died on Thanksgiving after a yearslong battle with pancreatic cancer. More than 1,600 people attended her funeral last week.
Dru Tarr, research and district director in Ferrante’s office, said he has the experience “to continue a legacy of service in delivering for the people of Cape Ann.”
A lifelong Gloucester resident, Tarr said his early supporters include Ferrante’s mother, two former Gloucester mayors, four city councilors, a school committee member and Register of Deeds Eileen Duff.
“I have spent the past nine years tutoring under the best mentor one could possibly have asked for,” Tarr wrote in a Facebook post. “Ann-Margaret Ferrante was not just my state rep, she was my teacher and friend. Every day with Ann-Margaret was a lesson. The legacy that she leaves is not just one of policies and programs, but of the people that she lifted up through her actions. I count myself fortunate to be among them.”
Tarr told the News Service Monday that he never considered running for public office.
“I really wish that my friend was still here to be the one doing the job,” he said.
With the 2026 elections set to unfold, Speaker Ron Mariano’s office on Monday did not respond to questions about a potential special election. State law does not specify a time frame to call for a special election. 
A special election was called on Dec. 7, 2023 to fill former Rep. Peter Durant’s seat after he won his Senate bid. Mariano’s office in February 2024 decided not to hold a special election to fill the vacancy left by Rep. Josh Cutler after he resigned to join the Healey administration. 
Sarah Wilkinson, who served on the Rockport Select Board for 18 years, intends to run for Ferrante’s seat. 
“At her beautiful funeral service yesterday State Senator Bruce Tarr encouraged those of us in attendance to move forward and share the light that Ann-Margaret was,” Wilkinson wrote in a Facebook post Friday afternoon. “His words were both inspiring and overwhelming to me. Inspiring because as many of you know, my whole life I have felt a calling to serve others and my community. That calling is now louder now than ever before. Overwhelming because Ann-Margaret leaves enormous shoes to fill as she was the true definition of a faithful and dedicated public servant.”
Wilkinson called Cape Ann “one of the most special places on Earth” and said she wanted to share her decision “as we wait for the release of the details of the Special election.”
Dru Tarr told the News Service that he had not heard any details about the timing for a special election but said it’s his “understanding” that “there would be one called.”
Ferrante was first elected to the 5th Essex seat in 2008. Before Ferrante, the 5th Essex House district was represented by Rep.

Amara and Nick followed separate dreams: speech therapy for her, real estate for him. With the support of mentors who helped them navigate their opportunities, both went west—building lives that are grounded in the values they grew up with.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Different roads, same roots: Twins from Pownal forge independent futures.","Amara and Nick with their mom at Amara’s wedding.
Amara Chester and Nick Armstrong are twins. They say that many assume they share the exact same interests—but when it came to their education and career, each followed their own path. 
They grew up in Pownal in the furthest southwest corner of the state. From a young age (thanks to a steady message from their mom), Amara and Nick knew that education could open doors for them. “Mom was clear she didn’t want us to stay in our hometown,” Nick said. “She wanted us to see the world. If we came back later, that was fine, but she wanted us to see something else first.” While their mom hadn’t gone to college herself, she encouraged the twins and their older sister to think out of their comfort zones when it came to their futures. 
So they did, stretching their wings to the west coast to pursue their passions. For Amara, it’s speech pathology. For Nick, it’s an entrepreneurial approach to real estate. 
Amara discovered speech pathology (and her future) in California 
In high school, Amara thought she might go into the medical field because she shared the mindset of her older sister who became a nurse. She knew she wanted a career with strong personal connections. “I was interested in as much interpersonal interaction as possible,” she said. A human services class her high school, Mount Anthony Union in Bennington, introduced her to additional career ideas—and it included a skills test that suggested speech pathology. “I had never even heard of speech pathology before, but the more I looked into it, the more I liked the idea. I liked that it was care and support in a non-emergency setting.”
As Amara began searching for colleges, she looked for schools with three criteria: a major in communication sciences, a Christian college, and warm weather far from home. She typed one simple phrase into Google: “Christian colleges with warm weather and speech pathology.” That search led her to Biola University in California. Of the three colleges she ultimately applied to, Biola offered the strongest financial aid package, which deepened its appeal.
Amara says that Monda Kelley, an Outreach Counselor with VSAC’s Talent Search program, played a huge role in that outcome. “My entire junior and senior year I was writing scholarship applications every week,” she said. “Monda printed this big list of scholarships for me. We even found one for people who are left-handed, like me.” She remembers her mom sitting in the library during meetings and working beside her. “It was always collaborative. We would not have had that level of information without VSAC.”
Amara’s first plane ride—ever—took her to California for college. At Biola, she earned a bachelor’s degree in speech disorders and then completed her master’s degree in Speech Language Pathology. Far from home, Amara found community through the Torrey Honors program. “We had three-hour book discussions twice a week. I love reading, and that was a huge draw for me,” she said.
Today, Amara lives in Huntington Beach with her husband, Zach, and their six-month-old child. She works at a nonprofit called the Brain Rehabilitative and Injury Network, which helps people who have experienced traumatic brain injuries, strokes, or conditions like dementia. “A lot of clients have used up their insurance, and they can’t afford the therapy they still need,” she explained. “We don’t turn people away because of finances. We can give scholarships as needed.”
Her focus is cognitive therapy, helping people rebuild thinking and communication skills. And, after becoming a mom herself recently, she appreciates that her job has flexibility. “Maintaining my license is important to me, and I love being a mom. I’m trying to balance both.”
Looking back, she feels certain that VSAC made a major difference. “We were first-generation. We didn’t know the process or the culture around college. Without VSAC, I would not have known where to look for scholarships. A good chunk of my first two years was covered because of what they helped me find.”
Nick built a career through real estate and entrepreneurship
Nick’s path, although nothing like his sister’s, was similarly unique and exploratory. As a teenager, he thought he wanted to be a pharmacist. He later switched to accounting and a real turning point came when he took a marketing internship during his junior year of college. “It sounded better than the pizza job I had,” he said. “Once I started the internship at Keller Williams, I was exposed to the real estate world, and that was my ticket.”
He now lives in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and works as a real estate broker. Nick also owns investment properties that he manages and improves himself. He learned a lot of his home improvement skills working for a general contractor when he was in high school in Vermont.
Nick also worked with VSAC Outreach Counselor Monda Kelley, and says that back in those early high school days, VSAC helped him simply get started. “VSAC was one of those opportunities you didn’t really know about until you were sitting there at the table,” he said. “The biggest thing I noticed was Monda’s desire to see us win. It didn’t matter what our plan was. It mattered that we had one and had structure behind it.”
He remembers that the applications, but especially the fees that accompany them, felt overwhelming. “The first barrier to entry is really the fees,” he said. “Something that helped me a lot was that I didn’t have to worry about that because VSAC was there.” Then the financial aid packages arrived, and he weighed them carefully. “I’ve always been very frugal. I needed a school that fit both my goals and my budget.”
The University of New Mexico offered a strong package, and Nick accepted. After college, he earned his real estate license and bought his first investment property. He now helps clients buy and sell homes, renovates properties he owns, and continues to grow his business. “Real estate is one of those things where longevity pays off,” he said. As for his future? “I want to open a property management company in the next ten years.”
Nick still remembers two adults who shaped his high school years. One was Monda, his VSAC counselor. The other was his AP Biology teacher at Mount Anthony, Mr. Cross. “He changed my perception of what college could be,” Nick said. “He would play the song ‘Build Me Up Buttercup’ every morning to set the vibe. I heard it just the other day and texted it to my sister. Every time I hear it, I think about what his influence meant to me.”
Separate paths, shared support
The twins live far apart now, far from their Vermont roots. Amara and Nick visit a few times a year and stay close, even as their adult lives look very different.
Both say that VSAC changed what they believed was possible after high school. “I feel very blessed to have landed where I did,” Nick said. Amara echoed the same feeling. “There were so many opportunities that I would not have known about,” she said.

It is unclear how many of the more than 200 will return, or if some have taken other jobs.Union says millions of dollars wastedRachel Gittleman, president of American Federation of Government Employees Local 252, which represents Education Department workers, said that “for more than nine months, hundreds of employees at the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) have been sidelined from the critical work of protecting our nation’s most vulnerable students and families.”“Instead of following court orders and federal law, the Trump Administration chose to keep these civil rights professionals on paid administrative leave — a decision that has already wasted more than $40 million in taxpayer funds — rather than letting them do their jobs,” she said. Gittleman pointed to “severe” consequences, noting that “by blocking OCR staff from doing their jobs, Department leadership allowed a massive backlog of civil rights complaints to grow, and now expects these same employees to clean up a crisis entirely of the Department’s own making.”",,,,2025-12-08 16:57:57.471005

(Photo by Andrew Weeks/For the North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota K-12 students continue to make gains in becoming ready for college or career paths after high school, according to new data released by the Department of Public Instruction.
On Friday, the department released its statewide performance and assessment data for the 2024-25 school year that provides information on graduation rates, English and math proficiency and other statistics.
Federal law requires state education agencies to provide an accountability report for every public school in the state.
“Honest competition and transparency help make everyone better,” said State School Superintendent Levi Bachmeier in a statement. “This information helps districts understand who to look to for best practices and helps citizens ask thoughtful questions about educational outcomes.”
The data showed a 2% increase in students considered “Choice Ready” over the previous year, increasing to 73% of all North Dakota students. A student can become Choice Ready for post-secondary education, military service, workforce or essential skills, through courses and other opportunities offered at their schools. 
During the 2020-21 school year, 45% of North Dakota students were considered Choice Ready, according to the data.
The department began implementing the Choice Ready framework during the 2018-19 school year with the goal of making students ready to choose any career path after leaving high school, said Amanda Peterson, director of educational improvement and support for the Department of Public Instruction. 
“It’s not necessarily a student making a conscious choice on which bucket they fall in. It’s a school offering opportunities in all three buckets, including the essential skills, so that a student can be prepared for any field they want to go into,” Peterson said.
She said students’ aspirations can change over time, but skills in math and English are needed for college and employment opportunities.
“Employers really want students to be able to critically think, be strong in all of the subject areas needed and they really need to be strong readers as well in order to be successful in life,” Peterson said.
Cellphone ban means less drama, more focus for some North Dakota students

Student graduation rates remained relatively flat with 84% of students receiving their high school diplomas within four years of entering high school. That rate was 82% last year and 83% in 2022-23.
The data showed a 7% increase in the four-year graduation rate for North Dakota Native American students, from 63% to 70% in the 2024-25 school year.
Peterson said the “completer rate” is a better metric because it takes into account students who receive their diploma or pass the General Education Development test before age 22. It also includes some special education students who may attend school until age 21.
North Dakota’s “completer rate” was 92% for the 2024-25 school year, up from 91% last year and 90% during the 2022-23 school year.

Data may not be available for some categories that have fewer than 10 students due to privacy concerns, the department said.   
The department changed its test provider, platform and questions used to measure English, math and science proficiency for the 2024-25 assessment. The scores are:

English: 40% advanced or proficient, 42% approaching proficiency and 18% novice level
Math: 41% advanced or proficient, 29% approaching proficiency and 29% novice level
Science: 38% advanced or proficient, 29% approaching proficiency and 32% novice level

Chronic absenteeism, students who missed more than 10% of school days during the year, remained flat at 20% of students, the same percentage since the 2022-23 school year.

The Republican representative adds to a recent spate of departures among legislators.

Rep. Jim Harrison, R-Chittenden, plans to step down as representative of the Rutland-11 district —  comprising Killington, Chittenden, Mendon and Pittsfield — according to an announcement last week. 
Harrison was appointed to the seat by Phil Scott in 2017, after his predecessor, former Rep. Job Tate, resigned for overseas Navy deployment. Harrison has since been elected to the post for four consecutive terms and served as vice chair for the House Committee on Appropriations last session.
Harrison’s resignation is the fifth in a string of apparently unrelated departures from the state Legislature since June. Harrison was considered among his peers as a moderate and influential member. 
“I just tried to bring a pragmatic sense to each and every issue that was before us,” the representative said.  
Killington Republican chair Chuck Hughes said that members of the four towns in the district will gather on Dec. 17 to discuss potential candidates to put forward to Gov. Phil Scott for appointment to replace Harrison. 
“It’s a big loss for our area, because he was very active,” Hughes said. “He would listen to people, you know, that was one of his strong features of being a representative. He was there to represent the people.”
Before his tenure as a representative, Harrison led the organization now-called the Vermont Retail and Grocers Association for 29 years, lobbying for retailers interests in the statehouse. 
After 19 years living in Chittenden, Harrison said he and his wife plan to move to New Hampshire to be closer to family, necessitating his departure from his political post. 
Harrison said he will close out his tenure at noon on the first day of the session, Jan. 6, so he can say goodbye to long-time colleagues and still ensure his successor has time to step into the role. 
Focused on affordability and lower taxes for Vermonters living in his district and the state, Harrison said that he worked with the House Committee on Appropriations to trim the budget last year and come to consensus on funding priorities.
In a Monday statement, Gov. Phil Scott expressed appreciation for Harrison’s years of work, “especially on the House Appropriations committee, to make Vermont more affordable.”
Along with advocating for a frugal state budget, Harrison aimed to foster bipartisanship in Montpelier as the self-appointed tournament organizer of a statehouse-wide March Madness bracket. 
“It’s all about having some fun and building bridges,” Harrison said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-08 20:42:02+00:00,CT Mirror,Rep. Jim Himes wants Venezuela boat strike video made public,Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/08/jim-himes-boat-strikes-pete-hegseth/,U.S. Rep. Jim Himes was one of only a handful of lawmakers authorized to view the classified video of deadly boat strikes in the Caribbean.,"As the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, U.S. Rep. Jim Himes was one of only a handful of lawmakers authorized to view the classified video of deadly boat strikes in the Caribbean.
Now, he wants the footage of the strikes from early September released so the public can judge for itself.
In an interview on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” the southwestern Connecticut congressman described parts of the video, which he says showed two survivors “clinging to a piece of wood and about to go under” after the first strike by U.S. forces on an alleged drug boat near Venezuela. A second strike was carried out and killed the remaining survivors.
The so-called “double tap” strikes on Sept. 2 have come under intense scrutiny on Capitol Hill, as well as whether the strikes were carried out legally. But Democratic and Republican lawmakers have different interpretations of what they saw on the video — a reason why Himes hopes it can be made available for everyone to see.
“I’ve spent years looking at videos of lethal action taken, often in the terrorism context, and this video was profoundly shaken, and I think it’s important for Americans to see it,” Himes said in the Sunday interview. “It’s not lost on anyone, of course, that the interpretation of the video, which six or seven of us had an opportunity to see last week, broke down precisely on party lines. And so this is an instance in which I think the American public needs to judge for itself.”
Himes said the people on the boat were “almost certainly running drugs,” but that it was unclear if they were headed to the U.S. or elsewhere. He disputed characterizations that all 11 people on the boat were high-level targets or that they knew the identifies of everyone on board.
“Under the law, if someone has been struck and continues to engage in hostilities, points a gun at you, has a gun, they may be a legitimate target. But if they are outside of combat, they are not, and attacking them is a violation of the laws of war,” he said. “This is why the American people need to see this video. These guys were barely alive, much less engaging in hostilities.”
President Donald Trump said last week he supports the public release of the video. During an appearance over the weekend at the Reagan National Defense Forum, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said they’re reviewing sources and methods first since it’s an ongoing operation.
Himes and other Democrats who viewed the classified video offered different accounts of what they watched compared to Republican lawmakers who were also privy to it.
U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, has defended the strikes and said they were valid targets. He also doesn’t oppose the public release of the video but echoed Hegseth’s remarks about how to go about carefully declassifying it.
“They were not floating in the ocean on a wooden plank, or in life jackets. They were  on the capsized vessel. They were not incapacitated in any way,” Cotton said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “It was entirely appropriate to strike the boat again to make sure that its cargo was destroyed. It is in no way a violation of the war of law.”
As key members on their respective intelligence committees, both Himes and Cotton had private briefings with Navy Admiral Frank M. Bradley, who commanded the operation, and Gen. Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
Similarly, U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-2nd District, and other Democrats on the House Armed Services Committee have also requested that Hegseth release all audio and video footage of the strikes. They cited reporting from The Washington Post that Hegseth issued a “kill everybody” order. Hegseth has disputed that and said he left the room after the first strike. But in an interview over the weekend, he said, “I would have made the same call myself” about the follow-up strike.
Himes said lawmakers received different explanations about the strikes, which is why he lacks trust in Hegseth. The congressman told CBS they were initially told that a second strike was ordered to clear the wreckage to help with navigation. Himes said he was then told that they might have a radio and were potentially trying to recover the drugs. Once he watched the video, Himes said, “You realize they don’t have a radio.”
“There was a lot of lack of clarity over exactly what Pete Hegseth’s role here was, but Pete Hegseth has no credibility on this matter,” Himes said. “So what we’ve had is a series of shifting explanations.”
When asked if he retains confidence in Bradley, Himes had a different take on the admiral’s role and capabilities.
“What it raises is what happens when an apparently good man like Admiral Bradley is placed in a context where he knows that if he countermands an order that he is perhaps uncomfortable with, it is very likely that he will be fired,” Himes said.
As the Pentagon grapples with the strikes, the inspector general of the department released a report last week about Hegseth’s use of the encrypted messaging app Signal to discuss an imminent attack on Houthi targets in Yemen earlier this year. The report found using a personal cell phone to conduct business and send nonpublic information over Signal could have put U.S. forces and mission objectives at risk.
It came to light after a journalist from The Atlantic was inadvertently added to a group chat where officials were discussing the plans of the pending attack back in March.
On Sunday, Himes told CBS that Republican lawmakers are privately expressing concerns about what has been referred to as Signalgate, despite the department calling the report a “total exoneration” and Hegseth maintaining he didn’t share classified information.
Members of Connecticut’s congressional delegation have recently called on Hegseth to resign in light of the boat strikes and his use of Signal to discuss attack plans.
“From leaking classified war plans in a group text to going around Congress and the President of the United States to halt weapons shipments to our ally Ukraine, Pete Hegseth has shown a repeated pattern of unbecoming conduct since the minute he was sworn in as Secretary of Defense,” U.S. Rep. John Larson, D-1st District, said in a statement. “He is clearly unfit to serve and needs evaluation.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-27-at-5.44.33 PM-1024x567.png,,,2025-12-08 15:59:13.303734

(Photo courtesy of Western Iowa Tech Community College)A former psychology instructor is suing Western Iowa Tech Community College for alleged discrimination in its handling of her complaint that she was being stalked by a student.
Mariana Pacheco, who describes herself in court papers as a young, Hispanic academic from Costa Rica, is suing WITCC in Woodbury County District Court.
The lawsuit alleges that in 2022, when Pacheco was teaching a beginning-level course in psychology at the Sioux City college, a student, identified in court filings by the initials M.U., exhibited “odd behavior” toward her, would wait for her after class, and would block her from leaving the classroom.

At one point, the lawsuit alleges, M.U. told Pacheco he had been “kicked out” of the military and not allowed to become a police officer due to several psychiatric conditions.
Throughout the fall 2022 semester, Pacheco alleges, she noticed M.U. following her around campus. She then notified her direct supervisor and the school’s dean of opportunity of engagement, but no action was taken, according to the lawsuit.
In the spring of 2023, when Pacheco taught developmental psychology, M.U. allegedly enrolled in the course.  In one class exercise, students were instructed to use ink pens as a device, but M.U. allegedly substituted AR-15 bullets for the pens.
When Pacheco taught an abnormal psychology course in the fall of 2023, M.U. enrolled and sent her an email informing her that “a Latino guy” had approached him at a bus stop and threatened him with a knife, adding that “this experience reminded me of why I normally carry a gun as I could’ve ended it two ways. Either de-escalation or with him dead.”
According to the lawsuit, while Pacheco was teaching a course on forensic psychology in early 2024, she noticed M.U. outside her classroom, circling the room three to five times every class period and making eye contact with her as he passed by.
Pacheco reported her concerns to WITCC officials who dismissed her concerns, the lawsuit claims, adding that security officials “said that there were other security officers in the office that were smaller and older than Mariana, and they were not scared of M.U., so she should not fear him either. Mariana pointed out that WITCC security officials are armed, while Mariana is not.”
One of the security officers allegedly suggested that had M.U. been a Somalian student, they would intercede because Somalian students had “trouble” with female instructors.
The lawsuit claims that in February 2024, three WITCC administrators allegedly observed M.U. circling Pacheco’s classroom and contacted campus security. Pacheco’s direct supervisor subsequently agreed that either she or her secretary would escort Pacheco to and from class, but with the understanding that if they were unable to do so, there would be no one else available since campus security had declined to offer such assistance.
According to the lawsuit, Pacheco then met WITCC’s president, Terry Murrell, to discuss her concerns. Murrell allegedly suggested Pacheco teach remotely, via Zoom, until any safety concerns could be addressed. However, the lawsuit alleges, the school subsequently decided not to file a harassment complaint against the student on Pacheco’s behalf and it also required her to conduct her classes in person.
The lawsuit alleges that around this time, WITCC permitted a different instructor, who is white, to teach remotely after she had expressed similar concerns related to a different student. On March 29, 2024, Pacheco resigned from WITCC.
Her lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for negligence; third-party sexual harassment; discrimination based on race, skin color or national origin; retaliatory discharge, and violations of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Americans with Disabilities Act.
WITCC has yet to file a response to the lawsuit. A spokesperson for the school indicated it does not comment on pending litigation.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Boston’s First Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday dismissed the Trump administration’s appeal of a Rhode Island judge’s Nov. 6 order directing the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to fully fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) while the federal government remained closed.
The call to drop that appeal was made by the administration itself, according to the two-page judgment.
A USDA spokesperson declined to comment, citing ongoing litigation for Rhode Island State Council of Churches v. Brooke Rollins still before Chief Judge John J. McConnell in Providence. The spokesperson referred additional inquiry to the U.S. Department of Justice, which did not immediately respond to request for comment. 
The 43-day federal government shutdown ended on Nov. 12. Even before the president signed the package ending the longest shutdown in U.S. history, the USDA promised federal food benefits would resume within 24 hours of the government reopening. The administration then withdrew its request that the U.S. Supreme Court halt McConnell’s order requiring full food stamp payments.
“The case was dismissed because of the government reopening,” Democracy Forward Press Secretary Amahree Archie, whose national group represented some of the 20 plaintiffs in the case, confirmed Monday morning.
But that does not mean the overall lawsuit against the Trump administration is moot, said Kevin Love Hubbard, an attorney representing the plaintiffs for the Lawyers’ Committee for Rhode Island representing the plaintiffs .
Hubbard said the lawsuit targets the administration’s attempts to revoke waivers that existing SNAP recipients have from new work requirements mandated under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.
McConnell on Oct. 31 issued a temporary restarting order (TRO) demanding that all previous work requirement waivers must remain valid after their initial termination.
Waivers had allowed states and municipalities to show USDA evidence that certain areas had limited job opportunities, exempting people from work requirements necessary for food assistance. The lawsuit notes plaintiff cities of Providence, Central Falls, and Pawtucket each received waivers in March 2025 that were valid through Feb. 28, 2026.
“We’re in the posture where the existing TRO remains in place on the waivers question while the federal government figures out what they want to do,” Hubbard said. “The question is whether they’re going to continue to litigate and convince Judge McConnell not to issue more permanent relief on that front.”
The Trump administration chose not to tap into contingency funds to continue SNAP benefits during the shutdown. But after the coalition of communities and nonprofits filed suit in Rhode Island, McConnell gave the federal government two options: Cover partial benefits through a $5.5 billion contingency fund or other reserves, or pay for a full month tapping into additional revenue sources such as the Child Nutrition Program.
The USDA initially chose the latter option. But McConnell issued a clarifying order to fully fund the program, which the administration then appealed in Boston and before the U.S. Supreme Court.
The Republican-led legislative package that reopened the federal government fully funds SNAP, and children’s nutrition programs, including subsidized school breakfast and lunch, and the availability of food during summer school breaks.
In addition to the three Rhode Island cities, the named plaintiffs include national groups and cities such as Baltimore; Columbus, Ohio; Durham, North Carolina; New Haven, Connecticut; and Albuquerque, New Mexico. The Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Community Center in Newport, East Bay Community Action Program, United Way Of Rhode Island, Federal Hill House Association and Amos House are also plaintiffs.

In a legal memo submitted Friday to the U.S. District Court of New Hampshire, attorneys for the U.S. Department of Justice said the residents do not meet the legal requirements to be added as intervenors. 
In September, the Justice Department brought a lawsuit against New Hampshire Secretary of State Dave Scanlan, seeking to compel Scanlan to hand over the state’s voter file so federal officials could check it for ineligible New Hampshire voters. Scanlan has refused to provide the file despite multiple requests this year, citing state law that prohibits most disclosure. The file contains the full name, date of birth, residential address, driver’s license number, and Social Security number for each registered voter. 
Days after that lawsuit, a bipartisan group of residents requested to the federal court to be added as intervenors, arguing the Trump administration’s actions would violate their privacy rights as voters, as well as the ability for some of them to recruit voters who may not want to be added to the list. The group, including former Republican state Rep. Neal Kurk, Portsmouth attorney Christopher Cole, former Democratic state Rep. Bob Perry, and liberal activist Louise Spencer, appealed to the federal court to be added as an intervenor. 
If granted, the intervenor request would give those residents a status similar to co-defendants and allow them to make their own arguments in favor of dismissal of the lawsuit.
“DOJ’s demands not only run roughshod over federalism principles and New Hampshire law — they spurn Proposed Intervenors’ privacy rights,” the residents’ September brief reads. 
There are two paths for residents to become intervenors: “intervention as of right,” in which a judge finds they meet strict statutory criteria under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and “permissive intervention,” in which the judge finds they have an interest in a common legal question that might be answered by the lawsuit. 
The Justice Department lawyers argue the residents don’t meet either criteria. Their lawsuit against Scanlan argues the state is violating both the Help America Vote Act of 2002 and the Civil Rights Act of 1960 by not supplying the voter file. They argue those statutes give the U.S. Department of Justice the authority and responsibility to ensure state voter lists are accurate, a point Scanlan has disagreed with. 
And in their brief Friday, the Justice Department attorneys say because none of the residents represent state government, the statutes at the heart of the lawsuits do not apply to them. The residents are not responsible for maintaining accurate voter files, for instance.  
“Rather, they assert only that they are individuals that perform voter engagement, assisted with legislation, and education for some voters and seek to maintain the privacy of voters they claim to represent,” the federal brief reads.  “… While these may be noble interests, they fall well outside the clear language of the parties covered under the provisions of HAVA and the CRA that the Attorney General is enforcing in this action.” 
The lawyers also said the residents’ fears of potential abuse of voter data by the U.S. government are unfounded.
“The Proposed Intervenors’ alleged injury — fear that voter data may be misused or chill voter engagement from the community — is not concrete or imminent, but hypothetical and baseless,” the brief reads. “The information at issue is already subject to extensive statutory protections under Federal law.”
New Hampshire is one of 14 states the Trump administration is currently suing over refusals to provide voter registration information, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, a voting rights think tank. Two states, Indiana and Wyoming, have provided their full lists, and other states have turned over only the publicly available versions of the lists.

The reality is that cold weather doesn’t affect all Vermonters equally. For families already struggling to afford heat, a single cold snap can become life threatening.
This winter, VTDigger is launching a two-week campaign to keep Vermonters warm and informed through a partnership with the Warmth Support Program of Vermont’s Community Action Agencies. 
Donate to VTDigger by Dec. 25 and your gift will help heat a home for a day and keep our journalism free for everyone.

Donate and heat a home

How the Warmth Support Program works
For nearly four decades, Vermont’s community-funded Warmth Support Program has filled critical gaps in heating assistance, especially during the early and late winter months when federal and state programs aren’t running. 
Warmth assistance is administered by Vermont’s five Community Action Agencies. For the Warmth Support Program, trained staff work directly with households who are running out of bulk fuel or at risk of electric or gas disconnection. The program is also accessible to those just above eligibility thresholds for federal programs, but still unable to afford essential heat.
To date, the program has delivered more than 95,000 emergency disbursements to Vermonters, with staff describing the impact bluntly: warmth literally saves people’s lives every year.
How your gift today does double duty
Donating to the Warmth Support Program is a concrete way that neighbors can help neighbors stay safe and warm through the winter.
Warmth Support funds go directly to fuel suppliers to prevent shutoffs and ensure households don’t run out of heat. No administrative fees are taken from contributions, a model designed to amplify the impact of every donation.
At the same time, Vermonters rely on VTDigger for clear, fact-based reporting on the issues shaping daily life, from energy and housing costs to legislative debates, climate resilience, school funding and local government decision-making. Reader support ensures this reporting remains accessible to all, without a paywall.
Right now, your donation supports trusted local news and provides warmth to a household in need.
Donate by Dec. 25 and your gift will have double the impact. It will fund independent journalism and thanks to our partnership sponsor, Vermont Gas, it will also provide one day of heat for a low-income Vermont home through the Warmth Support Program.

Give today and warm a home

Thank you for your readership and for helping keep Vermonters safe, warm and informed.
Sincerely,

Libbie Sparadeo
Director of Membership and Engagement, VTDigger

(Getty Images illustration)The New Mexico Department of Health on Monday said it continues to “strongly recommend” newborns receive hepatitis B vaccinations, including the first dose within the first 24 hours of birth.
The announcement follows the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices’ vote on Friday to recommend delaying the initial dose for babies whose mothers test negative for hepatitis B.
According to a news release from the CDC, the committee instead recommended “individual-based decision-making” for parents whose children were born to women who tested negative for the virus. And for those infants not receiving a dose at birth, ACIP recommended administering the initial dose no earlier than two months of age.
In a news release, NMDOH noted that its recommendation aligns with the American Academy of Pediatrics and many other professional health organizations. Following ACIP’s vote, American Academy of Pediatrics President Dr. Susan J. Kressly released a statement calling the guidance “irresponsible and purposely misleading,” and said it would “lead to more hepatitis B infections in infants and children.”
A highly infectious virus, Hepatitis b “can survive on surfaces for up to seven days and often spreads without visible blood exposure,” the NMDOH news release said. Prior to the start of universal newborn vaccination in 1991, “thousands of children were infected annually,” and up to 90% of those infected at birth developed chronic hepatitis B and approximately 25% die prematurely from related liver disease.
The NMDOH news also said the three-dose vaccination series against hepatitis B “provides protection into adulthood and significantly decreases risk for hepatitis B-associated liver diseases, including cancer,” and will continue to be available through the federal Vaccines for Children program as well as Medicaid and private insurance.
“For decades, the hepatitis B vaccine has proven safe and effective at protecting children from infection, including in settings like day care and schools where others may not know they are infected,” NMDOH Chief Medical Officer Dr. Miranda Durham said in a statement. “The vaccine provides a safety net for newborns at a time when they are most susceptible to disease.

It will build or rehabilitate 160 housing units, a press release from the agency said. 
“As Montana’s economy continues to grow, it is crucial that our workers and their families have an affordable place to call home. The projects that were selected by the Board will provide more affordable housing options for families and seniors in Billings, Kalispell, Livingston, Miles City and Missoula,” said Commerce Director Marta Bertoglio.
Saddle Horn Apartments in Miles City will receive $8.5 million to build 28 new homes, while the Tower Apartments in Billings will get $7.5 million to rehabilitate 44 affordable homes for seniors.
Additionally, a Missoula project is expected to receive $7.5 million to rehabilitate 44 affordable homes for seniors at the Wildflower Apartments.
Outpost at Kalispell will receive $8,336,000 to build 24 new affordable homes for families and individuals. And in Livingston, the Sheep Mountain Residences will receive $6.7 million to build 24 new affordable homes for families and individuals.
The Montana Board of Housing, which is attached to the Department of Commerce, picks the projects — federal money flows through the agency and is divided among projects annually. 
Last year, the funds went to projects in Billings, Bozeman, Dillon, Missoula and Polson.
“Each year, the Board has to make very tough decisions on which projects will receive housing tax credits. All the projects that were presented to us are worthy of receiving housing credits; unfortunately, we cannot fund them all due to limited federal funding,” said MBOH Vice Chair Sheila Rice.

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas legislative leaders’ messaging has teetered between confident and uncertain as they approach a possible attempt at drawing new Congressional lines in January.
House Speaker Dan Hawkins, a Wichita Republican who is running for state insurance commissioner, said in an interview with a conservative political commentator that something isn’t connecting with a handful of holdouts in his caucus. 
Hawkins and Senate President Ty Masterson, also a Wichita Republican, spoke with pundit Hugh Hewitt at a recent conference in Fort Worth held by the American Legislative Exchange Council, a nonprofit that convenes state legislators and private industries while crafting model legislation.
Both discussed possible redistricting in Kansas’ upcoming legislative session and their bids for statewide office. Masterson is one of nine Republican candidates for governor.
Leadership failed to rally enough support to call a special session this fall to pass a redistricted map of Kansas’ congressional districts. The effort was part of a nationwide push to retain Republican seats in the upcoming midterm elections.
Masterson obtained enough votes in the Senate for a special session, but Hawkins fell about 10 votes short.
“Do your members understand that politics is now nationalized and that — I know they might not think that way in Kansas — but if the (U.S.) House is one seat D(emocratic), it’s because Kansas didn’t act. Do they get it?” Hewitt said during the nine-and-a-half minute interview posted to Hawkins’ YouTube Channel.
Hawkins said redistricting is possible, but something must change. He said the House Republicans who didn’t support the special session have different reasons for not favoring redistricting, and the national message isn’t connecting with everyone.
Masterson was more confident.
“We’ll have no trouble for sure passing a new map with majorities,” he told Hewitt in a separate interview.
The uncertainty lies in how Republicans can overcome Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s anticipated vetoes, he said.
Redistricting could also affect whether the state Republicans will retain their supermajorities, which has caused a bit of fear as they approach the 2026 election cycle, Masterson said.
But redistricting is a must for Masterson.
“I think we have to do it,” he said.
He said he is “not a fan of drawing deep red and deep blue districts,” instead favoring districts that “look like Kansas.”
“I think there should be a shot in all of them,” Masterson said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/P4100057-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-12-08 15:59:13.303734

Bill Huizenga (R-Zeeland) campaigns in Lansing on Aug. 27, 2022. (Andrew Roth | Michigan Advance)The anti-Trump Save America Movement PAC, the spending arm of a nonprofit organization founded by former Republicans to combat policies of President Donald Trump, launched its “Save America Seats” midterm election spending campaign. 
The campaign will target districts held by GOP incumbents, as well as defending battleground districts currently held by Democrats. Among the first districts targeted in the campaign is Michigan’s 4th Congressional District, currently held by U.S. Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Holland Township). 
The initial spending push will focus on 11 congressional districts, but the group hopes to expand to over 50 U.S. House races, a press release from the organization said.
“SAM PAC is applying one standard to its evaluation of Congressional districts: any member, Democrat or Republican, who backs Trump’s economic agenda at the expense of their own constituents will face accountability,” the press release stated.
The spending in the campaign could reach $100 million, according to POLITICO. 
“For years, DC Democrats wrote off rural towns, farmers, ranchers, veterans, and small businesses while Trump’s policies gutted them,” Mary Corcoran, a co-founder of the Save America Movement PAC said in the press release. “We’re not writing them off. We’re speaking to them in their media, in their language, on their terms. These races don’t become competitive by magic. They become competitive when you hit early and never let up.”

Steve Schmidt, another co-founder of the PAC, called out a “deep crisis of competence” within the Democratic national establishment, noting that this campaign intends to focus on areas of the country that the party tends to invest less in. 
The campaign will include rural radio, agricultural-network buys, billboards and targeted digital programs, and will focus on directly tying incumbent Republican members of Congress to Trump’s policies, including health care costs and rural hospital closures. 
Michigan’s 4th Congressional District is a target district for Democrats to flip in 2026 — especially as Huizenga had left questions open as to whether or not he would run for re-election after deciding in July not to run for U.S. Senate.
A recent poll by Public Policy Polling showed state Sen. Sean McCann (D-Kalamazoo) within the margin of error behind Huizenga, only trailing by two points.

Gretchen Whitmer — faces Kalamazoo attorney Jessica Swartz, IT and cybersecurity professional Richard Aaron and former Congressional staffer Diop Harris in the Democratic primary.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Florida Senate President Ben Albritton said Monday that he would prefer to wait to decide about a mid-decade congressional redistricting until after the U.S. Supreme Court rules in a Voting Rights Act case sometime next year.
That would contradict the timetable for congressional redistricting set last week by a select committee in the Florida House and put the upper chamber in synch with Gov. Ron DeSantis, who said last week that he wants the Legislature to act during a special legislative session sometime after the regular session ends next year on March 13.
“What the governor has suggested is that we wait until the spring to redistrict,” Albritton said in a sit-down meeting with reporters who cover the Capitol. “He has his various reasons why we wait until the spring. I don’t have any issue with that. If you’ve seen anything out of the Senate, we move pretty slowly, anyhow. But our goal is just to be methodical and measured.”
DeSantis has said for months that he wants Florida to join a growing list of both red and blue states that have engaged in unprecedented mid-decade congressional redistricting ever since President Donald Trump called on Texas legislators to do so to help Republicans maintain their majority in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Democrats and voting rights advocates say Florida would be in violation of the Fair District Amendments passed by state voters in 2010 that insist no reapportionment plan or individual district can be drawn “with the intent to favor or disfavor a political party or incumbent.”
DeSantis has denied that is what would be taking place, saying last week that lawmakers are “not allowed to use partisan data” and that they would be “forced to” redistrict its 28 congressional seats once the Supreme Court rules on the case involving Louisiana’s congressional map.
House Speaker Daniel Perez announced in August that the House would convene the select committee to create a new congressional map in time for the 2026 elections. (That committee held its first meeting last week).
However, Albritton had not commented at all about where his chamber stood until last week, when he released a statement acknowledging the governor’s “desire” to redistrict the state’s congressional seats but that there was “no ongoing work” to that end in the Senate.
Disagreement with the House on timing
Albritton doubled down Monday, saying the Senate is not drawing any proposed maps right now and that he doesn’t see any need to do so until after the legal picture becomes clearer.
During arguments in the Louisiana case in October, justices seemed amenable to limiting the consideration of race in the redistricting process, a move that would undermine a key portion of the 1965 U.S. Voting Rights Act.
By agreeing with DeSantis, Albritton puts Senate at odds with the House on timing. The chairman of the House congressional redistricting committee said last week that it would be “irresponsible” to delay, specifically because the deadline for candidates to qualify for federal races next year is April 20.
Albritton bristled at the notion Monday that his chamber isn’t acting independently, just because it agrees with DeSantis and not the House on timing.
Proclaiming the Senate ‘an independent body’
“The Florida Senate has a very special role in all of this,” he said. “And that role is we are an independent body the same way the Florida House is and the same way that the executive office of the governor is. The same way that the courts are. If we happen to agree with the governor on something, it doesn’t mean anything other than, ‘Well, we happen to agree.’
“If we disagree with the governor on something, no, I’m not going to make a spectacle of it. But the fact is that we do on things disagree. And that’s the way the system’s supposed to work. So, I just push back on the notion that just because, you know, we happen to agree with waiting on redistricting because it makes sense to me in my mind to wait and garner all the information we can on it, sure.”
Asked what he would do if the House passes a congressional map during the regular session and then sends it to the Senate, Albritton was noncommittal.
“We’ll see what happens,” he said.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_7898-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-12-08 15:59:13.303734

Roosevelt fired FTC Commissioner William Humphrey before his seven-year term ended. He died shortly after, and his executor sued and won.Slaughter fired in MarchMonday’s case stems from Trump’s March firing of Rebecca Slaughter, an FTC commissioner since 2018, when she was named during Trump’s first term. President Joe Biden reappointed her and the Senate unanimously confirmed her for a second term in 2023.Trump fired Slaughter on March 28 in an email that said her “continued service on the FTC is inconsistent with my administration’s priorities.” Slaughter sued and won in federal district court and at the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.U.S. Solicitor General John Sauer argued to the justices Monday that Congress is “shaving away from the president’s control.”The conservative justices homed in on Sauer’s argument.In an exchange between Justice Amy Coney Barrett and Slaughter’s counsel, Amit Agarwal, Barrett said, “If we decide this case in your favor, we don’t know what a Congress in 15 or 20 or 30 years might do.”Agarwal responded, “We haven’t seen this problem materializing at all.”“The real world danger that is imminent right now, that we know will happen, and that is that if petitioners get their way, everything is on the chopping block,” he said.Fed firing up nextThe arguments lasted two-and-a-half hours and could be a preview of oral arguments in January that will center on Trump’s firing of Federal Reserve Board governor Lisa Cook.The seven-member board governing the central bank sets U.S. policy, including interest rates.

The bill was passed by the House on Dec. 1 and referred to a Senate committee the next day. The federal government shutdown in October forced a pause in the Medicare program, and it would face another pause next month if budget negotiations break down again.  
Shutdown forces Medicare patients off popular telehealth and hospital-at-home programs

As of last fall, 366 hospitals nationwide had participated in the hospital-at-home program, serving 31,000 patients, according to a federal report. The program, officially called Acute Hospital Care at Home, allows patients who would otherwise be hospitalized to receive care at home with a combination of nurse visits, monitoring equipment and remote doctor visits.
“The hospital-at-home model gives hospitals the flexibility to treat certain patients in the comfort and convenience of their own homes rather than in the hospital,” said Pennsylvania Republican U.S. Rep. Lloyd Smucker, speaking on the House floor during debate on the bill Dec. 1. 
“A number of hospitals in my district have used the program to great effect,” he said. “One hospital system has accepted more than 800 patients, freeing up more than 1,500 hospital bed-days and saving approximately $1.1 million.”
The bill still must be passed by the Senate and signed by President Donald Trump before taking effect. Another popular Medicare program, which offers telehealth visits, was also paused in the shutdown and would still be subject to a pause if the short-term funding bill passed in November ends Jan. 30 without a new budget agreement.

A new report from the state Legislative Finance Committee predicts less than 1% of growth for next year’s state budget. (Anna Padilla for Source NM)New Mexico’s economy is “treading water,” but not at risk of a recession, according to state economists. They expect the state budget to grow by a slim margin in the next fiscal year due to some revenue sources generating less than previously projected.
Economists and cabinet secretaries on Monday presented lawmakers on the state’s Legislative Finance Committee with two reports about New Mexico’s general fund revenue for the upcoming fiscal year. Projections for “total new money,” the amount by which the state budget can grow, are estimated at $105.7 million, which is less than 1% growth from the current fiscal year. The state’s recurring revenue for this fiscal year — which comes from sources such as corporate and personal income taxes — initially was projected at $13.7 billion as part of an August forecast. That number has decreased by nearly $323 million.
Officials impressed upon lawmakers that while the numbers are concerning, they don’t see a need for drastic measures like budget cuts. The state’s budget continues growing, just at a slower pace than recent years, they said.
New Mexico is “still in a pretty good place,” state Department of Finance and Administration Secretary Wayne Propst told lawmakers Monday. “Even in a worst-case scenario…we are still not needing to look at reductions.”
Analysts primarily attribute the economic slowdown to a reduction in the state’s collection of corporate income taxes, an effect of the “One Big Beautiful Bill.” The federal legislation gave tax relief to industries including oil and gas and manufacturing, which together make up half of New Mexico’s corporate tax base, according to one of Monday’s reports. Corporate income tax revenue was in the red in this fiscal year’s first quarter — the first time that’s happened since the “short-lived pandemic oil crash of 2020,” the report said.
With less than 1% of growth for new money, any budget lawmakers pass in the upcoming legislative session starting in January, 2026 will likely have little room for risk, analysts said. Executive orders from the governor’s office could wipe out all new money, one report said. The governor’s use of executive orders to pay for the state’s response to unexpected disasters such as the COVID-19 pandemic, wildfires and flooding has become a point of contention between Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and some lawmakers.
“The takeaway from my presentation is one of concern,” Ismael Torres, LFC’s chief economist, told lawmakers Monday morning. “There is still a path forward here. We’re still expecting to miss a recession.”
Torres’ report highlighted a number of other recent federal policy changes that are impacting the state’s revenues, including:

Increased standard deduction: estimated loss of $39.2 million in fiscal year 2027, which begins in July
No tax on car loan interest: estimated loss of $6.4 million in fiscal year 2027
Limitation on individual deductions for certain state and local taxes: estimated loss of $66.7 million in fiscal year 2027
All other changes to business-related federal taxes: estimated loss of $144.7 million in fiscal year 2027
Changes to Medicaid and state-directed payments: estimated loss of $17.1 million in fiscal year 2027

Some lawmakers on Monday used the reports as evidence that New Mexico needs to diversify its economy.
“We are so reliant on oil and gas and the feds,” said Sen. George Muñoz (D-Gallup), who serves as chair of the Senate Finance Committee. “Let’s ride this out and let’s roll up our sleeves…and figure out how not to hit that recession.”
Economic growth largely depends on consumer spending by families in the nation’s top 10% of income and on publicly traded stocks in artificial intelligence companies. In the last decade, presenters said, national construction on data centers has skyrocketed from less than $5 billion in 2015 to more than $40 billion this year. 
That national economic outlook resembles “a story familiar to New Mexico, one that’s very reliant on one industry,” Torres, the LFC’s chief economist, said. “It’s a narrow tightrope walk. If AI revenue doesn’t materialize to the extent it’s expected…those stocks could fall, high-income earners could become discouraged and stop spending and then the economy could take a turn for the worse.”
State funds in investment accounts continue to earn interest, Torres said, and are projected to remain the most stable revenue sources for the state’s budget.
But the “saving grace” of this year, he said, is the New Mexico State Land Office, which has leased and sold more than $476 million of land. If it weren’t for that revenue, “we would’ve been in the red and it would’ve been a much tougher financial picture,” Torres said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_0528-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-08 15:59:13.303734

(Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)Alina Habba, President Donald Trump’s personal attorney, announced her resignation Monday as New Jersey’s top federal prosecutor, a week after a U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals panel disqualified her from the job.
Habba, though, won’t walk away unemployed. She said she will serve as senior adviser to Attorney General Pamela Bondi on U.S. attorney matters.
“As a result of the Third Circuit’s ruling, and to protect the stability and integrity of the office which I love, I have decided to step down from my role as the U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey,” Habba said in a statement. “But do not mistake compliance for surrender. This decision will not weaken the Justice Department and it will not weaken me.”
She also left the door open to returning, saying she’s awaiting further review of the court’s ruling.
Trump named Habba U.S. attorney for New Jersey in March. But after the Senate did not approve her nomination within the timeframe required by law, Trump administration officials resorted to a string of maneuvers to keep her in the job — even firing her top deputy, Desiree Leigh Grace. Federal judges had appointed Grace in July, a task federal law allows them to do if the Senate fails to act.
Several criminal defendants then challenged Habba’s continued service in the post, prompting the legal battle that led to the 3rd Circuit’s decision Dec. 1. In that ruling, a three-judge panel found that the Trump administration’s moves undercut constitutional protections meant to ensure the three branches of government remain separate but equal.
Habba in her Monday statement complained about the “lawfare aimed at President Trump” since his first term and called his critics “obstructionists.”
“Do not mistake compliance for surrender. This decision will not weaken the Justice Department and it will not weaken me,” she wrote. “My fight will now stretch across the country.”
She blasted the U.S. senators, Democrats Cory Booker and Andy Kim, who fought her confirmation, and the federal judges who suspended most prosecutions and some other court operations until the challenge to Habba’s authority was resolved.
The U.S. Senate’s “blue slip” process allows home-state senators to block some of the president’s nominees from moving forward.
“While I was focused on delivering real results, judges in my state took advantage of a flawed blue slip tradition and became weapons for the politicized left,” Habba wrote. “For months, these judges stopped conducting trials and entering sentences, leaving violent criminals on the streets. They joined New Jersey senators, who care more about fighting President Trump than the well being of residents which they serve.”

(Photo by Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)The Indiana Senate’s Republican leader wasn’t making predictions Monday about the fate of the congressional redistricting proposal that’s become a test of loyalty to President Donald Trump.
Hundreds of anti-redistricting protesters filled the corridor outside the Senate chamber as it began taking up the bill that Republicans pushed through the House last week.
GOP Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray has warned for months that not enough senators supported redrawing the maps for the issue to win approval.
When asked Monday whether he believe there were enough votes for redistricting now, Bray avoided a direct answer.
“I’ve said before that they weren’t there,” Bray told reporters. “People are having a conversation about it. Senators know there’s going to be a chance to vote on it, so we’ll see Thursday.”

The Senate Elections Committee was holding a public hearing Monday afternoon on the bill, with the committee chair saying 127 people had signed up to testify. Sen. Mike Gaskill – chair of the committee – kept testifiers to a strict, two-minute timer at the front of the chamber that ticked down 120 seconds each time someone came to the microphone to speak.
He also warned against using signs or applauding, even telling police to remove people who clap.
A committee vote was expected late Monday afternoon.
Senators are expected to meet again on Wednesday to consider possible amendments to the proposal in House Bill 1032, with a full Senate vote expected Thursday.
While the Senate held a brief floor session Monday anti-redistricting protestors can be heard from outside the chamber, chanting, “No cheaters!” over and over again, and “No redistricting!” 
Many were holding signs with sayings like, “Protect our vote!” and “Democracy doesn’t get redrawn.”
The redrawn congressional map targets Indiana’s current two Democratic U.S. House members and is designed to create a 9-0 Republican map ahead of the 2026 midterm election.
Initial testimony was split on the issue — a marked difference from last week’s Indiana House hearing where 43 were against and only two in support
Mike Morris, with Lafayette Citizens in Action, told the committee “it’s time for Republicans to take a page from (Democrats’) playbook.”
He noted that U.S. Reps. André Carson and Frank Mrvan — Indiana’s two Democratic members of Congress — have supported tax hikes and twice voted to impeach President Trump.
“Senators, I urge you not to just merely be in office, but to be in power, and to use that power to save our federal republic,” he said.
John Colburn, of Sellersburg, additionally called on senators “to help fight the actions of California, Illinois, New York and others.”
As Indiana Senate begins redistricting turn, some Republicans keep mum

“If, by your inaction, a Democratic majority enters the House of Representatives in January, the result will be the beginning of two years of more accusations and investigations based upon the lies and deceit,” he said.
But Kelly Thompson, a Democratic congressional candidate in northern Indiana’s 3rd District, said she was “appalled” that the House had advanced the redistricting measure and that lawmakers “have forgotten who it is that they have been hired by, and who they are obligated to represent.”
“Instead of fighting for Hoosiers — the majority of which are against mid-cycle redistricting maps for Congress — they have chosen to cave to the pressure of the very people they have pledged to protect us from, the D.C elite,” she said.
Hoosier military veteran Lasima Packett, also opposed, called the bill “purely for political performance.”
“Today, the Senate has the opportunity to not just vote on the bill, but to lead the nation to show that in our state, we do not cave to the pressures from Washington, D.C.,” she said. “We do not redraw the democracy to suit a moment. And here, in this state, we still believe in fairness, transparency and the right for every Hoosier to be fully represented.”
The House approved the redistricting bill Friday, as expected, on a vote of 57-41. Twelve Republicans joined all Democrats present in opposition.
Indiana’s Constitution requires a majority of the 50-member Senate to approve legislation. That means the 40-member Republican supermajority must muster at least 26 votes to pass the bill if all 10 Democrats oppose. GOP Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith can break a 25-25 tie but only if there are no absences.
Sixteen Senate Republicans have publicly come out in favor of a redraw — some more enthusiastically than others — and 14 are against. The remaining 10 Republican senators haven’t taken a public stance.
Gov. Mike Braun has stood by threats that he and Trump have made to support Republican primary challengers against recalcitrant senators — and to keep up the pressure campaign if the Senate were to reject the new maps next week.

(Getty Images)A state judge has given Yazzie/Martinez plaintiffs extra time to file objections to a court-ordered Public Education Department plan to better serve public school students.
The plaintiffs in the long-running education equity lawsuit had until Dec. 1 to respond to the plan, delivered by PED about a month ago. But they argued in a motion filed last week they needed more time to finish reviewing it with experts and then draft their objections. PED Secretary Mariana Padilla told lawmakers two weeks ago the plan has “changed drastically” from an earlier draft.
Based on the plaintiffs’ ongoing review, the plan is “thoroughly inadequate” and violates previous court orders, the motion reads, and they intend to file “substantial” objections.

This story originally published on New Mexico In Depth.

The plaintiffs requested a Jan. 30 deadline. PED asked that it instead be pushed to Feb. 19 — the last day of the legislative session — which State District Court Judge Matthew Wilson granted. The department will have 30 days after that to respond, then the plaintiffs will have another 30 days to reply.
New Mexico legislators express concerns about judiciary’s role in education policymaking 

This spring, Wilson agreed with the plaintiffs that PED hadn’t complied with a 2018 court ruling that found New Mexico had violated its constitutional duty to provide a sufficient education to all children, particularly Native American and low-income students, English language learners and students with disabilities.
Wilson ordered PED to craft a comprehensive remedial action plan.
After public meetings and a statewide survey, the department delivered a 70-page draft in October. Indigenous education experts said it had major gaps, including limited concrete goals and funding estimates.
PED’s final version, submitted in early November, more than doubled, to 190 pages. According to a department press release, it adds “clearer outcomes and accountability measures,” among other improvements.
But advocates, educators and the plaintiffs say the revised plan is still short on details and wouldn’t adequately overhaul the public education system.

(Reader submitted photo)  State documents show a contractor has recovered dozens of oil-covered and injured animals after the Smitty’s Supply Inc. environmental disaster in Tangipahoa Parish. Several others were found dead on site or later died from their injuries. 
The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality released a report Thursday showing the most recent count for the wildlife known to have been impacted by the Aug. 22 fire, explosion and massive chemical and petroleum products spill. 
Lindsey Reeves, a spokeswoman for the Center for Biological Diversity, called the report “deeply troubling” though said she’s not surprised at the impact on wildlife given the massive volume of the oil spill, which polluted the surrounding environment with an estimated 12 million gallons of oily and liquid chemical waste.
The report, dated Dec. 3, details a state contractor’s work recovering 74 live wild animals, including 59 listed as “oiled” and 15 others — mostly opossums and raccoons — that were captured and relocated to unaffected areas. A total of eight animals were listed as dead.

The contractor, Wildlife Response Services LLC, sent a team of five workers to Tangipahoa Parish on Oct. 11 with a few off-road vehicles and a trailer outfitted with equipment to scrub down oiled wildlife. The WRS team established a temporary rehabilitation center where animals have been bathed, fed and monitored until they’re well enough to be released back into the wild. Some have been sent to veterinary clinics for more advanced treatment. The location of the rehab center hasn’t been disclosed.  
The company reported 29 animals have been rehabilitated and released as of Dec. 3. Separate records from the Department of Environmental Quality note some animals were released at the Joyce Wildlife Management Area, a state-owned swamp just north of Pass Manchac.
Most of the oiled animals recovered have been reptiles, including 50 turtles and three alligators. Also listed as oiled were four birds and two amphiumas, which are large, aquatic salamanders often mistaken for eels or snakes. 
Among the birds were large species that typically nest near water: a Canada goose, a great egret, an osprey and a pied-billed grebe. The grebe later died, but the goose and egret recovered and were released. The report doesn’t mention the status of the osprey.
One bobcat is listed in the report, though it doesn’t specify whether it was injured or just relocated. A separate LDEQ document noted it as a bobcat kitten but offered no more details.   
Four eastern river cooter turtles also died after being secured. Two of the turtles died while in care, and the other two were euthanized at LSU Small Animal Hospital in Baton Rouge, according to the report. 
The WRS team also found an alligator, a mouse and a raccoon already dead in the area impacted by the Smitty’s Supply disaster. The report indicates the contractors collected and disposed of the carcasses.

When reached by phone Friday, Wildlife Response Services owner Rhonda Murgatroyd said she wasn’t allowed to discuss her work without permission from the Department of Environmental Quality or the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. When asked about that policy Friday afternoon, LDEQ spokeswoman Meagan Molter said she would look into the matter. 
Reeves, with the Center for Biological Diversity, said there are likely many more affected animals the company wasn’t able to find. 
“After the spill, the Tangipahoa River looked like motor oil, so I suspect that the impacts to wildlife, especially aquatic species, are probably more significant and will be longer term than we see in this report,” Reeves said.
While reptiles, birds and mammals have been found injured or dead, no fish kills in the Tangipahoa River have been reported in connection with the disaster, LDEQ spokesman Greg Langley said. Much of the river, which runs directly adjacent to the Smitty’s Supply plant, was closed to the public for over two months. 
Animals of particular concern in the contractor’s report include the alligator snapping turtles, a threatened species that has been proposed for listing under the Endangered Species Act, Reeves said. The team recovered 12 alligator snapping turtles, one of which required more advanced veterinary care from LSU Small Animal Hospital, according to the report.
Other imperiled species that live within the footprint of the spill but haven’t been reported as affected by the disaster are manatees and freshwater mussels, Reeves said. 
“One of the things that’s been keeping me up at night is there are manatees in the Tangipahoa River,” she said. “There’s actually a lot of protected species that live in the Tangipahoa. It’s really a special place.”
Wild animals have borne the brunt of the oil spill, but pets and livestock have also been impacted, according to several Tangipahoa residents. 
A cattle farmer, Ronnie Polezcek, who lives 3 miles from Smitty’s Supply said fallout from the disaster contaminated hay he planned to feed his herd. He also reported the delivery of a stillborn calf immediately after the explosion, according to his lawsuit against the company.
Candy Cardwell, who lives near the Smitty’s Supply facility and saw her house covered in soot and oily residue during the fire, said in an email Friday that her dog, Rusty, is still suffering from bouts of illness since the fire. A veterinarian couldn’t give her a definitive diagnosis or attribute the symptoms to certain environmental toxins, she added. 
“At one point, I thought I was going to lose him,” Cardwell said. 
Cardwell said she’s not surprised by the amount of wildlife injured in the disaster because the animals that once frequented her garden have mostly disappeared. 
“I can tell you, I don’t have frogs, lizards or rabbits anymore,” she said. “I’ve only seen one squirrel. Things like that for a good ecosystem are gone.”

While CVS Caremark did not admit to wrongdoing, the company will pay over $5 million to Attorney General Gentner Drummond’s office and agreed to certain reforms to avoid further litigation, according to the settlement first publicized Monday. 
Reforms include reviewing pharmacy payment disputes against national cost benchmarks, responding to disputes within 10 days and working with the Attorney General’s Office to resolve additional complaints, according to a news release. 
CVS Caremark is a pharmacy benefit manager, or PBM, that works to negotiate prices between insurance companies, drug manufacturers and pharmacies. CVS Caremark operates under the parent company CVS Health.
“CVS Caremark cooperated fully to reach this settlement,” said Phillip Blando, a spokesperson for CVS Caremark, in a statement. “We are pleased to continue serving Oklahoma clients and their members to make prescription drugs more affordable.” 
Drummond’s office said 75% of settlement will repay Oklahoma pharmacies for more than 68,000 under reimbursed prescriptions filled between January 2024 and August 2025, according to a news release. The Attorney General’s Office will notify eligible pharmacies.
“When your local pharmacy is paid pennies on the dollar, or even loses money filling your prescription, it can’t keep its doors open,” Drummond said in a statement. “This settlement puts millions of dollars back into Oklahoma pharmacies so they can continue serving their communities. We’re protecting your access to the prescriptions you need and the pharmacists you trust, especially in small towns where the local pharmacy is often the only option for health care.” 
The last quarter of the settlement will support the Attorney General Office’s “continued oversight of PBMs.”
The settlement also covered the state’s investigation costs. 
Drummond filed the lawsuit in January and had sought the censure, suspension or revocation of CVS Caremark’s licenses and an assessment of fines.

The State of Iowa is contesting an injunction issued in a lawsuit brought by the former operator of the state-owned Honey Creek Resort in southern Iowa.
The lawsuit, filed last month in Polk County District Court by Achieva Enterprises, alleges state officials have misled the public into believing the company acted negligently and withdrew from the financially troubled Honey Creek Resort.
Achieva, which was hired by the state several years ago to operate and revitalize the resort at Rathbun Lake, is suing the Iowa Department of Administrative Services and Iowa Department of Natural Resources for the “abrupt and unlawful termination” of its concessionaire agreement with the state.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
According to the lawsuit, DAS terminated its contract with Achieva without notice and in direct violation of the contract’s terms. “DAS then took extreme and disruptive actions, including shutting down the resort, firing over 50 employees, evicting guests, confiscating personal property, and making public statements that damaged Achieva’s reputation and business relationships,” Achieva alleges in its lawsuit.
The DNR, as the legal owner of Honey Creek Resort, “actively participated in the termination and transition process,” the lawsuit claims, adding that the two state agencies’ actions have “caused irreparable damage to Achieva’s business, reputation, and property interests” and now “threatens the continued viability of Honey Creek Resort as a public asset.”
Last month, a judge approved portions of Achieva’s request for an “interim temporary injunction” in the case, pending a hearing on the matter. The injunction temporarily bars the state from either reopening the Honey Creek Resort to the public or hiring a new third-party operator to manage the resort while the lawsuit moves forward in court.
The Iowa attorney general’s office has declined to comment on Achieva’s allegations, but has filed a brief with the court arguing an injunction will unduly burden operations at the resort and be against the public interest.
The state says it terminated the contract with Achieva because the company failed to live up its contractual obligations “for significant lengths of time.”
In its brief to the court, the state also notes that the contract specifically allowed DAS to immediately terminate the two parties’ relationship, without any advance notice to Achieva, in the event that the company ended or suspended its business.  According to the state, Achieva’s president, Beth Henderson, “directly indicated to DAS that (the company) would do exactly that on October 21, 2025.”
In addition, the state claims, Achieva failed to comply with the contract’s requirements to obtain and maintain insurance, exposing the state to increased liability, and also failed to provide periodic reports of its financial and operational activities.
The state further alleges that an injunction forcing the state to further pause its efforts to hire a new resort operator will result in further damage to “the resort’s operations and viability as an ongoing venue for Iowans to enjoy the state’s natural beauty.”
A court hearing on the temporary-injunction issue was held Nov. 24, 2025, but the two parties did not have time to present their closing arguments before the hearing concluded. A second hearing for that purpose is scheduled for Dec. 17, 2025.
Achieva alleges a ‘smear’ campaign by the state
The $60 million Honey Creek Resort opened to the public in 2008, offering a 106-room lodge, 28 cabins, an indoor waterpark, an 18-hole golf course and a marina. The resort struggled financially, and in 2013, the Iowa Legislature authorized a $33 million bailout to pay off the resort’s outstanding bonds.
In 2016, the DNR entered into a management contract with Delaware North Companies, a private hospitality firm. Under that agreement, Delaware North was to pay the state a portion of profits generated by the resort once annual revenue exceeded $7 million.
Over the next five years, annual revenues never reached the $7 million threshold, and in early 2022, Delaware North exercised an option to terminate its contract with the state. Achieva was then hired by the state to run Honey Creek. In its lawsuit, the company claims it “inherited a resort in disrepair — physically, financially, and reputationally.”
According to the lawsuit, the resort generated significant sales tax revenue for Iowa but operated on “razor-thin” profit margins. In late 2024, Achieva and DAS entered into a contractual amendment to provide the company with some temporary financial relief as the company worked to improve its operating margins.
That amendment temporarily waived Achieva’s obligation to deposit 5% of its gross monthly receipts into a state-created fund, enabling Achieva to use that money for operating expenses such as audits and insurance premiums.
In April 2025, following DAS’ failed attempt to give the resort to Appanoose County, DAS “abruptly ceased communication with Achieva,” the lawsuit alleges.
On Oct. 29, 2025, without warning, DAS sent a contract-termination letter to Achieva and then “took extreme and punitive actions” — shutting down the resort, barricading its entrances, and sending home “over 50 employees without notice, destroying livelihoods,” all while falsely claiming Achieva had abandoned the property, the lawsuit alleges.
The lawsuit claims that DAS then launched “a coordinated publicity and outreach campaign to smear Achieva,” issuing press releases and social media posts falsely portraying “Achieva as negligent and unfit” to run the resort.

John James (R-Shelby Twp.) at a campaign event for JD Vance in Shelby Twp. on Aug. 7, 2024. | Lucy ValeskiSeveral key Republicans and other Michigan politicos have for months speculated if U.S. Rep. John James of Shelby Township was serious about his bid for governor in 2026, but a new campaign announcement shows he’s staffing up and getting ready for a strong primary fight in the upcoming August nomination contest.
James on Monday announced a reorganization of his campaign team, which now features a stalwart Michigan GOP operative in Tori Sachs, filling the role of senior advisor, as well as other national Republican faces.
The candidate, who is pushing his chips toward a gubernatorial bid instead of seeking reelection to Congress against the better wishes of the party and President Donald Trump, said the moves put him in a better position to win the August 2026 primary and the general election, should he become the nominee.
Trump jokes that GOP won’t let James seek Michigan governorship without a good replacement

“I’m excited to have assembled such a talented team who all share the same grit, passion for service, and love for our state and country as I do,” James said in a news release. “Their valuable experience of winning tough races in Michigan and nationally will help propel our winning message of bringing prosperity and sanity back to Michigan.”
Among the moves that will get the most attention in Lansing is the elevation of Sachs to the role of senior advisor.
Sachs is the current vice president of P2 Public Affairs and has worked over the past two decades as a Republican operative, issues advocacy and communications professional – with government and campaign experience to boot. She also served as the executive director for the Michigan Freedom Fund, managed James’ failed U.S. Senate campaign against outgoing U.S. Sen. Gary Peters (D-Bloomfield), and had a hand in other successful campaigns for governor.
Prior to the announcement, Sachs had been positioned as a strong supporter of James and was reportedly already doing work for James’ campaign.
Sachs made no formal announcement of the move on X but her feed is rife with James campaign related content.
James also announced that his longtime communications official, Hannah Osantowske, was moving from his congressional office to serve as his full-time campaign communications director. Osantowske served on his 2024 congressional reelection campaign. She was previously the press secretary for the Michigan Republican Party.
Other major moves affected the following James staffers:

Jackson Gross joined the campaign as its manager after previously serving as James’ congressional chief of staff;
Chris Grant will serve as an advisor. Grant is the founder of Big Dog Strategies, a national Republican firm that The New Yorker noted was behind the rise of George Santos.
Greg Brock will serve as his campaign policy advisor. He was previously a senior advisor, executive director and CEO of American Federation for Children, as well as the executive director of the Great Lakes Education Project, and the Michigan Republican Party.
Charlie Spies will serve as the campaign’s legal counsel. He currently leads the political law practice at the Dickinson Wright firm and has been involved in various GOP legal battles over the past decade.
Curt Anderson, a veteran of the Reagan White House and the National Republican Committee, will serve as James’ media advisor.
Time Saler will serve as James’ chief data consultant, after previously serving Trump’s 2024 data consultant.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DSC_0364-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-08 14:57:24.534038
,Mississippi Today,2025-12-08 19:24:22+00:00,Mississippi Today,Mississippi’s biggest sports event ever? You wouldn’t want to argue with John L.,Rick Cleveland,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/08/mississippis-biggest-sports-event-ever/,"We could argue for days which is bigger: an NCAA championships playoff football game, the biggest women’s golf tournament in the world or the last bare-knuckles championship fight.","The longest bare-knuckle prizefight in history took place between John L. Sullivan and Jake Kilrain in an obscure location in south Mississippi.

Ole Miss will play host to Tulane in a first round college football playoffs game on Dec. 20 and some pundits already proclaim it the biggest, most important sports event to ever take place on Mississippi soil.
It’s huge, no doubt, and millions around the globe will watch on TV. The stakes are enormous. Win that one – and Ole Miss is a heavy favorite to do just that – and the Rebels then will play Georgia in the second round, which this year is the Sugar Bowl on New Year’s Eve. Ole Miss would not be favored in that one, but the Rebels led Georgia midway through the fourth quarter on Oct. 18 at Athens. An upset could happen. Win that one and Ole Miss will be two victories away from a national championship – the proverbial pot at the end of the rainbow.
Rick Cleveland
But we are getting far, far ahead of ourselves. Let’s get back to the original case in point: Will the Tulane-Ole Miss playoff game indeed be the biggest, most important sporting event in Mississippi history?
That’s a good question. We don’t have any real bowl games in the Magnolia State. The Egg Bowl, which got its unofficial name for just that reason, is pretty much our biggest sports event of the year, every year. We don’t have much in the way of professional sports. The NCAA never holds any of its championships in Mississippi.
Twenty-six years ago, the late, great George Bryan brought golf’s U.S. Women’s Open – the most important tournament in women’s golf – to West Point. I still can’t believe Bryan pulled it off, but he did. Hall of Famer Juli Inkster won it and more than 120,000 fans attended. Millions more around the world watched on TV. 
That was huge – probably the most important sports event of the past century in Mississippi.
But there was one bigger still, although there is nobody alive who would remember it. John L. Sullivan, were he alive, would surely argue that the biggest sports event in Mississippi history took place on July 8, 1889. Trust me, you would not want to argue with John L.
On a brutally hot summer day in Richburg, a tiny community just south of Hattiesburg, Sullivan fought Jake Kilrain for the world heavyweight boxing championship. Adding to its historical importance, the fight was the last world championship bare-knuckle fight. Sullivan – the son of Irish immigrants famously known as “The Boston Strongboy” – punished Kilrain, a New Yorker, for 75 rounds before knocking him out.
The fight was the lead story in the next day’s New York Times. The story began: “Never, during even a Presidential election, has there been so much excitement as there is now, even when the brutal exhibition is over and it is known that John L. Sullivan was successful and that 75 rounds were necessary to knock out Jake Kilrain.”
Clearly, this is some serious Mississippi history here, and here’s the deal: The fight was not supposed to take place in Mississippi. No, bare-knuckle fighting had been outlawed in all 38 states at the time. The fight was supposed to have taken place in New Orleans, but Louisiana’s governor threatened to call in the state militia to prevent the fight from taking place. Enter one C.W. Rich, a wealthy lumberman and namesake of Richburg, who owned 30,000 acres and a large sawmill. Rich invited the entire fight party to his land, and they came by the thousands on trains.
Historical marker honoring where John L. Sullivan defeated Jake Kilrain for the heavyweight boxing championship.
We could argue for days which is bigger: an NCAA championships playoff football game, the biggest women’s golf tournament in the world or the last bare-knuckles championship fight. Better to call it a draw, which is what Kilrain offered to do after 44 rounds when Sullivan, who was knocking back whiskey between rounds, began vomiting. Sullivan declined the offer and promptly knocked Kilrain down with a blow to the ribs to end the 45th round.
So let’s not argue. Better to relive as best we can what happened more than 136 years ago in an otherwise sleepy south Mississippi community. Some snippets:

Mississippi Gov. Robert Lowry dispatched 25 armed men to the state line to stop the trains from crossing the state line. The trains plowed through, and no shots were fired. The county sheriff also tried to stop the fight at the site. But Bat Masterson, the legendary western gunfighter, gambler and sometimes lawman, not only refereed the fight but brandished his own firearms to dissuade the local lawman.
Bleachers, hastily constructed from Rich’s freshly cut pine, provided the seating for more than 3,000 spectators. The heat, which reportedly reached 106 degrees, caused resin to seep from the pine and more than a few spectators reportedly lost the backsides of their clothing to the sap. It was so hot that spectators paid the then-exorbitant cost of 25 cents for a ladle of water.
The fight was a perfect illustration of why bare-knuckle fighting had been banned. By the 34th round, both fighters were drenched in blood and sweat. Kilrain’s nose was broken, his lips split, and one eye was swollen shut. Sullivan’s fists suffered the consequences and reportedly were swollen to twice their normal size. He had a black eye and bled from one of his ears.
During the 75th round, a doctor told Kilrain’s cornermen their fighter would likely die if the fight continued. When Kilrain stumbled out to the center of the ring for the 76th round, they threw in the bloody sponge, signaling the end to the last world championship bare-knuckle fight. Sullivan was carried away on the shoulders of his adoring fans, while Kilrain reportedly wept like a child. Both were later arrested, but penalties were minimal.

We shall see what fate awaits the Tulane Green Wave and the Ole Miss Rebels on Dec. 20. There are likely to be some tears, but hopefully no arrests.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/08122009/SullIvan-Kilrain.jpg,,,2025-12-08 14:57:24.534038

Josh Stein speaks to reporters in Raleigh on Oct. 20, 2025. (Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)Gov. Josh Stein on Friday renewed his push for FEMA to approve North Carolina’s applications for a property buyout program – applications that have been pending for almost a year.
In a letter to FEMA’s new acting administrator Karen Evans, Stein requested that the agency fast-track additional aid to households, local governments and nonprofits in the mountains that continue to wait on crucial payments.
That includes the Hazard Grant Mitigation Program, a FEMA initiative that allows the agency to buy out badly damaged properties. North Carolina has submitted more than 500 applications totaling $240 million for that program since February, but FEMA officials have yet to approve or make final decisions on any of them.
“Further delay of these approvals keeps communities and families in limbo, in some cases paying expenses on homes they cannot live in while they await word from FEMA,” Stein wrote to Evans.
Stein also asked the agency to expedite other pending aid. Requests for more than $1 billion in total public assistance dollars for North Carolina remain pending within the agency, according to the governor. State officials have repeatedly pointed to increased bureaucratic obstacles, including personal approval by Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, on payments from FEMA to the state.
“The reimbursement process is particularly onerous for local governments, many of which are struggling to fund essential services like trash pickup and law enforcement,” Stein wrote.
City and county governments in western North Carolina have faced significant budget shortfalls in recent months — a combination of decreased revenue over the past year and payments for Helene recovery that have yet to be reimbursed by the federal government.
FEMA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Evans began leading FEMA at the beginning of December, the latest in a series of interim leaders at an agency whose fate is uncertain under the Trump administration but which remains crucial to North Carolina’s Helene recovery.
Her predecessor, David Richardson, resigned last month after he failed to appear or speak publicly after flooding in Central Texas. Cameron Hamilton, who led the agency before Richardson, was fired in May after he told Congress that he believed the agency should remain in place.
State officials leading Helene operations have touted the speed of the recovery, particularly with regard to their home repair and rebuilding program. But they have repeatedly pointed to federal bureaucracy as a key sticking point, failing to reimburse the state and local governments in a timely manner more than a year after Helene hit the mountains.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_3910-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-08 14:57:24.534038

Spencer Cox on Sunday called the Utah Legislature into a special session set for Tuesday evening to consider a slate of bills meant to “facilitate” Republican state leaders’ appeal fighting the state’s court-ordered redistricting process and its resulting congressional map that created a Democratic-leaning district. 
“I support the state’s appeal and have confidence the Utah Supreme Court will consider it in a timely way so we have clarity for the 2026 election,” Cox said in a post on X late Sunday.

The governor also included on the special session agenda legislation to repeal a controversial law prohibiting public workers’ unions — including those that represent firefighters, school teachers, police officers and other government workers — from collective bargaining. 
“I support the repeal, and appreciate the Legislature’s work to refocus this conversation to ensure government is doing its best to support our first responders, educators, and all those who serve our state,” the governor said. 
The House and Senate are scheduled to convene for the special session at 6 p.m. Tuesday. 
Ahead of the session, anti-gerrymandering groups supportive of 3rd District Judge Dianna Gibson’s redistricting ruling and pro-public labor union groups are expected to rally together at the Utah Capitol in Salt Lake City.
Redistricting
Last month, Utah’s Republican legislative leaders held a news conference to announce their plans to appeal Utah’s new court-ordered congressional map to the Utah Supreme Court, calling it the “most gerrymandered map in the history of the state of Utah.” 
They also announced they would be holding a special session to consider extending congressional candidate filing deadlines in order to allow more time for the possibility of a different congressional map to be enacted before the 2026 elections. 
In redistricting fight, Utah Republican lawmakers will appeal to Utah Supreme Court

“Utahns deserve a stable, transparent and accountable process for redistricting, one that respects the roles of our elected branches and the voice of the people,” Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, and House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, said in a prepared statement. 
They pointed to a recent poll by The Sutherland Institute, a conservative think tank, that suggests a majority of Utah voters think elected officials should be making redistricting decisions, not judges. 
“The Legislature is taking action to restore order, ensure transparency and defend the integrity of our elections, keeping Utah’s constitutional framework strong and stable,” Schultz and Adams said.
During Tuesday’s special session, lawmakers plan to consider the following, according to a news release issued by Adams and Schultz’s offices: 

Election Amendments, a bill sponsored by Sen. Scott Sandall, R-Tremonton, and Rep. Karen Petersen, R-Clinton. The bill “adjusts congressional filing deadlines to provide candidates clarity and election officials time to prepare,” pushing the congressional candidate filing period back by about two months, to March 9-13. The bill also “preserves existing processes for all other candidates not impacted by the court ruling, with no changes to primaries or conventions.” For congressional candidates gathering signatures to qualify for the ballot, the bill will set a window of time to file a notice of intent to gather signatures from Jan. 2 to March 13, with signature thresholds staying the same. 
Court Procedure Resolution & Supreme Court Jurisdiction, a bill sponsored by Sen. Brady Brammer, R-Provo, and Rep. Jefferson Burton, R-Salem. The bill is expected to make changes to court rules related to appeals by government officers or government entities regarding election, voting and redistricting cases, according to the governor’s call. It will propose delaying attorney fee determinations in election cases until after the appeal process has concluded and exempting a government official or entity from posting bond to appeal a case. It will also make clear that the Utah Supreme Court has “exclusive and original appellate jurisdiction over election and redistricting cases,” according to the House and Senate news release. 

Joint Resolution Regarding Constitutional Authority, a resolution sponsored by House Majority Leader Casey Snider, R-Paradise, and Senate Majority Whip Chris Wilson, R-Logan, to affirm that the “Legislature, who is elected by and accountable to Utahns, has constitutional responsibility over redistricting.” It’s also expected to condemn “the courts’ novel interpretations of the Utah Constitution that infringe on that authority and silences Utahns’ voices.” 

In a ruling last month, Gibson overwhelmingly sided with the plaintiffs in a redistricting lawsuit against the Utah Legislature, blocking the GOP-controlled Legislature’s preferred map from being used in the 2026 elections and instead approving one of the plaintiffs’ submitted alternatives, known as Map 1. 
The Legislature’s map, she wrote, “fails in many ways to comply with Proposition 4,” a 2018 voter-approved law establishing an independent redistricting process and neutral map-drawing criteria. 
Utah’s mid-decade redistricting process and its resulting new, court-ordered congressional map was the result of an earlier ruling issued this summer, when Gibson voided Utah’s last congressional map that the Utah Legislature set in 2021. 
In that decision, the judge ruled the 2021 map was the result of an unconstitutional process after she determined the Utah Legislature overstepped its constitutional authority when it undid Proposition 4. In that ruling, Gibson restored Proposition 4 as law while ordering a “remedial” redistricting process to choose a new congressional map in time for the 2026 election. 
Redistricting ruling: Utah judge picks plaintiffs’ congressional map, blocks Legislature’s

Fighting the courts every step of the way, the Utah’s Republican legislative leaders have accused Gibson of violating the Utah Constitution when she picked a map that wasn’t adopted by the Utah Legislature, which GOP lawmakers continue to argue — despite multiple court rulings against them in the state’s yearslong redistricting court battle — has the sole authority to redistrict. 
Plaintiffs in the state’s redistricting lawsuit have pointed to court proceedings in other states and  argued the courts have a duty to intervene and select “remedial” maps when they determine lawmakers have failed to follow the law. But Republican lawmakers contend the judge should have gone another route, like asking the Legislature to vote on an alternative, rather than picking a map and sidelining the Legislature. 
The plaintiffs and anti-gerrymandering groups have argued that Republican lawmakers have long gerrymandered Utah’s congressional maps in the GOP’s favor, and they celebrated Gibson’s map selection as one that most closely follows Proposition 4’s neutral map-drawing criteria and reflects the state’s “political geography” with a district that best represents its urban core in Salt Lake County. 
But the map’s critics argue it created four uncompetitive districts that lead to skewed partisan results in a state that’s dominated by a statewide majority of Republican voters.
The plaintiffs’ selected map was generated by a computer algorithm designed to comply with Proposition 4, which first and foremost calls for minimization of city and county splits. 
Public union law repeal
The repeal of the anti-public union law, HB267, comes after a coalition of labor unions submitted 320,000 signatures in support of a referendum to ask Utah voters to overturn the law in the 2026 general election. The groups far exceeded the signature threshold needed to qualify the referendum for the ballot — and in May the law was put on hold until voters could decide its fate. 
With enough signatures confirmed, controversial union law put on hold

But rather than waiting for the repeal of HB267 to go to a vote, the Utah Legislature will be taking matters into its own hands. 
In a lengthy statement posted on X late Sunday, the bill’s sponsor, Rep. Jordan Teuscher, R-South Jordan, said the ideas originally behind the law — meant to “end exclusive, behind-closed-doors collective bargaining that shut out many workers” and to bring “accountability” to pay raises and personnel policies — “remain just as important today as they were when the bill passed.” 
“However, it’s clear that the debate surrounding HB267 has been overshadowed by misinformation and unnecessary division,” Teuscher wrote. “That was never the intent. Repealing the bill now allows us to step back, lower the temperature, and create space for a clearer and more constructive conversation.” 
The labor groups coalition Protect Utah Workers fought vehemently against HB267, arguing it would effectively gut the power of public labor unions by collective bargaining, the process where unions meet with employers to negotiate a contract or terms of employment. 
In a statement issued Sunday night the Protect Utah Workers coalition thanked legislative leaders for “respecting the will of the people.”

“This anticipated repeal preserves the rights of firefighters, police, nurses, public educators, transportation workers, airport staff, and all other critical public workers who improve the lives of Utahns every day,” the coalition said. 
Protect Utah Workers organizers also credited the repeal to people who got involved in the referendum effort. 
“The expected repeal belongs to the Utahns who stood up and signed the referendum,” the coalition said. “More than 320,000 people who signed the petition sent a clear message that public workers deserve a voice on the job.”
Teuscher, however, indicated that he won’t be abandoning his legislative efforts around public unions. 
“Moving forward, I appreciate the willingness of Protect Utah Workers to engage in good faith, and I intend to work closely with union leaders, public employees, and Utahns across the state in the coming year to determine the best path forward,” he said. “My focus is on developing policies that protects public workers, supports taxpayers, and keeps Utah’s public employment practices open, responsible, and grounded in good governance.”",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111025_Salt-Lake-City_01-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-08 13:57:44.166539

The rising cost of housing continues to be a huge problem for millions of Americans. But, of course, as just about any average person can also confirm, lack of affordability is not just a problem confined to housing – it’s spreading across the U.S. economy in dozens of areas. So, what’s going on here? During the COVID pandemic, we knew precisely what was going on – a huge drop in supply that was giving rise to rapid inflation, and that problem was rapidly and successfully addressed during the Biden presidency.
So why are prices going up again and what should elected leaders be doing about it? Recently Newsline got a chance to discuss these and some related matters in an extended conversation with NC State extension economist and professor emeritus Mike Walden.
In Part One of our extended conversation, we discussed the affordability crisis that’s plaguing millions of average Americans – and how President Donald Trump’s tariffs are contributing to the problem and undermining the bold promises he made to Americans during the 2024 election.
In Part Two of our chat, we dug deeper into some of the economic challenges that confront the nation, including the impact of artificial intelligence, the changing nature of work, the ongoing disinvestment in research in higher education and the soaring costs of health care.

In an opinion issued Monday, Court of Claims Judge Sima Patel said she was denying a request for a preliminary injunction from the plaintiffs in Holistic Research Group Inc./Michigan Cannabis Industry v. Michigan Department of Treasury.
The consolidated lawsuits posited that the new tax, passed in October as part of a comprehensive 2025-26 budget deal to raise new revenue for road repairs and rebuilds through 2030, was unconstitutional because it violated the title-object clause of the state’s Constitution.
Patel on Monday, after hearing oral arguments in the matter in November, said the industry advocates didn’t make a supported argument that a real constitutional issue existed, nor did the group succinctly show that the Michigan Regulation and Taxation of Marijuana Act, which legalized the use and sale of cannabis in Michigan, was the only statutory mechanism to enact taxes on pot.
Critics warn Michigan’s 24% pot tax could crush small retailers, boost black market, hurt patients

“The (road funding act) is consistent with the (maraijuana taxation act). The plaintiffs contend that the phrase ‘all other taxes’ … refers only to generally applicable taxes, like the 6% sales tax imposed on all retail sales. If that were true, however, the initiative could have simply said that. Instead, the initiative stated plainly that the 10% retail excise tax was in addition to ‘all other taxes.’ And the phrase ‘all other’ is broad and expansive. According to the plain meaning of these terms, ‘all other taxes’ broadly means all taxes other than the tax imposed by (the marijuana taxation act).”
Patel further noted that the Legislature did not directly amend any of the existing taxes in the regulatory act or replace it with the new tax in the road funding legislation; rather, the Legislature imposed a new separate tax, which is permitted under the regulatory act.
“The two statutes can be read together,” Patel wrote.
2025-12-08 25-000160-MM 38 Order - 20251208 Ord and Opin
The claim regarding the mechanism by which a new tax could be enacted was therefore dismissed, Patel wrote.
Patel did, however, allow the case to move forward to determine if the tax interferes with the intent of the voter-initiated law that allowed marijuana consumption, regulations and sales. Patel said a genuine issue of fact remained on that issue, which required further consideration before the court.
“The court must consider the intentions of the (taxation act) drafters and the impact of the new wholesale excise tax on the purposes of the (taxation act),” Patel wrote. “The court may not resolve such factual questions at the summary disposition phase.

It’s one of the first times Fitch has publicly acknowledged there may be better ways for Mississippi to manage the money it’s won in the national opioid lawsuits, cases that charged some of the country’s biggest companies with contributing to a public health crisis that’s killed over 10,000 Mississippians since 2000. 
The Attorney General’s office sent an email addressed to Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann and Speaker of the House Jason White late Friday afternoon with two attachments: a finalized list of applications seeking to spend some of the state’s opioid settlement money, and a letter authored by Fitch to the Legislature.
The list, a reflection of the council’s work soliciting and scoring project applications looking to address Mississippi’s addiction crisis, tiers the 127 applications into five categories. The council recommended about $40 million of grant funding in the highest priority category and about $41 million for applications in the second highest group. 
Fitch’s letter summarizes the recommendation list and adds additional messages the council agreed to tell the Legislature. Toward the end of it, she acknowledges that she and the other members may need additional help to make sure funds are spent appropriately. 
“As we prepare for the second round of applications, the Council will be reviewing its process and may determine the need to utilize services to assist in evaluation of applications, tracking of public funds, and others to ensure that the Legislature’s priorities for accountability, transparency, and public involvement are fulfilled,” she wrote.
The Legislature created the council last spring to recommend how lawmakers should spend most of Mississippi’s opioid settlement money and appointed Fitch’s office to lead the effort. Lawmakers gave council members about five months to create application materials, review completed proposals and assess how well they believe applicant organizations will address the addiction epidemic.

The council completed these tasks in that time period, but the process was filled with a variety of issues that concerned overdose prevention advocates both on and outside of the council. From missing application materials in the summer to conflicts of interests and grading discrepancies in the fall, Mississippi Today reported on challenges that led overdose prevention advocates to worry whether the funds would help those who struggle with addiction. 
In the past, Fitch has often responded to the newsroom asking questions about these concerns without proposals to address them. When Mississippi Today asked her about the council conflicts of interest in November, her Chief of Staff Michelle Williams wrote back that the members are state leaders at addressing addiction and are positioned well to address the public health crisis. 
Her idea in the letter to seek out additional services echoes fellow council member James Moore’s message at a meeting last week. Just before the members left, he asked the committee to consider reaching out to groups with expertise in helping states manage opioid settlement funds in the future.

Also in the letter, Fitch said the state has just over $90 million in opioid settlement money that must be spent to address addiction. There’s an additional roughly $15 million in state coffers that her office and the Legislature allow lawmakers to spend the same as any public money.
The setup for those $15 million mirrors the one Fitch created for the settlement money sent to Misississippi’s cities and counties. Elected leaders can spend the money on addressing addiction but don’t have to. A September Mississippi Today investigation found that most of the settlement money local governments were spending went to general expenses rather than addressing addiction — a big reason why the state has spent less money to fight the public health crisis than any other state in the country. 

Each year since 2022, Mississippi has been paid tens of millions of opioid settlement dollars, money that is supposed to help respond to the overdose public health crisis. But 15% of those dollars — the money controlled by the state’s towns, cities and counties — is unrestricted and being spent with almost no public knowledge. Mississippi Today spent the summer finding out how almost every local government receiving money has been managing the money over the past three years.Read The Series

When Mississippi Today has asked Fitch why she allowed Mississippi to spend large chunks of the settlement funds for purposes other than addiction, her office has said the lawsuits allow for some of the money to repay past government expenses fighting the opioid epidemic.

T[...]","Dr. Evelyn Griffin, a Baton Rouge obstetrician and gynecologist, was announced Monday, Dec. 8, 2025, as Louisiana's next surgeon general. She is an appointee of U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to a vaccine advisory panel at the Centers for Diseason Control and Prevention. (Screen capture of CDC video stream)  Louisiana’s next surgeon general is a Baton Rouge physician who U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. chose for a panel that’s implementing his anti-vaccine policy recommendations. 
Dr. Evelyn Griffin, a Baton Rouge obstetrician and gynecologist, has also aligned herself with Republican Gov. Jeff Landry’s stances on the COVID-19 vaccine and abortion.
The governor’s office announced Griffin’s appointment Monday. She will replace Dr. Ralph Abraham, the state’s first surgeon general who Kennedy recently picked for the No. 2 post with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
“Dr. Evelyn Griffin embodies the expertise and commitment that the people of Louisiana deserve in a Surgeon General,” Landry said in a statement. “Her clinical experience, her leadership in advancing maternal health, and her dedication to strengthening the doctor-patient relationship make her the exact right choice for this role. With Dr. Griffin stepping in, I’m confident Louisiana is in good hands and headed toward a healthier, stronger future,”.
In late September, Kennedy picked Griffin for the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, making her one of his replacements after he removed all 17 prior members in June. Its new lineup voted Friday to update decades-old guidelines that called for newborns to be vaccinated for hepatitis B at birth. 
Griffin sided with the majority in the 8-3 vote, which will be up to acting CDC director Jim O’Neill to adopt. Its revised policy calls for the vaccine at birth only for children whose mothers test positive for the disease. Otherwise, the first dose is recommended to be delayed until the child is two months old.
During debate over the matter, Griffin made a connection between hepatitis levels in the U.S. and immigration.
“We have had years of illegal immigration, undocumented people coming in from higher endemicity countries,” she said. 
U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-Louisiana, a physician with a specialty in hepatology, criticized the panel’s decision in a social media post and urged O’Neil not to accept the panel’s recommendation.
“As a liver doctor who has treated patients with hepatitis B for decades, this change to the vaccine schedule is a mistake,” Cassidy wrote on X. “The hepatitis B vaccine is safe and effective. The birth dose is a recommendation, NOT a mandate.”
“This will make America sicker,” added Cassidy, who chairs the U.S. Senate health committee and cast the deciding vote earlier this year to approve President Donald Trump’s nomination of Kennedy as health secretary. 
In the same meeting where she voted on hepatitis B vaccine policy revisions, Griffin made a presentation to committee members on the use of aluminum in vaccines as an adjuvant, which is intended to improve their efficacy. Aluminum-based adjuvants are commonly used in childhood immunizations for hepatitis B, the human papilloma virus and diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTaP).  
Kennedy has claimed aluminum in vaccines is linked to autism and food allergies, though multiple studies have disputed that claim and shown no harmful accumulation or harmful effects from aluminum adjuvants. They include research published in July that studied more than 1.2 million children in Denmark from 1997-2018.  
Griffin said her presentation was intended to inform members of the advisory committee ahead of the possible formation of a workgroup focused on adjuvants that could make recommendations about their use in vaccines.

The December meeting was Griffin’s second as a member of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. At her first meeting in September, she voted with the majority on a resolution to recommend ending the use of a combination vaccine for measles, mumps, rubella and chicken pox given to children before age 4. Instead, the committee suggests doctors administer the MMR and chicken pox vaccines separately. The vote followed a presentation of research that showed a slightly increased chance of fever-related seizures in children who received the four-component vaccine compared with those who received two separate shots.
Griffin previously weighed in on vaccine policy at the state level after former Gov. John Bel Edwards issued an executive order in 2021 that required students 16 and older to provide proof of the COVID-19 vaccine in order to attend school. Landry, who was attorney general at the time, joined anti-vaccine forces to have the order repealed, even though families were allowed to claim exemptions to the rule. 
At an April 2022 legislative hearing on a resolution to repeal Edwards’ order, Griffin told lawmakers “the average kid in Louisiana has a higher chance of getting struck by lightning than dying of COVID,” a claim that vaccine proponents called into question.
In her introductory speech as a new member of the CDC advisory committee in September, Griffin said she had received the COVID-19 vaccine.
“In my clinical practice in obstetrics, I had been part of initiatives for maternal immunization, including diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus,” Griffin said. “And in my overall practice, I feel like, if I was to be given a label, I would call myself pro-informed consent because of medical ethics for discussing risk, benefits and alternatives with the patient.”
Abraham offered a similar informed consent explanation when justifying his decision to forego state health department campaigns to promote and administer the flu vaccine. 
Griffin has also made public statements in support of Louisiana’s abortion ban, considered one of the nation’s strictest, that went into effect after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022. 
In May 2023, Griffin appeared before the Louisiana House Committee on the Administration of Criminal Justice to oppose a bill that would have removed a 15-year prison term and reduced a $200,000 fine for medical professionals who performed abortions. Some doctors expressed concern the state’s abortion law would result in them facing criminal charges if a colleague did not agree when a pregnancy is medically futile, a requirement to allow an emergency abortion to be performed. The proposal, sponsored by Rep. Aimee Freeman, D-New Orleans, would have allowed a single doctor to decide when an emergency abortion is warranted.     
“Our current law is not penalizing doctors who are administering standard medical care, only those who are intentionally performing abortion,” Griffin told lawmakers, who shelved the Freeman bill without taking a vote. 
Griffin has also collaborated with Louisiana Right to Life, appearing in one of its social media broadcasts to explain the post-Roe landscape for reproductive health care providers. She also joined a dozen other Louisiana doctors in signing a statement “to provide clarity that Louisiana Pro-Life Laws protect physicians’ ability to care for their patients.” The letter addresses what it calls “misinformation” and “false narratives” that have circulated since Roe v. Wade was overturned.   
“Together, let’s ensure the public knows that women’s necessary healthcare is not at stake and move forward with protecting unborn babies and their mothers,” the statement reads.
This is a developing story.

(Courtesy NMED)Two New Mexico agencies announced they have taken early steps to remediate four long-abandoned, potentially dangerous uranium mines, marking the state’s first foray into a problem experts have said is of potentially “infinite” scope and cost.
The four mines all lie in McKinley County in the Ambrosia Lake Mining District. Contractors have conducted on-site surveys, environmental sampling and other preliminary steps at the sites, according to a joint news release Friday from the New Mexico Environment Department and state Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department.
“This is the first step in a truly monumental effort to reverse the legacy of neglect,” said Miori Harms, the uranium mine reclamation coordinator at NMED, in a statement. 
The four abandoned mines are among an estimated 1,100 that dot the landscape in New Mexico, including about 500 on or near the Navajo Nation, following decades of unregulated uranium mining that left toxic pollutants on land and water. The lack of regulation and ephemeral nature of many of the mines means that, in most cases, state officials cannot determine which companies built the mines and are therefore liable for cleanup. 
A problem of ‘infinite scope and cost’

In 2022, the Legislature passed the Uranium Mine Cleanup Act, which mobilized state agencies to document and make a plan to remediate the mines. Then in the 2025 session, the Legislature agreed to put $20 million toward uranium mine cleanup. 
With the help of $12 million of that funding, state officials identified the McKinley County mines and found contractors who will clean them up. The mines are known as the “Schmitt Decline Mine,” “Moe No. 4,” “Red Bluff No. 1” and “Roundy Shaft and Manol Strip,” according to NMED.
NMED officials have said they will use $2 million of the one-time Legislature funding to try to find more owners of legacy mines, as well as $6 million next spring to truck out contaminated soil from two sites companies polluted with petroleum.
The agencies’ work at the four McKinley County sites will provide a template for future cleanups and funding needs, with more sites added to the remediation list next spring, according to NMED. 
While anti-nuclear advocates and state officials have long said the federal government should be responsible for paying for the mess, state lawmakers described the $20 million funding as a way to get started, at least.
State financial analysts have calculated that remediating all the mines would cost, at least, hundreds of millions of dollars, and a University of New Mexico study in 2020 said the cost and scope is potentially “infinite,” given the depth of the contamination that has spread unchecked for decades. 
One contractor that is tackling early site cleanup, EA Engineering, Science, and Technology, Inc., released a video outlining its initial steps for the Schmitt Mine cleanup. Drone video the company shot shows a deep hole in the ground with no signage, along with a long-abandoned vehicle nearby covered in rust. 
New Mexico starting cleanup for abandoned uranium mines, but officials say more funding needed

Leona Morgan, a longtime Diné anti-nuclear activist, told Source New Mexico on Monday that she appreciates the state using its own funding to start remediation, even though it represents a fraction of the estimated cost to clean up the mines statewide. 
“It’s just scratching the surface, literally,” she said. “I know it’s just preliminary, like, these first actions will inform future actions. So my concern is getting more money, especially from the federal government, securing the funds needed for all of the orphaned mines.”
But she also urged state contractors to conduct adequate preliminary — including culturally-sensitive — community outreach, and she hopes that the state avoids repeating the mistakes of the past by ceasing to monitor mines after they’ve remediated them. A changing climate makes constant vigilance necessary, she said. 
“We can never consider these sites 100% remediated and, you know, pat ourselves on the back, like, ‘Oh, job well done,’ and walk away,” she said. “These are permanent liability sites.”
The state’s announcement said it will produce quarterly progress reports, including one it released Monday. 
The report says officials selected the four mines due to a variety of factors, including ease of access, proximity to homes and the hazard they pose. But the NMED is still working on a ranking which sites are the highest priorities, noting that it hasn’t yet completed assessments for all neglected sites and that “prioritization work” is underway under a separate contract. 
The agency also pointed the public to its dashboard, which contains a map and database with the history, location and remediation progress on statewide abandoned uranium mines. 
“We are making meaningful efforts to protect communities,” Environment Secretary James Kenney said in the statement. “This initiative is about taking concrete steps to finally address the unfinished business of abandoned uranium mine cleanup.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screen-Shot-2025-12-08-at-11.14.16-AM-1024x597.png,,,2025-12-08 13:57:44.166539

Bird, a Westminster Democrat, will step down on Jan. 5 ahead of the 2026 legislative session, meaning a vacancy committee will convene to find her replacement. She represents House District 29, which includes northern parts of Jefferson County and Adams County bordering Broomfield.
“With the upcoming legislative session beginning on January 14, the people of House District 29 deserve a representative who will be fully focused on legislative matters — and the voters of the Eighth Congressional District deserve a candidate who is able to put in the 70+ hours a week of work that it will take to flip this seat from red to blue,” Bird said in a statement.
Evans, a Republican, unseated former Democratic U.S. Rep. Yadira Caraveo, who was the first person to represent the district. Caraveo in September dropped her bid to reclaim the congressional seat. Colorado state Rep. Manny Rutinel, a Commerce City Democrat, is also running for the seat, as well as Colorado Treasurer Dave Young and Marine veteran Evan Munsing. The Democratic primary election in June will determine which candidate will face Evans in November.
Before announcing her congressional bid, Bird served on the Colorado Legislature’s powerful Joint Budget Committee, which drafts the annual state budget. She was first elected to the Legislature in 2018 after a stint on the Westminster City Council.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — After meeting in closed session for over 90 minutes Monday, the Nebraska Legislature’s Executive Board opted to delay a vote on how it will respond to groping allegations against State Sen. Dan McKeon of Amherst.
The Executive Board, which is in charge of handling disciplinary procedures within the Legislature, met at least once on Oct. 27 to discuss the same situation in another closed session, said State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, who chairs the group. They met a second time Monday but adjourned without reaching a resolution.
The Nebraska State Patrol cited McKeon for misdemeanor public indecency in late October after investigating an allegation by a legislative staffer attending an end-of-session party this spring in Lincoln. The Patrol received a report in early September that McKeon allegedly “made inappropriate contact with her buttocks with his hand, over the top of her clothing,” Patrol spokesman Cody Thomas said at the time.

During the Executive Board’s Oct. 27 meeting, Hansen said the group agreed to move McKeon’s former first-floor office, exchanging it with another first floor office previously occupied by State Sen. Tanya Storer of Whitman. He did not specify why the board felt the move was necessary.
Hansen said the board had a “great discussion” about the situation Monday, but he ultimately felt it would be best to hold off on any formal decisions until the full board was able to attend. Three voting members of the 10-member board were absent Monday — State Sens. John Arch, John Fredrickson and Mike Jacobson. Fredrickson was absent due to a canceled flight, Hansen said, while Arch and Jacobson notified him that they wouldn’t be able to attend in advance.
“I want to make sure we’re all together if we make any kind of decision of this magnitude,” Hansen said.
Hansen said he’s targeting Saturday for the board’s next meeting, that being the earliest date that all members can participate.
Typically, legislative committees are not allowed to vote in private sessions, but Clerk of the Legislature Brandon Metzler said some “administrative” exceptions might apply to the Executive Board. This would apply to McKeon’s office move, which was voted on in closed session.
The Executive Board is obligated to take action in response to allegations of workplace harassment within 45 days of the initial report’s filing, per the Legislature’s workplace harassment policy. Hansen said the board fulfilled its obligations in the actions it took Oct. 27.
McKeon is a registered Republican who was elected to the officially nonpartisan Legislature in 2024, replacing former State Sen. Fred Meyer of St. Paul. McKeon’s biographical page on the Legislature’s website highlights that he has been married for 30 years and has four children.

Gov. Jim Pillen and other state officials have called for McKeon’s resignation, but McKeon has said he will not resign.
McKeon has made several statements about the incident since the citation was issued, including a July 28 letter he sent to the staffer, and a broader statement through his attorney Perry Pirsch. In those statements, McKeon acknowledged the incident occurred but denied the woman’s allegations, describing the incident as a “light-hearted exchange” that he argued did not qualify as public indecency.

Pirsch said McKeon “made a single remark — a joke — to a staff member about her planned trip and hoping she and her husband would receive a ‘Hawaiian lei,’ or words to that effect, and he then patted her on the back.”
“It was meant in jest, and nothing about his action was in any way sexually charged or lewd, just a bad pun,” Pirsch said in the statement.
State Sen. Myron Dorn of Adams, a member of the Executive Board, previously told the Examiner that board members were advised by legal counsel to be cautious in their public statements about the situation.
This is because they don’t want to inadvertently do something that could impede the Patrol’s investigation, Dorn said. However, Hansen said Monday that the ongoing criminal investigation is not influencing the board’s actions.
McKeon is expected in Lancaster County Court Dec. 10, authorities said.

The delegation wrote that the E.U. regulations “introduce substantial uncertainty” for the forestry industry and “risks further depressing already strained log and wood-product markets, harming rural communities that depend on healthy, functioning timber economies.”
While the delegation’s letter primarily focused on the state’s $15-billion a year forestry industry, the regulations apply to other agricultural products, such as cattle and soybeans. 
In 2023, the E.U. revised its timber supply chain regulations to curb deforestation, clearing trees and converting forest land to another use, such as agriculture. The new regulations, which will start to be implemented on Dec. 30, require companies importing wood and certain agricultural products to certify that their products were not produced on recently deforested land.
The delegation said this is an infringement on “American private property rights.”
Casey Anderson, executive director of the Mississippi Forestry Association says that as a consequence of the new regulations, some producers are being asked to sign contracts by traders saying that they will not convert the land. Landowners are pushing back at their ability to decide how best to use the land they own.
“The E.U. is trying to dictate how we do things in the U.S.,” said Anderson. 
In a social media post, Mississippi Commissioner of Agriculture and Commerce Andy Gipson wrote, “We can never allow foreign interests and globalists to dictate the use of our land and natural resources here in Mississippi.”
Anderson points out that most producers in the U.S. practice sustainable forestry. And in the delegation’s letter, they highlighted that the E.U. considers the U.S. to have “negligible or insignificant levels of deforestation.” 
Mississippi and much of the South’s forestry industry has struggled in recent decades and is facing low prices. 
“It can really do a lot of harm if it goes through,” said Anderson of the new regulations.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06172847/20211014_carbon_trees.jpg,,,2025-12-08 13:57:44.166539

It’s common knowledge that the nation’s housing market – especially in growing areas like North Carolina – has become prohibitively expensive for millions of people, and a new report from researchers at the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy and the Center for Geospatial Solutions (which is housed at the institute) highlights a major culprit – the rising tide of corporate ownership of the nation’s residential housing stock.
According to the report – which is entitled “Who Owns America,” nearly 9% of residential parcels in 500 U.S. counties are owned by a corporation and the concentrations exceed 20% in some cities. What’s more, the trend is expanding rapidly, and it’s further complicating the already deeply challenging housing market for first-time buyers. And recently to learn more about the report and the housing market challenges it helps to highlight, we caught up with the national housing reporter for the news outlet, Stateline, Robbie Sequeria.

One lesson in particular stayed with me: “Make eye contact and small talk.” In simple terms: talk to your neighbors. Seek face-to-face connection. Humanize one another.
In 2024, I ran and won my race for State Representative by knocking on more doors than anyone else in the state —and it worked. And amid the polarization in our state, our nation, and our world, Snyder’s advice feels urgently relevant.

Nick Menapace

Although I was not on the ballot in 2025, I spent months holding a listening tour across my district. Those conversations reinforced a truth that rarely appears in our social media feeds: people, when they speak in person, are far more thoughtful, reasonable, and compassionate than online discourse suggests.
Online, disagreement quickly hardens into hostility. Algorithms reward anger over understanding. People retreat into echo chambers that tell them not only what to think, but whom to fear. And increasingly, we’ve learned that some of the people fueling this anger and misinformation are being paid to do so— or are not who they claim to be. In that environment, it becomes easy to blame one another instead of asking what solutions might actually help our communities.
It’s tempting to dismiss the most aggressive online voices as “keyboard warriors,” but I’ve found that most people express hostility out of fear, not malice. Rapid economic shifts, rising costs, global instability, and local uncertainty leave many feeling unmoored. Fear convinces them that someone —usually someone different from them— is the cause of their anxiety. Fear convinces them that empathy is weakness. And fear convinces them that other people’s suffering is inevitable, or even deserved.
But when you sit across from someone at their kitchen table or at a town hall, that fear softens. People ask honest questions. They listen. They share their worries about their families, their jobs, and their bills. They want practical solutions, not partisan talking points. And more often than not, they want the same basic things: stability, safety, opportunity, and a government that works.
I was recognized for bipartisan work in Hartford this last session. That mattered to me because it reflects a principle I hold deeply: government works best when we approach one another as partners in problem-solving, not opponents in a culture war. But political incentives —especially online— too often reward division over governance.
That dynamic is dangerous because the challenges facing Connecticut are real and complex. They require sustained focus, long-term planning, and cooperation. They cannot be solved through outrage or one-minute video clips.
Consider our statewide priorities:
Energy affordability. Connecticut families pay some of the highest energy costs in the country. The most reliable way to bring those costs down is to expand the use of the lowest-cost, most proven sources: solar, wind, hydroelectric, geothermal, and nuclear power. Other states and nations are moving rapidly in this direction. We should, too.
Healthcare access and cost. Expanding Husky to all Connecticut residents would reduce overall system costs and ensure every resident can access care without financial risk.
Taxes. If we want to lower the sales tax and reduce income taxes for everyday people, we need to modernize our fiscal guardrails and build a long-term plan that reflects how people actually live and work. That requires serious bipartisan engagement.
Housing and property taxes. The most effective way to stabilize property taxes is to expand the municipal tax base. That means building smart, fiscally sound housing that allows young people, families, and seniors to stay in Connecticut. This is the conclusion reached by municipal leaders, economists, and national experts. Our recent housing bill is a start —but only a start.
Transportation. Reducing congestion and long-term infrastructure costs requires greater investment in public transit, walkable town centers, and bikeable infrastructure. These investments are not ideological —they are economic development tools.
None of these solutions are radical. All are grounded in research and successful models nationwide. The question is not whether solutions exist; it is whether we can build the trust and civic culture necessary to implement them.
Which brings me back to Snyder’s lesson. Algorithms, headlines, or viral posts do not sustain democracy. It is sustained by people looking each other in the eye and choosing cooperation over contempt.
If Connecticut is to flourish in the decades ahead, we must recommit to the simplest democratic act: talking to one another. More listening, less shouting. More shared responsibility, less shared resentment. We can solve the challenges before us —but only if we face them together.
The future of our democracy begins with a conversation. So let’s have it.

Wray, who served 10 terms in the House, lost a close primary race to Democratic incumbent Rep. Rodney Pierce by 34 votes last year. 
Wray was criticized by Pierce and other Democrats for siding with the Republican House majority on key votes, including veto overrides. 
Wray posted his appeal to Republicans on his campaign Facebook page on Monday morning.

“Are you a Republican and want to support me in the primary election against Rodney Pierce?” the post reads.
“You can temporarily change your party affiliation to UNAFFILIATED, but you must do so BEFORE FEBRUARY 6TH. If you make the switch, remember that on election day, you must ask for a Democratic ballot in order to vote for Michael,” the post says. 
As he announced his plans for a rematch, Wray leaned into his work with Republicans, saying it helped him secure money for the district. 
“I am not going to apologize for working in the back rooms of the State Legislature to make sure that our region gets money from the state budget,” Wray said in a July statement. 
The district includes Warren, Halifax and Northampton counties. It is heavily Democratic, so the primary winner will likely win the seat. 
Pierce faced no general election opponent last year. 
Pierce said in a fundraising email last month that district residents haven’t benefited from the successes Wray claims. 
Wray’s appeal to Republicans is not surprising, Pierce said in a statement Monday.  
“My opponent has been misleading voters for years,” Pierce said. “He thinks that Democratic voters are dumb, which is why they rejected him the last time. While I represent all of my neighbors here in District 27, I’m running as a Democrat.”
In a statement provided to NC Newsline, Wray said he’s providing information to Republicans who support him on how to vote for him.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-08 17:35:24+00:00,CT Mirror,Borrowing for transportation on Lamont’s chopping block,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/08/ct-transportation-borrowing/,"Stagnant fuel and sales tax revenues mean CT will have to roll back plans to boost transportation borrowing, according to a new report.","An ongoing surge in state borrowing to rebuild Connecticut’s aging transportation infrastructure must be rolled back, Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration projects, because of stagnant fuel and sales tax revenues.
But business leaders and a key legislator insist Connecticut has other options to maintain expanded financing for highway, bridge and rail upgrades, including scaling back one of the governor’s favorite programs: an aggressive effort to pay down pension debt.
And while Lamont downplayed the revenue challenges last week, saying the impact wouldn’t be felt for several more years, his budget staff projected borrowing levels to be reduced starting in the next fiscal year, which begins July 1.
Just 12 months after the Lamont administration reported that Connecticut was ready to increase a key element of its transportation construction budget by 40%, from $1 billion to $1.4 billion, by 2028, a new forecast held that three-quarters of that planned growth is unaffordable under the current system.
That $400 million in new borrowing anticipated for the 2026-27 and 2027-28 fiscal years should be stalled, according to recommendations in the Fiscal Accountability Report issued Nov. 20 by the Office of Policy and Management, Lamont’s chief budget and planning agency. 
Reversing plans to invest hundreds of millions in infrastructure work will have a chilling effect on industry hiring plans, said Donald Shubert, president of the Connecticut Construction Industry Association.
“The minute they see any kind of uncertainty, or the minute they get any clue things are slowing down, they pull back,” Shubert told the Connecticut Mirror. “We pull back and that slows the economic activity or the economic benefits — immediately.”
The Connecticut Business and Industry Association’s vice president for public policy, Chris Davis, said that “any business that’s on the fence” about hiring or otherwise expanding, “they need that [state funding] stability to make those types of investments.”
Twelve months ago, in the 2024-25 fiscal year, while Connecticut was borrowing $1 billion for its transportation rebuild, Lamont’s budget staff said that should grow to $1.3 billion in 2025-26, $1.4 billion in 2026-27, and then remain at that level through at least 2029 – a prediction that excited industry and construction trade leaders.
Now the administration wants to stick with $1.3 billion in borrowing for 2025-26, but drop to $1.2 billion in 2026-27, $1.1 billion in 2027-28, and remain there through 2030. And given inflation in the construction industry, $1.1 billion in the late 2020s would reflect little increase, if any, beyond the $1 billion Connecticut borrowed last fiscal year.
Borrowing through bond sales, coupled with matching federal grants, are the two ways Connecticut pays for the overwhelming bulk of its transportation construction projects.
Slowing revenue growth is a solvable problem
So why does Lamont now expect to forego most of that funding growth he envisioned just one year ago?
The administration points to the $2.3 billion Special Transportation Fund, which represents 8% of the overall state budget, and covers the principal and interest payments on infrastructure projects, as well as operating expenses for the Transportation and Motor Vehicles departments.
Twelve months ago, Lamont’s budget office expected annual tax revenues supporting the fund to grow almost 4.5%, or $84 million, by 2028. Now they say those sources — two fuel levies, a portion of sales tax receipts, and a highway mileage fee on most large trucks — will effectively remain flat, growing by less than $6 million over the next three years.
The administration projects this sluggish revenue growth, coupled with rising costs, will push the STF into insolvency by 2029. But this is common outcome when projecting a state program’s finances out four or five years into the future, at which point inflation normally outpaces revenue growth.
Still, learning $84 million in expected extra tax receipts by 2028 largely won’t happen is problematic.
Tens of millions of extra dollars for annual debt service payments would allow for hundreds of millions of dollars in additional yearly borrowing for construction work. That’s because the state pays off various projects across 15 or 20 years.
But compensating for losing roughly $80 million in expected revenue growth also is far from unsolvable.
And some of the first solutions that might come to mind are untenable or unnecessary.
Lamont would not need the electronic highway tolls he sought in 2019 and 2020, nor the $600 million they would generate annually, far more than needed to fill an $80 million gap.
And given that both the governor’s office and all legislators are up for reelection next November, any hike in fuel or sales taxes — which would raise far less than tolls but still enough to cover the gap — also is likely off the table.
But there are still more options.
Will Lamont ease budget controls to grow construction work?
The overall state budget’s General Fund, which covers about 90% of all operating expenses, has been sharing some of its resources with the transportation fund since the late 1990s. The last major change occurred in 2015 when legislators and then-Gov. Dannel P. Malloy assigned about 1/13th of annual sales tax receipts, which currently exceed $5.2 billion — to the STF.
And the General Fund has generated unprecedented surpluses, averaging more than $1.8 billion or 8% to 9% of the fund, since 2017, thanks to aggressive budget caps installed at that time that force big savings.
Most of those unspent dollars, about $10 billion in total since 2020, have been used to reduce the massive pension debt Connecticut amassed across seven decades prior to 2011. And that’s in addition to the more than $3 billion in mandatory pension contributions Connecticut makes annually.
Lamont, a fiscal moderate, has been reluctant to scale back that savings effort, though, given Connecticut still owes more than $33 billion in this area. His critics, including many of his fellow Democrats in the General Assembly, say this effort is too aggressive and is draining funds from education, health care, municipal aid and other core programs.
They also note the governor has proposed saving less, himself, on a few occasions.
He signed big state tax cuts, which take hundreds of millions annually away from surpluses, in 2022 and 2023, just before and after he successfully ran for a second four-year term. He also proposed and won legislative approval last year for a new endowment to bolster affordable child care. That last initiative took $300 million from last year’s General Fund surplus and is expected to collect tens or hundreds of millions from future surpluses indefinitely.
Sen. Christine Cohen, D-Guilford, co-chairwoman of the legislature’s Transportation Committee, said Connecticut should not abandon what amounts to a huge planned investment in new construction jobs and in the state’s economy.
“If we really do something like that, we’re not looking at the big picture,” she said, adding that by rebuilding the state’s aging highways, bridges and rail lines, “we create a vibrant economic picture for our state.”
Cohen also praised Connecticut’s savings habits in recent years and said the state should continue to whittle down its pension debt.
But “I also recognize times change,” she added, “and sometimes minor adjustments are needed.”
Shubert’s association has asserted for years that Connecticut should be borrowing more than $1.5 billion annually to rebuild a transportation network that is one of the nation’s oldest.
According to the American Road & Transportation Builders Association, Connecticut ranks 35th in the nation, 1st being the worst, in terms of the share of its highway bridges considered “structurally deficient.” But when it comes to the percentage of bridge area that falls into this category, Connecticut ranks in the worst 15 states, according to the association.
Being “structurally deficient” doesn’t mean the bridge is functionally obsolete but at least one key component, such as a deck or culverts, is rated in “poor” or worse condition. And though not necessarily unsafe, the bridge requires significant repair or monitoring.
Lamont’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee, declined to say what changes the governor might recommend when he proposes his next budget to the General Assembly on Feb. 4 but added “We expect considerable discussion around this [transportation] question in the coming months.”
Lamont has pressed lawmakers in recent years to consider cutbacks to public transit programs, including higher rail and bus fares to reduce the need for state subsidies. This also could help offset sluggish revenue growth and make more borrowing for transportation construction possible.
But Cohen was skeptical the Democratic-controlled General Assembly would look to tighten belts further in this area.
“I certainly hope not,” she said. “I want to see more people on public transportation and that means putting investments there.”
Governor downplays transportation funding challenges
The governor downplayed the transportation funding challenges when discussing them with reporters last week.
Federal transportation funding has been on the rise since 2021, when President Joe Biden and Congress enacted an aggressive $1.2 trillion transportation infrastructure program, Lamont said, adding that “2030 is a long way away. A lot can change.”
But President Donald Trump already rolled back some of that infrastructure funding in July when he signed an omnibus federal spending and tax measure.
Trump also has told states he intends to link future federal transportation funding, “to the maximum extent permitted by law,”  to local compliance with federal policies on vaccines and immigration enforcement — issues on which many Connecticut officials and the president disagree.
State Department of Transportation Commissioner Garrett Eucalitto said the transportation fund revenues and changes at the federal level do present challenges to Connecticut’s construction program.
But the department also has adjusted its capital program to ease demand for more state investments “without compromising the long-term health of our transportation system. [The department] will also continue seeking competitive federal grant opportunities.”
The DOT has more than 650 active infrastructure projects, Eucalitto said, adding “We will continue to invest strategically in aging infrastructure … directing funds where they deliver the greatest benefit to Connecticut residents, communities and businesses.”
Keith R. Brothers, president of the Connecticut Building Trades Council, said that since Lamont took office in 2019, a robust 90% of his organization’s members in transportation construction-related trades have been employed.
“I have all the confidence in the world,” Brothers added, “that Gov. Lamont is going to keep us working.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GoldStarBridge_090417a013-e1470924753243.jpg,,,2025-12-08 12:58:50.744504

For families who have already checked off the bigger city parades, Greenwood offers something a little different.
Jamie Kleman | Contributing Writer Delaware Live | December 2025
If your family is still looking for a classic small-town Christmas parade to round out the season, Greenwood has you covered. The annual Greenwood Christmas Parade returns Friday, December 12, with a charming Santa’s Workshop theme that captures everything people love about a hometown holiday celebration and a winter night out.
The parade steps off at 7 p.m. in the heart of Greenwood, giving families time to grab an early dinner, bundle up, and stake out a good viewing spot before the first lights roll by. Organizers encourage spectators to arrive early to enjoy the festive atmosphere and avoid last-minute parking scrambles. Greenwood is expecting visitors from across Sussex County, which adds to the lively energy along the parade route.
A big part of the fun this year happens even before the parade begins. From 4 to 6 p.m. families can stop by for photos with Santa. It is a great chance for little ones to share wish lists while parents snap keepsake pictures. This early window also gives people a chance to support local businesses, warm up with a hot drink, and ease into the evening instead of rushing in at the last minute. Parade volunteers are planning simple activities for children and encouraging residents to show their holiday spirit by dressing in bright red, green, and cozy sweaters.
As the sky gets dark Greenwood will start to glow. The Santa’s Workshop theme invites floats, marching groups, and community organizations to think in terms of toy trains, elves, peppermint stripes, candy canes, and twinkling lights. Residents can expect a mix of decorated vehicles, school and church groups, first responders, scout troops, and small businesses all doing their part to bring the North Pole to Sussex County for one night. Many participants spend weeks preparing their floats which leads to friendly competition and extra creativity.
The parade also doubles as a community fundraiser. Town organizers have highlighted gift baskets and raffle prizes tied to the event, with proceeds helping to underwrite parade expenses and future celebrations. Local businesses have stepped up to donate items and sponsorships to keep the tradition strong year after year. Proceeds will support community activities throughout the coming year.
For families who have already checked off the bigger city parades, Greenwood offers something a little different. It is intimate, easy to navigate, and full of familiar faces yet still big enough to feel special. Kids get their Santa moment, parents get that warm small town feeling, and the entire community gets a reason to gather, wave, and wish each other a merry Christmas.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/thumbnail_Greenwood-Parade.jpg,,,2025-12-08 12:58:50.744504

(Provided by S.C. Nuclear Advisory Council)A sales agreement approved Monday by Santee Cooper would eventually remove $2.7 billion worth of debt from customers’ power bills as part of a major nuclear restart in the Palmetto State.
More than eight years after abandoning the project, the state-owned utility’s governing board unanimously passed an agreement, known as a memorandum of understanding, with New York investment firm Brookfield Asset Management for the purchase of two partially built nuclear reactors at the V.C. Summer nuclear plant in Fairfield County.
Santee Cooper and Brookfield must still go through feasibility and other due diligence studies. A date for the $2.7 billion payment is unknown.
It depends on Brookfield finalizing its investment decision. An estimated date won’t be set until June.
Under the agreement, Santee Cooper will maintain an ownership interest in the reactors of up to 25%. This would give customers access to the power the reactors would produce if completed.
Santee Cooper and the now defunct South Carolina Electric & Gas started construction on the two first-of-their-kind nuclear reactors alongside an existing unit near rural Jenkinsville in early 2013. But the project was riddled with delays, cost overruns and fraud that led to multiple federal convictions of former executives.
The utilities abandoned the plant’s expansion in 2017, but not before jointly spending $9 billion on the reactors that never produced a single megawatt.
Santee Cooper’s share of the debt was $3.6 billion, which customers so far continue to pay for on their monthly bills.
“Our customers have been paying for this,” Santee Cooper CEO Jimmy Staton said. “It’s time they got some value for it.”

Shkreli enters an already crowded primary on the Democratic side of the race to replace current Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, who cannot seek reelection due to term limits and is the frontrunner in the 2026 Democratic gubernatorial primary hunt. Michigan Deputy Secretary of State Aghogho Edevbie, Ingham County Clerk Barb Byrum and former state Sen. Adam Hollier of Detroit are also seeking the party’s nomination. Secretary of state candidates are nominated by the respective parties during their spring conventions.
Tim Smith is the sole Republican running on the GOP side of the primary race.
The announcement was followed swiftly by a message from Gov. Gretchen Whitmer appointing Shkreli’s successor: Joe Froelich.
“The Michigan Lottery helps us make record investments every year into our schools, and their success is supported by a team of professionals who ensure our games are run smoothly,” Whitmer said in a statement. “I’m proud to announce Joe Froehlich as acting commissioner of the Michigan Lottery, ensuring a seamless transition as Suzanna Shkreli resigns effective today. The incredible team at the Michigan Lottery will continue working together to run our games effectively and with full integrity.”
Froelich was previously the chief operating officer of the Michigan Lottery, as well as its deputy commissioner of legal affairs and charitable gaming, and the agency’s director compliance and legal affairs. He also worked in the Michigan Department of Attorney General’s office.
Whitmer also praised Shkreli as she moved on to seek a career in state politics.
“I’m grateful to Suzanna for her service to the people of Michigan as Lottery Commissioner,” Whitmer said. “She’s led the commission through multiple record-breaking years, facilitating billion-dollar investments into Michigan’s public schools.

A 33-year-old Vermonter was killed this month while serving as a medic in Ukraine, according to his parents.
Andrew David Mario, of Brattleboro, died Dec. 3 while assisting an international brigade of the Ukrainian National Guard in the Donetsk region’s Pokrovsky district, said his mother and father, Heidi and Michael Mario.
Mario is believed to be the first Green Mountain State casualty of the Russia-Ukraine war.
“He made his decision to cast his lot with the courageous citizens of that beset nation, very much aware that he was putting his life at great risk,” his parents wrote in their son’s obituary, sent to VTDigger and set for publication in local media.
The family said it learned of Mario’s death from officials at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv.
“We do not, as yet, know the details,” Heidi Mario told VTDigger.
An autopsy could take place in Kyiv as early as Monday, she said.
Mario left for the war-torn country last summer after being “overcome with an urgent desire to make a meaningful contribution” to Ukraine since a Russian invasion in 2022, his parents wrote in his obituary. 
Mario trained with the Ukrainian National Guard before becoming a medic in the village of Zolotyi Kolodiaz alongside other global volunteers.
Russia has been pummeling Mario’s service area — an eastern Ukraine railroad hub and “gateway to the war’s most fiercely contested region,” according to reporters there — for more than a year, with its former population of 60,000 residents reduced to fewer than 1,300.
Mario, born Aug. 26, 1992, attended Guilford Central School for elementary and middle school and Brattleboro Union High School for two years before completing his education through Vermont Adult Learning.
“Although struggling throughout his life with ADHD, depression and an at times tempestuous personality, Andrew was deeply compassionate, with a lively curiosity, especially concerning history and politics, a sly sense of humor and a fiery passion for social justice,” his parents wrote in his obituary.
Mario volunteered at what’s now Brattleboro’s Groundworks Collaborative shelter, supported pipeline protesters by living in a tent at North Dakota’s Standing Rock Indian Reservation, and toured the Canadian province of Ontario with a group raising awareness about missing and exploited First Nations women and girls.
Mario also worked as a bicycle messenger in Philadelphia, a carpenter in California, an organic farmhand in Finland and Serbia, and a support staffer at the McMurdo and Amundsen-Scott South Pole scientific research stations in Antarctica.
His family is planning a memorial gathering for next spring.
“We are heartbroken,” his mother said.

The United States is the only country on the planet that failed to show up and did not even submit its report that was due on August 4. 
What happened to us — to the “shining city upon a hill”?
What have we become? 
And what message does our silence on human rights send to friends and foes alike? 
The current U.S. administration has turned its back on human rights. Consider recent events: rising numbers of extra-judicial killings; unlawful deportations without due-process hearings; escalating violence against women, girls, and trans people, including outrageous numbers of murdered pregnant women; lack of equal opportunities for people of color; the wide economic chasm between the top 1% and the rest of the country; worsening access to health care, especially for poor and rural people; increasing rates of childhood mortality from preventable diseases — and much more.
Although the U.S. didn’t submit a human rights report, we at Minnesota-based World Without Genocide and allied organizations did. Civil society organizations can introduce critical issues with what’s known as a shadow report. In these reports, issues can be raised that the country under review may have omitted or presented less than fully or with bias. We organized a coalition of national nonprofit organizations and we submitted a shadow report.
In a modern-day David and Goliath story, our shadow report excoriates the United States over its human rights abuses, exposing systemic failures that undermine the rights and dignity of people across the nation. The report offers unflinching analyses and strong recommendations that would protect and uplift all who call this country home.
Our small coalition exposed the United States, an all-powerful giant of an adversary, and provided critical information to members of the Human Rights Council. 
The report focused on the human right to bodily autonomy, which encompasses health choices, protection from violence, and personal control over all stages of one’s own reproduction. As a cornerstone of gender equality and a fundamental human right, bodily autonomy is safeguarded by international treaties, national laws and global human rights mechanisms. Our coalition report demonstrated that U.S. policies have eroded these protections, striking at the very heart of rights that should be universal and inviolable.
The UN has rescheduled the U.S. review for November 2026. We hope that the United States will show up. We will show up and update our report. We are ashamed that the United States was absent – ashamed because every other nation in the world participates, and this sets a terrible precedent that threatens to diminish the process of holding human rights as a global goal. 
Furthermore, we are ashamed because the United States has tossed aside even a pretense of concern about human rights, here and everywhere.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/trumpsept232025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-08 11:58:02.042750

Trail Finder, a free, statewide trail website supported by the Vermont Trail Accessibility Hub, is making it easier for Vermonters of all abilities to find outdoor adventures that fit their needs. With accurate information and firsthand stories, the project is helping more people experience the joy of getting outside.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Findi[...]","Enock Glidden, an accessibility consultant, visits trails in Vermont and writes about his experiences on Trail Finder’s Trail Talk page.
At Oakledge Park in Burlington, accessibility consultant Enock Glidden rolls onto the trail with measuring tools in hand. He checks the grade of the paved path, looks for tight turns near the shoreline, notes surface changes, and photographs rest areas under the cottonwoods.
Soon after, those observations appear on Trail Finder, a free-to-use website used by trail-seekers to discover diverse, four-season trails across Vermont. 
His review of Oakledge is part of a statewide effort supported by the Trail Accessibility Hub—a partnership of organizations managed by The Vermont Trails and Greenways Council working to expand access and improve accessibility information across Vermont’s trails.
Enock’s on-the-ground assessments of Vermont trails give trail-seekers something they’ve long needed: clear, consistent, objective accessibility information all in one place. 
“For many people with mobility, sensory, or cognitive disabilities, as well as older adults or parents with young children, planning a day outside isn’t just about choosing a trail labeled ‘easy,’ ” says Steve Engle, Director of Community Geographics, one of the organizations that oversees Trail Finder.
Details like surface, grade, width, and places to rest are important objective trail descriptors. These specifics, however, are often missing from websites, signage, and trail maps, making the research harder than the trip itself.

Trail Finder’s Growing Database 
Lacking, incomplete, or outdated trail information is the first barrier that people encounter when trying to access the outdoors. Trail Finder is working to change that. 
Thanks to recent grant funding from the Vermont Department of Forests, Parks, and Recreation (FPR), including a $644,000 Vermont Outdoor Recreation Economic Collaborative (VOREC)  Community Grant supporting the Trail Accessibility Hub, the Trail Finder team has been able to improve the descriptions and maps for over 125 miles of accessible pedestrian trails on the site.
Routes of all types are continuously added, from rail trails to adaptive mountain biking. Website users can click the “Access(ible) Experience” search filter to find trails that offer greater levels of access. Through the Trailside Services feature, businesses can also get listed on Trail Finder, making it easier for trail users can find restaurants, nearby accommodations, gear rentals, and guide services. 
“Trail Finder’s work to develop and expand their database of accessible trails addresses a critical gap in communication about accessible outdoor recreation,” said Claire Polfus, Recreation Program Manager for the Vermont Department of Forests, Parks, and Recreation. “It’s about giving more people the confidence to explore Vermont’s outdoors.”
Managed and maintained by Hub partners Upper Valley Trails Alliance and Community Geographics, it’s one of the few free map-based trail databases in Vermont focused on increasing access to trails. 
“Unlike other trails apps and websites out there,” says Engle, “Trail Finder relies on 100% trail manager-approved content. Postings for accessible trails on the site receive extra attention and review from Trail Finder’s administrators to ensure consistency and accuracy.”
Hub partners are not only improving existing trail descriptions and adding new ones, but also developing resources for building accessible trails and sharing first-person stories that show what accessible outdoor recreation looks and feels like across Vermont.
Since 2024, the Hub has held over a dozen informational workshops and webinars for trail managers and completed 55 trail accessibility assessments with more than 30 organizations to evaluate pedestrian, aquatic, and adaptive mountain biking routes. These assessments are in demand and help trail managers identify the specific improvements needed to enhance access or meet established accessibility standards.
An accessibility assessment is conducted with Vermont Adaptive on a mountain biking trail to determine what upgrades need to be made to the trail.
More Voices on the Trail
Greg Durso, a wheelchair athlete and program director at the Kelly Brush Foundation, played a key role in creating a series of three tutorial videos on building adaptive mountain biking trails with Hub partner The Vermont Mountain Bike Association. 
“Adaptive mountain bikes are for people who want the thrill of trail riding,” Durso said. “The main goal of adaptive trails is to provide adaptive riders the same experience as two-wheel riders.”
New Hub resource pages built with input from trail users provide detailed information on how to build accessible pedestrian trails, mountain biking trails, and aquatic entry points, along with their benefits. 
A series of audio stories developed by the Hub helps people hear what access feels like. In one, Derek Flint, who is blind, describes kayaking with his family at Green River Reservoir in Hyde Park and how accessible launches make a difference. 
“Being on a kayak…it’s a sense of freedom. I used to be able to drive, and now I get a part of that back with kayaking,” he said.
In another, hand-cyclist and wheelchair user Edie Perkins talks about her visits to the Lamoille Valley Rail Trail. 
Trail Finder also hosts a growing set of trail accessibility blog posts, including two about Edie’s trips to Raven Ridge in Charlotte and Vermont Institute of Natural Science (VINS) in Quechee, and the confidence that comes with clear, accurate information.
“Everything felt thoughtfully designed for accessibility without losing that wild, natural feel,” Perkins shared in a post she recently wrote about VINS for Trail Finder. “The paths are subtle, the views are incredible, and the experience left me grinning ear to ear…the sense of peace was exactly what I’d hoped for.” 
Edie Perkins takes in the view from the end of the accessible trail at the Raven Ridge Natural Area, Monkton, Vermont.

Mike Jones of Richmond clinched the Democratic nomination Sunday evening for next month’s special election in Virginia’s Senate District 15, defeating Del. Debra Gardner, D-Chesterfield, in a firehouse primary. The spotlight now shifts to a January showdown for control of a key Virginia Senate seat.
Jones, first elected to the House in 2023, will face Republican John Thomas next month in a race Democrats view as critical to protecting their narrow 21–19 majority in the Virginia Senate. 
The solidly Democratic district, which covers parts of Richmond and northern Chesterfield County, is expected to be one of the first major tests of the party’s strength heading into the 2026 General Assembly session.
Sunday’s firehouse primary — a rapid, party-run process held under a compressed timeline after Lt. Gov.-elect Ghazala Hashmi resigned to prepare for her statewide post — drew steady turnout from local Democrats at three polling locations. Party leaders quickly rallied behind Jones after polls closed Sunday.
“Mike Jones has shown through his work and leadership that he is deeply committed to serving Virginians and tackling the everyday challenges families face,” Democratic Party of Virginia Chair Lamont Bagby, a state senator from Henrico, said in a statement. 
Jones, he said, “brings a steady, solutions-focused approach to public service, and he understands what it takes to make life more affordable and strengthen our communities. Keeping our Democratic majority in the Senate is critical to continuing that progress, and I look forward to serving with him in the Senate.”
Jones currently represents House District 77. If he wins the Senate seat on Jan. 6., the victory will immediately trigger another special election to fill his House seat.
Sunday’s primary followed an unusually tense week in what had been a brief nomination contest. 
As reported by Virginia Scope on Thursday, the campaigns of Gardner and Jones — once close political allies who often described each other as friends — came to blows after Gardner released a TV and digital ad focused on past allegations involving Jones and a 2024 protective-order case that was later dismissed by a judge.
The ad displayed old news headlines and asserted, “Mike Jones’ history of alleged violence toward women is shocking, dangerous and disqualifying.” 
Jones criticized the ad in an interview with the outlet, saying Gardner left out the full context of the case’s resolution. 
“I am honestly saddened that a member of my own party, someone who I thought was a friend, who I’ve talked in confidence with about this situation, would use portions of it for her political gain,” Jones said. 
Gardner’s campaign declined to answer questions from Virginia Scope about whether she was aware of the judge’s decision dissolving the protective orders.
Jones, meanwhile, spent more than $100,000 on his own advertising, running spots on Richmond-area TV and radio stations focused on “lowering costs, school funding and housing affordability.”
Top Democratic officials lined up behind both candidates in the final days of the race.
Hashmi was among the first to endorse Jones last month, calling herself “proud” to support him. Richmond Mayor Danny Avula backed Jones on Thursday.
Gardner, a former deputy county administrator, received endorsements from Senate President Pro Tempore Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, and Sen. Aaron Rouse, D-Virginia Beach. 
The special election was scheduled after Hashmi’s victory in the November statewide contest created a vacancy that needed to be filled before lawmakers return to Richmond in mid-January. 
Redrawn in 2021, Senate District 15 is safely Democratic but geographically split between Richmond and Chesterfield, with strong pockets of organized voter turnout. Hashmi won the seat by a decisive margin in 2023.
Thomas, the Republican nominee, is familiar to voters after challenging Gardner in House District 76 last month, a race he lost by more than 37 percentage points. 
With the nomination settled, Jones now has less than a month to focus on the general election and consolidate Democratic support.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)An influential Democratic-Farmer-Labor official in northern Minnesota has roiled the party by declining to resign as chair of Congressional District 8 despite being charged with criminal vehicular homicide.
The incident has split Democrats between those who believe due process should play out for the accused and those who believe a personal scandal will derail the goals of beleaguered Democrats in northern Minnesota.
On the evening of July 3, 2024, police in Itasca County responded to a report of a person lying in a lane of Highway 169, near Nashwauk. They found the body of 19-year-old Carter Haithcock, who was pronounced dead at the scene.
The next morning, 8th District DFL Chair Cyndy Martin called 911 and said that she may have been involved in a collision near Nashwauk the night before, according to the criminal complaint.
Martin, who declined the Reformer’s request for comment, pleaded not guilty last month to a felony count of criminal vehicular homicide. Martin faces up to 10 years in prison. Martin’s attorney, David Valentini, also declined to comment.
Martin is one of the most influential DFL figures in northern Minnesota. In addition to chairing the 8th District party, she sits on the DFL’s Constitution, Bylaws and Rules Committee. She’s also a successful fundraiser and has connections with statewide elected officials.
Minnesota Democrats have largely refrained from publicly commenting on Martin’s case and whether she should remain in party leadership. Local congressional district parties aren’t controlled by the state party, but state officials could call on or press Martin to resign.
Multiple DFL elected officials in the Northland didn’t respond or declined the Reformer’s requests for comment about Martin.
Last month, DFL Chair Richard Carlbom was asked at a Democratic listening session why someone charged with vehicular manslaughter should remain in party leadership.
Carlbom, after an awkward pause, said “there is due process in this country, and I’m not about to, like, somehow — I don’t know, people sometimes think I can just, uh, well, I’m gonna allow due process to play out.”
Carlbom echoed those comments in a statement to the Reformer.
“This was a tragic loss of life, and my condolences go out to Carter’s family and everyone affected by this heartbreaking situation. Because this is an active legal case, we’re not going to prejudge the judicial process,” Carlbom said.
But pressure could be mounting for Martin to resign. Minneapolis citizen journalist Taylor Dahlin is tracking the case closely, and some party activists want her out.
A mysterious email
Lee Cutler served as the 8th District DFL vice chair under Martin until March of this year. Cutler said he was good friends with Martin, but he felt that she should have resigned back in November 2024 when she was criminally charged.
He says that shortly after prosecutors charged Martin, he and Martin together drafted an email to the DFL’s 8th District delegates saying Martin had already resigned. The email was sent out from the local party’s email account.
“Unfortunately, our friend and leader Cyndy Martin has stepped down as chair due to personal matters,” Cutler wrote in the email sent out on Nov. 23, 2024.
In the email, Cutler directed delegates to tell reporters if they’re contacted that Martin is no longer the chair and that he’s the acting chair.
About three hours later, another email from the local DFL party’s account — purportedly written by Cutler —  told the delegates: Never mind.
“Please disregard the previous email that I recently sent out. There was a misunderstanding, and Cyndy Martin has not resigned from her position as CD 8 Chair,” the email said.
Cutler says he didn’t write the second email, even though his name is in the signature of the message. He says the second email made its way up to DFL leadership, and he suspects someone in the party sent out the second email under his name.
The details of the emails were first reported by the Duluth Monitor.
In March, Northland politics came under a microscope after former Minnesota Sen. Justin Eichorn was charged with attempted coercion and enticement of a minor. Shortly after he was arrested, Eichorn resigned from the Senate under immense pressure from his Republican colleagues.
Cutler said that Martin’s charge and Eichorn’s scandal are obviously different, but he said that as with Eichorn, Martin’s charge is a distraction.
“It’s tragic what happened. I’ve always felt that as a leader within the DFL, our role was to uplift the party, its goals and the candidates — not ourselves,” Cutler said. “Party leaders are meant to support that work in the background, so the story should never be about us. In the 8th District, we need to focus on electing a candidate who represents our party’s values and this situation only serves as a distraction from that work. Fighting within the party is never a good thing.”
Minnesota v. Martin
Martin told law enforcement in July 2024 that on the night of the collision, she attended a dinner and was driving home after her dinner concluded at about 10:30 p.m., according to court documents. While driving through Nashwauk in Itasca County, she hit something with her car, she told officers.
“She believed she struck an owl or a turkey. (Martin) stated she did not stop, and continued home,” the complaint reads.
Martin was speaking to someone on the phone at the time she allegedly hit Haithcock, according to the complaint. The police interviewed the caller, who said that Martin exclaimed “Oh my God. I hit something,” according to the complaint. The caller told Martin to call 911. Martin later called the person back and said nothing was wrong with her vehicle — something only hit her windshield.
A photo of Martin’s car taken by State Patrol troopers at her Grand Rapids home on July 4, 2024. Screenshot from court documents.
State patrol officers interviewed Martin at her Grand Rapids home the morning of the collision. Outside they found her teal Chevy Tahoe; the windshield was cracked and a headlight was  broken, and there was a piece of black fabric stuck between the hood and the frame, according to court documents.
The troopers asked Martin if she was drinking or on medications, and Martin told them she had an opioid prescription for knee pain, and she took one pill earlier in the day. Throughout the interview, the troopers said Martin exhibited mood swings and was “distraught, crying and upset at times,” according to court documents. Because of her behavior, the troopers decided to do a DWI investigation. Martin tested negative for controlled substances, including opiates.
The state and Martin’s defense agree that Haithcock was wearing dark clothing and “engaged in risky behavior” by walking in the highway, the state wrote in court documents.
Although the collision occurred in July 2024, Martin wasn’t charged with vehicular homicide until four months later. Itasca County Attorney Jacob Fauchald declined to tell the Reformer why.
Under state law, “the driver of any motor vehicle involved in a collision shall immediately stop the vehicle at the scene of the collision, or as close to the scene as possible, and reasonably investigate what was struck.”
The prosecution argues that Martin gave conflicting information about what happened.. She told officers that she believed she hit a bird and didn’t stop, while surveillance footage from a nearby gas station showed her stopping there for about 25 seconds.
The state argues that a jury could find that Martin didn’t conduct a reasonable investigation after the collision and doubt her claim of believing she hit an animal.
“There is a stark difference between an adult male and an owl or a turkey,” the state wrote in court documents.
Martin’s defense relies on whether she conducted an adequate investigation of the collision since she believed she only hit a bird.
Haithcock was 19 at the time of his death and had a young son.
“His passion was helping people who were going through hard times. He was caring, genuine and was such a funny sweet boy who took care of everyone. Carter had a great sense of humor and could make anyone laugh and was always, ‘Just Chillin,’” his obituary reads.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MG_8862-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-08 10:59:10.749814

(Photo illustration by Dean Mitchell via Getty Images)Drive through any town in northern New Hampshire and you’ll see older adults everywhere — opening shops each morning, volunteering at church fairs and food banks, checking in on neighbors, or caring for grandchildren while parents are at work. Older adults are the backbone of rural New Hampshire. They preserve local traditions, sustain civic institutions, and keep the social networks of small towns functioning.
But beneath these visible strengths lies an urgent reality: Many rural older adults are struggling to access even the most basic health and social supports they need to stay healthy, safe, and connected. 
New Hampshire is now one of the oldest states in the country, with nearly 21% of residents age 65 or older. Rural counties have even higher concentrations. These communities rely on small health systems, local nonprofits, and volunteers — but these systems, especially in the North Country, are stretched to the breaking point. 
Demand is surging at the same time that Medicaid and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits are being cut, insurance reimbursements do not keep pace with cost, there are workforce shortages, and service capacity lags behind. Appointments are scarce, waitlists are long, specialty care is limited, and transportation is unreliable or nonexistent.
This is not sustainable. And it will not improve unless the state begins listening to rural older adults and investing in the services they say they need most.
 Listening to the people most affected

As New Hampshire considers new funding models, federal waivers, and/or delivery-system reforms, one principle must guide every decision: Older adults must have a meaningful voice in shaping the programs designed to support them. Across the country, the most successful rural initiatives elevate local residents as partners — not passive recipients. 
New Hampshire’s rural older adults possess deep resilience, life skills and experience, and practical insight. Policymakers cannot afford to overlook their expertise. Without targeted investment, chronic illness will continue to erode the health of older adults and the stability of the rural communities that depend on them.
Chronic illness
For many rural older adults, chronic illness shapes daily life. Rates of heart disease, diabetes, COPD, arthritis, obesity, and dementia are significantly higher in rural areas nationwide. In New Hampshire, 53.9% of adults 65 and older live with four or more chronic conditions, and 44.4% of adults 75 and older report a disability. Managing these conditions requires consistent, coordinated care, yet distance, weather, limited home-care capacity, and primary-care shortages often make that impossible. Social drivers of health — including social isolation, food insecurity, and unsafe or unaffordable housing — further compound risk and escalate costs. Two approaches with especially strong evidence in rural settings that can address chronic illness are integrated primary care and community health workers.
A strong primary care system increases trust, improves outcomes, and reduces unnecessary emergency-department and inpatient use. It provides comprehensive, continuous, and coordinated care; reflects the population it serves; and connects patients to specialty care, behavioral health, and needed services.
Community health workers, or local residents trained to serve under the guidance of a primary care provider, help bridge the workforce gap, extend care into hard-to-reach areas, and support chronic-disease management. For every $1 invested, community health worker programs save an estimated $11 and reduce hospitalizations and non-emergency ER visits. This is precisely the kind of cost-effective, high-impact solution New Hampshire needs.
Prevent falls
Falls are one of the most preventable and costly threats to older adults. In 2022, New Hampshire recorded 272 fall-related deaths, 17,743 emergency-department visits, and more than $315 million in related costs. Evidence-based fall-prevention programs, home-safety assessments, physical therapy, and simple home modifications should be scaled immediately.
Support aging in place and improve chronic-care capacity
Most older adults want to remain in their homes and communities. Programs like Home and Community-Based Care and Choices for Independence help — but demand vastly exceeds workforce capacity. The state must strengthen and modernize these systems.
Additional proven models include:
PACE (Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly): Integrates medical, social, and long-term care for people 55 and older who meet nursing-home eligibility. PACE consistently reduces hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and admissions to long-term care — even for people with dementia.
Hospital at Home: Delivers hospital-level care — including IV therapy, daily clinical visits, and remote monitoring — directly in the home. Research in The New England Journal of Medicine shows it reduces complications, lowers costs, and shortens recovery time. For rural areas with limited beds and long travel distances, this model is a natural fit.
New Hampshire must also increase insurance reimbursement rates, develop housing for health care workers, expand mobile-health teams, and improve coordination between health care and community organizations. If approved, the state’s Rural Health Transformation Grant proposal could be pivotal in advancing many of these solutions.
Expand broadband infrastructure: Telehealth, mental-health visits, remote monitoring for chronic illness, virtual physical therapy, and Hospital at Home all depend on reliable broadband. Yet many rural towns still lack it. Broadband is not optional — it is core health infrastructure.
Reduce social isolation: In 2025, 25.5% of older adults in New Hampshire lived alone, with rural residents at highest risk. Loneliness increases depression, dementia, and mortality. Senior centers, library programs, congregate meals, volunteer networks, and Certified Community Behavioral Health Centers can help rebuild connection and address the mental health conditions associated with isolation and loneliness.
Ensure reliable transportation: Rural older adults face long travel distances, winter isolation, and limited public transit. Volunteer driver programs, demand-response transit, and community rideshare networks can help close these gaps.
Healthy older adults mean healthy rural communities
Investing in primary care, community health workers, fall prevention, chronic-disease management, home-based care, broadband, transportation, and social-connection programs is not simply compassionate policy — it is an economic and moral imperative. Older adults are not a financial burden. They are the heart of rural New Hampshire.
When older adults thrive, rural communities thrive. And when rural communities thrive, New Hampshire thrives.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/caregivingworkforce-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-12-08 10:59:10.749814

Whitmer will succeed Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear in the role, as Beshear was elected as the chair of the association. 
“In Michigan, we’ve shown that staying focused on the kitchen table issues — like costs, jobs, and roads — is a winning strategy,” Whitmer said in a press release from her Fight Like Hell PAC. “We flipped counties that voted for Trump like Macomb, Bay, and Eaton because we showed up and focused on what Michiganders needed to get ahead. As Vice Chair of the DGA, I look forward to taking what we’ve learned in Michigan to races across the country and helping candidates win tough races.”
The Democratic Governors Association is a political organization focused on electing Democrats in gubernatorial elections nationwide, as well as providing support for sitting Democratic governors. 
“We’ve proven that when we show up and focus on what we can do to make people’s lives better, then we can win anywhere, even in the toughest places,” Whitmer said in a press release from the association following the election.
Whitmer’s term will include the 2026 election cycle, in which 36 gubernatorial seats are up for election — 18 currently held by Democrats, including Michigan, and 18 by Republicans. 
“We also know with all the chaos coming out of Washington, D.C., it’s never been more important to elect Democratic governors,” she added in a video posted to X. “I know the stakes are high, but I know we can meet the moment and win.”
Whitmer stepped away from the National Governors Association earlier this year over what her office said were concerns about a lack of bipartisanship in the organization. 
Other Democratic governors who left the organization, including Govs. Tim Walz of Minnesota and Laura Kelly of Kansas, reportedly did so due to what they perceived as a lack of pushback to the policies of the Trump administration.

The issues came to a head after a group of nurses walked out in protest of the working conditions in October.
The Marshall Project – St. Louis spoke to over 40 people who have worked or lived at the prison. They reported rampant problems, including going weeks without medication, a lack of medical attention in solitary confinement and monthslong waits to get treatment or follow-up appointments for serious issues. 
Former and current staff at the prison lay the blame on Centurion Health, a private company that was awarded a contract in 2021 worth over $1 billion to provide health care for incarcerated people in Missouri. The state had sought a company to provide primary and specialty health care, medications, personnel and supplies and coordinate hospitalizations, the request for proposal said.

But staffing problems began to worsen in recent months after some personnel concerns. Employees allege that Centurion forced them to work long hours and extra shifts, creating a dangerous environment for them and their patients. 
Dana Long was a nurse in the infirmary, where sometimes she said she was caring for more than 20 patients on her own when there should have been at least an additional nurse. That meant juggling tasks such as administering IV antibiotics, taking vitals, changing wound dressings, helping those who were incontinent and, when she had time, updating medical records. 
Patients were in danger, she said. 
Long is one of several nurses who quit in early October. More have left since then. 
A corrections employee who asked not to be named out of fear of retaliation said the situation has gotten to the point where it’s causing unrest because people are frustrated. Daaron Harris, who is incarcerated, said people are feeling helpless, which creates hostility among the men and toward staff.
Missouri Department of Corrections officials declined a request for an interview with Warden Kelly Morriss. Department spokeswoman Karen Pojmann acknowledged that several health care professionals left in a short period, adding that Centurion brought in staff from other prisons to fill the gaps when the departures happened. She also said there is a team that monitors medical services. 
Pojmann referred other questions about staffing to Centurion. Officials there did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
State Rep. Gregg Bush, a Democrat from Columbia with a career in nursing, said he was beyond troubled by the allegations. He said he supports a review by the Missouri Legislature of any contractor that may not be meeting expectations.
In its contract proposal, Centurion officials boasted that its “corporate leadership team invests heavily in recruiting and human resources management systems to ensure full staffing.” According to the company’s website, there were 19 vacancies in mid-November of this year. Those included openings for a director of nursing and registered nurses, as well as a medication technician and mental health staff.
Caylin Marriott, a medical scheduler who worked at the facility in 2024, said she begged Centurion officials for help. A nurse who worked there until October, who didn’t want to be named because she’s looking for a new job, said their calls for staffing support were ignored. 
Nurses would go in for a shift without knowing when they would be able to leave because the next person might not show up and there are strict rules about leaving patients unattended, she said. Others said they were fired when they refused to work extra shifts.
In a resignation letter, Marriott said there was a toxic environment and she couldn’t let her mental health suffer longer. Another nurse wrote in her resignation letter that she left because “basic medical care and human dignity were routinely compromised.”
To get medical attention, people in prison fill out a health services request form. Ariane Todd, who worked at the facility until January, said they were “months and months and months” behind on addressing the forms. Marriott said there were stacks that had not been reviewed. People in solitary confinement went even longer without medical attention because their slips didn’t get picked up there on a regular basis, she added.
The forms for those outside of solitary are collected during sick call, a designated time they can seek medical attention.
Nineteen incarcerated men who spoke to The Marshall Project – St. Louis reported problems accessing care because sick call was canceled for weeks at a time. Several incarcerated men and corrections employees at the prison pinpointed that it had been over a month since it was last held.
A Centurion employee who didn’t want to be named out of a fear of retaliation said she’s seen patients who didn’t get proper care for infections or receive their cancer medication. 
The men in prison acknowledged that medical staff were overwhelmed. Most said the nurses were well-qualified and some went out of their way to help, though a couple were unprofessional. 
Two dozen incarcerated men told The Marshall Project – St. Louis that they had a difficult time getting their medication. Joseph Wilson, 52, fears he could have an embolism because he has gone several days without his blood thinners. 
“I really go into a panic,” he said.
Wilson shared a journal entry dated Sept. 10 that read, “So I’ve been out of my Eliquis since 9/6/25. I have done all I’m supposed to on my end but they haven’t issued me my monthly dosage cards. My Leg has begun to swell again.” 
Others reported not being able to get insulin, blood pressure medication or inhalers for various breathing disorders. Several said it was a long battle to get medical items like orthopedic shoes. Two former staff members confirmed there was an issue getting medical shoes ordered for patients. 
Many of the men said they relied on their loved ones to call and put pressure on Centurion or the Missouri Department of Corrections. In a November email, Tammy Mogab pleaded for help for her brother, a detainee there who was not getting his insulin. 
“I am very aware of the critical shortage of healthcare workers at JCCC but the essential medical needs of residents continue,” Mogab wrote.
Adequate health care is a longstanding issue in many prisons, but Deandre Pointer, who has been incarcerated for over two decades, said he’s never seen it this bad. He said there have been days when he hasn’t gotten his insulin and his blood sugar has bottomed out. 
Many of the men, especially those with chronic ailments, said a lack of medical attention means they are left in physical pain. The conditions also take a mental toll. One man said he was scared his liver cancer was spreading, but he hasn’t gotten an appointment to be seen yet. Those with lengthy sentences said they worry about getting older in the prison, which houses more than 1,830 people. 
Douglas Maupin, 69, said he got sepsis when a bleeding ulcer turned into an infection. He was transferred to a local hospital for a time before returning to the infirmary.
“It’s crazy down here,” he said.  
At least 14 of the incarcerated men interviewed by The Marshall Project – St. Louis said they submitted complaints that didn’t go anywhere. Joe Becker filed grievances when his finger was injured in 2021. When those didn’t help, he filed a lawsuit in July 2023. Court records show he received at least a dozen denials. Becker is one of several men who have open lawsuits regarding medical care at Jefferson City Correctional Center. Other cases involve allegations about scabies treatment, dental care and a catheterization procedure. 
Eugene Burrell has filed five complaints in the past year or so. He has also written to the assistant warden and the Department of Justice seeking help getting orthopedic shoes, according to documents reviewed by The Marshall Project – St. Louis. In a grievance dated Oct. 24, he wrote: “JCCC Medical Dept. has canceled ‘sick call’ for several weeks this month citing ‘staff shortage.’ I’ve attended three weeks hoping to obtain health care & a follow-up appt. to no avail.” 
In another complaint, he wrote that the lack of health care access “equates to neglect on behalf of the Department.”
In February, Zachary Smith submitted a complaint saying he had not received refills for his thyroid medication. In a response five months later, a nurse wrote that she had “discovered that all items have been ordered and will be issued as soon as they arrive.”
Eugene Crider, 56, said he was diagnosed with Guillain-Barré syndrome, a neurological disorder that can be fatal, and has been in the infirmary for over a year. At first, there was an aide who helped him, he said, but she’s gone. Nurses give him medicine to help him sleep, but otherwise, he relies on prisoners who have jobs in the infirmary to help him with daily tasks such as getting dressed and eating, though there are restrictions on what they can do to help. 
Crider said he’s been “laying here, day in and day out.” He said he wanted to know if Centurion and the Department of Corrections officials were inept or just didn’t care.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Conservation groups across the West are raising concerns about Steve Pearce, a former New Mexico representative who is President Donald Trump’s newest nominee to lead the Bureau of Land Management.
The nomination has reignited a fight over the management of public lands which was highlighted during negotiations over Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” due to proposed amendments to sell off federal land. The fight also spawned two new bipartisan caucuses in Congress, both co-chaired by Montanans, and predicated on public land access and management.
In Nevada, the BLM manages nearly 48 million acres of federal land, about 67% of the state. Nationwide, the BLM oversees 245 million acres of federal land, along with 700 million acres of subsurface rights for extraction and energy development, putting the position directly in the crosshairs of energy developers and outdoor industry groups.
According to the Center for Western Priorities, Pearce amassed a “lengthy anti-public lands record,” sponsoring bills to shrink national monuments and increase extraction on national forest land.
Many conservation groups are specifically honing in on Pearce’s long record of advocating to sell off federal lands, including sponsoring legislation in Congress to authorize land sales or exchanges with local governments.
In a letter to then-House Speaker John Boehner in 2012, Pearce wrote that of the federal lands located in the West, “most of it we do not even need.”
He proposed using land sales to reduce the deficit, similar to rhetoric heard earlier when Interior Secretary Doug Burgum equated federal lands to the nation’s “balance sheet.”
“We cannot afford to hand the keys to 245 million acres of our public lands over to someone who has spent his career trying to auction them off to the highest bidder,” Aubrey Bertram, staff attorney and federal policy director at Wild Montana, said. “Steve Pearce’s record is crystal clear: he believes public lands should be privatized for billionaires’ benefit, not protected for the people’s.”
But Pearce’s nomination has been greeted with enthusiasm by mining and energy companies that operate on federal land, as well as by many Republican officials, including Montana Sen. Steve Daines.
“I knew Steve in the House days, and Steve is a great pick. And I particularly like the fact that it’s a Westerner,” Daines said in an interview. “I think it’s helpful when we have leaders in those important positions that come from the West, when they understand uniquely the challenges we face as it relates to federal land, state land, private land. And Steve Pearce has lived it and breathed it.”
Daines is a member of the newly formed Senate Stewardship Caucus, which is co-chaired by Montana Sen. Tim Sheehy.
The two Montanans also bucked their party earlier this year by joining Senate Democrats in a resolution that would have prevented the use of public land sales to reduce the deficit.
Pearce has roots in the oil and gas industry that stretch beyond his political work.
In the 1980s, Pearce founded an oilfield services company in New Mexico, which he later sold when he won his first election.
Starting in 2003, he represented New Mexico in Congress for seven terms.
He lost races for the U.S. Senate in 2008 and governor in 2018.
While conservation and public land advocates have pushed back against Pearce’s nomination, industry groups have applauded Trump’s pick.
The National Cattleman’s Beef Association said Pearce’s experience makes him “thoroughly qualified to lead the BLM and tackle the issues federal lands ranchers are facing.”
The Western Energy Alliance, comprising oil and gas companies across nine western states, also put out a statement of support for Pearce.
“As a westerner coming from a state that’s nearly 20 percent BLM land, he understands the bureau’s mission. As a former congressman and chair of the Congressional Western Caucus, his record shows he’s been a champion of multiple-uses of public lands. Steve has been a longtime friend who understands the value of energy development among other uses,” the Alliance said.

(Image by Lela Seiler, courtesy of CCS Early Learning)The Alaska Supreme Court has ruled that the state’s child support system has first priority when a foreclosed property is sold to pay multiple debts.
The court issued its opinion on Nov. 28, resolving a long-running lawsuit brought by Global Federal Credit Union (formerly Alaska USA) against the state and several other defendants.
“This is a pretty important case from my client’s perspective,” said Jonathan Clement, a senior assistant attorney general who represented Alaska’s child support system.
“This is the first time that a court has actually decided that child support gets priority over all other judgment lien holders, even liens recorded earlier, when there’s surplus funds at issue,” he said.
The case decided by the court involved property in Eagle River that was mortgaged by Wells Fargo. In 2017, Global levied a lien against the property for unpaid debt. Shortly afterward, the state’s child support division recorded another lien against the property for unpaid debt.
Typically, liens are repaid in chronological order: First filed, first paid.
In 2018, a law firm sold the property through foreclosure and paid off the remaining Wells Fargo mortgage. There was money left over, but not enough to pay both Global and the state.
The state protested the law firm’s plans to pay Global first, and the firm complied with a state order that required it to pay the state first. 
Global sued in state court, but a district court judge and a superior court judge each ruled against the credit union before it appealed to the supreme court.
Writing on behalf of the court, Justice Jude Pate concluded, “Our interpretation of (state law) provides an effective priority for CSSD liens over competing judgment liens.”
Alaska’s Child Support Services Division (CSSD) is now known as the Child Support Enforcement Division (CSCD).
That priority doesn’t put the state above a bank holding a mortgage or “deed of trust” but it does give the state priority over other liens on the property.
 “The important thing for this case is that it gives CSCD another tool where they can try to collect money that’s owed by the obligors,” Clement said.
“I would say of all the cases I’ve worked on, this is the one that will have the most impact in my career going forward,” he said.
An attorney representing Global declined comment on behalf of the credit union. 
In a footnote attached to the case, Pate wrote that the court’s ruling could cause people to behave differently during foreclosure auctions.
He suggested that if the Legislature disagrees with the court’s interpretation, it might want to pass a law clarifying two conflicting statutes interpreted by the court.
“If our interpretation is contrary to the legislature’s intent,” he wrote, “amendments to the relevant child support statutes could clarify the interaction between child support liens, other liens, and mortgages.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/unnamed-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-08 10:59:10.749814

(Submitted) TOPEKA — The newly formed American Honey Institute will offer the honey industry the same opportunities and advocacy that other commodities currently have, one of its founders said.
Gary LaGrange, CEO of Valor Honey, said on the Kansas Reflector podcast that industry-wide challenges need to be addressed. The low price of honey makes it difficult for small producers to compete with imported honey, much of which has had cheap sweeteners added to it, he said.
“We also discovered that the industry as a whole did not have the power as other commodities have, wheat and soybeans and corn and cattle, and it was a bit more ad hoc,” LaGrange said.
Four years ago at an National American Honey Producers meeting, discussions began about creating the institute to focus on educating people about the importance of bees and the honey industry; to create a certification process for honey; to promote beekeeping as a therapeutic activity to help veterans and others; and to advocate on a national level, LaGrange said.
Through Valor Honey and its work teaching soldiers beekeeping skills as a way to help them manage post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, LaGrange has seen beekeeping transform lives. But when veterans wanted to take their skills and compete in the honey market, they couldn’t, he said.


“They could sell small quantities, but to get into the commercial, industrial side was difficult to them because the price of honey was so low, they couldn’t compete with the honey that was being put on the market by packers,” LaGrange said.
Packers buy imported honey, he said.
In 2021 and 2022, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration tested 144 samples of imported honey, finding that about 10% were adulterated with sweeteners. LaGrange said more consistent testing and enforcement is needed so consumers know what they are buying.
Brian McCornack, Kansas State University professor and and head of the Department of Entomology, joined LaGrange on the podcast to talk about the honey institute, which he will lead. LaGrange said K-State offers research capabilities along with the ability to communicate through its networks to support educational outreach.
McCornack said beekeepers lose about 40% to 50% of honeybees annually, but last year, reported losses were upward of 70% to 80%.
“Those kinds of loss losses for a managed pollinator like honeybees are not sustainable,” he said. “At the center of this is really the U.S. beekeeper. They make most of their living, especially the larger producers, through pollination services. So they’re moving, literally trucking bees, around the U.S. to provide valuable services for a lot of the commodities that we find in our grocery stores and our shopping carts. When you have those kinds of losses, and one of your primary incomes is pollination services, staying alive in that industry becomes very challenging.”
The formation of an institute to combine research, education, workforce development, communication, and testing for authenticity and integrity of honey was a perfect fit for K-State, McCornack said.
“Our beekeepers are in peril as well,” he said. “It’s not just about the bees. It’s making sure that beekeepers can thrive, and making sure that they’ve got a market that is fair.”
Valor Honey and K-State are joined by the American Beekeeping Federation and the American Honey Producers as partners in the institute.
“The two largest beekeeping orgs in the U.S. coming together on this particular topic, to me, is what really keeps me inspired on a daily basis,” McCornack said. “If everybody has an important message and sings their song the loudest, and they’re not singing from the same sheet of music, as Gary often says, then it’s really hard to know what to really focus on.”
Bringing the primary organizations together to discuss the issues will help the industry create a plan and find solutions, McCornack said.
LaGrange said the honey industry has flown under the radar, often because people don’t understand the importance of pollination.
“Most people think that honey comes out of a hive or two in the backyard, and they just don’t understand the industry,” he said. “They don’t understand the importance of bees and pollination. Without them, we would be paying a whole lot more for fruits and vegetables and other commodity crops that they pollinate. Honey is really tertiary in that process.”
LaGrange, 83, spent 28 years in the Army and served three tours in Vietname. Since founding Valor Honey, he’s made it his life to support veterans and others who need help through teaching them about beekeeping. Founding the American Honey Institute is the next step in helping soldiers.

“To help these young men and women find find their way, to keep them from suicide, to get them out of this post traumatic stress syndrome, and get them out of these other issues that come with war — it’s so important to see that happen on a recurring basis with those we work with,” LaGrange said. “It’s just a wonderful thing. What good does it do if they can’t get into the industry that’s profitable, if they can’t find work that’s profitable? So it all ties together, and that’s why we intend for all of the functions of this institute to get as much as possible under one roof.”
Packers, consumers and others involved in the industry are part of the solution, he said.
McCornack said answers won’t be easy to find. There are no standards for honey currently, a process needs to be worked out for testing and even determining the definition of honey, and all of the work needs to be research-based.
“There are politics involved in the changes that need to be made,” he said. “Anytime you bring up the word ‘regulation’ or policy or law, I think that gets people nervous, and that can be expected.”
McCornack said the institute will maintain its focus on the goals of stabilizing the industry for beekeepers and for consumers, who should know what is in the honey they’re buying.
“I hear this from Gary a lot — honeybees are the canary in the coal mine,” McCornack said. “It’s just whether or not we’re willing to listen. And they’re telling us a lot here these last couple years, this last year in particular.”
LaGrange and McCornack easily list stresses on the bee population, from mites to lack of floral resources to chemicals.
As they tackle those problems, both men keep at the forefront the work being done with veterans and others.
“The fact that working with honeybees has the merit of being able to save a life, that’s very special,” LaGrange said. “With all these young men and women whose lives we have helped, we’re making more than a marginal contribution to the problem we have in this country with suicides today, particularly among veterans and now others, maybe farmers and first responders. That’s pretty special.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Beekeeping4-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-12-08 09:56:33.828196

Members of the Van Gilder family, which owns the land under consideration for the rezoning and runs a community Facebook page for the project, said on social media Sunday that it pulled the request, upholding their responsibility to be good stewards of the land.
“That responsibility matters deeply to us and while we believe we put forth the best proposal, we also heard from many of you that more study was needed,” the family said on Facebook. “As a result, we believe the right thing to do now is to honor the current moratorium, which will give the township and its residents the time needed to develop thoughtful, well-considered regulations for any future data centers.”
The Howell Township Board of Trustees planned to hear the request tonight at its Monday meeting.

Howell Township is one of a growing number of communities in Michigan raising questions on how they will be impacted if one of these facilities is built within their community as a project reportedly backed by Meta, the parent company for Facebook and Instagram, is planned on more than 1,000 acres of farmland.
Breanne Green, with Stop the Data Centers Livingston County, a leader in the movement to prevent data centers from flourishing, said the withdrawal of the request was a tactical victory but was not a final decision.
“The community will continue to show up, and we expect the Township to protect residents and uphold the master plan. We’re not backing down,” Green said in a statement. “Residents spoke up, that’s what made a difference. But it’s also clear the developer plans to return as soon as they believe they have influenced the process or changed the board’s mind. This is far from over.”
Howell Township Board Trustee Bob Wilson also confirmed that the rezoning application will no longer be before the board on Monday evening. Wilson told Howell-based WHMI-FM that the board received an email about the withdrawn application.
Jonathan Hohenstein, the township board’s treasurer, also told the station that the application was on hold as the township and board worked on regulations for data centers.
“We will still be having a meeting to address the definition of data processing and to allow the public to speak should they still wish,” Hohenstein wrote to the station.

,Mississippi Today,2025-12-08 14:40:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Mississippi State rolled out changes to campus parking. Some students say they can’t afford it,Candice Wilder,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/08/mississippi-state-campus-parking/,Recent changes to campus parking at Mississippi State University are unexpected expenses some students struggle to pay.,"STARKVILLE — Since transferring to Mississippi State University from Itawamba Community College in 2022, the cost of parking on campus has always been an issue for Madeline Comer. 
Last spring, Comer got a $50 parking ticket because her license plates weren’t registered properly with the university’s parking services, she said. Comer, a junior studying graphic design, called to dispute the ticket. 
For weeks, she couldn’t reach anyone on staff, she said. Two weeks after the first ticket, she received another $50 ticket for the same issue. She was afraid of racking up other parking citations that might result in progressively higher fines and a “boot” or wheel clamp. 
The citations would have strained her monthly budget as she juggles rent, art supplies for classes, groceries and other bills. 
After weeks of back and forth, parking services dropped the ticket. Comer felt relieved.
Then in July, university officials announced a major parking overhaul that included restructuring campus zones, revamping prices and implementing new tier systems to purchase parking permits. 
Comer knew parking fees would be even more of a problem. But she lucked up. 
She bought a $225 annual commuter parking permit after waiting nearly four hours in an online lottery to apply for her pass, unlike many of her peers, who ended up on a lottery waitlist or getting a pricier permit outside of their desired spot. The annual parking permits can cost up to $650.

Her parking spot is in G3, a lot near Humphrey Coliseum, where the Bulldogs’ basketball teams play. But Comer’s parking spot is nowhere near the majority of her classes in Hunter Hall. She lives 15 minutes from campus, outside of Starkville, and commutes four times a week. 
Weekly costs for gas are now adding up, Comer said.
“It’s just a lot for my bank account to handle,” she said. “Not to mention the rent, groceries and art supplies I also pay for out of pocket.” 
Comer, who is paying for college on her own, works multiple part-time jobs. She is a house cleaner for Airbnb, a barista at a coffee shop and has taken on multiple side hustles as a freelancer, selling her art and designs online. 
Covering unexpected college costs
Mississippi undergraduates leave university with an average of $29,000 of federal loan debt, according to a 2021 report from the Institute of College Access & Success.
The rising cost of in-state tuition over the past few decades, along with additional costs of campus meal plans, textbooks and class supplies, laboratory fees, transportation and off-campus housing have made attending university expensive.

At Mississippi State, tuition has increased slightly in each of the past four years, including a nearly 4% rise from $9,815 in 2023-2024 to $10,202 in 2024-2025 academic year, according to data from the National Center for Education Statistics. 
On-campus housing starts at $8,456, and meal plans are $5,808 a year — a total of $24,000 for a full academic year. For out-of-state students, costs can soar up to $42,000 a year. 
While the cost for books and supplies have steadied over the past year, the cost of food and housing for students living on and off campus has steadily increased year to year. Data from NCES shows nearly a 5% increase in food and housing expenses and a 4% increase in other expenses between 2023-2025. 
Mississippi State officials said its new parking system allows students to pay less for a permit with guaranteed space, while other universities in the state do the opposite.
“The inherent value of our permit is significantly higher than that of our peers,” Sid Salter, a university spokesman, said in an email.
By comparison, parking permits at the University of Southern Mississippi are $167 for students and $414 for reserved spaces, according to the university’s parking and transit services website. At the University of Mississippi, parking permits for students are $395 for the 2025-2026 academic year. 
But for some students at Mississippi State, the price change for campus parking is just another cost to their already lean budgets.
Kenneth McGowan, senior studying computer engineering, said college students can quickly tally hundreds or up to $1,000 a semester in unexpected expenses. He felt blindsided by the price changes to parking, tuition and dining plans upon returning to campus this semester. He said he had to come up with more than $3,000 extra to get through the year.
McGowan isn’t alone. Nationwide, students reported some level of surprise with the full cost of attending college, including but not limited to tuition and other directly billable expenses, according to survey results from Inside Higher Ed’s Student Voice report. At least a quarter of students have trouble budgeting as a result, according to the report. 
In another set of findings in Inside Higher Ed’s report, 36% of students said an unexpected expense of $1,000, or even less, could threaten their ability to stay enrolled. Another 22% said the same of an expense between $1,001 and $2,500. 
The College Board estimates that indirect expenses can make up 40%–50% of the annual cost for undergraduates. The average full-time undergraduate spends $1,240 per year on books and supplies, according to the College Board report. An estimated 91% of American colleges fail to tell students the full cost of their college education, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office. 
To make up for extra college related expenses, McGowan spends his free time with gigs including food pickup and delivery for GrubHub, UberEats and Door Dash. He also picked up another job as a FANgineer, working for catering and event services during Mississippi State football games. 
“The whole thing, it’s just kind of frustrating,” McGowan said of unexpected expenses. 
McGowan said he bought a $225 parking pass for the year. It was another hit in his budget, but he considers himself lucky. He parks his car near Sanderson Center, the student recreation hub, which is near the heart of campus. His engineering classes in McCain Hall are another 10-15 minute walk across campus.

Eli Rowell, a senior studying graphic design, paid $650 for a North Garage parking permit. He was shut out of the lottery process once the university ran out of his preferred parking lot spot: G3, near Howell Hall. 
Rowell works part time as a bartender at Harvey’s restaurant in Starkville to pay for college. He received a scholarship when he transferred from Hinds Community College, but he is paying out of pocket for his next three semesters.
Mississippi State does a “decent job” of breaking down costs for attending the university, Roswell said. But research and transparency from university scholarship and financial aid offices are just as important, he said. 
“Education should be accessible to more people,” Rowell said. “Understanding where your money is going is important. The more information you have about costs, the better you are able to navigate your college experience.” 
McGowan said he wishes the university would be more transparent about price changes. He said he doesn’t know anyone in his friend group who had to pay less due to the changes made at Mississippi State. 
“I just don’t understand the reason or purpose behind it,” McGowan said of increased costs. “MSU used to be affordable.” 
Mississippi State officials said they’ve worked to modernize and improve the parking system to accommodate population growth and changing campus infrastructure. The changes were also to reduce heavy traffic, enhance pedestrian and cyclist safety, and increase usage of existing parking spaces. 
“The plan has worked as it was designed to work,” Salter said. 
This year, MSU sold parking permits on a tiered system, with different prices assigned to parking zones based on proximity to campus and desirability. The most convenient spots at the heart of campus, aside from North Garage, cost $375 for residents and $275 for commuters. Permits for North Garage, located at the center of campus, cost $650.

For commuters, parking breaks down into four tiers, with the lowest level costing $100 to park on the outskirts of campus. Resident parking breaks down into three tiers, with the lowest level costing $150. 
Mississippi State officials were aware of the criticism from students, faculty and residents, including several petitions calling for the resignation of Jeremiah Dumas, executive director of parking services. 
“Parking is a hot-button topic, so such unfair criticism is neither unexpected nor unusual,” Salter said. “The university will continue to work and adjust as necessary to fix issues, but there are none we plan to address. Things are functioning smoothly.”  
It is unclear how much the university profits off of campus parking, but the revenue is used to cover the cost of parking operations, which is more than $2 million, Salter said. It costs an average of $5 million a year to maintain the parking lots and roads on campus, Salter said. 
‘Spending every penny’ to pay for college
Mississippi State offers resources for students who need short-term loans, food security resources, temporary housing assistance and access to devices such as laptops. The university also helps students find on-campus and part-time employment. 
When Comer moved to Starkville, she opted to not buy a parking pass. It was expensive. To save money, she walked 40 minutes from her apartment to classes, trudging along with her portfolio and art supplies. 
“It wasn’t much  fun in the heat and heavy rain. But I made it work,” Comer said. 
She tried taking public transportation, but a bad experience left her not wanting to ride the bus. During Comer’s first year, she was dropped off at a random location on campus and had to find her way back on her own. 
She worked multiple shifts waitressing at a local sports bar to save up for a car.  
Comer doesn’t want to slam her university; she enjoys attending Mississippi State. But she said as someone who is “spending every penny” to put herself through college, speaking up on behalf of other students can make a difference for future students. 
“Parking may seem small to some people,” Comer said, “but it’s just these little costs that make it really hard and often feel like, if you don’t have money, college isn’t for you.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/19120758/3X0A2039.jpg,,,2025-12-08 09:56:33.828196

(File photo by Getty Images)The Medical University of South Carolina’s hospital system is asking legislators for $350 million for its planned new cancer hospital.
The hospital’s governing board in April approved plans for a top-tier cancer center in downtown Charleston, next to Rutledge Tower on MUSC’s campus.
At the time, MUSC Health did not say how much the hospital would cost. Now it’s turning to the General Assembly in hopes of getting taxpayer dollars to cover the bill instead of taking on debt to build it.
The ask comes as MUSC chases a Comprehensive Cancer Center designation from the National Cancer Institute.
If approved, the center would be the first of its kind in South Carolina. Patients seeking this top level of care currently must travel out of state to centers in North Carolina, Georgia and Tennessee.
The state-owned hospital system’s cancer hospital holds a tier-two designation as a Clinical Cancer Center. The bump in rankings could mean a bump in National Cancer Institute research grant support — as much as $14 million over five years compared to the $11 million, five-year grant it holds now.
“This investment is crucial for South Carolina, as it facilitates the development of lifesaving treatments, attracts top-tier scientists and jobs, and advances innovations to reduce the state’s cancer burden and mortality rates,” the budget application reads.
The hospital system anticipates a “strong” return on the investment but did not provide further details in its application.
South Carolina is below the national rate in terms of number of cancer cases, according to National Cancer Institute data, but the state has a higher mortality rate from the deadly disease.
There are 57 Comprehensive Cancer Centers in the country. MUSC would apply for its designation in 2028 and the center would open in 2030.
To reach the next level, the cancer center must increase the depth and breadth of its research and broaden its community reach.
The Legislature set aside $5 million worth of recurring payments in the current budget to help pay for the designation effort. That’s on top of $10 million in recurring payments, which the hospital system has received annually since 2022.
SC-owned hospital system set to double debt with 2 new hospitals

The existing center already boasts more than 230 researchers with a more than $50 million portfolio and more than 200 clinical trials, according to the hospital system’s budget application
When MUSC announced the new center, hospital leadership said it would likely have 50 to 100 beds for inpatient treatment but will also house outpatient care. Services will include surgeries, stem cell transplantation, dedicated CT and MRI scanners, chemotherapy and radiation, a lab and pharmacy, as well as pain management and rehab.
In addition to the new center on the peninsula, MUSC is standing up clinics around the state. The hospital system broke ground in September on a clinic in Summerville and it has announced plans for a similar facility in Florence. Leadership also has suggested Orangeburg as a possible clinic location.
Doctors diagnose an average of 780 people with cancer each year in Florence County, according to data from the state Department of Public Health. In Orangeburg County, that number is 519, with breast, prostate and lung cancers being the most common.
MUSC has been on an expansion spree the last several years.
In 2019, the hospital system purchased four rural community hospitals in Florence, Marion, Chester and Lancaster counties and, with the latter two, saw firsthand the growth potential in communities near the North Carolina state line.
In 2021, it again expanded with the purchase of three hospitals and a standalone emergency room in the Midlands. And in 2023, it took over operations of Orangeburg’s hospital.
MUSC Health weighing deal for control of struggling Grand Strand hospitals

A five-member state financial review panel gave the hospital system permission in April to borrow $860 million: $400 million to build a hospital in Summerville’s mega Nexton community, $330 million to build a hospital in Indian Land (the unincorporated panhandle of Lancaster County), and $130 million to finance the equipment for both.
And in September MUSC and Tidelands Health were still finalizing a deal for the state-owned system to take a controlling interest in the Grand Strand area hospitals. Financial details of that deal have yet to be made public.
All of that is on top of a planned purchase by MUSC of Roper St. Francis’ hospital on the peninsula.
The price of that deal will be decided in 2029, when Roper is scheduled to move to a new North Charleston location. In 2022, the Legislature set aside $15 million to help MUSC buy Roper’s to-be-vacated property.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lung-cancer-concept-1024x666.jpeg,,,2025-12-08 09:56:33.828196

Maynard says the administration is not moving quickly enough to inform the public about dire revenue forecast[...]","EPISODE INFO

HOST: Jennifer Smith
GUEST: Greg Maynard, the Boston Policy Institute







AMERICA MIGHT RUN on Dunkin’, but Boston runs on property taxes. Some 70 percent of the city’s $4.8 billion operating budget depends on levies from residential and commercial properties, which means pandemic-era shifts in work patterns have pushed the burden away from the downtown towers and toward homeowners. 
While this broader workplace and commercial value change is not Mayor Michelle Wu’s doing, her critics argue that a second consecutive double-digit residential tax hike should not be used to ramp up pressure on a struggling commercial sector. Beyond that, they say, the city sat on its potential 2026 tax rate numbers until late in the year when lawmakers were out of formal session.  
Wu announced last week that the city expected residential property taxes to rise 13 percent while the commercial sector could expect an average 4.4. percent drop next year. Since the Boston City Council must vote on Wednesday to approve the new tax rates, she coupled the announcement with a plea for lawmakers and business groups to back Boston’s plan, withering on Beacon Hill, that would shift the property tax burden away from residents and cap the annual increase at 9 percent. 
While these numbers are “surprising today,” the process of releasing the valuations so late in the year highlights a “mismatch between how much information City Hall has and how much information everyone else in this conversation has,” said Greg Maynard, executive director of the Boston Policy Institute, on The Codcast. 
“These are numbers that the city has had all year long. These are numbers that the city has been using all year long. These numbers are used to create the budget that was passed back in June,” said Maynard, whose think tank has a prickly history with Wu. He joined CommonWealth Beacon reporter Jennifer Smith to discuss the tax hike rollout. 
The mayor is currently trading shots with state Sen. Nick Collins of South Boston, who made similar claims about Wu’s timeline in releasing estimates.  
According to WBUR, Wu slammed any “accusations” that her administration withheld or obfuscated the numbers, saying elected officials’ “first responsibility” is to be “honest with our constituents.” 
Last year, Wu’s home rule petition to shift the tax burden toward commercial properties over a three-year period crashed and burned on Beacon Hill, with no hearing in the state Senate and the chamber’s leadership notably cool on the proposal. 
Business leaders, who initially agreed to the home rule’s language as a compromise, justified withdrawing support because of a discrepancy between Boston’s alarming estimates in the fall on the looming residential tax hike and the ultimate certified numbers. In a press briefing last week, administration officials noted that they were very confident about the accuracy of their assessments this year and released a letter announcing the numbers were certified on Friday. 
Maynard called the last-minute push a deliberate move from the city. “This is an issue that’s been warned about for years,” he said of the declining commercial values and their impact on city budgets. “The kinds of questions about, ‘How should Boston respond to this?’ is a conversation that can be had over a long period of time, and it’s a choice that’s been made by this city council, by this mayoral administration, to not have it over a longer period of time — to concentrate it, to manufacture this crisis.” 
On the episode, Maynard discusses the foundation of the property assessments (2:20), how the Wu administration has responded to the commercial downturn (7:00), and the prospects for a third try at the home rule tax shift (20:15).",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/The-Codcast_Wide-Banner.png?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-08 09:56:33.828196

(Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A Nebraska lawmaker two times was denied entry to the controversial state-run federal immigration detention facility that federal officials dubbed the “Cornhusker Clink” —  and now is calling on the Legislature’s Executive Committee to step in.
State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha said Monday that she made the four-hour trip to McCook in mid-November to check out the conditions of the place where migrant detainees of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement are held pending deportation.

She argues that the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services violated state law by not allowing her into the converted Work Ethic Camp, and cites a state statute that says Nebraska legislators are entitled to visit any state correctional facility “at any time.”
When Gov. Jim Pillen and Corrections Director Rob Jeffreys announced the agreement with the federal government, Cavanaugh said, they stated that the department would manage the property and it would continue to be considered a state facility.
“The denial of physical entry to a sitting senator is not only unprecedented — it is the latest escalation in a broader pattern of obstruction that undermines the Legislature’s statutory and constitutional oversight obligations,” Cavanaugh said.
The Omaha senator said she routinely conducts unannounced visits to state-run 24-hour facilities “because direct oversight is not optional — it is a core responsibility of my job.”
She said she specifically wanted to visit the McCook ICE detention center, because it involved “people being held in Nebraska without criminal charges and, in many cases, without clear legal recourse.” The immigration court and deportation process is separate from state courts, and immigrants held by ICE often face civil versus criminal charges.
“When the state deprives someone of their liberty, the conditions of that confinement must be subject to full public and legislative scrutiny,” she told the Nebraska Examiner. “There is no scrutiny. There is no carve-out in Nebraska law for secrecy just because ICE is involved.”
Neither the Corrections Department nor the Governor’s Office had immediate comment. 
Cavanaugh documented her efforts to gain entry to the former WEC in a letter to State Sen. Ben Hansen, chair of the Legislature’s Executive Board, and Sen. Myron Dorn, chair of the Legislative Oversight Committee. 
She also chronicled five prior legislative attempts to obtain information about the project, describing a pattern of “limited transparency and restricted information.”
Email between Cavanaugh and Jeffries and a person she described as a warden at the McCook facility offers details of the rejected visits on Nov. 12-13.
According to the email exchange: 
Cavanaugh arrived at the facility around 4:20 p.m. Nov. 12, and apparently spoke to Jeffries via the warden’s cell phone around 4:30 p.m., who told her she had failed to provide notice of her visit. 
Said Jeffries: “You were instructed that no person could arrive unannounced and be given immediate entry to a Nebraska correctional facility or a federal detention center.”
Cavanaugh, in an email around 10 p.m. that night of Nov. 12, emailed the warden and Jeffries that she would be returning to the facility the next morning.
“Though statute 83-186 (attached) does require me to provide notice, I am giving you this notice per my conversation with Director Jeffries on Warden Sommer’s cell phone at approximately 4:30 p.m. today, when Director Jeffries informed me that I had failed to provide notice of my visit.”
Jeffries later wrote to Cavanaugh to “clarify the legal position” of the department as to why she was not allowed to enter. 
“It is the fundamental nature of corrections, safety protocols and operations, and consistent with Nebraska law, that unannounced visitors of any type cannot be accommodated.”
He said her communication alerting them that she’d be there again Nov. 13 was “short notice” and “again a problem.”
Of Cavanaugh’s legal justification for her visit, Jeffries said in email that his team “worked to analyze your request, get legal advice and collaborate with our federal partners.”
“We have come to the determination that you will not be allowed to enter the WEC until you have complied with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement protocols related to detention center visits and provided sufficient notice to allow for the safe conduct of a visit.”
He also said that statute 83-186 “does not displace protocols for the security and safety of corrections facilities.” He said his team read that statute “in harmony with the statutory scheme of which it is a part.”
Cavanaugh, in the letter to Hansen and Dorn, said she reviewed the state’s contract with ICE and believes it provides that any “provision of this agreement contrary to applicable statutes … is null and void and shall not necessarily affect the balance of the agreement.”
“This means that the right of access provided in 83-186 invalidates any interpretation that members of the Legislature may be prohibited from accessing the facility.”
Cavanaugh said the documented history demonstrates that legislative leaders “have repeatedly sought access to accurate, timely information” on the project and its implications. 
She said the Executive Board oversees all legislative services and employees and hears matters of “general import to the Legislature and its operations as a whole.”She said Jeffreys actions were a “direct disregard” of the Legislature and its constitutional authority.
“I urge you … to act to defend the authority of the legislative branch. Such action is necessary to ensure we can effectively represent our constituents and the people of Nebraska.”

The California Highway Patrol graduated 780 new officers this year, including more than 130 cadets on Friday, underscoring the success of the agency’s recruitment push during a once-concerning vacancy rate.
Grappling with vacancies that ballooned 94% between 2015 and 2023, the agency in 2022 asked for $2 million from the state Legislature to hire more officers and launched a recruitment campaign known as the CHP 1000. In recent years, it also received some of its highest pay raises for officers, securing a 7.9% wage increase in 2023 and a $489-million, three-year labor contract in 2024.
Since those efforts kicked off, the agency hired more than 2,300 officers from 2022 and is on track to increase hiring by more than 60%, reports The Sacramento Bee. Applications also jumped by 52% — from more than 16,000 in 2022 to nearly 25,480 in 2024, according to the agency. This year, the CHP is on track to receive more than 33,000 applications.

Gov. Gavin Newsom, in a statement: “As we close out the year, California continues to make real progress — strengthening protections across the state while staying focused on the needs of the people we serve.”

The hiring surge comes as the governor is deploying CHP “crime suppression” teams in six California regions, following similar state intervention efforts in 2024 in Oakland, Bakersfield and San Bernardino. 
Though Newsom denied the teams were expanded in response to what the Trump administration called a crime crackdown in Democratic-led cities, enforcement activity from San Francisco police has reportedly ramped up due to potential threats of federal intervention.

Debating CA’s AI data centers

Artificial intelligence proponents and skeptics of the technology’s promised benefits clashed over how California should approach AI data centers at a recent CalMatters’ event moderated by reporter Alejandro Lazo.
The Nov. 18 panel discussion included Liang Min, the managing director of Stanford University’s Bits & Watts Initiative, who said that forecasting the state’s electricity demand is difficult because since new AI apps roll out quickly. He argued that as AI puts more demands on the grid, the state will need to rely on other sources of power, such as nuclear, geothermal or natural-gas energy.
The explosive growth of data centers are also raising environmental concerns, as well as concerns from utility watchdogs that Californians may end up footing the bill for billions of dollars in grid upgrades. But AI supporters say overregulation could stifle competition in the state.

Ahmad Thomas, CEO of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group: “It’s very hard to see a world where California is at the top of the AI pile if we do not have an approach to data centers that is — at minimum — mildly competitive with other states.”

One politician’s fight against pollution

Before voters elected her to the San Diego County Board of Supervisors in July, Paloma Aguirre spent two decades trying to mitigate Tijuana River’s sewage contamination, writes CalMatters’ Deborah Brennan. 
Considered by Aguirre to be one of the worst environmental crises in the country, Tijuana River pollution dates to at least the 1930s. As the population grew in the border Mexican city, its waste exceeded what cross-border sewage plants could handle. In the early 2000s, sewage spills and beach closures along the southern San Diego coast became common. Contamination in the ocean leaves swimmers with illnesses, and toxic gas emissions near the river give residents headaches and nausea.
As the former mayor of Imperial Beach, Aguirre urged California and the federal government to declare a state of emergency over the pollution problem and lobbied to classify the area as a Superfund site. Once she became a county supervisor, she led plans to study the health effects of the pollution, and requested $50 million from the state to help ease the problem in a particularly contaminated area known as the Saturn Boulevard hot spot.

Aguirre: “The river is carrying dangerous chemicals, pollutants, pathogens and toxic gases that are impacting South San Diego communities.”

In a year of profound shifts at the federal level, uncertainty has been the name of the game across the United States. Nowhere is that truer than in the California water world.
Over many decades, the state has forged a symbiotic relationship with federal agencies to manage its notoriously complex — and aging — water system. The state has worked with an alphabet soup of federal agencies to manage some of the worst floods and droughts the state has ever seen. 
Research and technical expertise undergird all water-related activity in California, whether you’re a farmer applying water to your crops, a utility providing clean drinking water to your customers or a municipality trying to protect your community from floods. 
Fortunately the state is blessed with top-notch water experts, hailing from state and federal agencies, universities, consulting firms and nongovernmental organizations. They’re responsible for many of the tools the state uses to manage its water. Any California water action relies on decades of applied research and experienced people to implement it.
Changes at the federal level have put this tight state-federal partnership in doubt. 
The dust has yet to settle on the cuts — including the impact of the recent shutdown — but the effects are already being felt, just as storm season gets underway in California. These cuts already are impacting flood forecasting and emergency response. 
The California-Nevada River Forecast Center is reducing the frequency of its flood predictions. And staff reductions of emergency responders and at regional National Weather Service offices mean fewer people will respond to extreme weather events, which puts Californians at risk. 
The loss of institutional expertise is harder to quantify, though it’s vital to managing droughts and floods, protecting human health and restoring ecosystems.
The state must keep water flowing for the wellbeing of California’s residents, economy, and ecosystems. It’s equally important to be ready for droughts, floods, fires and other natural hazards.
Fortunately, in recent years, Californians have come together to find pragmatic solutions to water problems. 
Voters have shown they are all in on water, with most passing bond measures that fund crucial work. Partnerships once considered impossible — between agriculture and environmentalists, or cities and farms — are becoming the gold standard in this state. 
Research is helping us use scarce water wisely.
In a recent report, we at the Public Policy Institute of California make recommendations for where research dollars should go. We need to keep better track of our water, find new ways of funding big projects and develop new tools for the new problems we’re facing.
“California’s farms, communities, and ecosystems would all benefit from more accurate and timely systems to track how rain and snowmelt move through soils, vegetation, groundwater, rivers, and wetlands,” the study says.
“Just as important are improved tools to monitor and measure water use — across agriculture, cities, and the environment — so that managers can respond quickly and effectively to changing conditions. Without these systems, water planning, management, and emergency services are all hamstrung.”
The challenges confronting California water are not going away. The state will need to step up to fund and maintain the technical expertise needed to manage our water systems.
Now is the time to double down on research. The governor, the Legislature and researchers can work collectively by setting priorities, allocating funds and collaborating with other western states.

In San Jose, supporters see jobs and investment, while a key ratepayer advocate worries customers could end up paying for upgrades.","In summary
Artificial intelligence and its growing demand for data centers are putting new pressure on California’s electric grid. In San Jose, supporters see jobs and investment, while a key ratepayer advocate worries customers could end up paying for upgrades. 


San Jose, the symbolic capital of Silicon Valley, is now ground zero in California’s battle over how to govern the rise of data centers used to power artificial intelligence.
The county seat of Santa Clara is touting its partnership with Pacific Gas & Electric, claiming the city is “the West Coast’s premier destination for data center development.” The investor-owned utility now estimates it has enough capacity in its planning pipeline to push the city’s electricity use to almost three times its current peak.
Those plans are forcing major grid upgrades, PG&E and city officials say, while raising questions about who pays for them and whether the state can keep the power clean.
Panelists at a CalMatters event in downtown San Jose clashed over key issues. They included a local official working with PG&E on the city’s data-center buildout, a tech advocate urging California to seize the economic moment, a Stanford energy expert pressing for a more modernized grid and a utility watchdog skeptical of AI’s promised benefits.
Their discussion centered on how quickly California should move to accommodate new demand, what information the public should be entitled to and how to keep customers from shouldering the cost of infrastructure that may never be fully used.
Proposals to more strictly regulate data center development died in the Legislature this year. Going forward, several state agencies and commissions are expected to take up further discussions, including the California Energy Commission, the Little Hoover Commission and the California Public Utilities Commission.


How much energy will California’s new data centers actually need?
The surge in AI is complicating efforts by regulators and utilities to forecast how quickly data centers will grow and how much power they’ll need. Companies can propose large facilities without committing to build them, the computing demands behind AI are changing quickly and cooling needs vary across the state. These factors make long-term energy needs hard to pin down.
According to the state’s electricity-demand forecast, utilities report that data centers, in planning documents, have requested 18.7 gigawatts of service capacity. That’s enough to power roughly 18 million homes, compared with California’s estimated 14 to 15 million. Regulators don’t expect all of those projects to be built, and assume the ones that do will come online gradually and operate at less than their requested capacity, producing a forecast of between 4 and 6 gigawatts by 2040.
Liang Min, who directs Stanford’s Bits & Watts Initiative, and a speaker on CalMatters’ panel, said that forecasting is particularly tough because companies are rolling out new AI apps — or “application layers,” as he put it — at breakneck speed. They include products like ChatGPT that use large language models. No one knows which apps will take off, and those uncertain bets are driving huge demands on the power grid.
“Right now we’re really struggling,” Min said. “The risk is extremely high in the application layers.”
The Public Advocates Office, an independent consumer watchdog within the California Public Utilities Commission, recently warned that rapid data-center growth could leave Californians paying for billions of dollars in grid upgrades if projects never materialize or use far less power than promised. 
“Ratepayers could end up paying for costly infrastructure upgrades that may not be needed for many years – or at all,” the office said in its commentary.
Min said forecasting data-center load is a national challenge, but California will need better tools to keep rates in check, meet its clean-energy targets and stay competitive with states racing to attract data centers and high-paying tech jobs.
Local officials have also begun to grapple with the uncertainty. In San Jose, city energy officials say they are reluctant to procure additional power until they know which projects will actually be built. “We do not want to buy more power than we need,” said panelist Lori Mitchell, director of San Jose Clean Energy, the city’s publicly-owned electricity provider. “That’s job No. 1.”
What are the environmental concerns around the data center boom? 
California’s data-center boom is bringing a wave of environmental concerns that state officials are only beginning to understand. Those concerns center on water use, the carbon emissions tied to rising energy demand and the air pollution from diesel backup generators.
Air quality is a particular concern. While back-up generators run only intermittently, their presence is concentrated in a handful of regions. In Santa Clara County, where many facilities sit close together in dense industrial areas, the local impacts could be greater simply because so much equipment is packed into a small space.
Yet the state still has limited visibility into what data centers are doing. Attempts to require more transparency stalled this year amid tech industry opposition. The only measure that became law gives regulators the authority to determine whether data centers are driving up costs — but stops short of requiring environmental reporting.
Ahmad Thomas, CEO of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, and another panelist, said his group opposed the electricity disclosure and water reporting measures because they would make California less competitive.
“It’s very hard to see a world where California is at the top of the AI pile if we do not have an approach to data centers that is — at minimum — mildly competitive with other states,” he added.
Consumer advocates say the lack of information leaves communities unprotected. “We certainly think there needs to be more transparency — that’s a good thing,” said panelist Mark Toney, the executive director of the The Utility Reform Network, a ratepayer advocacy group..
Will data centers slow down California’s switch to clean energy? 
The rapid growth of data centers could slow California’s clean-energy transition if it keeps the state tied to natural gas. And some of the carbon-free alternative energy sources that could meet their power needs are deeply controversial among environmentalists.
The state has pledged to reach 100% carbon-free electricity by 2045, yet it still depends heavily on natural-gas plants during hot summer days. A recent report by the environmental think tank Next 10 and UC Riverside estimated that data-center carbon emissions nearly doubled from 2019 to 2023 — largely from gas-fired generation — underscoring how even a relatively clean grid may struggle to absorb AI-driven load without higher emissions.
State leaders are making policy shifts as AI demand grows. California this year approved joining a broader Western power market, a move driven in part by new demands on the grid, including data centers. Critics warn the change could expose the state to dirtier electricity from other states and weaken its control over clean-energy rules.
Min of Stanford argues that California will need to rely on options some environmentalists would rather avoid. That includes holding onto existing resources like the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant. In a recent report, Min argued the state will also need more “clean, firm” power — resources that can operate around the clock — such as geothermal energy or natural-gas plants with carbon capture.
PG&E agrees. Spokesperson Stephanie Magallon told CalMatters in an email that nuclear power, carbon-capture systems and large solar-plus-battery projects are all options under consideration for powering data centers in its region. But environmental justice critics in California have opposed carbon capture technology calling it unproven tech that risks extending fossil-fuel use.
Mitchell said community choice aggregators can manage new data-center load while keeping power clean and affordable. San Jose’s mix is already 60% renewable, and she said the biggest opportunity is flexibility — getting data centers to shift use off the hottest afternoons so the city can avoid buying additional power.
Will data centers raise your electric bill? 
California’s data-center boom is reshaping the fight over electricity bills, exposing a divide over whether these new customers will lower costs — or drive them higher for everyone else.
PG&E argues that adding large users like data centers can lower rates because fixed grid costs would be spread across more customers. It also claims the grid is underutilized on average — operating at about 45% of capacity — although the grid faces real strain during the hottest hours and in parts of the system that routinely run close to their limits. If data centers can be connected in places with available capacity, PG&E argues, they could help spread costs without worsening congestion.
Toney, another panelist, urged the state to slow down, warning that California is planning major infrastructure without knowing which data centers are real or how their costs will land on customer bills.
“I’m worried that we’re engaged in what I call faith-based policymaking,” he said. “The benefits are very speculative, but the costs are very real.”
Some states, said Toney, have begun tightening rules around the growth of data centers. One law in Oregon will require data-center grid costs to remain off household bills.  A Minnesota law will give very large data centers their own billing category so regulators can keep their costs separate from other customers’ electric bills.
“This issue of data centers and the connection between affordability and clean energy is of national concern, and California is actually behind on this,” Toney said. “There’s this mythology about California being the leader all the time.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/120425_Edgecloud-Link-Data-Center_BANG_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-08 08:57:27.729486

According to the financial consultant WalletHub, Utah places last on metrics measuring income disparity, and inequality in the state’s share of executive positions. 
The Utah Women and Leadership Project at Utah State University in partnership with the state published a brief studying 100 Utah companies that have implemented best practices that allow Utah women to succeed in the workplace. A fundamental one is the implementation of flexible work hours in addition to other family-friendly policies.

“Research on the importance of implementing flexible and family-friendly policies, programs, and practices in workplaces has been well documented,” the brief says. “In fact, there is a clear, direct link between companies that implement such strategies and the retention and advancement of women.”
The researchers have been measuring family friendly and women-focused initiatives in different workplaces in the state for three years, including paid and unpaid family leave, back-to-work maternity support, child care support, and adoption and fertility benefits. This year fewer companies reported offering those perks.
While 71% had unpaid family leave available — more than the 64% recorded in 2024 — only 63% offered paid maternity leave, less than the 69% reported in 2024. Also, 20% had adoption and fertility benefits, less than the 27% seen last year.

Susan Madsen, director of the Utah Women and Leadership Project, said she was particularly surprised to see a lower percentage of child care support, which went from 34% in 2024 to 25% this year.
“We’ve been talking about that more the last three years here in the state of Utah,” Madsen said. “And women and families need child care support most. In most families, if there’s two parents in the home, both of them are working, and so child care is really important.”
The benefit doesn’t necessarily translate into a child care center in the workplace, or stipends to cover day care expenses, Madsen said. 
“There’s a lot of other things that could be possible in helping and trying to support parents, not just women, with child care,” she said. “Sick days, letting people do remote work when their kids are sick, or various things like that.”
There was still a good number of companies that offered flexible hours in the list the researchers studied, though it went from 98% last year to 94% in 2025. Remote work was also available at 83% of the workplaces this year, less than the 91% seen in 2024.



Let us know what you think...


 


“These are some of the top companies or top organizations. It’s just interesting to see what they’re doing and what things are jumping to the top of the list,” Madsen added. “For women, flexible work hours and some options for remote work just continue to be absolutely critical.”
Another popular initiative among the 100 companies was an annual review of pay equity, with 82% of the organizations reporting they conduct studies on everyone’s salaries.
“We can’t generalize it to the rest of the population. I’m sure there’s a lot of workplaces that don’t do these things and are not really concerned about doing things,” Madsen said. But it gives us as companies and workers a good look at what people are doing. What should we look at doing more in our organizations?” 
The report encouraged other organizations to open opportunities to make a more inclusive workplace for women. It also recommended that state legislators consider and support policies that will help Utah to host more family-friendly workplaces. 
“When businesses consider organizational-level strategies, initiatives and programs, including family-friendly practices and policies that support all employees and help them thrive, Utah can increase the representation of women in businesses around the state, which is important to ensure more women and their families can thrive,” researchers wrote.

(Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images)Amid ongoing federal and state attempts to limit access to vaccines or loosen vaccination requirements, data shows that Alabama has fallen below national averages for children being up to date on some vaccines.
The state is trailing the country for uptake of vaccines for whooping cough and Hepatitis B, while immunization rates against measles have swung above and below rates that experts consider necessary to attain herd immunity.
The vaccination rate for children aged 13-17 nationwide remained high in 2024, but it drops significantly in Alabama as children age. Where about 70% of 4-10-year-olds are up to date on vaccines statewide, only 25% of children 11-18 years old are up to date.

Experts say misinformation and struggles to access medical care around the state are playing a role.
“There were several insurance companies that didn’t even cover routine immunizations,” Dr. Norma Mobley, a Mobile-based pediatrician, said. “We at the AAP level, that was something that they really worked hard toward making sure that all children under insurance policies could receive routine, recommended vaccines.”
Mobley, president of the Alabama chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), has started to see cases of whooping cough, a highly contagious respiratory infection, despite a vaccine for the disease existing for nearly 30 years. 
Statewide, 69% of Alabama’s 19-47-month-olds are up to date on the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTaP) vaccine, according to data from ADPH. Nationwide, 80.4% of children in the U.S. are vaccinated against whooping cough by the time they turn two in 2021, according to the CDC. The CDC recommends doses of the DTaP vaccine at one- and two-months-old.
Mobley said in an interview Tuesday that she has seen younger parents as more hesitant to vaccinate their children. That, along with how long it takes for a child to be fully vaccinated has led to the return of diseases that are no longer common, she said.
“If you’re going to give them the vaccines, you might as well just do them the way they’re scheduled,” Mobley said “You’re still going to poke them the same number of times, whether you do them a week apart or not.”
Misinformation from social media has also contributed to a decrease in vaccinations, especially for influenza vaccines, Mobley said.
“We had a lot of people reading sources saying that there’s a combination of the flu and the COVID vaccine,” she said. “That’s not true.”
Influenza

According to the ADPH data, 6.3% of Alabamians 18 years old and under were vaccinated against influenza for the 2025-26 flu season as of Nov. 25. The season spans from Oct. 1 to Sept. 30, 2026, according to ADPH. In the 2024-25 flu season, 13.1% of children were vaccinated against influenza, according to the data. The CDC recommends a flu shot every year starting at 6-months-old, with some children needing two doses.
According to the ADPH data, about 345,000 adults have gotten the flu vaccine so far this season, which is about half of all adults that received the vaccine in the 2024-25 season.
Dr. Wes Stubblefield, district medical officer at ADPH, said the best way to combat misinformation on vaccines is a good patient-physician relationship.
“We want to make sure that our providers are having conversations with their parents, with their patients and parents, especially those that have questions about vaccines or or have not received vaccines in the past,” Stubblefield said in an interview Wednesday. 
Efforts to loosen vaccination requirements have taken hold in the Alabama Legislature. A bill sponsored by Sen. Arthur Orr, R-Decatur, that would have allowed parents to declare their children religiously exempt from vaccines failed in the 2025 session, but Rep. Mack Butler, R-Rainbow City, pre-filed a similar bill for the 2026 legislative session, which starts in January.  
HB 24 would allow parents or guardians to object to vaccination or testing requirements by submitting a written statement stating that the vaccination or testing conflicts with their religion as valid grounds for exemption from any school enrollment vaccine or testing requirement. It also specified that no additional forms, fees or documentation could be required of the parent, guardian or child for enrollment in any public K-12 school. The bill would have also extended these provisions to public colleges and universities. 
Mobley said vaccinating children is ethical practice because it keeps children out of harm’s way.
“We take a vow when we graduate from medical school to do no harm,” she said. “If we know we’re holding back on something that could place that patient at risk, then to me, that’s placing them in harm’s way.”
Friday, the federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted to end a 35-year recommendation to vaccinate infants against hepatitis B virus (HBV) on the day they are born. The new recommendation is to only vaccinate infants whose mothers test positive for the disease or have not tested. 
According to the Mayo Clinic, HBV is a viral liver disease that can be transmitted through sexual or blood contact with somebody who is not vaccinated or from a mother to her baby. It can cause liver failure, liver cancer and cirrhosis. For most, the disease lasts six months or less, but it can also be chronic. 
According to the ADPH data, about 76% of 19-47-month-olds in Alabama are up to date on the HBV vaccine. It is one of two vaccines infants get the day they are born. According to the CDC, 91.4% of children in the U.S. were fully vaccinated against HBV by the time they turned two in 2021. 
Measles

Amid outbreaks of the disease around the country, Alabama reported a confirmed case of measles this year, the first in the state since 2002. An unvaccinated child under five years old contracted the highly contagious disease while traveling outside the country. ADPH later said the child recovered.
Mobley said she has not seen any pushback against the MMR vaccine. According to the Centers for Disease Control, measles immunity has moved up and down in recent years. About 95.3% of Alabama kindergarteners were vaccinated against measles in the 2024-25 school year, more than the 95% considered necessary for herd immunity. But it was about 93.8% for kindergarteners the year prior.  
“Herd immunity is 95% so we’re still pretty close. We’re doing a good job in our state in that regard,” she said.
According to the ADPH data, 77% of children under 10 are up to date on the MMR vaccine. According to Cleveland Clinic, children typically receive the second dose of the vaccine between four and six years old.
Some counties, especially in Dale, Henry and Houston in the Wiregrass, have significantly lower vaccination rates, according to the data. Mobley said there are small groups of parents throughout the state that are either skeptical, hesitant or against vaccinating their kids. 
“The only thing that we try to make sure they do is go through the health department to obtain those exemptions so that it is documented through the registry, so we know who’s not immunized,” Mobley said of those who seek vaccine exemptions.
Stubblefield said that access to health care could contribute to it, especially in Wiregrass counties, like Dale, Henry and Houston. According to the data, 49% of 19-47-month-old children are up to date on vaccines in Dale County. Henry and Houston counties are at 53% and 52%, respectively, for the same age group. Statewide, 65% of the same age group is up to date.
“We also have some counties in Alabama that have very limited access to vaccinations in general, particularly in the south central and southwest part of the state,” he said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Child-getting-vaccine-for-Aug-29-2025-story.jpg,,,2025-12-08 08:57:27.729486

Amid economic uncertainty, the panel charged with estimating Nevada state government revenues kept projections modest earlier this year.
It appears their caution was warranted.
On paper, Nevada’s revenue appears to be exceeding its forecast by 6.7%. But that number is artificially inflated by administrative anomalies, state legislative staff told the Economic Forum on Friday.
True performance, after accounting for anomalies that created one-time windfalls, is around 2% above the deliberately cautious forecast.
“We were purposefully being conservative” when finalizing the biennium revenue forecast earlier this year, said forum member Marvin Leavitt, “and it looks like that’s fairly close to what’s actually been happening.”
Expecting the dramatic shift in U.S. economic policy following the election of Donald Trump to a second presidential term — policy that has been rubber-stamped by the Republican-controlled Congress —  the Nevada Economic Forum approved a conservative revenue forecast in December 2024. Then, they nudged that forecast down in May 2025 in response to the first few months of the new administration, including the so-called “Liberation Day” tariffs Trump had announced a month earlier.
A bumpy rollout of the state’s tax collection system, combined with a massive cyberattack on the state, led to around $80 million in commerce tax revenue being collected in the first quarter of the current fiscal year when it should have been collected during the previous fiscal year.  Another unique accounting matter stemmed from the Legislature  shortening the timeframe for businesses to transfer money categorized as unclaimed revenue to the state, accounting for a one-time revenue boost of $120 million.
Excluding those anomalies, sales tax revenue is slightly underperforming and commerce tax revenue is basically flat.
“The forecast right now is holding,” said top state fiscal analyst, Michael Nakamoto. “I think that all things considered, it is doing quite well right now.”
Sales tax is by far the largest generator of state revenue, comprising close to a third of general fund revenue. Trump’s re-election sparked alarms among economists about the impact of tariffs and a global trade war.
Among the state’s other major sources of revenue, the insurance premium tax is performing best — 10.3% above forecast after one quarter of tax collections.
Gaming revenue, the second largest revenue generator for the state, is 8.7% above its forecast after five months of tax collections, but Nakamoto cautioned against interpreting that as anything but “we’re doing okay right now.”
Annual visitor volume to Southern Nevada is down 7.6% as of October, according to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. Flights in and out of Harry Reid International Airport were down 8.2% in October 2025 compared to October 2024, and down 5.1% year over year.
Gaming revenue is trending downward in Clark County if you remove baccarat, according to Nakamoto. Baccarat is dominated by a small number of high-end players who spend “a whole lot of money.”
“Sometimes they are lucky, and sometimes they are not,” said Nakamoto. “I think the easy way to explain this is: The houses have gotten very lucky from a (small) number of people, and because baccarat is effectively, statistically, a coin flip, that could very easily swing the other direction.”
Nevada’s live entertainment tax (LET) is currently 1.3% below its forecast, though there is a stark difference in performance when broken down by gaming and non-gaming properties.
LET from events not associated with gaming venues — like The Sphere, T-Mobile Arena, or Allegiant Stadium — are up 44.7% after three months of tax collections. LET from events at venues inside a casino property are down 23.9% after four months of tax collections.
Two other revenue streams categorized as “major” by the forum are both underperforming against their forecasts after one quarter of tax collections. Modified business tax is down 4.3%, and real property transfer tax is down 4.8%.
Non-major revenue sources are down by 14.5% year to date.
Notable among those: Nevada’s transportation connection excise tax, which captures taxis and rideshare services, is down nearly 40% in the first three months of collections.
Similarly, revenue from short-term car rentals started out the fiscal year badly — down 30% after four months.
While not major revenue sources, those revenue streams are often seen as indicators of tourism strength.
The Economic Forum did not make any adjustments to the state forecast on Friday.
The forum is expected to reconvene in June for another check in on Nevada’s economy and state revenues.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2210332783-1024x540.jpg,,,2025-12-08 08:57:27.729486

Nuclear Advisory Council)For me, the news surrounding the future of the V.C. Summer site is more than an industry headline. It feels like a homecoming.
I started my career at V.C. Summer, working alongside hundreds of dedicated engineers, technicians and community leaders who believed deeply in the promise of nuclear energy. We believed in what the project could mean for the state — reliable power, good-paying jobs, and a long-term investment in South Carolina’s economic resilience.
Those early years shaped not only my professional path but my commitment to advancing nuclear energy as a force for progress.
Seeing momentum return to V.C. Summer brings both pride and hope.
Pride because I know the caliber of the people who poured their expertise, sweat and heart into the site.
Hope because the renewed attention signals something bigger — a second chance to fulfill the potential this project has always held.
The future of V.C. Summer isn’t just about reactors, concrete, or systems.
It’s about people. It’s about the workforce that will be trained, the families who will thrive on new opportunities, and the communities that will benefit.
When a state commits to developing nuclear infrastructure, it commits to stability, innovation, and economic strength for decades to come.
That’s why events like the 2nd Annual South Carolina Nuclear Summit are so important to our state and industry.
Leaders from across the country will gather here in South Carolina to discuss the future of nuclear energy, the electric grid and the role our state can play in strengthening the energy landscape.
As someone who began his career at V.C. Summer, I see this summit as a powerful opportunity for professionals to come together, share ideas and advance the conversations that will shape our region’s growing need for nuclear infrastructure, reactor development, and reliable clean energy.
New nuclear power plants don’t make sense for South Carolina

South Carolina is uniquely positioned right now.
With the right vision, V.C. Summer can be a catalyst — not only for energy generation but for job creation, technology development, and statewide economic growth.
As someone who has spent nearly two decades in nuclear development, both in the field and through years of research leadership, I’ve seen firsthand what successful deployment requires.
It takes technical excellence, committed leadership, intentional planning, and a shared belief in the long-term value of clean, reliable energy.
It also takes experienced teams who understand the complexities of nuclear development from design to deployment — and who know how to get the work done safely and responsibly.
V.C. Summer shaped the beginning of my career.

McKinney Award by the National Homelessness Law Center,Sonya Quick,,,,,https://calmatters.org/inside-the-newsroom/2025/12/homelessness-award/,"CalMatters’ homelessness coverage this year has spanned multiple investigations, stories and resources that led to real-world impact.","In summary
CalMatters’ homelessness coverage this year has spanned multiple investigations, stories and resources that led to real-world impact.


CalMatters was honored with the Stewart B. McKinney Award by the National Homelessness Law Center in November. The awards honor “leaders who raise awareness about and advance solutions to homelessness and poverty.”
As a part of its 2025 Human Right to Housing awards, the center highlighted CalMatters’ “multi-part, multimedia series, spending several months interviewing experts on homelessness, doing a deep dive on all available data and most importantly, visiting encampments to document firsthand how enforcement efforts have displaced unhoused people and the devastating aftermath of these cruel and inhumane sweeps. It is exactly this type of journalistic integrity that our country so desperately needs in this time of misinformation, and we are so grateful for the high-quality reporting that CalMatters is bringing to the homelessness crisis.”
CalMatters reporting has captured the day-to-day reality for homeless people on the streets of California.
A great example of this is our series documenting the impact of Grants Pass v. Johnson, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that cities did not have to have a shelter bed available before punishing someone for sleeping on the street. That ruling, stemming from an ordinance enacted by an Oregon town, has had huge consequences for California, home to more unhoused individuals than any other state, more than 187,000 by the most recent count.
CalMatters journalists spent four months interviewing experts, requesting data and making a dozen visits to encampments in San Francisco and Fresno to document enforcement efforts and follow the unhoused people displaced when their camps were cleared. Our public media partner, KPBS, did extensive reporting and visits to encampments in San Diego. 
Our reporting showed that every time a homeless person is forced to move, the odds that they lose something increase. That can include identification and documentation critical to obtaining housing and the medication a person needs to survive. Moving also makes it harder for someone to stay in touch with case managers and social workers working to get homeless people into housing.
Homeless Californians also have more difficulty getting to jobs and keeping appointments like court dates. Every time they get arrested or forced to move, that gets harder. Missed court dates can eventually lead to warrants and fines: More barriers to obtaining housing and getting off the street.
CalMatters’ homelessness coverage also spanned multiple investigations, stories and resources. Our work has led to real-world impact.
Two California families were reunited in 2025 after seeing loved ones who are homeless quoted in CalMatters articles. One woman found her sister after losing contact with her in 2019. Another woman found her father, who she’d been searching for without luck. In addition to sharing the stories of these two families, CalMatters also created a resource on what to do if your loved one is homeless.
Fremont backed down after proposing a ban on ‘aiding and abetting’ homeless encampments.
In 2025, Fremont’s city council revised a new city camping ordinance, removing what had become a controversial clause — first reported on by CalMatters — that could have punished those “aiding and abetting” encampments. The ordinance makes it illegal to camp on streets, sidewalks, parks and other public property, but what separated it from other efforts was explicit language that would make anyone “causing, permitting, aiding, abetting or concealing” an illegal encampment guilty of a misdemeanor. Local homeless advocates feared this could be enforced against  workers and volunteers providing aid to unhoused people in Fremont.
Lawmakers advanced a new bill to increase homeless shelter oversight, citing our reporting as the catalyst for action.
Under the new proposal, local governments would be required to perform annual inspections of taxpayer-funded shelters, and cities and counties could lose state funding if they fail to correct code violations or keep neglecting to file mandatory reports. The bill has passed the assembly and is on to the senate. The 2025 proposal followed a CalMatters exposé on homeless shelter failures, and our 2024 investigation revealing that cities and counties have been ignoring a state law requiring basic safety and sanitation checks in shelters. Watch lawmakers discuss this bill, and our reporting. 
A CalMatters lawsuit forced LA officials to turn over secret homeless shelter complaints.
In 2025, Los Angeles officials began releasing thousands of internal records related to conditions inside homeless shelters in response to a CalMatters lawsuit challenging their repeated public records denials. The Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority, better known as LAHSA committed to releasing at least 175 incident reports every other week until the public records request is fulfilled. The agency estimated there are 5,000 such reports.

The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development in November announced new restrictions to Continuum of Care Program funding, which is the largest pocket of federal funding states rely on to address homelessness. 
Under the new rule, no more than 30% of federal grants received by jurisdictions from the program can go toward funding permanent housing. 
Nevada could lose an estimated $13 million in funding and an estimated 925 people would lose housing, according to the NAEH analysis.
The move is expected to displace 170,000 people nationally.
The new requirement came as a surprise since Congress already authorized the funds “to be a two year funding cycle,” said Catrina Peters, the Homeless Services Coordinator with Washoe County.
As the Trump administration has reversed long-standing approaches to homelessness, local governments and nonprofits that rely on federal funding to support homeless programs have been preparing for future changes. 
Yet the funding notice was still unanticipated, Peters said. 
“We would really love to at least have some time to be able to plan for these changes, and have a little runway to be able to work with folks on what some different options might be, instead of just being pushed off a cliff, which is what it feels like right now,” she said. 
Both Clark and Washoe counties dedicate close to 90% of its federal Continuum of Care funding toward permanent housing, the NAEH found. 
“For us, that’s a $1.9 million cut to programs that are currently housing people,” Peters said. 
The NAEH analysis estimates 738 beds will be lost in Clark County, 139 beds in Washoe County, and 48 in the rest of the state. 
The “most conservative” estimate projected by Washoe County indicates 88 households would lose assistance, Peters said, adding the figure doesn’t factor in other potential changes to eligibility requirements, such as proposed work requirements the administration has proposed to place on housing assistance.
Regardless, the most vulnerable populations, including those with disabilities and seniors, could potentially lose housing under the new rules. 
“When we think about people with a permanent disability, which is an eligibility criteria for people to get on the program, that’s unlikely to change,” Peters said. “Once folks get into the housing programs, reducing that funding puts those folks who are in those programs at risk” of re-entering homelessness. 
Clark County wouldn’t confirm if the breakdown provided by NAEH was accurate. 
“This is an emerging challenge that we are currently working to navigate,” Jennifer Cooper, a spokeswoman for Clark County, said in an email. “It would be appropriate for us to engage with you on this when we have information to share.” 
HUD’s swift and sudden reversal comes as the Trump Administration has vowed to move away from the “housing first” approach to homelessness, which focuses on getting people stably housed before treatment. 
Despite “housing first” being supported by homeless advocates, social service providers, and state and local jurisdictions, the administration has pushed to prioritize treatment before housing. 
Trump issued an executive order in July that sought to crack down on homelessness by pressuring cities to criminalize unhoused people or push them into institutions, and called for “ending support for ‘housing first’ policies,” saying they “deprioritize accountability.”
Peters said they have continued to use the housing first model ​​because of a “mountain of evidence showing its effectiveness.”
NAEH and the National Low Income Housing Coalition, along with several municipal governments, filed a lawsuit last week against the administration over the new requirements, warning the sudden changes are reckless and will lead to a steep rise in homelessness. 
The groups argued the two-year funding cycle authorized by Congress in 2024 sought to give communities greater stability in how they run programs used to house people. 
“It rescinded the two-year notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) and replaced it with a new one, initiating a new competition for FY 2025 awards,” according to the lawsuit. “This decision will severely delay essential funding for housing, as HUD now says it will not make any new awards until May at the earliest.”
Twenty states and the District of Columbia have also filed suit to stop the rules, arguing they violate federal law.
Nevada has not joined any of the lawsuits. 
Alcinia Whiters, a spokeswoman for Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford, said the state didn’t join the lawsuit because state agencies, such as the Nevada Housing Division and the Department of Human Services “do not receive HUD Continuum of Care funding.”
Rather it is the counties that receive funding directly from HUD.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/54642266096_fd9c809767_o-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-08 09:56:33.828196

(Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)Back in 1997, a group of students formed an organization for gay and lesbian undergraduates at Fordham University. They applied for official club status at our Catholic school.
As the time and setting may suggest, this was far more difficult than it should have been. After a lot of temporizing, the administration denied the LGBTQ+ group status. The reasons were nonsensical. And those of us who worked at the campus newspaper, The Ram, said as much in an editorial.
What did the university do to us?
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Nothing.
We continued to cover our campus, and the people on it, as best we could. And while individual administrators grumbled, they didn’t interfere. At some level, the school recognized that it was better for the community to let students speak about their thoughts, their experiences and their hopes, even when those weren’t the same as the administration’s.
I thought back to this last week after the University of Alabama shut down two student magazines — Alice, aimed at women, and Nineteen Fifty-Six, covering Black culture and lifestyle — claiming that their existence was an affront to the Trump administration’s project of driving anyone who isn’t a white man out of public life.
There was no other reason to close the publications. Both found a balance between major issues and lighter fare, as good magazines do. Alice had articles on shoes and tattoos, as well as features on UA workers and a thoughtful essay on women and body images.
One recent issue of Nineteen Fifty-Six had solid pieces on evolving definitions of family and the popular exploitation of Black childhood, as well as recipes and songs.
You’d have to be the most brittle person on the planet to consider anything published by these magazines offensive, let alone discriminatory. Unfortunately, we live under the rule of people whose skin could be punctured by a feather.
To justify the closures, UA Vice President for Student Life Steven Hood cited a July memo from U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi. Like other attempts at discrimination — including Alabama’s — the language is absurdly, purposefully broad.
Hood said the magazines operated as “unlawful proxies.” Bondi defined these as “ostensibly neutral criteria that function as substitutes for explicit consideration of race, sex, or other protected characteristics.”
This is vague to the point of meaninglessness. Which a halfway competent attorney — and UA has many skilled ones — could point out.  If the school felt that its student organizations risked legal attack, it could mount a very good case in court.
And, in fact, Bondi gave them ammunition. The memo goes on to cite examples of “unlawful proxy” as asking job candidates to describe how their backgrounds inform their performance, or recruiting from areas because of racial or ethnic composition, or daring to state how racism shaped their lives.
This is all discriminatory in the arrogant, smugger-than-thou way of this White House. But nowhere does Bondi suggest that a publication aimed at a particular group of students would violate the administration’s already absurd policies against diversity, equity and inclusion.
That’s a fight UA could have.
But it won’t. If anything, school leadership seems to be using the memo for its own purposes.
When students and professors sued the university over its closures of dedicated spaces for the Black Student Union and LGBTQ+ students — thanks, SB 129 — attorneys for UA said the memo justified their refusal to bring the spaces back.
At first, this only seemed craven. But at some point, cowardice became connivance.
Hood said there were no complaints about Alice or Nineteen Fifty-Six that led to their suspension. So one has to conclude that the university is shutting these  publications on its own initiative. There’s nothing in the Bondi memo that can possibly justify this.
Which leads to the inevitable question: What does UA want its students to be?
Should its graduates emerge from Tuscaloosa as independent, open-minded people who can think, express themselves clearly and learn from other people’s experiences?
Or should they be meek, sheltered and deferential individuals, hostile to anything that’s different and silent if they don’t conform?
Right now, UA is leaning toward the latter. The school is telling Black and female students that they are not part of the campus community. And that their experiences, no matter how mundane, are illegitimate and threatening.
That they need to shut up. UA isn’t bending the knee. It’s helping Trump lift the wall.
To their credit, UA students aren’t falling silent. Look no further than the Crimson White, UA’s undergraduate newspaper. It broke the news of the shutdown and continues to report on the situation with calm, clarity and context.
It’s student media at its best: forthright, informed and earnest. As Alice and Nineteen Fifty-Six were. Taking a community not as a blob to be shoved into a mold, but the sum of many different parts. Each worthy of exploration and understanding.
UA administrators might learn something from that.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-08 08:57:27.729486

The Alabama Professional Workforce Protection Act, sponsored by Rep. Napoleon Bracy, D-Saraland, would recognize nursing, physician assistants; physical therapy; education; counseling; social work; public health; speech-language pathology; accounting engineering, and architecture as professional programs. All were excluded from recent decisions by the White House, which the Trump administration has said was an effort to cap maximum borrowing for certain degrees.
Bracy, who works at a federally qualified health center in South Alabama, said in an interview earlier this month the changes could deter students.

“I noticed that more and more people started to kind of talk about it,” he said. “And it was kind of making people look at changing their minds about career fields and paths that they were looking at going forward, maybe not being able to become a nurse practitioner or physician, just seemed like it created an additional burden on people, and I felt like we needed to do something about it.”
According to the Code of Federal Regulations, a professional degree shows completion of both academic requirements and professional skills that are more than a typical bachelor’s degree requires. Professional licenses are also typically required for these degrees.
The changes to professional student classificationswere first outlined in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed over the summer.
The U.S. Department of Education said in a statement on Nov. 24 that a professional degree is “an internal definition used by the department to distinguish among programs that qualify for higher loan limits.”
“Misinformation on TikTok has caused confusion about the Trump Administration’s ongoing actions to implement student loan caps for graduate students. While still in development, the Trump administration is implementing long-needed loan limits on graduate loans to drive down the cost of programs,” Ellen Keast, press secretary for higher education, said in a statement last week.
Previously, graduate students seeking professional degrees could borrow up to the cost of attendance in federal student loans. Now, under the new limits, professional degree seekers, including those in medicine (M.D.), dentistry (D.D.S./D.M.D.) and law (L.L.B./J.D.), can borrow up to $200,000 while those not in a professional degree program can borrow up to $100,000.
Keast’s statement said that 95% of nursing students would not be affected, while “the most expensive outlying 5%” would be grandfathered into existing limits. 
“We expect that institutions charging tuition rates well above market prices will consider lowering tuition thanks to these historic reforms,” the statement said.
Keast did not mention what data the department received this information from or what TikTok videos have caused misinformation.
The Alabama Board of Nursing (ABN) and the Alabama Hospital Association (ALAHA) wrote to the U.S. Department of Education in a joint letter on Nov. 26 saying that recognizing nursing as a professional degree “is necessary to ensure that our state and nation can meet the challenges facing the healthcare workforce.”
“A professional degree carries with it significant financial advantages for individuals pursuing post-baccalaureate education to advance in various professions, which, under current regulations, include medicine, dentistry, and pharmacy, among others,” the letter said. “Given the rigor of educational, licensing, and regulatory policies required to obtain and maintain licensure as a nurse, as well as long-standing public regard of the discipline as a distinct profession, it is natural that nursing should be included in this definition.”
Honor Ingel, chief communications officer for ABN said in an interview Friday the board stands by the letter.
“We’re not speaking to the Department of Education’s intent there. We just believe that we should not be interfering with the pipeline at this time for healthcare workers specifically,” Ingel said.
Bracy said Alabama is experiencing a “workforce crisis.”
Alabama workforce participation rate has trailed the nation’s for at least 50 years. According to the Alabama Department of Workforce, the state’s workforce participation rate in August was 57.7%. This is lower than the national average of 62.4% reported in September. Experts have cited several factors, including a lack of training, a lack of transportation and a lack of child care for Alabama’s lagging rate. 
Alabama State Superintendent Eric Mackey said after the October State Board of Education meeting the state is seeing a shortage in special education teachers even after funding from the Alabama Legislature.
“[The funding] has helped but what we’re continuing to see is that we have a shortage of special needs teachers especially in rural areas, and especially in areas like autism,” Mackey said.
Ingle said the healthcare industry is also experiencing a shortage due to older generations retiring.
“As the as the final Baby Boomers and Generation X start to retire, we are we’re looking at potentially, you know, major drop in the number of nurses Practicing and providing care to Alabamians, and that includes Advanced Practice Nurses, [Certified Registered Nurse Infusions] CNIs, [Certified Registered Nurse Practitioners] CRNPs and [Certified Nurse-Midwives] CNMs.”
Bracy said the Professional Workforce Protection Act would protect incentives for workers.
“If we protect [these degrees], it allows people to have more of an incentive to go into these career paths where taking this away, it really hurts them in the long run,” he said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-08 12:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,About 36K in CT are at risk of losing SNAP benefits. Here’s what to know.,Jenna Carlesso,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/08/ct-snap-cuts-big-beautiful-bill/,"Cuts to SNAP in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” will affect thousands of people, who could lose coverage between Dec. 1 and March 31.","About 36,000 Connecticut residents are at risk of losing access to food stamp benefits due to new eligibility requirements outlined in a recent federal bill.
The cuts to food assistance in H.R. 1, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, will directly affect thousands of immigrants, young adults, veterans and people experiencing homelessness because of new, stricter work requirements and other changes. They are expected to lose coverage between Dec. 1 and March 31.
The people affected represent about 10% of the state’s residents who receive benefits through the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
“We’re going to have a whole lot of people who don’t have access to the food they need to stay healthy,” said Sara Parker McKernan, policy advocate for New Haven Legal Assistance. “People are going to eat as frugally as they can, which means a lot of really inexpensive foods that they’re able to buy because they don’t have the advantage of SNAP anymore.”
Here’s what’s happening with food assistance changes under the bill.
Who is affected by the changes?
H.R. 1 imposes a work requirement on adults 55 through 64 and parents with children 14 and older for the first time. It removes exemptions for veterans, people experiencing homelessness and young people who recently aged out of foster care — exemptions that were added in bipartisan legislation in 2023, according to an analysis by the Center on Budget Policy and Priorities. Recipients must now document 20 hours of work per week, participate in a narrow set of work activities or prove they qualify for another exemption.
The bill also ends eligibility for many immigrants living lawfully in the U.S. who have been granted humanitarian protection by the federal government, including refugees, people granted asylum and certain survivors of domestic violence and sex trafficking.
“We’re talking about folks who have been physical laborers their entire life, and all of a sudden, they’re getting to the stage where their bodies are giving out and they can no longer compete with younger workers,” McKernan said. “We’re talking about folks who have raised their kids or grandkids and now have an empty house and no work history. They may have kids over the age of 14, but they can’t act in that caretaker role and get SNAP.”
What do advocates say?
Advocates worry the changes will mean more families will go hungry.
“When you’ve got a family who are looking at a budget that doesn’t work – their income doesn’t balance with their expenses — they start saying, ‘What can we squeeze?’ Rent is what it is, you have no power to negotiate health insurance premiums, the cost of gas is what it is. One area where families have some flexibility to squeeze a budget down is food,” said Lisa Tepper Bates, president and CEO of the United Way of Connecticut.
Some families might lean toward purchasing foods that are calorie-dense to maintain their caloric intake but that aren’t nutrient-dense, health officials said. That can lead to conditions like obesity, diabetes and heart disease.
“When I was working full-time running a shelter for families experiencing homelessness, this is the part of their budget where they were looking to spend as little as possible so they could maximize what they had for rent,” Tepper Bates said. “What that meant was often, for a family with two small kids, they’re buying a 10-pound bag of white rice and five pounds of the cheapest hamburger meat they can find, and that’s going to be the basis of their food for the week. That is simply not adequate nutrition.”
Are there legal challenges?
Attorney General William Tong announced late last month that he and 21 other attorneys general are suing the federal government, seeking to block new guidance from the U.S. Department of Agriculture that deems some immigrants ineligible for food assistance even after they become permanent residents.
In October, the USDA issued new guidance to state agencies describing changes to SNAP eligibility under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Tong said the memo incorrectly asserted that all individuals who entered the country through certain pathways — including refugees, asylum recipients and others — would remain permanently ineligible for SNAP, even after obtaining green cards and becoming lawful permanent residents. The attorneys general argue the guidance contradicts federal law and could impose large financial penalties on states.
“The Trump Administration cannot help themselves. They are messing with SNAP benefits again. This time they are inventing their own rules to permanently ban legal immigrants — green card holders — from ever receiving food stamps,” Tong said in a statement. “There is zero basis in the law for this cruel move, and we’re suing to stop them.”
Will the state step in with funding?
With many poised to lose benefits, advocates are asking elected officials to create a state-funded food assistance program to fill the gap.
Since at least the 1990s, Connecticut had a state-financed food stamp program for legal immigrants who otherwise would have been eligible for the federal program but were excluded by welfare reform legislation in 1996. The legislature in August 2016 directed the state Department of Social Services to stop adding people to the program, though the initiative was funded through 2017, officials with DSS said.
In September, representatives with Greater Hartford Legal Aid, New Haven Legal Assistance and Connecticut Legal Services sent a letter to Gov. Ned Lamont and Democratic legislative leaders asking them to, among other things, establish a state-funded food assistance program for previously eligible legal immigrants and others who may lose SNAP benefits.
“We urge you to address the imminent harm to low-income CT residents that cuts to SNAP in H.R. 1 are poised to inflict. Our low-income clients depend on SNAP benefits to feed themselves and their families and depend on information and resources provided by DSS to access those benefits,” six people with those organizations wrote.
Sen. Matthew Lesser, a Democrat from Middletown who is co-chair of the Human Services Committee, said he and his colleagues are interested in exploring a state-funded food assistance program during the legislative session that begins in February. Launching such an initiative would require money and software upgrades to run it, he said.
House Speaker Matthew Ritter, D-Hartford, pointed to a $500 million emergency fund authorized during the special session this month as one way to help residents losing access to SNAP. “This is an example of what the fund could be used for,” he said. “Obviously, the governor has a lot of discretion, and we have to vote on it. If the governor were to come to us and say, ‘I’d like to help out these folks who are getting kicked off SNAP,’ I would support that.”
A spokesman for Lamont said the governor is still reviewing how to use money in the emergency fund.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025_1105_SR_SNAPFoodPantries_070-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-08 07:57:23.749582

(Rich Townsend/Getty Images)New Mexico Department of Health experts on Friday announced an expedited timeline for the state’s new medical psilocybin program during the program’s first advisory board meeting.
The seven members of the newly formed Medical Psilocybin Advisory Board met virtually with DOH experts, state Sen. Jeff Steinborn (D-Las Cruces) and dozens of members of the public to discuss the status of the program and a draft of the program’s operational procedures.
The program was created during the regular legislative session earlier this year through the passage of Senate Bill 219, cosponsored by Steinborn. The bill established the program and advisory board, as well as made the use of psilocybin legal in the state in controlled, qualified medical treatment settings. New Mexico is the third state in the country to allow psilocybin, or magic mushrooms, for therapeutic use.
“We are experiencing a new renaissance…of psychedelic medicine,” Steinborn said during the board meeting. He added that other states will be watching and learning from how New Mexico’s program is established. “By definition, we’re pioneers and we’re going to learn a lot, but I also want to challenge you to not be afraid to try new things, to innovate, to make things better than maybe they’ve been in other states, in some cases.”
Medical Psilocybin Act becomes law in New Mexico, but what’s next?

According to the bill, patients will qualify for the psilocybin program and treatment if they are diagnosed with major treatment-resistance depression; post traumatic stress disorder; substance use disorders; end-of-life care; and other conditions approved of by the DOH. The bill also states that the program must be implemented no later than Dec. 31, 2027.
Dominick Zurlo, director of the Center for Medical Cannabis and Psilocybin, said during the meeting that the DOH has set the goal of opening the program to the public a year early. The department has also hired a program manager and are working to fill the roles of environmental scientist and compliance officer.
“Because there has been such large interest in this and a push for us to try to be able to help people with psilocybin treatments earlier, we have set a goal now to have the program at least to be able to see the initial patients by the end of December of 2026,” Zurlo said. 
During public comment, attendees voiced support and excitement for the program’s creation. Others said they were curious about the possibility of trying the treatment when it becomes available; how the supply chain will work with local mushroom growers; and how licensing will work for medical providers.
Denali Wilson, director of strategic support for the nonprofit Healing Advocacy Fund, said her organization is ready to provide input to the DOH as the program takes shape. She said its priorities are safety, a “clear code of ethics,” systems for measuring outcomes and patient affordability.
“While it is important for the program to move forward with urgency, achieving the right balance of safety, affordability and equity will require careful attention and thoughtfulness,” Wilson said. “Let’s be sure that any acceleration of the regulatory timeline doesn’t unintentionally compromise patient safety, undermine long-term sustainability or limit meaningful public engagement.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/RichTownsendGettyImages-mushroomsDec72025purchased-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-12-08 07:57:23.749582

The courage from the task force members allows us to refocus this upcoming legislative season on the real needs in front of Vermonters and our schools.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Caitlin Macleod-Bluver: On redistricting, recognizing the nuances of an issue is a success, not a failure.","This commentary is by Caitlin Macleod-Bluver, of Moretown. She is an English and history teacher at Winooski High School, and 2025 Vermont state teacher of the year.



In my classroom, we do a lot of challenging learning. When given a hard task, we spend time reading multiple sources, asking questions, interviewing stakeholders, listening to diverse perspectives and synthesizing multiple perspectives. 
A good learner revises their thinking when given new information; we will often use sentence frames such as “I used to think… then I learned… now I think” to track our learning.

Recognizing the nuances of an issue is not a failure; it’s a success. When my students recognize complexities of an issue, it’s a win not a failure. 
Our members of the redistricting task force did just this: they listened to community input, reckoned with the complexities of the task, and rather than pushing through with the “assignment,” they bravely proposed an alternative solution. 
And yet, Gov. Phil Scott and his team deemed this a failure, claiming that the task force had given up and failed. Nothing could be further from the truth: when my students understand the complexities of an issue and propose nuanced solutions to difficult problems, that is a win. Why would it not be the same for our state’s leaders? 
If the governor is so annoyed about the direction of the task force, I wonder why his team has not produced any numbers that reflect actual cost savings of consolidation. It became abundantly clear to the task force that a plan to consolidate districts lacks clear financial savings. If the administration disagrees, where are these numbers? 
The courage from the task force members allows us to refocus this upcoming legislative season on the real needs in front of Vermonters and our schools. Rather than debate consolidation maps that do not prove to save money, our legislators can focus the conversation on what our students and schools need. And there are indeed a lot of needs. 
We could use our legislative session to focus on the rising health care costs that strain school budgets. We could address the unsustainable rise in property taxes that are hurting Vermonters statewide. Or, we could discuss how to actually fund the school construction aid that was established in Act 73. 
We could use this new session to focus on putting nurses back in every school building, every day, or art and music teachers in all of our schools daily, or on hiring more social workers and therapists to respond to the ever growing mental health needs of our students. Many school districts passed budgets in 2024 and 2025 that cut many staff positions and are likely preparing for another round of barebones budgets.
We could use our upcoming session to address our statewide teacher shortage and invest time and money in expanding our grow-your-own initiatives and our support for new teachers. 
Or, we could focus our attention back on ensuring that public funds go to public schools that serve all students and follow state guidelines. Rather than provide vouchers for some, we could strengthen our public schools for all. 
There’s a lot of work to be done in our state. Hopefully, the stance of the task force will give other legislators in Montpelier courage to do right for public schools: to listen to teachers, to listen to students and to listen to community members who demand strong public schools.
Our public schools are our bedrock to our democracy; let’s focus on building them up, not tearing them down, this new legislative season.

Dec. 4, 2025 | Photo by Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceAs Gwynne Wilcox awaits a court ruling to determine if President Donald Trump had the power to remove her from the National Labor Relations Board, the tireless labor advocate returned to Detroit last week with a hero’s reception.
Wilcox was the first Black woman to serve on the board since its inception. She was also the first person to be removed from the board by a sitting president in its 90-year existence. She is now suing the Trump administration over that decision, and the case is pending before the U.S. Supreme Court after a stay was issued by Chief Justice John Roberts. The lower courts have largely rejected Trump’s effort to remove her.
On Thursday, Wilcox headlined Sugar Law Center’s annual “Essential Advocacy: For Economic & Social Justice” dinner and speaker event. The night included an address from Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist and was attended by U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit). 
Wilcox also received the firm’s essential advocacy honor. It was a full circle moment for Wilcox, who at one time was a board member to the nonprofit which is dedicated to providing advocacy and support to poor and working people facing societal challenges.
Wilcox said the work of advocates that tell the stories of working people, much like Sugar Law Center, was indeed essential to upholding the nation’s constitutional freedoms – especially in the era of Trump.

“The impact of the decisions made by the administration have really changed the National Labor Relations board’s ability to do the work that it’s doing,” Wilcox said. “So needless to say … the work that you all are doing is so, so important. We don’t know what’s going to happen with the National Labor Relations Board, but you have been surviving for so many, many years, doing excellent work. Workers need you. Our communities need you. Their families need you to continue doing the work.”
For Wilcox, it was just another feather in her cap after a long distinguished career of fighting for worker’s rights. Prior to her appointment to the National Labor Relations Board, Wilcox was a senior partner at the Levy Ratner law firm in New York, serving as the associate general counsel for  SEIU United Healthcare Workers East, and a labor representative to the New York City Office of Collective Bargaining. 
She’s also been a board member for various labor advocacy and legal groups, including the AFL-CIO Lawyers Coordinating Committee, now known as the Union Lawyers Alliance.
John Philo, the executive and legal director of the Sugar Law Center, told Michigan Advance that honoring Wilcox as she continues her fight against the Trump administration meant a great deal to the organization.










The president cannot remove someone who has not been alleged to have engaged in any type of negligence nor any type of cause. They never pretended to even allege that there was any cause.

“It’s the living struggle that’s happening right now between those who believe in rule of law and those who believe strictly in power. And she is at the pivot point of that,” Philo said. “What’s happened to her through the actions of the president really is going to define our country. Do we believe in the rule of law, and do we believe that the president is restrained by a Constitution? Or are we going in a much different and much dangerous direction?”

Wilcox was nominated by former President Joe Biden and served a first term on the National Labor Relations Board from August 2021 until August 2023. She served as the board’s chair after she was renominated by Biden in 2023, until she was ultimately removed by Trump shortly after he returned to office in January of this year.
Her term was meant to go through 2028. Wilcox was one of two board members dismissed by Trump this year, as Jennifer Abruzzo was also removed from the powerful labor board. The firings essentially nullified the three-person board because it now lacks a quorum to decide labor cases that have come before it over the last century.
Wilcox sued the Trump administration and the board’s new chair, Marvin Kaplan, in February, filing in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.
U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell of the District of Columbia ruled in March that Trump had violated the National Labor Relations Act, and ordered that Wilcox would remain a member.
A three-judge U.S. Court of Appeals panel overturned that decision, but when the appellate court heard the matter again en banc, which means before the entire U.S. Court of Appeals D.C. Circuit bench, the court ruled 7-4 to block Wilcox’s termination.
The matter is now pending before the U.S. Supreme Court on a stay issued by Roberts.
Wilcox discussed her struggle against Trump and the difficulties therein while speaking to a rapt crowd at the Sugar Law Center event.
“I knew that I had to fight because the board, both the statute and the Supreme Court have said, they’re an independent agency,” Wilcox said. “The board is supposed to exist, and the president cannot remove someone who has not been alleged to have engaged in any type of negligence nor any type of cause. They never pretended to even allege that there was any cause.”
Wilcox said that the Trump administration’s firing of her and Abruzzo exposed that the administration didn’t really fully understand the board’s role or what the members of the board did.
“Sometimes I was called commissioner, sometimes she was considered a board member, but (the letter said) she made decisions,” Wilcox said. “It was poorly written.”

In all, Wilcox said the lawsuit wasn’t about trying to get her job back – it was about the important fight for the autonomy of a key independent federal agency.
“(The board) has been in existence since 1935, and it protects the rights of workers,” she said. “It’s not a neutral statute, the statute that’s there to protect workers. And so I felt very clear about that. … I believe in the rule of law.”
Although the ultimate decision over Trump’s authority rests with a U.S. Supreme Court majority that has shown a willingness to appease the president’s legal overreaches, Wilcox said the work that advocates like Sugar Law Center and others do to uplift the stories of workers was paramount to the cause and maintaining American freedoms.
Philo echoed the same sentiment, and called Wilcox a shining example of that effort.
“We will fight. We will fight it now. We’ll fight it tomorrow, and we’ll fight it the day after tomorrow. We may lose a few of those battles, but we’re not going back to a country that doesn’t have a Constitution, a country that doesn’t believe in equality or the rule of law,” Philo said. “We may lose battles, but we’re not going to lose this at the end of the day. (The American people) are a decent people, and they are going to embrace our Constitution, embrace democracy, embrace, really, equality for everybody.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/PC046413-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-08 07:57:23.749582

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)About a quarter of Indiana Republican senators have not yet said how they’ll vote on a sweeping partisan redraw of the state’s congressional maps, teeing up an uncertain week for the proposal’s future.
The Senate will reconvene Monday afternoon to begin consideration of House Bill 1032, after reversing an earlier decision not to meet.
The redesign would likely eliminate Indiana’s two Democratic-held congressional districts to create a 9-0 Republican map ahead of the 2026 midterm election, as sought by President Donald Trump.
The House approved the redistricting bill Friday, as expected, on a vote of 57-41. Twelve Republicans joined all Democrats present in opposition.
But Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray has warned there are “not enough votes to move that idea forward.” He didn’t return multiple interview requests on how the proposal’s prospects may have changed in recent weeks.
Indiana’s Constitution requires a majority of the 50-member Senate to approve legislation. That means the 40-strong Republican supermajority must muster at least 26 votes to pass the bill if all 10 Democrats oppose. GOP Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith can break a 25-25 tie.
Indiana House approves redistricting bill, sending issue to state Senate

Sixteen Senate Republicans have publicly come out in favor of a redraw — some more enthusiastically than others. Another 14 are against.
The latest senator to indicate firm opposition is Sen. Mike Crider, R-Greenfield.
“I think the maps are pretty alarming, actually. So I was a no before, and I’m for sure a no now,” he told the Capital Chronicle. “I mean, I just think that if those maps pass, there’s a good possibility that three or four millionaires from Indianapolis will represent a third of the state, so I don’t know that that serves us well.”
In the current congressional maps, drawn in 2021, Republicans maintained a 7-2 GOP advantage. Democratic Rep. Frank Mrvan holds the 1st District in northwest Indiana, while Democratic Rep. André Carson holds the 7th District in Indianapolis.
The House Republican proposal would break up the Lake Michigan shoreline area into two districts and splinter Indianapolis across four far-reaching districts — three of which hit borders with other states.
“I can tell you, from experience, it’s kind of difficult to have totally urban areas and totally rural areas where the constituents are thinking and talking about completely different things,” Crider said.
“For instance, in Hancock County and Shelby County, they never talked about mass transit, and that’s what they wanted to talk about in Irvington. And so, I mean, it’s a stretch,” he said. “And then, if you take that stretch and magnify it from, you know, the south side of Indianapolis to the Ohio River, I’m not sure how that’s even workable. I guess I don’t know how you come up with the map that does that.”
The positions of 10 others remain unknown, even though the first Senate-side votes could be cast as early as Monday afternoon.
That’s when the Elections Committee is scheduled to hear the proposal — and from constituents.
Committee math
Sen. Mike Gaskill, R-Pendleton, promised to “foster a civil debate as we review this bill,” in a Friday statement. He chairs the nine-member committee and is the Senate sponsor of the House-originated legislation.
Gaskill, plus GOP Sens. Tyler Johnson of Leo and Daryl Schmitt of Jasper, support redistricting. But fellow Sen. Greg Walker of Columbus, who isn’t running for reelection, has come out against the idea.
Two committee Democrats are expected to vote in opposition, while three other Republicans are undecided or have declined to comment.

Sen. Linda Rogers, R-LaGrange, said she’s “going back and forth, listening to constituents” throughout “lots of” phone calls and emails, as well as testimony from the House’s single public hearing last week.
“I will be in the elections committee, so until I at least hear all the testimony I don’t like to have made my decision,” Rogers told the Capital Chronicle. She noted “there are so many ramifications on both sides.”
Sen. Greg Goode, R-Terre Haute, previously said he wanted to see the maps — which have since been released — before making a decision. Goode didn’t reply to multiple requests for comment on his stance.
Sen. Stacey Donato, R-Logansport, said, “I don’t have any comment for you at this time,” when reached by phone Wednesday.
If the redistricting bill advances from first reading in committee, it would head to the chamber floor for amendments on Wednesday. After it’s engrossed, the proposal would go up for a full Senate vote on Thursday.
‘Whatever happens, happens’
It’s unclear how the bill will fare outside the committee room, too.
Sen. Aaron Freeman, R-Indianapolis, said Wednesday that he had seen the maps but hadn’t yet read the details of the bill: “You’re not going to get me to commit to something that I haven’t read.”
But, he noted, the legislation goes beyond redrawing boundaries.
“I understand there’s, you know, dates in there and all the things of, you know, people can’t sue. I mean, there’s all kinds of things in there that are unrelated to a map that I have to review,” said Freeman, who is also an attorney. “So I’ll do so, and I’ll be ready to go.”
House Bill 1032 would prohibit seeking or granting temporary injunctions against it, and gives the Indiana Supreme Court “exclusive” jurisdiction over any appeal of an order promoting an injunction.
“That part, in particular, might be a little flag for them in terms of how (unsure senators) view this,” said Laura Merrifield Wilson, a political science professor at the University of Indianapolis.

Sen. Brian Buchanan — who spoke to the Capital Chronicle during a brief dally on the sidelines of a pro-redistricting rally at the Statehouse on Friday — declined to comment on his stance or announcement timeline.
Others didn’t reply to requests for comment, including:

Republican Sens. Dan Dernulc of Highland and Rick Niemeyer of Lowell told the Capital Chronicle last month, during the ceremonial first day of the legislative session, that they wanted to see the maps before deciding. It’s unclear what they think of the released draft.
Sen. Cyndi Carrasco, R-Indianapolis, said last month that she’d made a decision. When asked to share it, she replied, “Maybe later.”
Sens. Ed Charbonneau of Valparaiso and Ryan Mishler of Fishers have been publicly noncommittal.

“We also, to my knowledge, have not heard more statements from some of the ‘question-mark’ senators,” Wilson, the professor, observed.
“I kind of wonder if … there’s been movement that we don’t know,” she said, like if senators are “not being forthright with the information of whether or not they have changed or made a decision.”
Wilson said that silence could set up a shock result, if “enough people silently vote in support, having never gone on the record … before.”
Or, it could go the other way. When asked Friday what’s next if the Senate rejects the redistricting bill, Huston told reporters: “Look, it’s been a long week. We’ll deal with it. Whatever happens, happens.”
Cranking up the pressure
Indiana Gov. Mike Braun, who appeared at the pro-redistricting rally on Friday, was more aggressive. He again threatened to support primary competition for fellow Republicans who oppose redistricting.
The bill’s failure in the Senate, he said, “means you’re gonna have to clean house to get real conservatives in.”
Braun first echoed Trump’s primary ultimatum last month, after the president posted that Braun “perhaps, is not working the way he should to get the necessary Votes” — and later, that he “must produce” on redistricting.

Rally attendees were repeatedly encouraged to contact their senators — including at stations upstairs by the Senate’s Republican and Democratic entrances. Constituents could leave handwritten messages there.
“I’m down here to break the one-party rule in Marion County,” said Lawrence Township resident Adam Harvey. “Currently, André Carson’s my congressman, and he doesn’t represent me at all.”
The rally drew a crowd of a couple hundred. Some traveled from further afield.
“The state is 60% Republican. We’ve got 80% of the House and the Senate. There’s no reason why we shouldn’t do this,” said Robert Hall, who drove about 90 miles from Mitchell.
Some redistricting opponents argue all-GOP congressional representation isn’t fair when Indiana has typically voted for Trump and others on a 60-40 split. But, Hall said, “What if each of those nine districts were 60-40? That’s what the state is.”
He, like numerous others, cited partisan redistricting efforts in Democratic-controlled states.
The pro-redistricting rally came days after hundreds of Hoosiers packed the Statehouse’s third floor to protest the redistricting plan. Their chants echoed throughout the building, audible even through the doors into the House chamber, as lawmakers plodded through proceedings.
Linda Butler of Lawrence in northeastern Marion County was among the protesters.
“They’re doing it so that they can win elections,” Butler said then, about Indiana Republicans. “It is terrible. I think it’s terrible. That’s an illustration for me that this is wrong.”
State police adjust Statehouse security
At least a dozen legislators, largely Senate Republicans, have publicly disclosed being targeted in swatting attempts, bomb threats and more — prompting an ongoing investigation now led by the Indiana State Police.
That number doesn’t include similar incidents involving local officials, such as Indianapolis City-County Councilor Nick Roberts, according to ISP spokesman Ron Galaviz.
The threats have varied but appear to share a common aim: triggering significant law enforcement responses.
In mid-November, GOP Sen. Andy Zay reported that a bomb threat was emailed to his family’s Huntington vehicle rental business, prompting officers to temporarily block off the area while they investigated.
The threat came shortly after a procedural vote on when the Senate would reconvene. Zay had voted to keep the chamber in session instead of returning in January, which was widely interpreted as support for coming back and addressing redistricting sooner.
“At this point, I’m voting for it,” he told the Capital Chronicle on Wednesday. But, he said, “I would like to see the maps change. … I’m hoping we can make them better” in the Senate.
Constituents could write directly to their senators — about redistricting or otherwise — at stations set up outside the Senate chamber at the Indiana Statehouse on Friday, Dec. 5, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
Asked what edits he’d like to make, Zay quipped, “We don’t have enough time on this phone call.” He said the maps “changed a lot more dramatically than I thought they would.”
Several other lawmakers have also disclosed fake reports had been made to police about violent incidents at their homes — including what officials described as attempts at “swatting.”
Swatting typically involves someone falsely reporting an emergency, such as a shooting or hostage situation, in an effort to prompt an armed law enforcement response to an unsuspecting person’s home.
Although some incidents prompted only small responses — “maybe about a handful of officers,” Galaviz said of the first Terre Haute call to Goode’s residence — officials have stressed that the intent behind the calls appears consistent with swatting.
Galaviz said none of the recent episodes resulted in what police would consider a “large police response.” He emphasized that local agencies “are responding seriously,” while also taking “an extra moment of pause” because they know similar hoaxes are occurring across the state.
State police are routing all reports through the Indiana Intelligence Fusion Center as part of one overarching investigation.
Galaviz said ISP has not made any arrests and declined to discuss investigative specifics. But the work “can take some time.”
The “volume of reports” and the high-profile nature of the alleged targets require “thorough, accurate, deep-diving investigations” that could ultimately result in state or federal prosecutions, per Galaviz.
Security protocols at the Statehouse have been adjusted, too, although Galaviz declined to provide details. He said ISP is “well aware” of the ongoing threats and has updated plans ahead of lawmakers’ return to Indianapolis. Local law enforcement agencies may also have their own protective measures in place for targeted officials.
Galaviz urged the public to continue sending any relevant information to the Fusion Center and said ISP will release updates — particularly if an arrest is made — but won’t disclose details prematurely.
“We’re not going to jeopardize our case just because one of your subscribers wants to know,” he said. “It’ll come out sooner or later. We just want it to come out at the appropriate time.”

The U.S. Department of Justice sued the state over the prohibition last month.
Democratic lawmakers here in Washington are now planning similar legislation.
Washington’s proposal, spearheaded by Sen. Javier Valdez, D-Seattle, and Rep. Julio Cortes, D-Everett, resembles California’s law. 
The Trump administration says the California policy jeopardizes the safety of federal officers, including those from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and is unconstitutional because it tries to regulate federal activities.
Legislators in other states, including Virginia, Illinois and Michigan, have proposed similar restrictions. Connecticut has prohibited authorities from wearing face coverings inside state courthouses, with limited exceptions.
Cortes hopes the legislation would build community trust in law enforcement and hold police accountable. 
“Trust is essential for crime reporting. When folks trust their local law enforcement, they are going to be reporting more crime,” he said Thursday. “When we see ICE out there, when those masked agents are out in communities, they create fear and intimidation, and that discourages community members from interacting with any law enforcement, even when they need help themselves.”
Cortes sees the proposed policy as consistent with existing state law requiring officers to be “reasonably identifiable,” meaning that their uniform displays their name and other information.
The bill would have some exemptions, like for undercover operations, or if officers need to wear protective gear such as gas masks or motorcycle helmets.
In an April raid at a Bellingham roofing company, dozens of ICE agents donned masks when they arrested 37 workers accused of being in the country without legal status.
Steve Strachan, executive director for the Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs, declined to comment on the substance of the bill, but said he’s had a “very productive” discussion about it with Cortes and Valdez. 
“We remain hopeful that these conversations will be ongoing and result with a proposal that we can all support,” Strachan said in a statement. 
Valdez said it’s fair to say that law enforcement is “not excited about the bill.”
The Legislature convenes in January for a 60-day session. Both the House and Senate will need to pass the bill before it can get to the governor’s desk.
The potential legal battle that could ensue if the bill becomes law doesn’t discourage Cortes. 
“That’s maybe a bridge that we’ll cross when we get there,” he said, adding that the focus now is to make “our community understand that we are here with them, and we are here to support them, and we are here to keep them safe.”
Attorney General Nick Brown said his office is monitoring the bill. 

SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 
The bill will make clear that if the courts nullify California’s law, then Washington’s law, if passed, would remain on the books, but only apply to state and local law enforcement, not federal, Valdez said.
Congressional Democrats have filed bills focused on federal agents, including ICE, but the measures have little chance of success in the Republican-controlled Congress.
Next year, Washington state lawmakers will also consider a bill championed by Brown to protect immigrant workers. The Immigrant Worker Protection Act would require employers to notify their employees of a planned inspection of employment eligibility paperwork within 72 hours of being notified about it by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/immigration-agents-portland-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-08 07:57:23.749582

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)When a Colorado woman was accused of being a porch pirate, police were certain they had the right person. After all, it was caught on camera — specifically, on automatic license plate readers. She found herself having to painstakingly comb through her life to demonstrate that she couldn’t have been the one who committed the crime — she wasn’t even in the area at the time. After police dropped the charges, she told a news station, “It became my job to prove my innocence. And I thought it was supposed to be the other way around.”
She is, of course, correct. In fact, she articulated a core principle of the American justice system: we are innocent until proven guilty. Because of this, the government should not invade our privacy just in case we do something illegal. But law enforcement agencies are increasingly using license plate readers for mass location tracking and surveillance of everyone — not just those suspected of a crime. 
Indiana lawmakers want to crack down on data privacy. What about license plate readers?

A retired veteran in Virginia filed a lawsuit to find out just how often the readers were tracking him. The result? They logged his location 526 times in just over four months — about four times every single day. 
In most areas of the country, including Indiana, the data collected by the readers can be stored indefinitely with few, if any, meaningful privacy protections. Think of the implications. These records could be used to reveal incredibly personal and sensitive information: whether a person attended an AA meeting, a political rally, a church service, the office of a physician who specializes in a specific type of disease — the list is never-ending. 
This isn’t mere speculation. In fact, there have already been numerous instances across the country of abuse – including cases where members of law enforcement used the systems to track the whereabouts of estranged partners and exes. While the vast majority of officers would never misuse a tool like this, even a single violation of someone’s privacy is unacceptable and undermines public trust. 
The privacy concerns around license plate readers don’t stop at city or county lines. Some systems, like Flock, are used across the country and around the world. This means law enforcement in other states, and even countries, can access Hoosiers’ data, turning a supposedly local safety tool into potential cross-border surveillance that people never agreed to and can’t reasonably opt out of. 
Indiana lawmakers should institute reasonable guardrails on the use of the technology. This includes requiring that the records of people who are not suspected of any crime be deleted within a short period — days or weeks at most. Regulations should also ensure that law enforcement agencies can’t use databases from private companies that have inadequate privacy policies.  
License plate readers can be a helpful tool when used for narrowly tailored purposes, such as toll enforcement or identifying vehicles that are stolen or involved in a serious crime. But lawmakers must balance the use of this technology with the privacy rights of Hoosiers. If you wouldn’t be ok with the government installing GPS on your car to track your every move, you shouldn’t be ok with the unregulated use of these readers either.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2157492329-1024x678.jpg,,,2025-12-08 07:57:23.749582

Biking from Springfield to Mountain Home, Arkansas, where he’d planned to stay with a friend, Chiasson, 52, was pulled over and arrested on a warrant for a stolen car — charges that were eventually dropped.
While fighting the charges, Chiasson said, he got into a cycle of “using, stressing,” failing drug tests at his court appearances and then “hav[ing] to go do seven days in jail.” 
He was in jail when another inmate told him about the Action Recovery Center, a Christian sober living house in Gainesville. The residential program promised to help residents with substance use disorders find stability through faith, work and peer support.
Chiasson became one of about 20 Missourians who have graduated from Action Recovery Center’s nine-month program since it opened in November 2023. It’s one of a spate of faith-based sober living houses established by Christians in recovery from substance use disorders in Wright, Ozark, Douglas and Texas counties.
Jerry Chiasson reflects on his time as a resident and mentor at Action Recovery Center in Gainesville (Steph Quinn/Missouri Independent).
They’ve emerged outside Missouri’s regulatory structures for recovery houses in a part of the state where treatment and services for people battling substance use disorders are scarce. There are 3,677 accredited beds in the state, and 44% of them are located in St. Louis or Kansas City. There are no accredited beds in Ozark County, where Action Recovery Center is located.
While these unaccredited recovery houses meet a need in communities where treatment options are limited or nonexistent, they raise concerns that a lack of any oversight could hinder their effectiveness or lead to abuse.
“These things are popping up all over,” said Judge Craig Carter, presiding judge in the 44th circuit, which spans Ozark, Wright and Douglas counties. “And they give a lot of people who otherwise could not get it, they give them a second chance.”
Carter said that while he has a working relationship with recovery houses like Action Recovery Center and Mountain Moving Ministry in Wright County, he doesn’t always know what to expect from new houses farther afield.
“If I send someone all the way down to Butler County, I need to know that they’re going to communicate with me and that they’re above board,” Carter said.

Recovery houses in Missouri are not required to undergo any certification process to open their doors. But in order to receive state or federal funding disbursed by the Missouri Department of Mental Health, they must be accredited by the Missouri Coalition of Recovery Support Providers. 
The coalition accredits recovery houses using standards established by the National Alliance of Recovery Residences. The standards cover residents’ rights, building safety and the houses’ relationship with neighbors, and after initial accreditation, the coalition visits houses every two years to ensure they still meet all requirements.
Merna Eppick, director of the coalition’s housing committee, said the aim of accreditation is to strengthen support for residents of these recovery houses.
“We try hard to help you become better,” Eppick said. “Our goal is, even if you’ve got 20 deficiencies, you’ve got 90 days to fix it. We revisit it and say, ‘Yay, you did a great job. You’re accredited.’ We want to help all of us be better.” 
But Action Recovery Center — and a handful of other recovery houses in southern Missouri — are not seeking accreditation. 
Ken Polm, founder of Big Boy Men’s Ministry in Cabool, said he doesn’t pursue state funding because he is concerned the money would come with requirements that could sideline residents’ spiritual development.
“If we receive state funding,” Polm said, “a lot of times, we’re not allowed to make it all about Christ. We get limited to what we can actually do, as far as the type of classes.”
For Polm, the biggest issue with accreditation relates to medication-assisted treatment. He and other leaders of faith-based sober living homes told The Independent that they worry taking medications like methadone or buprenorphine to beat an opioid addiction sets people up to relapse.
Decades of research have shown that methadone and buprenorphine taken as “maintenance” medications, for months or years, sharply reduce overdose deaths by 50 to 70%.
Recovery houses don’t have to accept medication-assisted treatment to be accredited or receive state funding. But they do if they want any federal funds through the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.
 To fish for a man

On a Tuesday evening in late October, 15 to 20 men spill from the living room to the kitchen of an old house in Cabool, with a couple of people poring over Bibles in an adjoining room. 
It’s one of two homes to Big Boy Men’s Ministry. 
There are at least four bedrooms filled with the stuff of the men’s lives: family photos taped to the wall, backpacks, laundry hampers clustered around bunk beds set up dorm-style. Polm is rushing to get to a revival, and he’s trying to round up residents who want to come. Others stay to socialize, with hugs and gentle ribbing among men who have become brothers.
Polm said he began his ministry to men struggling with addiction while he was on probation. He’d strike up conversations when he reported to the probation office.
Chiasson wrote the mission statement for Action Recovery House after becoming house leader. “Those words just poured out of my heart,” he said  (Steph Quinn/Missouri Independent).
“Just through conversation, you could tell that they were trying to have a new life, but they didn’t know how to have it,” Polm said. “So I would basically start there. Then after that, even when it wasn’t my visit to see the probation officer, I would still attend the office, just to go in there and sit and fish for a man.”
Polm said he and his wife, April, were “blessed…with a very big house.” So they started welcoming men to live in their 3,200-square-foot basement. Big Boy Men’s Ministry now spans two houses, and April started a recovery housing ministry for women called Abundant Grace.
“Me and my wife, we really enjoy it,” Polm said. “Because downstairs, when the guys are down there and they’re being rowdy, laughing and just carrying on with each other, being brothers with one another…being able to be partakers of that experience is so rewarding.”
The men work during the day and attend evening classes four to five times a week. Saturday is laundry and shopping day, Polm said, and from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m., they volunteer in the community, building decks, repairing roofs, washing windows, cleaning gutters, “just all kinds of stuff.”
Once a month, the men hold “street church” and share their testimony with the public.
“Either myself or the other men from the ministry that’s been raised up from discipleship to be preachers, they get to be up there preaching the word of God, and we do altar calls,” Polm said. “So we’re very involved on the weekends in our community.”
The men pay $150 per week after their first two weeks, and the ministry accepts donations. 
In late October, there were around 20 men in each of the Polms’ houses. Polm said 50 to 60 men graduate from the ministry each year, and that he and his wife counsel residents like parents. 
“I sit them down as men, and I have these hard talks with them like a father would give them, and I give them the best advice that I can come up with,” he said. “And my wife does the same thing. It’s pretty fascinating and such a joy to experience this, that some of the men will even come to my wife and say, ‘Hey Mom, can we talk?’ They’re having wife problems, or they’re having children problems.”
Dayton Austin, 28, of West Plains, said Polm has been talking to him “man to man” since the first time he got in trouble in 2019, even when he slipped up.
He did his first recovery housing program at Mountain Moving Ministry in Mountain Grove, Austin said, where Polm is board president. 
He graduated from the program and “made all the right moves, did all the right hoops, said all the right words,” but got another charge within six months.
Austin kept graduating from recovery housing programs and getting in trouble, he said, selling fentanyl and “just being crazy.” He had periods of success, too, studying for a few years to be an occupational therapy assistant in Springfield.
“I was doing the thing, without people having to tell me what to do,” Austin said.
Dayton Austin looks to the future in the kitchen of Big Boy Men’s Ministry in Cabool (Steph Quinn/Missouri Independent).
He loved his studies, he said, but they were stressful and he returned to old patterns. He got caught with meth and a gun. 
Polm told him to just show up at Big Boy Men’s Ministry.
“I had a feeling I was destined for prison,” Austin said, “but I knew I needed to be here before I went.” 
Five months into his stay, Austin was sent to prison for eight months. But, he said, “I had a foundation to go to prison on now.” 
After his release this year, Austin returned to Cabool.
He looks up to the ministry’s growing group of graduates. Some of them have become part of the ministry’s leadership.
“All these guys are on the board now, that God’s really using,” Austin said. “He gave them businesses. They’re busting with kids. They’re busting with families. … They’re creating their own ministries.”
Austin, who is now a certified nursing assistant, said he hopes for a family of his own someday. 
“It’s all a process,” he said, “but I know what I want.”
 Grassroots standards

It’s a busy November morning at the Wright County Courthouse in Hartville, with almost 70 people on the criminal docket.
Chris Turner, 48, of West Plains, is the first to be called before the judge. 
Turner, who was found guilty of burglary and meth possession in April, was called to court for a probation violation hearing because she hadn’t been making her restitution payments. But she was able to satisfy Judge Craig Carter that she’s making progress.
She’s settled up with the county. And in June she moved into a Christian sober living house in West Plains called Design Your Life.
The women’s recovery house was established in September 2024. Carter said he had never heard of it.
“I can honestly say it’s the best thing that’s happened to me since I got in trouble,” Turner told The Independent.
Before she joined Design Your Life, Turner said she was facing homelessness and struggling to find transportation to her drug tests. She said she used to walk the 43 miles from West Plains to Mountain Grove. 
Now she gets transportation to court and her job at a sawmill from Design Your Life. And living in a house full of women is coaxing her out of her shell, she said.
Carter said he is a strong supporter of Christian sober living houses.
But he said there’s a need for shared expectations between sober living houses and the courts when completion of a recovery housing program is a condition of a defendant’s bond or probation. He said communication and fair, consistent drug testing are two of the most important areas for agreement.
Judges can’t unilaterally force a defendant to participate in a religious program, Carter said. But if a defendant applies to a Christian sober living house and is accepted, it can help make the case against keeping them in jail or sending them to prison.
“We’ve sent people to some of the ones in Springfield,” Carter said, “and guys will run, and they won’t let us know. We’ll have them back on the docket in two months. Where is this person?”
Autumn Dulaney, 42, of Isabella, outside of Action Recovery Center in Gainesville. Since finishing the program last year, she and her husband have saved enough money to move out of their camper into a house, and she’s mending her relationships with her children. “I couldn’t have done it without Jesus,” she said (Steph Quinn/Missouri Independent).
Wright County Prosecutor John Tyrrell said he is concerned a lack of standardization can allow abuse of residents.
He gave the example of Compassion House in Niangua. The facility’s founder, Isaac Tilden, was charged this year with child abuse and forced labor. The complaints allege that Tilden compelled residents to work for free or face revocation of probation or parole, and that he failed to protect his daughter from sexual abuse by residents.
Accreditation provides standards and protections for recovery house residents, but accredited recovery beds are scarce in some parts of the state.
Shawn Wilkerson, who is spearheading plans to expand Mountain Moving Ministry to Ava, said he and a friend spent 10 hours trying to find a spot for him in treatment when he embarked on his recovery journey five years ago.
“The guy said, ‘Well, it going to be a year,” Wilkerson said. “I said, ‘Well, in a year I’ll either be in prison or dead.”
Howell County, where Turner and Austin are from, has only 18 of the state’s 3,677 accredited recovery beds. Texas County, where Polm runs his two recovery houses, has one accredited house with 22 beds.
Springfield and Branson have a combined 641 beds, but each is over an hour away from Gainesville or Mountain Grove. And transportation is a challenge in this rural part of the state.
Sober living houses typically transport residents to and from work and court.
“Twenty guys in a house, and they all have different court dates,” Carter said. “And in different counties…. They just drive the tires off.”
Tyrrell said he’s leery of state oversight but suggested that judges, prosecutors and attorneys gather on a circuit level to set expectations for recovery houses.
“I need to know that the programs understand that these are court orders, and court orders have to be complied with,” Tyrrell said.
Wilkerson said leaders of the residences and the courts should work locally to share best practices.
“We need to build — and I think this is where we’re at working on it — building a baseline portfolio to where I could sit down with a prosecutor in Greene County, open up a portfolio and say, ‘This is what we do, why we do it, how we do it,” Wilkerson said.
Tyrrell said the recovery houses the court works with often share information that helps him make decisions about defendants’ cases. 
“I can go talk to the director,” Tyrrell said, “and say, ‘Hey, tell me about this person. What’s he like? Is there something I need to know?’ And they’ll be honest with you. That helps.”
Jayson Jackson, 27, said he was about to be sent to prison for 10 years after absconding from probation when he told the prosecuting attorney on his case that he was going to Big Boy Men’s Ministry. Because the prosecutor and judge were familiar with Polm’s recovery house, they agreed to give him a chance.
“I go, ‘God sent me a piece of paper telling me I’m going to Big Boy,” Jackson said. “So unless you [or that judge] have got more authority than God, I know I’m not [going to prison].”

Jackson said he had been trying to break into an abandoned house in Willow Springs while on the lam when he encountered God. He had fallen to his knees on the side of a road and prayed. Then, he said, a piece of paper hit him in the face. 
It was an advertisement for a new sandwich from Dairy Queen, Jackson said. On the other side, someone had written down Polm’s phone number.
Jackson said he’s been sober for 3 years. Now he travels around the state with Polm, preaching, and he works at a sawmill.
“I throw logs for a living,” Jackson said. “They come in, roll them down the log deck, chop them all up and I stack them.”
Jackson said the hard work has been worth it.
“It’s cold, and it’s wet,” he said. “But I wouldn’t trade the life that I live right now for the whole world.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_3273-1024x614.jpeg,,,2025-12-08 07:57:23.749582

Addison County State’s Attorney Eva Vekos’ conduct has prompted two formal ethics complaints. One advocate called her behavior “unacceptable and deeply concerning.”
Read the story on VTDigger here:  These Vermont sexual assault survivors sought justice. Instead, one victim said the prosecutor’s approach was “like a ‘screw you’”.","A Bristol small business owner said she hoped she and her 15-year-old daughter would be treated respectfully when they pursued a criminal complaint against the teenager who sexually assaulted her daughter. 
Instead, the business owner says she was sworn at by Eva Vekos, the embattled state’s attorney in Addison County. State’s attorneys are elected in every county in Vermont to lead the office that works with police and sheriffs departments to prosecute cases in court. 
“Her general attitude toward victims is so derogatory,” the business owner said of Vekos. She filed a formal ethics complaint against Vekos, whose troubles have piled up since she was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol nearly two years ago. 
Because of how the business owner and three other crime victims say Vekos handled their cases, they felt invalidated, belittled and demeaned. In three of these cases, the victims said Vekos denied them the opportunity to give meaningful input on plea deals she was negotiating with the defense on the sentences their offenders would face. It was “kind of like a ‘screw you’ situation,” said a college student from Vermont who was a victim in a sexual assault case. 
Martha Bowdish, a victim advocate at Addison County Unit for Special Investigations, which investigates sex crimes, has also filed a formal ethics complaint about Vekos with the state Professional Responsibility Board, which handles allegations of attorney misconduct.
The board of Atria Collective, a Middlebury organization that worked closely with Vekos’ office, also raised concern, saying, in a statement to media, that staff has witnessed “countless instances” of victims’ rights being violated during Vekos’ time in office.
“In case after case, our agency has observed, State’s Attorney Vekos neglecting to prioritize both the safety of victims and survivors and the well-being of the community,” Atria Collective’s board of directors wrote.

Vekos’ tumultuous relationship with victims and their advocates came to light after she was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol when she allegedly appeared intoxicated at a suspicious death investigation in January 2024. 
The state investigated a medical leave she took soon after the DUI charge. Then it temporarily suspended her law license. A judge declined to throw out her case. In the fall, her attorney pushed for a deal that could allow the charge to be cleared from her record. Her next court date is set for Dec. 16. 
In spring 2024, lawmakers called for her resignation, but Vekos never stepped down. She is up for re-election in November of 2026.
Vekos declined multiple requests for an interview to discuss the complaints outlined in this story. She responded to some questions via email but declined to discuss others, saying she is constrained by privacy laws.

“I stand by the work done in every case handled by my office,” she wrote. 
“There is no State’s Attorney in Vermont—or prosecutor anywhere—who has been able to fulfill the wishes of every crime victim, ” she wrote, adding that prosecutors must weigh other factors like the strength of evidence and available resources. 
To be sure, prosecutors routinely weigh their chances of winning a conviction as they consider making plea deals. But victims and advocates who criticized Vekos argue she did not meaningfully consult with victims before agreeing to a case’s resolution and that she treated them egregiously. Two victims said the outcomes of their cases led them to fear for public safety. 
Vermont law states that crime victims “shall be treated with courtesy and sensitivity” by courts and prosecutors. To ensure victims receive support, state law also guarantees crime victims the right to a victim advocate, someone trained to walk victims through court processes.
Victims rights were adopted by Vermont and many other states in the 1980s in response to complaints from victims that they were left behind in overburdened criminal justice systems. The goal was to better support victims and create avenues for their voices to be heard in the legal system. 
Victim advocates are state employees who work in every county’s state’s attorneys office. In Vermont, they often handle about 600 cases each, about double the number recommended by a study often cited by state officials. In Addison County, staff from other organizations, including Bowdish and Jena Santa Maria, who directs advocacy for Atria Collective, have stepped in to help.
VTDigger has decided not to name these sexual assault victims or their families, and does not identify sexual assault victims without their consent. VTDigger also interviewed two people who work closely with Vekos’ office who spoke on the condition their names not be used in this story for fear of retaliation. 
‘She had a vendetta’ 
The Bristol small business owner helped her teenage daughter contact police in 2017 after she was sexually assaulted by a teenage boy who was also under the age of 16.

After police found probable cause, a deputy state’s attorney at the time, Rebecca Otey, filed charges against the teenager who assaulted the business owner’s daughter. He faced up to a life sentence, court documents show. 
He pleaded guilty to the charge in 2018 and avoided serving time in prison on the condition he take part in a program for youthful offenders, court documents show. 
He could remain in the youthful offender program if he made a “good faith effort at treatment” and did not commit a crime of violence, his plea agreement said. 
But court records show he lost his placement in the youthful offender program and was eventually arrested in 2023. By this time, he was a 21-year-old man. Juvenile court records, detailing his time in the program, are confidential. 
Vekos was now serving as Addison County’s state’s attorney. After spending most of her career as a defense attorney, often representing juveniles, she was elected to be the county’s top prosecutor in 2022. 
Vermont law gives crime victims the right to get timely notifications of their offender’s release. But in 2023, the man who sexually assaulted the business owner’s daughter was released from jail, court records show. Vekos did not give the business owner any notice, according to the business owner and a person who works closely with cases in Vekos’ office. 
The business owner, in a private meeting with the state’s attorney, said she told Vekos she had violated her daughter’s rights. According to the business owner, Vekos responded, “This is fucking ridiculous. I don’t have time for this.” 
“That’s pretty much set the whole tone for that meeting, where she was just using profanity right and left,” the business owner said. “She was just so condescending and so arrogant,” she added later on. 
The business owner went on to report the profanities when she filed an ethics complaint against Vekos in 2024 with the state board that handles allegations of attorney misconduct. She shared that complaint with VTDigger.
After that meeting, things changed for her daughter’s case. “From that day on she didn’t like that I had called her out and she was gonna do everything she could to make sure that he wasn’t prosecuted,” the business owner said. 
“I would go that far, to say that she had a vendetta and like she was going to prove to me that she could do what she wanted and screw the victims,” the business owner said. 
“Vekos believes she is above the law,” the business owner wrote in her ethics complaint. 
Vekos didn’t address this claim directly when asked to respond to a list of complaints. 
In February, Vekos agreed to give a six-year deferred sentence to the man convicted for his original sexual assault charge from 2017, court documents show. If he followed his conditions of probation for those years, he would then have a clean record. 
The business owner said she considered that possibility “very very dangerous.”
The business owner wrote in her ethics complaint that Vekos violated her and her daughter’s rights by entering into the deferred sentence agreement with the defense before consulting her. A person who works closely with the cases in Vekos’ office confirmed that the business owner and her daughter were not consulted. 
In conversations with the business owner, Vekos did not know basic facts about the case and admitted she did not have time to read the entire file, the business owner wrote in her ethics complaint. The complaint is still pending before the state’s attorney misconduct board. 
A few months later, this June, the man was cited for violating his probation conditions by moving to a different part of the state, according to court documents. Typically, when someone convicted of a crime violates their probation conditions, the person is sentenced after they admit to the violation in court. In this case, the man could have seen up to life in prison on his original charge. 
Instead, Vekos dropped the violation of probation he was facing this summer, court documents show. That was despite the business owner’s insistence that Vekos prosecute the violation, the business owner said. The man was able to continue serving his years of probation outside of jail. 
“I have zero faith in the Addison County court system because of Eva. Like, zero faith,” the business owner said, using Vekos’ first name. “Every time I go to court, I always expect the worst. Always. Because that’s probably what’s going to happen.”
Vekos, asked to respond to the business owner’s complaints, said she could not do so for confidentiality reasons. In an email, she said: “My office is dedicated to supporting crime victims in all cases, which we do every day.”
Complaints of retaliation
After advocates for the Middlebury special investigations unit and Atria Collective complained about Vekos’ behavior, Vekos largely declined to communicate with them, surfacing concerns that victims weren’t being served.
“Eva Vekos has instructed her staff not to communicate with my organization,” Santa Maria, the advocacy director for Atria Collective, wrote in an email in May. She called Vekos’ behavior an example of retaliation. 
In that email, Santa Maria said, Vekos’ behavior “violates the spirit, if not the letter, of Vermont’s victims’ rights laws.” 
Similarly, after Bowdish filed an ethics complaint about Vekos in April, the prosecutor told her office not to communicate with Bowdish, according to an annual report from Bowdish’s investigations unit describing the fallout. 
Bowdish declined to comment on her ethics complaint. 
Vekos restricted Bowdish’s badge access and removed her from a state’s attorney software platform, preventing Bowdish from getting updates on cases, the annual report said.
Instead, Vekos was sending information on cases to other staff in Bowdish’s office, according to the report. That information was “often late and inaccurate,” the report said. 
“Bottom line victims are suffering,” the report said. 
At least five victims in cases investigated by Bowdish’s office retained their own attorneys due to lack of support from Vekos, according to the report. “This is something that has never happened before,” the document said. 
Vekos, in responding to questions via email, said the decision to cut off contact with Bowdish was based on advice from her attorney. Vekos said she took Bowdish off the court’s software systems back in 2023 because Bowdish, as a member of the public, shouldn’t have access to the platform. 
When asked to respond to Santa Maria’s claim, Vekos said, “There has never been any sort of retaliation against advocates in the community.” Santa Maria declined to comment. 
While conflicts between Vekos and the two community partners stewed, the only advocate directly employed by Vekos’ office, Katie Dutton, resigned in April. Dutton declined to comment. 
After Dutton left Vekos’ office, the position sat vacant for about three months. “When the office is understaffed, the whole team pitches in to make sure the job gets done,” Vekos wrote in a July email in response to a request for an interview.
During those months, Vekos’ strained relationships with Bowdish and Santa Maria bubbled to the surface. During that time period, emails sent from Bowdish describe instances in which Vekos declined to meet with victims if Bowdish was present. Those emails were obtained by VTDigger through a public records request. 
Maggie Zraly, who was hired as the victim advocate in Vekos’ office this past summer, declined a request for an interview but said her office has been a “supportive environment” where she can serve victims. 
Bowdish’s ethics complaint is still pending.
‘She doesn’t care about me or community safety’ 
Three crime victims, in addition to the business owner, told VTDigger that Vekos mistreated them. They said Vekos was disrespectful and did not take their input into their cases seriously. 
A 45-year-old Starksboro woman is the mother of one of those victims. The Starksboro woman said she has advocated for her daughter since she was sexually assaulted at age 15. 
Police affidavits describe how a 24-year-old man groomed the woman’s daughter and started picking her up late at night while her parents slept. The Starksboro woman contacted police when she looked at her daughter’s phone and found pictures of the man sexually assaulting her. 
The man was charged with four felony sexual assault counts, each of which could could carry up to 20 years in prison, along with other charges. 
The Starksboro woman and a person who works closely with cases in Vekos’ office said the assigned advocate, Bowdish, would email Vekos multiple times asking for updates about the case days before a hearing and oftentimes Vekos wouldn’t respond until minutes before court. 
The mother and her daughter told Bowdish they opposed a plea deal, and Bowdish shared their opposition with Vekos, the Starksboro woman said. 
“Even though Eva heard the things we were saying, she still went ahead with her plea deals as she made them,” the Starksboro woman said. 
In September, Vekos scaled back the charges against her daughter’s assailant to just one misdemeanor, court records show. He pled guilty and was sentenced to five years of probation, court documents show. 
For the man’s sentencing in court, the Starksboro woman’s daughter wrote a statement to the judge, saying she did not agree with the outcome and that Vekos had never consulted her. It was the third time Vekos made a plea agreement without consulting her or her mother, the daughter said. 
“This man destroyed my life. There are videos of me out there — god knows where. Do you know how terrifying that is? Do you care? It’s very clear Ms. Vekos doesn’t,” the daughter wrote.
“She doesn’t care about me or community safety. Ms. Vekos cares more about giving him the best deal than actually upholding the law,” she wrote.
Another case handled by Vekos played out similarly. 
In May 2022, a young woman who grew up in Vermont and goes to college in Virginia sought help from police after she was sexually assaulted at age 18, she said in an interview. The man she reported was originally facing a felony charge that could carry up to five years in prison, court records show. 
In December 2024, Vekos reduced the charge to a misdemeanor that only carried up to a year in prison, according to court documents. That was despite the college student’s vocal opposition, she said. 
“Everything just went smaller and smaller and smaller,” the college student said. 
The man agreed to plead no contest and, in exchange for a recommendation that he not serve any time, agreed to follow several probation conditions. None of those conditions agreed to by Vekos were geared toward preventing sex crimes, such as not working somewhere that regularly serves minors, court documents show. 
The college student and a person who works closely with cases in Vekos’ office said she found out that Vekos had agreed to the probation conditions only seven minutes before the man’s sentencing in court — meaning she did not have time to give meaningful input to Vekos or argue against his punishment.  
“Then I can’t change anything because the attorneys already made the agreement. They’ve already given it to the judge, and if they don’t inform us, it’s kind of like a ‘screw you’ situation,” the college student said. 
Like the Bristol business owner, the college student said when she complained that Vekos was discussing deals with the defense that she opposed, Vekos dismissed her concerns. Instead, Vekos complained about how much work it would create for her to push for the outcome the college student wanted, she said.
Asked about the college student’s complaints against her, Vekos said via email that she could not discuss that case and others because she’s constrained by privacy laws. 
“Also, there are several other additional sex assaults with child victims that I have prosecuted, including one involving a serial offender whose trial I personally conducted, leading to a guilty verdict and a sentence of 20 years to life,” Vekos wrote in an email. When asked what cases she was referring to in a follow-up email, the prosecutor did not specify in her reply. 
Beyond Vekos’ prosecution of sex offenses, other victims take issue with Vekos’ emotional insensitivity in their cases.

Tina Galante-Cram, a nurse who lives in Bristol, said Vekos was insensitive in her daughter’s case. 
Galante-Cram’s daughter, Jaida Cram, died after being injured in a car crash in April. Police affidavits say that Cram’s boyfriend was driving under the influence of marijuana with a suspended license.
It’s been hard to know how to live without her daughter.
“I’m not supposed to outlive my daughter,” Galate-Cram said in an interview in downtown Bristol, wearing a pink shirt printed with a picture of her daughter’s face.
Galate-Cram was 14 years old when she gave birth to her daughter and she put everything she had into raising her, she said. She wears her daughter’s ashes in a pendant around her neck. 
After her death, Cram’s boyfriend was charged with three felony crimes related to the crash, including manslaughter, court documents show. The case has since been moved to juvenile court. 
Without first consulting the mother, Galante-Cram said Vekos surprised her by proposing in court to amend the boyfriend’s probation conditions to allow him to attend Cram’s memorial. 
Galante-Cram said she was shocked. Vekos should not have ever proposed such an idea to the court, especially without consulting her first, she said. 
“I don’t want the killer mourning my child,” Galante-Cram said.
“She’s just looking at it like it’s another case,” she said of Vekos. “She doesn’t care.”

Before the U.S. Supreme Court recognized the right to an abortion in Roe v. Wade, a lot of women and girls died trying to end their pregnancies themselves. How many is impossible to know.
Since our current court overturned Roe, women are once again dying, as ProPublica has reported. But not in numbers anywhere near those of pre-Roe deaths from self-administered abortion. Then, as one doctor explained, “‘wire coat hangers, knitting needles, and slippery tree branches’ were the most common approaches.”
The vastly lower mortality post-Roe is the result of a number of factors, including there still being states where abortion is legal to travel to, along with abortion funds and internet forums helping people get there. 
But the biggest reason we aren’t seeing more deaths from self-managed abortion is modern medicine. Specifically, mifepristone. 
Mifepristone has been used for medication abortion in the U.S. for the past quarter century. The FDA’s 2000 approval of mifepristone meant women could have abortions earlier in pregnancy, rather than having to stay pregnant for weeks to have more invasive, procedural abortions. 
Patients report that a very early medication abortion can be no worse than a menstrual period. 
Today two thirds of abortions in the U.S. are medication abortions. Mifepristone is also used to treat miscarriages, which one in 10 women with known pregnancies will experience. And it is used to treat a slew of other conditions.
Opponents of legal abortion hate medication abortion. It makes it technically possible to have an abortion as soon as you suspect you are pregnant, and abortion opponents want to keep the focus on the women that they can vilify for needing later abortions. The early miscarriage induced by a medication abortion takes place in the privacy of one’s own home, depriving anti-abortion “sidewalk counselors” of the opportunity to intimidate women as they enter clinics. 
Basically, the advent of mifepristone made ending a pregnancy less painful and abortion opponents want it to be more painful.
Newly appointed Missouri Attorney General Catharine Hanaway has now joined the crusade to block access to mifepristone with a new filing in what remains of a sprawling and ridiculous lawsuit initiated in Texas that the U.S. Supreme Court mostly tossed. 
The remnants have landed in Missouri.
Anti-abortion doctors sued to have mifepristone taken off the market. The ultra-conservative Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that claim was time-barred (again, it was approved 25 years ago). The U.S. Supreme Court ultimately ruled that, thanks to federal conscience protections entitling the doctors to deny treatment, their fear of having to provide emergency care to someone who had taken mifepristone wasn’t an injury giving them standing to sue. 
But the case lives on.
Missouri, Idaho and Kansas had intervened as fellow plaintiffs. Those states can’t sue in Texas, so the Texas district court transferred the case to Missouri, where our federal courts are newly stacked with extremely anti-abortion Trump appointees, many of whom worked on this and other anti-abortion legal efforts as attorneys. 
While the attempt to get mifepristone off the market completely is dead, plaintiffs are seeking to make it inaccessible by forcing the FDA to reinstate unnecessary restrictions. For example, requirements for multiple appointments and that the pill be taken in the presence of a physician rather than obtained at a pharmacy like most medicines. 
I had hoped Hanaway might see her job as being a good lawyer working in the interests of all Missourians, rather than a culture warring partisan like her recent predecessors. It was not to be.
The filing is another piece of work indicative of how unseriously Hanaway takes her ethical obligations as the state’s top lawyer. It is filled with distortions about the law and women’s health care. In it, she and her counterparts claim to be seeking to protect women’s safety. In reality, all the evidence shows and all the nation’s major medical groups agree that her desired outcome would put us in danger. 
It’s impossible to believe this accomplished lawyer doesn’t understand that — she just doesn’t care. 
The filing adds an additional claim against the FDA for approving a second generic version of mifepristone in September. Hanaway acknowledges that the generic is chemically identical to the branded mifepristone, but argues it shouldn’t have been approved because the brand-name drug is unsafe.
That isn’t true. As the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Medical Association and nine other medical associations explained in an amicus brief, mifepristone is among the most studied drugs in the world. And those studies show it is safe.
The claim that making mifepristone harder to get will make abortion safer is audaciously disingenuous. Plaintiffs purport to lament the end of the in-person prescribing requirement because it severs the relationship between patient and doctor. These are the same people working to keep it illegal to have a medication abortion under the supervision of a local doctor. 
They are also fighting to keep mifepristone from women who are miscarrying. Even under the somewhat loosened regulations, mifepristone is largely unavailable in Missouri for miscarriage treatment because the process to become an approved prescriber remains arduous.
Mifepristone is currently completely unavailable for abortion care despite the passage of the Reproductive Freedom Initiative due to state restrictions currently being challenged in court.
Plaintiffs want mifepristone harder to access outside of Missouri. That means patients will have to have later abortions waiting for appointments and travel multiple times or spend days in hotel rooms for unnecessary additional visits. That will be too much for some people to manage or afford, causing more to order mifepristone online to self-manage — which is a massive improvement over slippery tree branches, but shouldn’t be one’s only option. 
Hanaway’s filing specifically laments that the generic’s approval could make mifepristone less expensive. Plaintiffs want to punish women for ending pregnancies by making the process as expensive, stressful, late, and medically invasive as possible.
This duplicity is not new, but it stings more coming from Missouri’s first female attorney general.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54921771475_e3916f919a_c.jpg,,,2025-12-08 06:57:23.952322

Federal fallout

	
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and
whether to make up the difference.
Read the latest > 


	A proposed budget from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) that cuts funds which have meant the difference between shelter and homelessness for about 170,000 people nationwide has left communities scrambling. In Wisconsin, the cuts are projected to cause the loss of permanent housing for 2,379 people according to a report by the National Alliance to End Homelessness. The loss of funds would hit early in the new year, leaving local governments to absorb the fallout in the middle of winter. 
Korey Lundin, senior staff attorney at the National Housing Law Project and former staff attorney with Legal Action of Wisconsin, told the Wisconsin Examiner that the grants that HUD cut —  known as Continuum of Care (CoC) funds — “help thousands of people. That includes folks who have been recently unhoused.” In Wisconsin, 52% of permanent housing funding is covered by the CoC program. 
The people the CoC program serves, Ludin said, include “families, children, seniors, veterans, those who are survivors of domestic violence,” and others who are “not just the stereotypical image that people get when they think of a homeless person.”
In Milwaukee County, over $12 million in CoC funds covers direct rent payments to help provide housing for vulnerable county residents. The investments help support thousands of people across more than 20 housing programs. 
CoC funding in Milwaukee County supports housing for:

over 770 children;
154 young adults between 18 and 24 years old, 
560 working-age residents from 25 to 44 years old, 
590 people between the ages of 45 to 64,
826 people with no income at all, 
347 who earn only $500-$1000 a month,
1,049 people diagnosed with mental health disorders,
321 people with physical disabilities,
123 with co-occurring substance use disorders,
549 people who’ve remained in housing for over five years,
and 610 people who’ve maintained housing for 1 to 2 years. 

HUD has also proposed capping permanent housing support at 30%. In Milwaukee County 89% of CoC funds are dedicated to permanent housing beds. The picture isn’t much different for Dane County (where 78% of CoC funding goes to permanent beds), or Racine County (where 80% of CoC funding supports permanent beds). 
HUD announced the cuts saying they will help fulfill President Donald Trump’s “Ending Crime and Disorder on America’s Streets” executive order. HUD claimed that cutting support for permanent housing beds across the country will restore “accountability to homelessness programs” while promoting “self-sufficiency among vulnerable Americans.” 
The Trump administration has been criticized for policies that essentially criminalize homelessness, jailing and displacing unhoused people in an effort to beautify cities. Lundin sees the HUD cuts as part of that effort. He told the Wisconsin Examiner, “They want to round up and warehouse the unhoused. They want to incarcerate the unhoused. The solutions they’re talking about are solutions that exacerbate homelessness.”
HUD Secretary Scott Turner has said that restricting and cutting permanent bed funding is “ending the status quo that perpetuated homelessness through a self-sustaining slush fund.” In a press release announcing the cuts, HUD criticized “the failed ‘Housing First’ ideology, which encourages dependence on endless government handouts while neglecting to address the root causes of homelessness, including illicit drugs and mental illnesses.”
Housing First is an approach to addressing homelessness that prioritizes placing individuals in permanent and stable housing. One 2022 study — which noted that chronic homelessness in the U.S. costs up to $3.4 billion — found that the economic benefits of implementing Housing First programs outweigh the costs of the programs. In 2023, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs published a research brief highlighting that “strong evidence exists that the Housing First model leads to quicker exits from homelessness and greater housing stability over time compared with treatment as usual.” It also stated that studies on the Housing First Model — four of which were reviewed to compile the research brief — show that the model “results in greater improvements in housing outcomes for homeless adult populations in North America.” 
Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley, who credits the county’s Housing First approach for a sharp reduction in homelessness, told the Examiner, “I am deeply concerned about the Trump administration’s move to slash permanent housing funding. This decision will destabilize housing for people across the country and it threatens the real progress we have made in Milwaukee County through our Housing First program.” Crowley noted that Milwaukee County has been recognized for having the lowest number of unsheltered homeless residents count per capita in the country, “and we are looked at as a national leader in this space. As someone who knows what housing insecurity feels like, I will pull every lever I can to protect working families and expand access to permanent housing so we can keep our state moving forward.” 
Especially in the winter, the HUD cuts could have troubling consequences. “We don’t have any state protection that prohibits people from being evicted in winter,” said Lundin, who lives in Wisconsin. “If this goes through it would be happening in the worst time here in Wisconsin in the middle of the winter.” 
Lawsuits are already being filed by cities, states and nonprofits. Lundin also said that Congress could intervene by appropriating funding for the HUD programs the administration plans to cut in 2026. In a statement to the Examiner, U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Milwaukee) called CoC funding and homeless programs “vital to many organizations in Wisconsin and in Milwaukee who help the unhoused and keep people housed.” 
Moore said in the statement, “as per usual with this administration, it is the most vulnerable, like domestic violence survivors and LGBTQ youth, who would be hit the hardest. The Trump Administration’s proposal disregards Congress’s intent and would be catastrophic, putting 170,000 Americans at risk of homelessness. I am pleased to have joined my colleagues on several letters opposing these changes. House and Senate Members on both sides of the aisle have also pushed back because they recognize what it would do: Move us backward in the fight to end homelessness.”
Advocates are urging members of Congress to support a final HUD spending bill that increases funding for housing vouchers and protects CoC funds for permanent housing. The House and Senate version of a bill to fund HUD’s affordable housing, community development, and homelessness services programs differ by billions of dollars as the two chambers work to hammer out a year-end spending deal.

COVERT TWP. — The Palisades Nuclear Plant, a facility shut down just two years ago, is poised to become the first U.S. commercial nuclear power reactor ever to be restarted, a result of a $400 million investment announced Dec. 2 by the U.S. Department of Energy and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.
Proponents hail the federal funding as a validation of Michigan’s role as a clean energy leader; opponents have filed a lawsuit against it, claiming the plant’s owner inappropriately took billions in public funds.
The new investment will finance the historic recommissioning of the original reactor and the deployment of two advanced small modular reactors at the Lake Michigan site.
The combined effort is projected to nearly double the site’s capacity, supplying enough carbon-free electricity to power approximately 1.4 million Michigan households and businesses, according to the governor’s office.
The $400 million is the latest addition to a vast federal commitment to Holtec International, the plant’s owner, which includes a $1.52 billion Department of Energy loan guarantee and over $1.3 billion from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, aimed at lowering energy costs for rural electric cooperatives like Wolverine Power.
“This historic investment will double Palisades’ capacity, provide more clean energy for Michigan homes and businesses, and protect 900 good-paying Michigan jobs,” Whitmer said in a statement. “(It) will lower energy costs, reaffirm Michigan’s clean energy leadership, and show the world that we are the best place to do business.”
 A dual-technology energy hub

The facility, located in Van Buren County’s Covert Township, will combine established and advanced nuclear technology for a total baseload power capacity of 1,400 megawatts:

Original reactor restart: The 800-MW pressurized water reactor that ceased operation in May 2022 is being prepared for recommissioning, an unprecedented feat in U.S. nuclear history.
Next-generation SMRs: Holtec plans to deploy two of its advanced SMR-300 reactors, each capable of generating 300 MW.

Holtec purchased the facility in June 2022 with the initial intent to decommission it, but reversed course amid political and environmental pressure to retain the major source of carbon-free power.
The $1.9 billion in combined direct federal and state funding is the financial backbone of this resurrection, which aims to extend the plant’s operational life to at least 2051.
 Legal, technical opposition mounts

While some are celebrating the announcement, several environmental groups have filed a federal lawsuit to block the restart, accusing Holtec of a “bait-and-switch” for seeking billions in subsidies after initially planning to dismantle the facility.
The complaint was filed in Grand Rapids federal court by organizations including Beyond Nuclear, Don’t Waste Michigan and Michigan Safe Energy Future.
“In our view, Holtec lacks both the operational experience and demonstrated accountability required to merit public trust. If Holtec wishes to pursue these ventures, it should do so using private capital — not public funds,” Michigan Safe Energy Future said on its website.
In stark contrast to the governor’s statement, Kevin Kamp, a radioactive waste specialist for Beyond Nuclear, said Holtec’s “unprecedented zombie restart” would jumpstart a reactor that was designed in the 1960s, which could bring unknown risks.
Kamp pointed to infamous nuclear disasters throughout history, including a partial core meltdown at Fermi Unit 1 in Monroe County in 1966 and the Three Mile Island Unit 2 meltdown in 1979 in Pennsylvania.
“Just imagine what havoc could be wreaked by two 300 MW-e reactors — each 4.5 times larger — at Palisades going forward,” Kamp said.
The planned restart is rooted in a history marked by operational challenges and a premature shutdown that shocked many in Michigan. The plant first connected to the grid in 1971.
From its initial commercial operation, the facility was plagued by persistent issues: within 13 months of opening, it suffered a radioactive leak in its steam generators, leading to a year-long shutdown, previous media reports indicated.
Despite having a license valid through 2031, its previous owner, Entergy, closed it in May 2022, citing financial pressures from inexpensive natural gas and the dynamics of the deregulated electricity market. The current federal and state effort aims to resurrect the facility and safeguard regional economic stability.
Kamp noted a lengthy documented history of multiple radioactive leaks and exposures that occurred at Palisades over the decade leading up to the plant’s decommissioning, including a radiation incident involving workers in 2014, leading to the NRC downgrading the plant from a top-tier reactor.
“Palisades has a long list of breakdown phase risks,” Kamp said. “The Palisades zombie reactor has multiple pathways to reactor core meltdown, which would unleash catastrophic amounts of hazardous ionizing radioactivity into the environment, on the beach of Lake Michigan, drinking water supply for 16 million people along its shores, and more than 40 million people downstream and downwind, up the food chain, and down the generations throughout the Great Lakes region.”
If the Palisades were to melt down, thousands would be at risk of radiation poisoning and billions in property damage.
Parts of Allegan County in Casco Township are within a 10-mile radiusEmergency Planning Zone — the prime area where people could be affected by a radiation leak from the plant, and evacuations would be most likely in an emergency.
The rest of the county, as well as Holland and Ottawa County, are in a 50-mile secondary emergency zone, where people could receive indirect exposure to radiation through contaminated food and water if there were a radiation leak.
Kamp said a 1982 report said a Palisades meltdown would cause a thousand acute radiation poisoning deaths, 7,000 radiation injuries, 10,000 latent cancer fatalities, and $52 billion in property damage — and that would be much more now.
“Adjusting for inflation alone, property damage would now exceed $168 billion,” he said. “And since populations have increased around Palisades in the past 43 years, casualty figures would be significantly worse, as more people now live in harm’s way.”

(Photo courtesy the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)The Indiana Department of Natural Resources has closed the bobcat trapping season after reaching the statewide quota of 250 bobcats in just four weeks.
The season was scheduled to run from Nov. 8 to Jan. 31, or until the quota of bobcats was reached.
A DNR news release said the framework of Indiana’s bobcat season was carefully designed with a total harvest limit based on population data collected throughout the state. Databases and reporting mechanisms were put into place to allow for close monitoring of the total season harvest.
“Licensed trappers had a successful first bobcat trapping season,” said Geriann Albers, DNR’s furbearer and gamebird program leader. “DNR will review what we’ve learned from this season as we move forward with regulated harvest and bobcat management.”
The bobcat season came after lawmakers passed legislation requiring the DNR to establish one. Before that, attempts to legalize killing bobcats had stalled in the DNR.
This bobcat trapping season was the first since 1969, when the species was nearly eliminated due to hunting, trapping and habitat loss. It was limited to 40 southern Indiana counties, including Brown, Monroe, Bartholomew, Clark and Dearborn.
Samantha Chapman, Indiana state director for Humane World for Animals, said “This bobcat trapping season was nothing short of a mass slaughter. Since November 8, recreational trappers have killed an average of about 9 bobcats every day, hitting the killing limit of 250 in just one month. That’s hundreds of bobcats who suffered in traps before being strangled, bludgeoned or shot to death.

(Photo courtesy of Kaylee Rains-Saucedo)OKLAHOMA CITY – Kaylee Rains-Saucedo relies on the federal insurance marketplace to insure her family.
Rains-Saucedo, who is wife and mother of two, is a small business owner. She has worked for three years to build her political consulting business. It’s something she doesn’t want to abandon for other employment because she believes in the American dream of owning her own business. Her husband stays at home to care for their children because child care costs are too high, she said.
Her family pays $750 a month for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, she said. 
But Rains-Saucedo has found herself among thousands of Oklahomans facing sticker shock as they navigate the re-enrollment process. Most are facing soaring costs due to a combination of higher premiums and the end of some federal tax credits that have helped make their health insurance affordable.
The Oklahoma City resident said her monthly premium will rise to about $1,350 to $1,550. She gets a credit of about $400 a month to offset the premium cost.
“Right now, it means I am going to have to choose between having health insurance or being able to put food on the table,” she said.
The Rains-Saucedo said is trying to pick up more business, which will mean more time away from her family.
“It’s just a really big problem for us,” she said. “I honestly don’t know what we are going to do financially yet, until I can find more work.”
More than 300,000 Oklahomans rely on the Affordable Care Act marketplace for health insurance, said Insurance Commissioner Glen Mulready.
And of those, 97% are receiving some level of subsidy to offset their premiums, Mulready said.
Most consumers will see their average insurance premiums increase by 29%, he said. 
The loss of subsidies coupled with premium increases represent a “double whammy for the consumer,” Mulready said.
He said he fears the cost increases will deter young healthy people from enrolling. They’ll opt instead to go without health insurance, Mulready said.
“That is not a good situation,” Mulready said. “You need young, healthy people to participate.”
About 289,000 Oklahoman receive the enhanced tax credit of $559 a month, said Rich Rasmussen, president and CEO of the Oklahoma Hospital Association.
Oklahoma consumers receive about $1.9 billion in premium assistance, which is set to end Jan. 1, unless Congress acts, he said.
The U.S. Senate is set to vote on extending those enhanced tax credits Thursday, but the plan may not have the bipartisan support needed to advance.
Jennifer Eastwood, of Norman, buys her insurance through the federal insurance marketplace and receives a subsidy. She said she has several medical conditions, including Lupus, a chronic autoimmune disease where the immune system attacks healthy tissue.
“I am going to lose my insurance and go off all my treatments unless something changes at the last minute,” Eastwood said.
Broader implications
The increase in premiums and reduction in subsidies has broader implications for Oklahoma.
According to the Cicero Institute, Oklahoma ranks in the bottom for primary care and physician availability. 
The state ranks 48th nationally in physician supply, 46th in primary care doctors and 47th in general surgeons, according to the Cicero Institute, a nonpartisan policy organization.
Of the state’s 77 counties, 75 are health care professional shortage areas.
The problem is particularly acute in rural Oklahoma, where patients have longer waits and spend more time on the road to access care.
Oklahoma already has the second highest rate of uninsured in the country, said Zack Stoycoff, executive director of Healthy Minds, a nonprofit, nonpartisan think tank that tries to improve mental health outcomes in Oklahoma.
For the uninsured, the options are to seek health care through charities, whose services are often overwhelmed and underfunded, Stoycoff said.
The other option is to seek treatment that costs more, such as through a hospital emergency room, resulting in uncompensated care and more costs to the facility, he said.
“Hospitals are already strapped, especially rural hospitals,” he said.
Rasmussen said the changes will hit rural hospitals and providers hard and will impact the health care professional shortage.
The ability to have health care correlates to a person’s ability to be employed and contribute to society, Stoycoff said.
“We want people to be healthy and have insurance, because it is ultimately more cost effective,” he said.
Up at night
The rising premiums and reduction in subsidies has caused “intense anxiety” for Rains-Saucedo, the Oklahoma City mother and business owner. 
She worries about being hit with a large medical bill that will take years to pay off.
“It has just made me stay up at night,” she said.

Meanwhile, the state is staring down long-term economic decline. 
The post Wyoming lawmakers square off with business council over government’s role in economic development appeared first on WyoFile .","Competing visions for the state’s economic future clashed Thursday as the Wyoming Business Council presented its budget proposal to the Wyoming Legislature’s Joint Appropriations Committee in Cheyenne. 
While the council has functioned as Wyoming’s statewide economic development agency since its creation in 1998, some lawmakers argue that government shouldn’t be involved. Meanwhile, the business council is warning that stagnant job and wage growth, as well as low workforce availability, are fueling long-term economic decline in Wyoming. 
“The markers of GDP, the markers of wages, the markers of [the] number of job opportunities, the outmigration of our youth and the widening gap between our population and our workforce all spell that our economy is not where we want it to be,” Business Council CEO Josh Dorrell told lawmakers Thursday. 
The Appropriations Committee met in Cheyenne last week for the first round of budget hearings ahead of the 2026 legislative session. After one lawmaker expressed interest in eliminating the business council, Thursday’s hearing put the agency squarely in the hot seat.  
“The business council today is a place where we understand the problem that we have better than ever,” Dorrell told lawmakers. “We understand the resources that we have or don’t have better than ever. And we understand that we’ve built a foundation that can be utilized as a way to change the economy.”

Josh Dorrell, CEO of the Wyoming Business Council (Wyoming Business Council)

Part of advancing Wyoming’s economy, Dorrell said, will require policy changes, including reforming the agency’s Business Ready Community grant and loan program. It’s also going to require more funding, he said. 
The council is asking lawmakers for about $112 million, while Gov. Mark Gordon’s recommendation for the agency is about half of that amount at nearly $55 million. However, Dorrell said, both of those figures would ultimately come up short, particularly when it comes to helping communities meet infrastructure needs, like extending water and sewer to business parks. 
“I thank you for giving us the courtesy of truth,” Senate Appropriations Chairman Tim Salazar, R-Riverton, said. “For you to be successful, you believe your budget should be somewhere over a billion, correct?”
“Mr. Chairman, yes,” Dorrell said. 
Gordon’s recommendation
House Appropriations Committee Chairman John Bear, R-Gillette, asked Dorrell about the discrepancy between the agency’s request and the governor’s recommendation. 
“I don’t see any other agencies where he’s denying half of the requests,” Bear said. “So that’s a pretty significant difference from your view and his.”
Dorrell confirmed that he told the governor neither budget was sufficient, but he also told Bear that Gordon has an entire state budget to consider and balance in his recommendations.
Lawmakers did not ask Gordon last Monday when he testified about the discrepancy, but in a Friday press release, the governor’s office reiterated that his budget recommendations are just that, because lawmakers are statutorily the state’s appropriators. 
“The Joint Appropriations Committee and the Legislature have often restored cuts to agency requests when they felt the increases were needed,” the press release said. “Governor Gordon’s budget has close to half a billion dollars on the table for the Legislature to make such decisions, including putting more into savings to benefit future generations.”

Gordon also pointed to his budget message, where he called for “maintaining low tax burdens and pursuing legal frameworks that attract new investment to broaden Wyoming’s economic base.” 
Council’s request
Ahead of last week’s hearings, the Wyoming Freedom Caucus — a group of Republicans who control the House — pledged to cut the budget, citing “pre-pandemic spending levels” as a general target. 
Dorrell told the committee Thursday that his agency’s budget request of almost $112 million “is actually less than the one that was submitted in 2019.”
Even so, several members of the committee expressed skepticism about funding the agency at all. Bear, for example, said he sees numerous issues with governments like Wyoming intervening to compete with other states in attracting private businesses.
“I understand that’s your responsibility … to try to compete with other states, make us competitive in that arena. But prior to that, you know, we’re 250 years old this next year. And prior to that, we went 150 years without government intervening in private sector business,” Bear said. 
“Don’t you agree that we have a great history in this country of private sector production?” Bear asked Dorrell. 
“Of course, I would agree with that,” Dorrell said. “And I might add that, you know, one of the things that we’re working to do is solve the problem that we have in front of us.” 
“I don’t get to go back 100 years to when states didn’t compete,” Dorrell said. “I get to solve the problem I have today. And the problem that we have today is that our outmigration of our youth and people who are born in this state is greater than any other state in the nation.”
Between 60% to 70% of Wyoming-born residents permanently leave the state by the time they are 30, according to a 2024 analysis prepared for the business council by Harvard Kennedy School researchers.

Rep. Ken Pendergraft, R-Sheridan, however, said he did “some research” and “found a couple of sources, including the U.S. Census Bureau that dispute” the outmigration findings that he hears from the business council “and others.”
“I just say that because I’m really interested in the truth,” Pendergraft said. 
Dorrell said while he hoped to be wrong about Wyoming’s outmigration, “our population and the demographics of our population would say that we’re probably right on.” 
Philosophical differences 
Pendergraft also said one of the criticisms he hears of the business council is “picking winners and losers,” and pointed to a metal fabricator in Sheridan County that was awarded a grant by the council, while there are other entities in the community that do the same work. 
The council only considers awarding grants to those who apply, Dorrell said, asking that Pendergraft provide him with “the names of those organizations that might be interested in this.”
Pendergraft also said he disputed the results of a statewide poll the business council completed earlier this year.
In September, the Tarrance Group, a Virginia-based Republican strategic research and polling firm, surveyed 514 registered voters in Wyoming about economic conditions, development priorities and community growth. 
“The results reveal a strong mandate for proactive, community-led growth and a clear consensus on the urgent need to retain our young people to build resilient communities,” according to an October press release from the council.
“I reject those results personally,” Pendergraft said, adding that “there were problems with how it was phrased.” 
Pendergraft also pushed back on the need for a business council at all. “How do you answer those that say it is not the role of government to build infrastructure?” he asked. “Leave that to the free market. Leave that to the businesses to develop that. Leave that to the consumers that want those things. How do you respond?”
It goes back to the problem of economic decline, Dorrell said, and there are plenty of examples across the state that indicate that the state’s minimal “investment in infrastructure” is working against Wyoming. 
“The idea that the state or that the community shouldn’t pay for infrastructure, that experiment is sort of running right now, and what it’s saying is that people are leaving and what it’s saying is our economy is in decline,” Dorrell said. 
Budget hearings will continue through this week before resuming Jan. 5. The committee is not expected to take any formal action on the budget bill until the week of Jan. 12.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)Oklahoma’s State Chamber needs to step aside and stop meddling in something they clearly know nothing about: education.
It’s clear from both public and media appearances that this influential business advocacy body is completely out of its depth in solving the education crisis which has long plagued Oklahoma.
Case in point: leaders of the group act like they’ve suddenly discovered that we rank at bottom in childhood literacy and that wealthy, established businesses don’t want to come here in large part because of that.
In a recent interview with Oklahoma City television station Fox 25, Chad Warmington, the group’s CEO, said it is “kind of fun to give the speech” to community groups that we rank at the bottom in reading. He said that he saw “surprise” and “shock” on people’s faces as he broke the news about our low rankings, including 49th in third grade literacy.
Tone deaf much? First off, nobody should be taking pleasure in discussing our students’ struggles. And secondly, I’d like to know who exactly in Oklahoma doesn’t know we’re cellardwellers in education outcomes. That news is not exactly a mic drop moment.
And in a further sign that business leaders in this group haven’t left their cushy corner offices and deigned to interact with us mere mortals, Warmington added during the interview that “a lot of political leaders” are talking about literacy that haven’t talked about it before.
I don’t know a single politician who hasn’t been talking about our lagging education outcomes and our low literacy rates. In fact, everybody has been talking about this for years now — both inside and outside the Capitol and trying to figure out how to fix it. 
But if all this wasn’t enough, the group is enthusiastically — and offensively — likening our children’s inability to read to the University of Oklahoma having a bad football season in the SEC and Oklahoma State University tanking in the Big 12. “Outrage would be deafening” if our reading scores were college football rankings, Warmington wrote in an editorial for The Oklahoman. 
“Coaches would be fired, strategies overhauled, and fans would never settle for it.”
To be clear, Oklahomans have not settled for this. Outrage already is deafening about education, and if the business community doesn’t know that then they’re completely out of touch with reality. Discussions about schools already dominate the 2026 gubernatorial race and conversations in the halls of our state Capitol.
To make better use of sports analogies, we cannot fire children’s parents, who are the equivalent of their head coaches, or the teachers we rely on to educate them. We already don’t have enough qualified people at the helm of our classrooms.
And, this is not the equivalent of a bad football season. This is more akin to the Chicago Cub’s 108-year World Series drought. The inability to read ripples across multiple generations.
And that’s why it’s so troubling that this advocacy group, which until recently has largely ignored this situation, has parachuted in during our crisis, claiming they have the golden bullet to solve our horrendous education outcomes — what many in education circles call the “Mississippi Miracle.”
Both Oklahoma and Mississippi passed laws in 2013 aimed at increasing literacy before fourth grade. The National Assessment of Education Progress test results showed Mississippi rose from last nationally to 21st. The state ranks second nationally in reading for children in poverty. Oklahoma, which later changed its law, has not seen similar progress.
The progress in Mississippi is attributed largely to the $100 million investment Jim and Sally Barksdale gave to develop a program to increase public school literacy rates. The money was overseen by an independent entity, not that state’s Department of Education. And the Barksdales demanded quantifiable results.
Warmington said Mississippi aligned the curriculum its higher education institutions are teaching teachers. They made sure that every school system is using the “same science of reading.” They brought in literacy coaches. And they held children back who weren’t reading at grade level.
That’s  great for Mississippi, but as I noted earlier we can’t get even qualified people to teach in Oklahoma. We’re so desperate for teachers, we’re allowing people with no education degree to lead our classrooms, so teaching the same curriculum in college really doesn’t matter in our case. 
Literacy coaches are going to cost money and require a financial investment from our Legislature, at a time when they’re obsessed with cutting taxes and giving big businesses tax breaks. 
During the 2023-24 school year, Oklahoma ranked 49th worst in what it spent per pupil at $11,311. Mississippi, meanwhile, spent $12,490 per student, according to an apples-to-apples comparison compiled by the National Education Association.
In the 2024-25 school year, Oklahoma was estimated to have spent $11,894 per student while Mississippi further widened the gap, spending $13,125. 
Both numbers represented about a 5% increase in spending.
Our class sizes are bigger in Oklahoma, too, probably because we don’t invest more in education. Mississippi had 13.6 students enrolled per teacher. Oklahoma had 16.3 students, according to the NEA analysis.
It’s easier to learn with smaller class sizes.
If we want to be Mississippi, we’re going to have to make a financial investment in schools.
To oversimplify our literacy crisis and say it can be solved by implementing the “Mississippi Miracle” is a mistake. Mississippi Today also reported that “reading miracle” has remained out of reach for some schools due to resource shortages and teacher turnover. 
Education systems are complex. No two children are completely alike or learn the same.
Solving this is going to take a multi-level approach, and require involving people who actually understand what is going on. 
That’s not the business community. We need to consult the people who are on the front lines, including those who work in low-performing and high poverty schools, who haven’t had the privilege of turning a blind eye to the problem and who, for years, haven’t been allowed to be complacent about it.
Warmington has said he wants to involve teachers in these discussions, but oddly enough, when the state Chamber held its business luncheon last month to unveil its vision for our schools, there wasn’t a single teacher highlighted. Only business leaders and Oklahoma lawmakers – none of whom had teaching experience – were the ones celebrating the state Chamber’s plan, which they dubbed Oklahoma Competes. 
Even more damning, state superintendent Lindel Fields said he didn’t attend.
Educators don’t tell CEOs how to run their businesses. So why should we trust people who don’t seem to ever set foot in schools to set this agenda for us?

(Photo by Kypros/Getty Images)New Jersey’s homeless population has crept up in recent years, and housing advocates say it is poised to skyrocket because President Donald Trump’s administration is changing how it funds permanent housing for people most at risk of homelessness.
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development adopted new grant policies last month that critics warn would cancel already appropriated funds and force as many as 170,000 people — including more than 2,000 people in New Jersey — into homelessness.
“At a time when homelessness in New Jersey has been increasing, we have federal action that will definitely further increase homelessness,” said Arnold Cohen, senior policy coordinator at the Housing and Community Development Network of New Jersey.
Young homebuyers lose more ground in housing market

New Jersey got about $66 million last year in federal funding to cover rent and supportive services for people most at risk of homelessness, said Taiisa Kelly, CEO of Monarch Housing Associates.
The state is expected to lose more than half of that, with cuts starting on Jan. 1, if HUD proceeds with its policy changes, Kelly said. Twenty states, including New Jersey, have sued to block the changes.
“We’re really waiting to see what will happen from that lawsuit,” Kelly said. “We really need a reversal of course on this, because this is going to immediately cause folks to experience homelessness, and it’s going to fundamentally change the programs — and change them in a way that we know doesn’t work.”
New Jersey uses what’s called a housing-first approach to homelessness reduction, which gets people into stable housing without conditioning it on sobriety, income, or other things that have historically served as hurdles to housing security. Once a person is stably housed, providers work to get them supportive services to address their other needs.
Proponents of the strategy say it’s a key approach to making homelessness “rare, brief, and non-recurring,” said Richard Uniacke, president of Bridges Outreach, a nonprofit that does street outreach and provides housing services in Union, Essex, and Somerset counties.
HUD has encouraged housing-first policies for over a decade.
But Trump announced in a July executive order that his administration would take a different approach. He rejected housing-first policies, saying they “deprioritize accountability and fail to promote treatment, recovery, and self-sufficiency.” He ordered mandatory treatment for people whose mental illness or addiction contributed to their homelessness and directed law enforcement to crack down on homeless encampments, loitering, squatting, and open drug use.
HUD officials consequently announced last month a series of changes that would cut two-thirds of the $3.9 billion in federal funds it had allocated for permanent housing; shift funding to transitional housing with work and other requirements; reduce automatic renewals of housing vouchers; and withhold funds from applicants that follow housing-first policies.
The Trump administration pitched the changes as “monumental reforms,” saying housing-first policies encourage “dependence on endless government handouts” while not addressing the root causes of homelessness.
“Our philosophy for addressing the homelessness crisis will now define success not by dollars spent or housing units filled, but by how many people achieve long-term self-sufficiency and recovery,” said HUD chief Scott Turner. “These long-overdue reforms will promote independence and ensure we are supporting means-tested approaches to carry out the President’s mandate, connect Americans with the help they need, and make our cities and towns beautiful and safe.”
The agency also now forbids grant recipients from using funds in ways that violate the Trump administration’s immigration agenda or opposition to diversity, equity, and inclusion and “gender ideology.” Critics say that threatens housing assistance and supportive services for certain marginalized groups, such as transgender youth, who experience homelessness at disproportionately high rates.
“They’re putting us in a position where we actually run the risk of breaking state laws in order to adapt to some of these requirements,” Uniacke said. “We have to provide services with no preconditions. We cannot be coercive of people who are experiencing homelessness in order to get them to treatment or get them connected to services.”
The National Alliance to End Homelessness estimates HUD’s changes could cost New Jersey $37.6 million in lost federal funding, leaving 2,439 people at risk of losing their housing. New Jersey had nearly 13,800 people living in shelters, hotels, or on the street as of last January, the most recent annual enumeration of the state’s homeless population. The alliance believes homelessness could climb in New Jersey by almost 18% next year.

Kelly warns that a jump in the state’s homeless population will have an impact that ripples far beyond those who lose their housing.
“We’re going to see agencies that have to close because they’re going to lose so much money from the program,” Kelly said. “It’s going to impact landlords who rely on this rental assistance payment to keep up their units. It’s just going to destabilize our communities across the board. So it’s really important that we collectively find an answer.”
Advocates say answers should include increased philanthropy, rent control, and the passage of legislation that would detail rights for New Jersey’s homeless population and allow municipalities to create homelessness trust funds, among other things.
Mostly, they agree, any effort to end homelessness cannot succeed without more money.
Kelly estimated $430 million would cover rental assistance for a year and supportive services for the 18,000 families who, according to a state database, accessed homelessness services in New Jersey last year.
Cohen agreed funding is the game-changer, pointing to a state effort, launched in 2024, to get more than 1,000 homeless veterans permanent housing.
“We have municipalities in New Jersey that have essentially ended homelessness for veterans because those resources have been there,” he said. “We have not put those resources into families.”

Property taxes are one of the only guardrails we have that discourage people from hoarding land and housing they do not use, writes Rep. Mike Yin.
The post Eliminating property taxes would sell out Wyoming forever appeared first on WyoFile .","Every Wyoming town with a good view, a nearby outdoor recreation area, a small airport or a good marketing campaign could become a target for out-of-state investors. The more real estate these investors buy, the tighter the housing market becomes for the people who actually live and work in those communities. With less inventory and more outside demand, prices go up, making housing unattainable for Wyoming families and future generations. 

Opinion

This is the future we are driven toward by one simple idea: no property taxes.
The Legislature’s Joint Revenue Committee has put forward a proposal to eliminate residential property taxes in Wyoming.
Every Wyomingite should take a step back and look hard at what this plan, which would also require voter approval, would really do. If this proposal passes, we will permanently turn our communities into a discount investment product for people who do not live here. The end result, transforming Wyoming into a full-blown tax shelter for out-of-state residents, will only make it even harder for young people and working families to afford a home. In short, by eliminating property taxes, we sell out our future. 
Property taxes are one of the only guardrails we have that discourage people from hoarding land and housing they do not use. If I am a wealthy out-of-state investor and I see land in a beautiful, low-population state with no property tax at all, I start running the numbers in my head. No ongoing expense. No annual tax bill. No cost to sit on a second, third or fourth house for years and wait for prices to rise. 
In that world, I would try to buy as much Wyoming land and housing as I could as fast as possible. And I would have no incentive to sell it again anytime soon, and certainly not for an affordable price. 
We already see this pressure in places where demand from wealthy out-of-state buyers is strong. When homes are treated first as an asset and only second as a place to live, prices rise faster than local wages. Teachers, nurses, sheriff’s deputies and service workers get pushed further and further away from the communities they serve. Property taxes create a carrying cost for holding multiple homes that sit empty most of the year, while paying for the critical services and infrastructure that make those homes livable in the first place. Eliminating property taxes would make speculative buying even more attractive. 
This is exactly the opposite of the Wyoming that we say we want for our kids and grandkids. We say we want young people to stay in Wyoming, start families and build careers here. We say we want them to be able to buy a home in the town where they grew up. A policy that invites unlimited outside demand for housing undercuts that goal. It tilts the playing field toward cash buyers who fly in a few weeks a year and away from the family trying to scrape together a down payment from a Wyoming paycheck.
There is another honest conversation we need to have. When politicians promise to get rid of property taxes, they almost always plan to make it up somewhere else, usually with a big increase to the statewide sales tax.
That might sound harmless until you think about who really pays.
The biggest landowners see their property tax bills disappear. That burden gets passed to the mom in Rock Springs buying clothes and notebooks for the first day of school.It gets passed to the dad in Casper paying for his kids’ hockey equipment and a pair of winter boots.It gets passed to the worker in Gillette trying to keep the truck running and pay the electricity bill that keeps going up. 
The owner of three houses in Jackson comes out ahead. The family trying to afford one modest home pays more every time they go through the checkout line.
That isn’t tax relief for the middle class. It is shifting the burden from the wealthiest landowners to the everyday Wyomingites who have to spend most of their paycheck just to get by.
Everything is getting more expensive, but the answer is not to blow up our entire tax system, which would make things worse. It’s to continue working on targeted relief that actually reaches the people who need help, and to build more housing for the middle class.
The Legislature has expanded the state property tax refund program so that more middle-class homeowners can qualify. It is not perfect and we should keep improving it, but it has already helped keep Wyomingites in their homes. 
And we can build on that work with real housing policy. That means working with local governments on land use to ensure that middle-class housing, rather than just high-end inventory, is possible to develop. It means making it easier to finance the infrastructure that new homes require.
There are solutions. But first, we have to answer a basic question: Who is Wyoming for?
Is it for the people who live here year round, who send their kids to our schools, who volunteer at the food bank, who plow the roads, who run the clinics and fix the power lines? Or is it for investors who want a safe place to park wealth in the form of land and houses they rarely use?
Eliminating property taxes would send a very clear signal about the Legislature’s answer to that question. I hope we choose differently.

To preserve public confidence in the judiciary, the commission ensures judges adhere to ethical standards, writes commission member Nicholas Bellack.
The post Safeguarding justice: The Wyoming Commission on Judicial Conduct and Ethics appeared first on WyoFile .","When most of us think about judges, we imagine solemn black robes, gavel strikes and the rule of law being carefully applied in our courtrooms. But what happens if a judge acts unethically, fails to follow the law or loses the public’s trust? In Wyoming, the answer lies with a little-known but essential body: the Commission on Judicial Conduct and Ethics.

Opinion

This constitutionally created, independent commission exists to ensure that Wyoming’s judges uphold the high standards the public expects. These ethical standards, which all judicial officers from municipal court judges to supreme court justices must adhere to, can be found in the Wyoming Code of Judicial Conduct. For nearly 50 years, the commission has been the guardian of accountability in our judicial system — preserving citizens’ confidence in the courts.
A history rooted in accountability
The commission traces its origins to 1970, when Wyoming voters approved a constitutional amendment creating the Judicial Supervisory Committee. At the time, this was a groundbreaking step acknowledging that even judges, who interpret the law, must themselves be held to standards of conduct.
In 1996, Wyoming voters updated the system, replacing the Supervisory Committee with today’s 12-member Commission on Judicial Conduct and Ethics. Its authority comes directly from Article 5, Section 6 of the Wyoming Constitution and its independence within the judicial branch is by design. The people of Wyoming insisted that accountability for judges should not be left to politics or personal influence, but entrusted to a balanced panel representing the judiciary, the legal profession and the public itself.
Who serves on the commission?
The commission consists of 12 volunteers and is deliberately diverse in its composition. This includes:

Three judges (two from the district court and one from the circuit court), chosen by their fellow judges.
Three attorneys, appointed by the Wyoming State Bar.
Six citizen members, known as “electors,” appointed by the governor and confirmed by the state Senate.

This structure ensures that no single group dominates. Instead, legal professionals and everyday citizens share responsibility for reviewing judicial conduct complaints, providing an important safeguard for public trust.
How do complaints work?
The commission’s work begins when someone files a written, verified complaint against a judge. These complaints can allege judicial misconduct, criminal wrongdoing, civil misconduct or even disability that affects a judge’s ability to serve.
Interestingly, the commission also has the power to launch investigations on its own if credible concerns surface. This means that misconduct cannot simply be hidden if no one files paperwork.
Once a complaint is received, the process unfolds through a careful three-panel system:

The investigatory panel reviews the complaint, gathers records and may request a response from the judge. If necessary, it hires disciplinary counsel to dig deeper.
The adjudicatory panel holds hearings, applies the Wyoming Code of Judicial Conduct and determines whether the Code of Judicial Conduct was violated.
The disciplinary panel determines consequences that range from private discipline to public sanctions that the Wyoming Supreme Court must approve.

This step-by-step process ensures fairness for both the public and the judge involved.
Confidential, but not secret 
One of the commission’s most misunderstood features is confidentiality. By rule, all proceedings remain confidential unless and until a case results in a recommendation for public discipline. This protects judges from unfounded rumors and ensures that investigations are conducted fairly, rather than through the court of public opinion.
At the same time, the system is transparent where it matters most. If public discipline is warranted, the commission makes recommendations to the Wyoming Supreme Court, which has the final say. This balance helps protect judicial independence while still holding judges accountable to the people they serve.
What the numbers say
Between January 2024 and July 2025, the commission handled 79 cases:

57 complaints were dismissed quickly, often because they lacked evidence, did not fall under the commission’s jurisdiction or arose from problems that another agency could better address. For example, many were complaints about the outcome of a case more appropriately dealt with through appeal. In those instances, the commission refers members of the public to the more appropriate body.  
15 cases were dismissed after deeper review.
One judge received a letter of caution and another a letter of correction.
One private censure was issued, requiring monitoring of the judge’s conduct.
Four cases remain open.

These numbers show that while most complaints do not result in disciplinary action, the commission takes each one seriously. Even minor concerns can lead to corrective action designed to keep judges accountable.
Why the commission matters 
Most Wyomingites will never file a complaint with the commission or even hear its name in daily conversation. Yet its presence is critical. By diligently performing its work, the commission reassures the public that our judges are not beyond scrutiny.
In 1996, Wyoming voters understood a simple truth: Justice depends on trust. If citizens doubt the integrity of their judges, the entire system falters. The Commission on Judicial Conduct and Ethics exists to preserve public confidence in the judiciary, demonstrating that while judges interpret the law, they are also held accountable under rules of ethical standards.
For the average citizen, this means one thing: The next time you walk into a courtroom, you will know that while the judge has a good deal of authority, he or she also has accountability.

(Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — Better jobs, opportunities, recreation and desire for diversity and belonging. Those surfaced as top reasons an Omaha audience recently gave for why talented people they know fled for other states.

The group offered advice, including: Higher paying jobs with growth potential, affordable housing, better public transit and bike lanes, beautiful spaces, an inclusive community and political leadership that listens.
“We aren’t just an ag state,” one person responded in the interactive electronic survey taken at a public forum hosted by the City of Omaha Tuesday that featured a panel of speakers and drew an estimated 125 people. 
 Spotlight intensifies

About 70 attendees participated in the poll aimed at informing the city’s efforts to better attract and retain talent, particularly as it assembles a new “comprehensive plan” to guide growth and development over the next 20 years.
Given that more than half of Nebraska’s brain drain originates in the metro Omaha area, it is significant that city leaders are stepping up efforts to better understand and attack the problem, said Josie Schafer, a public policy and data researcher at the University of Nebraska at Omaha who spoke at the event and also advises the Nebraska Legislature on workforce trends.

Since 2019, about 17,000 people who have earned a bachelor’s degree or higher have left Nebraska and just over 10,000 moved from the Omaha area, said Schafer, who heads the UNO Center for Public Affairs Research.
“I’m really excited to see the city jumping in on this conversation and finding solutions that fit for us,” she said, noting that its urban economy and other circumstances differ from the many rural areas of the state.
Other local and state efforts and groups also are  converging to stem the exodus in what many see as an alarming wake-up moment for Nebraska as a whole, and particularly its two largest metros.
The Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce, whose audience covers eight counties, is about to commission an in-depth brain drain-focused study, a spokesman said last week. Sparking that was the chamber’s latest “Barometer report,” which ranked the Omaha metro sixth lowest of 23 peer metros nationwide for jobs, talent and investment. 
A lead economist working on the report said the findings shined light on “uncomfortable truths” that must be confronted with “urgency.” The chamber’s young professionals group also had been gathering feedback.
Amplifying its alarm is the Aksarben Foundation, a more than century-old Nebraska business organization. Its research shows Nebraska’s two largest metros, Omaha and Lincoln, have lagged 68,000 jobs behind where both would have been had the markets kept pace the last five years with peers, including Des Moines, Sioux Falls, South Dakota and Fayetteville, Arkansas. 
Further probing by Aksarben’s research team has revealed widespread talent and wage loss in every region of the state, driven largely, it said, by scarcity of quality jobs and limited wage growth. Now the Aksarben leadership has formed a new nonprofit, “Strengthening Nebraska Families” to educate and stir action to elevate the state’s competitiveness. 
 ‘Without connection’ 

Aksarben’s Dana Bradford said discussion about brain drain — and the forces that for more than a decade have pushed more folks out of the state than in — have been going for some time, but “without connection.”

As the state’s budget woes become more pronounced and persistent — a $471 million shortfall is the latest projection — people and policymakers are starting to pay more attention, he said. 
“It’s pretty clear if Omaha and Lincoln were growing anywhere like they should have been we wouldn’t have the problem we have right now,” said Bradford, also a past chair of the Omaha chamber. “The reality is Omaha and Lincoln deliver 60% of tax revenues. If Omaha is struggling, everybody struggles.”
On Monday, the Aksarben Foundation is hosting a private meeting in the Ashland area, between Omaha and Lincoln, for select business, elected and other leaders intended to stimulate more discussion. 
Nebraska officials including Omaha Mayor John Ewing Jr. are to speak, as are experts expected to spotlight strategies in play or working elsewhere in the country to grow high-paying jobs and the talent pool.
Omaha still pushing for state incentive to help build sports facilities, despite Pillen headwinds

Ewing told the Nebraska Examiner he recognizes the urgency for quality job creation and wants to partner with state lawmakers and other elected officials on developing an economic incentive package that raises Omaha’s allure to new employers. 
“We also have companies I’ve talked to that would like to expand here, but the incentives are greater in other places,” he said, adding that he’s been told existing incentives are too laborious and should be easier to navigate.
The Democratic mayor, finishing his first year after ousting a 12-year Republican incumbent, said he and his administration are working to increase public and private support for business internships, public transportation options and affordable housing, which survey-takers underscored as pieces that could keep them from leaving Omaha. 
Public spaces are another focus to raise Omaha’s “fun” factor, Ewing said. He cited efforts to build a downtown soccer stadium and an expanded multi-purpose athletic complex in northwest Omaha that need a state tax incentive that Gov. Jim Pillen has for now put on ice, citing budget concerns.
Ewing is promoting new arrangements in which private foundations take on management and maintenance at certain city parks, saying that would allow city park staff to focus on fewer properties.

Creation of the new comprehensive 20-year growth and development plan also will help shape Omaha’s future infrastructure, amenities and talent-retention strategies. The city has been hosting meetings, including Tuesday’s brain drain-focused discussion, to inform the document. 
Land use updates, for example, could promote more “walkability” in districts. Other rules could encourage more communal areas and “belonging.” Those themes arose in survey recommendations. 
 Brain gain winners 

While social, civic and environmental factors play a role in brain drain, Schafer said that independent and Census-based research overwhelmingly point to jobs and career growth potential as top drivers of the out-migration trend.
A look at places outperforming Omaha in the brain gain contest, some without coastal sunshine and splash, underscore that Nebraska could compete with the right game plan, she said.
Denver and Stockton, California metros are in the pack where people recently moved to when leaving the Omaha area, census data shows. But Des Moines and Kansas City consistently rank in the top five, said Schafer. 
“These are places that have similar settings, environments, weather,” she said. “It’s not that they’re searching for something totally different from Omaha. The evidence really points to job opportunities as that leading factor.”

 As Omaha lost people to other states, peer metro areas that gained domestic migrants included Knoxville, Tennessee and Tulsa, Oklahoma, according to Census data.
In Tulsa, a program that has paid more than 3,400 remote workers $10,000 each to move there and diversify the workforce reportedly has returned four times its investment to the local economy.
According to the Knoxville News Sentinel, transplants consistently say they were drawn to that metro area by job opportunity, lifestyle change and affordable cost of living. The state of Tennessee does not levy a personal income tax.
According to the Aksarben study conducted by Development Counsellors International, the Omaha metro’s employment level barely grew over the past five years, inching up from 500,000 in 2019 to 512,000 last year. DCI said Lincoln’s employment and wage growth were nearly the same as Omaha’s.
A comparison group of metros, in contrast, grew jobs five times faster. The group: Colorado Springs, Des Moines, Fayetteville, Sioux Falls, Huntsville, Alabama, Raleigh, North Carolina and Boise, Idaho. 
Bradford said the new Strengthening Nebraska Families nonprofit aims to educate and provoke conversation about declining discretionary income for families. The DCI study and Aksarben leaders point to recruitment and development of “primary” jobs as a goal.  
Defined in the report as positions that pay above-average wages and produce goods or services for markets beyond the local area, primary jobs bring new wealth and dollars into the local and state economy. They also lead to creation of additional jobs in secondary sectors, such as medical, local banks, car dealerships, retail stores and restaurants.
Losing young adults to other states comes at a high price, the experts say, as those out-migrants build families and future workforce elsewhere.
 Forum highlights 

Among other highlights shared at the City of Omaha-organized meeting at Creighton University campus:

Brain drain, or net out-migration of Nebraskans with a bachelor’s degree or more, has persisted since 2010, with losses of 1,104 people in 2010, 4,610 in 2022 and 3,622 in 2023. 
The Omaha metro area is growing in population due to births and immigration, surpassing the million-person mark, according to Census data released earlier this year. However, for domestic migration, the state’s largest metro loses 723 people annually, according to UNO’s analysis of Census data between 2020 to 2024. 
Meanwhile, the Tulsa metro posted annual domestic migration gains of about 26,000; Kansas City about 8,000, Des Moines nearly 17,000. The Lincoln metro’s annual net domestic loss was 1,720.
Top places from where new Omahans came in recent years: Lincoln metro area, Asia, Europe, Sioux City metro area and the Des Moines metro area.

Experts on the “We Make Omaha’s Talent x Place” panel moderated by Omaha planner Sydney Embray also included Laurel Oetken of Open Range; Tammy Green of Metropolitan Community College and Dell Gines of International Economic Development Council.
The survey also asked about diversity, equity and inclusion programs. (Courtesy of UNO Center for Public Affairs Research)
Gines encouraged less emphasis on population growth and more on creating a distinct identity and quality of life improvements.
Green advocated for investment in growing skills for existing young populations and creating welcoming environments. 
Oetken said young generations seek an inviting entrepreneurial and tech ecosystem.
 Lessons learned

Aksarben’s Bradford said lessons can be learned from cities like Tulsa and the Kansas City’s Overland Park area, which attracted a new Fiserv strategic fintech hub by offering an incentives package that helped secure a commitment of 2,000 new jobs. 
Kansas is giving Fiserv more than $154 million in state incentives over the ten years, the Kansas City Star reported, and the city puts the average salary at $125,000.
“We have to do these kinds of things to compete or we’ll have no opportunities for success,” Bradford said. “Or we can do nothing and see how that goes.”



What survey-takers said
Omaha planners analyzed responses to the unscientific poll last week. Among results:

Is Omaha doing enough to retain talent? On a scale of 1 to 10, only 9 of 69 responses were above midpoint.
Think of someone you know who has left Omaha. Why did they leave? After jobs, opportunity and diversity/belonging came recreation/amenities/culture, transportation/walkability, political climate.

If you were to leave Omaha, what would be the main reason? After jobs and opportunities came transportation/walkability, culture/amenities/recreation; political climate, housing/livability.

(Getty Images)Idahoans have a week to pick or switch health insurance plans on the state’s exchange, as open enrollment for Your Health Idaho ends Dec. 15.
And unless Congress extends tax credits that deeply subsidize health insurance costs, Idahoans’ average premiums are expected to double on the exchange next year, possibly prompting thousands to cancel their policies. 
It’ll take time to see the full impact. Idahoans usually enroll in insurance plans on the exchange during the last week of open enrollment, Your Health Idaho Executive Director Pat Kelly said in an interview last week.
“Last year, we saw more than half of our enrollment occurred in the last seven days of open enrollment, and a third of that occurs on the very last day. So it’s always a little bit hard to tell where we will ultimately end up until we are completely done with open enrollment,” he told the Idaho Capital Sun.
On Thursday, the U.S. Senate is expected to vote on a bill by Democrats that would extend the enhanced premium tax credits for three years. But the bill likely doesn’t have enough bipartisan support to pass, States Newsroom reported. 
In Idaho, Kelly expects 25,000 people will cancel their policies if the subsidies aren’t renewed. About 87% of the roughly 116,000 Idahoans who have insurance through the state exchange get the enhanced tax credits, according to a report by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The enhanced premium tax credits ensure people don’t pay more than 8.5% of their income on health insurance for benchmark plans.

Almost 60% of Americans enrolled in health insurance through Affordable Care Act marketplaces say they can’t afford a $300 annual rise in their premiums, a poll released last week by the nonpartisan health organization KFF found. 
The federal government shut down after a health care clash. In Idaho, the stakes are high.

The premium prices on Your Health Idaho for health insurance plans assume that the tax credits will expire, Kelly said. Already, he said, there are signs that affordability is a big concern for Idahoans as people are downgrading plan types, more people disenrolling citing affordability as the reason, and agents and brokers saying clients are trying to wait to see what happens.
But he’s encouraging Idahoans to not wait, and instead enroll now.
“We’re encouraging agents to ensure that their clients enroll in a plan that works for their budget today and, of course, meets their medical needs — knowing that if things change, we’ll make sure that they have an opportunity to receive all the savings that they’re eligible for,” Kelly said. “And of course, if that means an opportunity to change plans or enroll, we would certainly do everything we can to make that available to Idahoans.”
 How to get help enrolling in insurance through Your Health Idaho

There are several resources to get help enrolling in health insurance plans through Your Health Idaho, including:

Calling customer support at Your Health Idaho at 855-944-3246. The line is staffed from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. on weekdays, and from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Saturday. 
Finding an agent or broker online. 
Finding an enrollment event near you online.
Using an affordability calculator online to explore plans. 

 How much are premiums rising?

Here’s a few examples of how Idaho households could be affected, based on estimates from Your Health Idaho:

A family of four that earns $130,000 a year would see their annual premiums rise by $10,831 a year. Because they earn more than 400% of the federal poverty level, they wouldn’t be eligible for tax credits if the enhanced credits expire. Losing tax credits would cost them $7,800 a year, and their separate premium raise would cost them another $3,031 a year. 
A couple that earns $85,000 a year would see their premiums jump by $18,600 a year. They’d also lose credits, because they earn more than 400% of the federal poverty level, which is the cutoff for the smaller tax credits created through the Affordable Care Act.

But on one recent Saturday, owner Juan Castelan gestured in the direction of mostly empty tables.  
Business is down 30% to 40% since the Memphis Safe Task Force began making thousands of traffic stops and arrests for alleged criminal and immigration law violations in September. 
Castelan has had to cut hours for his full-time kitchen and waitstaff to 25 or 28 per week, from 40.
It is common to hear sirens and witness federal and state officers conducting traffic stops and making arrests multiple times a day through the restaurant’s floor-to-ceiling windows, he said.
Business is down more than 30% at La Guadalupana since th Memphis Safe Task Force arrived, said owner Juan Castelan (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
“The Hispanic community just sees all these police and says, ‘OK, nobody else is going outside’ so they just stay home,” he said. 
Across town on Beale Street, the city’s neon-lit entertainment district, blues bars and Memphis barbecue restaurants sat near empty at 9 p.m. on the Friday night before Thanksgiving. 
“I work on Beale Street and it is dead,” said Joe Calhoun, who operates the Withers Collection Museum, a designated landmark on the U.S. Civil Rights Trail.
Calhoun said museum attendance has been down since January due to a perception of crime in Memphis, the impetus cited in a presidential memo establishing the task for to restore “law and order” to the city through “hypervigilant policing” 
But the constant presence of Tennessee National Guard patrolling Beale Street and news coverage of arrests is deterring visitors, he said.
Attendance at the museum has dropped as much as 50% this fall as foot traffic dwindled even further along the three-block entertainment district.
“Everyone, unilaterally, is saying business is flat.” said Calhoun, a member of the Beale Street Merchants Association.
The Task Force is having a similar economic impact on local businesses as the COVID pandemic, said Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris, who is challenging the constitutionality of the Guard deployment in court.
“Nobody is going downtown right now with all of this going on,” Harris said. “I mean it’s tough for people to justify going to Target, when you’ve got men in military fatigues protecting Target, and I guess I put protection in quotation marks.”
Harris said the chilling effect of the Task Force presence has extended to attendance at many public activities, particularly for Memphis’ Latino community, he said. 
“Everyone is just waiting and hoping that some of this dragnet reduces so they can go out, particularly Latino communities. Latino communities are frozen,” he said. 
“People can’t go to church; people can’t go to the extracurricular activities for their children…People in some cases are afraid to go look for a job because they’re afraid they might get caught up in a dragnet.”
Supporters of the Task Force, including Gov. Bill Lee and Republican lawmakers, have touted its success in taking criminals off the streets.

Data released by the Task Force shows 3500 arrests and over 39,000 traffic stops since it began operations in late September.
“This is how we restore law and order in Memphis,” said Sen. Brent Taylor, a Republican representing parts of Shelby County, said last week, citing a Tennessee Bureau of Investigation report confirming crime in Memphis was at a 25-year low before the Task Force operation began. 
The Task Force presence has stressed small business owners in other ways, said Mauricio Calvo, president and CEO of Latino Memphis. 
Calvo and his colleagues now routinely see Tennessee Highway Patrol cars and dark SUVs driven by federal immigration agents parked outside a popular Mexican restaurant across the street from their office. 
“The first time it happened, it really freaked us out,” said Calvo who, along with a staff immigration attorney, rushed to the restaurant to provide legal aid to restaurant workers.

It soon became apparent that the law enforcement officials were dining at the restaurant, not making arrests. 
Memphis restaurants have been called out on social media and threatened with boycotts for serving meals to Task Force members, but Calvo said owners he has spoken to feel they have no choice: refusing service could make them a target of the Task Force.
“It is such a humiliating thing,” serving Task Force members, he said. “I mean, I wish they could understand what this means to the workers there, to the people, to us as a community.”
Restaurants, retail, construction and other sectors have also contended with workers unwilling to come to work for fear they could be detained, he said.
“This may sound stereotypical, but Latinos are an important part of the essential workers, construction workers, landscaping, hospitality, where people are not showing up to work right now,” he said.
Calhoun, the Beale Street museum operator, said he has had to accommodate the heightened concern of his own staff.
“My maintenance people and my housekeepers are Hispanic. They’re afraid to come to work. They will only come to work in the middle of the day because they’re afraid to come at night.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Columbia’s City Council is considering a bill that would raise water rates up to 20% per year for five years to pay for a new, more drought- and disaster-resistant intake from the Duck River and a water treatment plant.
The rate increase would affect Columbia Power and Water System’s 27,000 customers, and would impact customers of other nearby water systems that purchase water from Columbia Power and Water Systems. Columbia’s water utility currently sells water wholesale to systems in Maury County, Spring Hill, Mount Pleasant, which serve roughly 35,000 customers combined.
Columbia Power and Water Systems also requested the City Council increase its water impact fee, a fee paid by new water customers to help cover the costs associated with increased demand.
The rate and impact fee increases would allow Columbia’s water utility to secure federal and state low-interest, long term loans needed to finance the majority of the $520 million project. Those loans require substantial “stress tests” to ensure the utility will be able to pay back the funds in a timely manner, Columbia Power and Water Systems President and CEO Jonathan Hardin said, so anticipated growth in the utility’s customer base and increased income from higher new customer impact fees can’t be considered in the loan process. 










What we see here today is the opposite: existing ratepayers being asked to subsidize decades of unplanned, uncoordinated, reactive growth … Now, what we’re facing is a plan that puts more straws into the Duck River, a river that’s already under stress.


– Gabe Howard, Columbia City Council


Several members of the public, including Maury County commissioners who spoke about the potential impact to their constituents, urged the council to pause and consider any other options that would place less burden on citizens, particularly those on fixed incomes.
Gabe Howard, who represents District 8 on the Maury County Commission, said he supports the higher impact fee proposal, but that the fee should have been raised years ago to better distribute the costs of system expansion among those that contributed to increased demand.
“We say often that growth should pay for growth, but the fact is, it doesn’t, and it never has,” Howard said. “What we see here today is the opposite: existing ratepayers being asked to subsidize decades of unplanned, uncoordinated, reactive growth … Now, what we’re facing is a plan that puts more straws into the Duck River, a river that’s already under stress.”
Howard said the compounded effect of an annual 20% rate increase would add up to 150% over five years — an “unprecedented … heavy burden” for Maury County’s families, farmers and small businesses.
Water wars: groups challenge ‘unsustainable’ withdrawals from Duck River

“Yes, this increase on a percentage basis is high,” Hardin said, but the 20% per year rate increase represents a worst-case scenario.
“Every dollar we actually do collect (from impact fees and growth) will directly reduce rate needs, and we expect to see lower-percentage increases in years three, four and five,” he said.
Vice Mayor Randy McBroom said Columbia Power and Water System would have to come to the council every year with an independent study to set the annual rate increase.
The council reviewed the proposals during a study session on Thursday, ahead of the bills’ first consideration on Dec. 10. Public hearings for the bills would be scheduled for Jan. 8, 2026.
Should the project’s funding plan be approved in January, work would begin in Spring 2026 and complete around summer 2029.
Water woes
Columbia Power and Water System draws its water supply from the Duck River, a scenic river packed with ecological diversity that also serves as the main water source for the fast-growing southern Middle Tennessee region. But droughts and increasing demand for larger water withdrawals have put additional stress on the river. 
Gov. Bill Lee issued an executive order in November 2024 creating an advisory group tasked with identifying ways to protect the river while addressing water needs. The group issued its first recommendations last month, including a feasibility study for a pipeline to the Tennessee River and raising the level of the reservoir created by the Normandy Dam to collect more water during the wet seasons. 
Plans for the new intake site and treatment plant have been underway for a decade, Hardin said.
The Tennessee Valley Authority first issued a report citing the need for a downstream intake to meet the growing region’s water needs in 2001, Hardin said. The Duck River Agency echoed this finding in a 2011 report.
Columbia Power and Water System’s current intake withdraws up to 20 million gallons of water per day from the Duck River at the Riverside Drive intake. The proposed project would move the intake location downstream, and increase the utility’s withdrawal to up to 32 million gallons of water per day.
Hardin recounted the detrimental effects of severe droughts in 1988 and between 2007 and 2008. The Riverside Drive intake also relies on the Riverside Dam, a concrete structure erected in the 1920s that is “nearing the end of its useful life,” he said. 
Environmental group calls for water conservation as drought saps Duck River

Extreme rain events like Hurricane Helene also put the dam at risk of failure, Hardin added. Relocating the intake downstream “to a location that would prove capable and resilient during a 1988 drought event, while protecting the sensitive Duck River ecology” would address those problems, he said.
Permits for the project have already been approved by the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation and the project received a favorable biological opinion from the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency in March. Columbia Power and Water Systems began acquiring the land easements necessary for the project soon after, and have since secured about 60%. The remaining easements should be secured by Jan. 1, Hardin said.
Jason Gilliam — chair of the Maury County Republican Party, a member of the Maury County Water System Board, and a leader of a group advocating for the construction of a new dam in Columbia — urged the council to consider postponing the decision while others consider alternate ways to source water. Gilliam cited a proposed expansion of an ongoing pipeline project from H.B. & T.S. Utility District in Williamson County.
Columbia Mayor Chaz Molder said his overarching question is the cost of inaction. 
Should the rate increase not pass council approval, Hardin said the utility would serve the “modest amount of excess capacity” it maintains to developers who were first in line until it hits the 20 million gallon per day cap. After that, the utility would not be able to serve any additional water needs.
“For the interest of public health and safety, we would lock everything in place, and we would maintain the status quo,” Hardin said. The utility would “certainly revisit our wholesale obligations, and somebody like Spring Hill who has other options available to them would not receive the same priority as an entity that only gets the water directly (from Columbia Power and Water Systems).”

(Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)Democratic state Sen. Julie Gonzales on Monday announced she is running to unseat U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper in 2026, aiming to ride a wave of liberal and progressive dissatisfaction with Democratic leadership to an upset primary victory.
Gonzales’ announcement, rumored for weeks, sets up a clash in Colorado between a leading progressive voice at the state Legislature and a business-friendly moderate who has been a fixture in Colorado politics for roughly three decades.
In an interview, Gonzales called the 2026 midterm elections “a defining moment for the future of the Democratic Party.”
“What sort of party do we want to be?” Gonzales said. “Do we want to send back John Hickenlooper, a go-along-to-get-along incrementalist, or do we want to send a proven legislator, with a track record of taking on big fights against a well-funded corporate lobby, who’s gotten s*** done?”

Gonzales said Hickenlooper has failed to offer a “bold and fierce critique” of President Donald Trump’s second term agenda, faulting him for his votes earlier this year to confirm many of Trump’s Cabinet appointees. The path forward for Democrats after a bitter defeat in the 2024 election, she argued, is to embrace “policies that will have transformative impacts on everyday working people’s lives,” like “Medicare for All” and universal child care.
“The work begins day one, to remind folks that we can actually have nice things — you just need people willing to fight for them,” Gonzales said. “We have the opportunity to get the profit motive out of our health care system, and to enact universal health care. We have the opportunity to enact universal care for children, for elders. It requires us to reassess our policy priorities.”
Hickenlooper, a former brewpub entrepreneur and real estate developer, was elected mayor of Denver in 2003 and served two terms as Colorado governor beginning in 2011. During an ill-fated 2020 presidential campaign, he insisted he was “not cut out to be a senator,” but months later acquiesced to party leadership’s efforts to recruit him to challenge former GOP Sen. Cory Gardner, whom he went on to defeat soundly to help Democrats capture a razor-thin Senate majority.
Hickenlooper was among a group of 22 Democrats and Republicans who crafted the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, championing provisions to expand broadband access and boost investment in electric vehicle charging stations, and he was credited by activists with keeping alive the negotiations that ultimately led to Democrats’ passage of billions in spending to fight climate change in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.
He would be 80 years old by the end of another six-year Senate term, which he has said would be his last. In an interview with 9News in April, Hickenlooper said that while he had considered passing the torch to a new generation, his breadth of experience as a mayor, a governor and a small business owner brings a “unique and valuable perspective to making decisions.”

The winner of the June 30 Democratic Senate primary will be heavily favored to win in the general election in November. Republicans have not won a statewide race in Colorado since 2016. Historical precedent, early polling data and special election results this year all suggest the party faces strong headwinds in the 2026 midterms. Two little-known Republican U.S. Senate candidates, former state Rep. Janak Joshi and Marine Corps veteran George Markert, have raised a combined total of about $267,000 in campaign contributions, less than one-tenth of the $3.6 million war chest that Hickenlooper reported at the end of September, according to Federal Election Commission disclosures.
Gonzales, who began her career as a community organizer before running for the state Senate in 2018, expects much of that financial firepower to now be directed at her.
“I expect them to throw everything that they’ve got at me, but that’s not going to stop me. I have never backed down from a fight,” she said. “We might not outraise John Hickenlooper — we’ll sure as hell outwork him.”
Calls for generational change
It’s extremely rare for a sitting U.S. senator to be unseated by a primary challenge, though that rarity is a relatively recent development.
In 18 regularly scheduled elections between 1946 and 1980, a total of 36 Senate incumbents were defeated in primary elections, according to data compiled by the Brookings Institution. But in the 22 federal elections held since then, it’s happened just eight times. The last senator to suffer such a fate was former GOP Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana in 2012.
Gonzales’ Senate bid is more than just a challenge to Hickenlooper — it’s a breach of protocol within a Democratic Party that has, both at the national level and in Colorado specifically, placed a heavy premium on deference to seniority and the appearance of party comity.
Colorado’s strong Democratic bench includes three rising-star U.S. House members in their forties and plenty of prominent up-and-comers at the state and local levels. But twice in recent years — in Hickenlooper’s switch to the 2020 Senate race, and fellow U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet’s unexpected run for governor in 2026 — a decision by a more senior party figure has largely cleared the field and put an end to announced and rumored candidacies by younger hopefuls.
Gonzales, 42, would be the first woman elected to the U.S. Senate from Colorado, and the first Latina elected to any statewide office.
“I’ve worked hard, and I’ve followed all the rules — but I am not willing to sit around and wait for the boys’ club to say, now it’s time for a woman to run,” she said.
Calls for generational change within the Democratic Party have grown louder in the wake of a 2024 election loss widely attributed to former President Joe Biden’s failure to withdraw from the race earlier than he did. Criticism of the party’s “gerontocracy” may have reached a tipping point in 2025, a year during which three Democratic U.S. House members died in office — leaving their seats empty at a time when the GOP majority advanced its sweeping tax and spending bill by a one-vote margin.
At least three longtime House Democrats — former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Reps. Jerry Nadler of New York and Jan Schakowsky of Illinois — announced their retirements in recent months after drawing young primary challengers who voiced explicit concerns about their ages. In Massachusetts, 79-year-old Sen. Ed Markey faces a primary challenge from 47-year-old Rep. Seth Moulton, and in Maine, polls show first-time candidate Graham Platner, 41, with an early advantage over two-term incumbent Gov. Janet Mills, party leadership’s pick to take on GOP Sen. Susan Collins.
Three other lesser-known Democratic candidates — attorney Karen Breslin, software engineer Brashad Hasley and accountant A.J. Zimpfer — have also formally filed to run against Hickenlooper. To qualify for the Senate primary ballot, candidates can either submit 12,000 valid petition signatures by March 18 or win support from at least 30% of delegates at the 2026 state party assembly, scheduled for March 28 in Pueblo.
“I’ve seen hundreds of thousands of Coloradans take to the streets to proclaim ‘No Kings,'” Gonzales said, referring to this year’s nationwide anti-Trump demonstrations. “There is no guarantee for any elected official — you have to earn those votes. I think that when primary voters in Colorado have the opportunity to weigh in about the future of the leadership that they want representing them in Washington, D.C., they will support my candidacy.”
Different political eras
Gonzales said she first seriously considered a Senate bid during a special legislative session in August, when Colorado lawmakers were called back to the Capitol to close a billion-dollar budget gap triggered by congressional Republicans’ passage of their tax and spending law.
After two four-year terms representing Senate District 34, which includes much of north, west and downtown Denver, Gonzales is term-limited in 2026. She currently serves as chair of the Senate Judiciary and Ethics committees. Her proudest legislative accomplishments, she said, include sponsoring the Reproductive Health Equity Act, an abortion-rights law passed before the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 reversal of Roe v. Wade, and two immigrants rights bills — House Bill 19-1124 and Senate Bill 25-276 — that she said helped protect Colorado from overreach by Trump’s immigration authorities.
“Both are times when (some) Democrats — some of my more moderate colleagues, some of my more incrementalist colleagues — would say, ‘This is a lot. This is too hard to do,'” Gonzales said.
As governor, Hickenlooper presided over a much different era of state politics — one in which Republicans frequently controlled at least one chamber of the Legislature, along with the offices of attorney general and secretary of state. His moderate stances often frustrated many within his party, especially when it came to energy and environmental issues, which roiled the state during the 2010s fracking boom that coincided with his governorship.
An August poll by Magellan Strategies found that 49% of Coloradans disapproved of Hickenlooper’s job performance, compared to 37% who approved. A separate poll found that his favorability rating had declined to 43% last month from 49% in March.
Colorado’s increasing Democratic lean has made Hickenlooper an outlier in the Senate, a Newsline analysis found earlier this year. During the first three months of 2025, he voted with Trump and Republicans nearly 30% of the time despite representing a state that voted against Trump by 11 percentage points. No other Democratic senator had a voting record that was more at odds with their state’s partisan vote share.
After years of community organizing work, Gonzales won the District 34 primary in 2018 with 64% of the vote, after winning endorsements from progressive groups including the Working Families Party and the Denver Democratic Socialists of America. She joined the DSA in 2018, because they were “engaging young people in a manner that I hadn’t seen take place in years,” she said, though her membership has since lapsed. She cited New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani’s victory last month, however, along with wins for progressives at the local level in Colorado, as evidence that Democrats need to propose policy solutions that “meet the scale of the problems that we face.”
“Across the country, we saw progressives who led with their values, and who were unapologetic about being fighters for the working class, win,” Gonzales said.
It’s the same lesson that she takes from her tenure in the Legislature, where Democrats, despite frequent predictions of a backlash from voters, have been able to build durable majorities in both the House and Senate.
“Colorado is a blue state, and at the state Capitol, we have led,” Gonzales said. “We need that same type of partner in Washington, D.C., who is willing to be bold, unapologetic and relentless — and I’ve done that my entire career.”

(Photo by Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor)Some North Dakota farmers are owed money after a large bankruptcy filing by a Nebraska-based grain dealer. 
The North Dakota Department of Agriculture says farmers in the state are owed more than $900,000 by the Hansen-Mueller Co. 
The bankruptcy affects creditors in multiple states, including South Dakota and Minnesota. Creditors also include a trucking company in North Dakota.
David Barrett is a Bismarck ag law attorney with clients that include some of the North Dakota farmers who will be filing claims. 
He has clients in other states, too, and has already filed a $1.2 million claim for a grain elevator in Mississippi.

“There’s creditors everywhere,” Barrett said, with more filings to come. 
Hansen-Mueller leases a grain storage facility in Grand Forks and has a roving grain buyers license in the state. As part of being licensed in the state, it also would have to secure a bond to help ensure it can pay for grain it has purchased. 
However, the company filed for bankruptcy Nov. 17, before the Department of Agriculture could begin insolvency proceedings. Those proceedings could have allowed the state to access the company’s bond to help repay farmers.
Shaun Quissell, director of the Grain and Livestock Division for the state Ag Department, said Hansen-Mueller was bonded for about $778,000 — less than what is owed. 
The state also has a credit sales indemnity fund, which helps protect farmers from fraudulent buyers. 
Quissell also said the grain purchase agreements between Hansen-Mueller and the farmers were not credit sales contracts and would not have been covered by that fund. 
Because the company declared bankruptcy, the bond money could become part of the bankruptcy proceeding, Quissell said. 
Most of the North Dakota transactions involved oats, Quissell said. He did not have information on how many growers were affected. 
Barrett said the farmers he’s aware of being owed money are in the Red River Valley. 
In a news release, state Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring encouraged farmers affected by the Hansen-Mueller bankruptcy to file claims with the bankruptcy court. 
“Every producer who is owed money by Hansen-Mueller should be receiving notification from the bankruptcy court that they are a claimant and need to file a claim,” Goehring said. “We understand the producer’s frustration and are here to provide clear information to help those affected.”
Bankruptcy information can be found at https://dm.epiq11.com/case/hansenmueller/info or by calling 877-717-1702.  
In a news release announcing the bankruptcy, Hansen-Mueller said it hoped to find a buyer to continue operations. 
Hansen-Mueller operates nine grain elevators, including five across the Midwest along Interstate 29. Its Minnesota operations include a facility at the Duluth port on Lake Superior.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)The vote total for state Rep. Aftyn Behn in the Tennessee 7th Congressional District race against now-U.S. Rep. Matt Van Epps show Democrats have narrowed their deficit to Republicans but not enough to flip any seats, an analysis of election data by the Lookout finds.
The racet to watch in the 2026 election is Tennessee Congressional District 5, currently held by Columbia Republican U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles. He’s won about 56% of the vote in the past two elections, the lowest of any Tennessee Republican who won their U.S. House race.
Behn performed better in every county in District 7 in 2025 when compared to the Democratic candidates in 2024 or 2022. But if the same shifts in Nashville, Williamson County and rural counties that happened in District 7 on the Dec. 2 special election occurred in the 5th district, the Democratic candidate would lose by 4 to 7 percentage points.
Kent Syler, a political science professor at Middle Tennessee State University, said based on his look at the election data, he came up with a similar number, but cautioned that the 2026 midterms are still 11 months away and a lot could happen.
“The biggest issue will be President Donald Trump’s popularity,” Syler said. “Midterms are always about the President.”
President Donald Trump’s approval rating is 36%, according to Gallup.
Trump’s approval rating is at its lowest since he returned to office in January, driven down by many voters who disapprove of the President’s handling of the economy and inflation.
In 2022, state Republicans redrew Tennessee’s U.S. Congressional map, dividing Nashville across three districts and successfully eliminating a Democratic-held seat in the old version of the 5th Distric — a seat held by Democrats from post-Reconstruction until Ogles’ 2022 election.
By cracking the district, Republicans narrowed their margins in districts 5, 6 and 7, which political analysts warned could make two of those districts competitive in a bad electoral year for Republicans.
U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles won’t run away from his association with President Donald Trump even if Trump’s popularity continues to decline, one expert predicts. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
“The shift we saw in the 7th district is the same one we saw in New Jersey and Virginia earlier this year,” said John Geer, a political science professor at Vanderbilt University. “All the Republicans should be fearful.”
During the campaign, both candidates ran on affordability, recognizing that the cost of living has become a top priority for voters.
Van Epps madeclear during his election night speech that he didn’t blame Trump for economic issues and believed the president’s support in his race boosted his chances of winning.
“Tonight, you sent a clear message loud and clear,” Van Epps said. “The people of Middle Tennessee stand proudly behind President Donald Trump.”
Geer said Van Epps’ praise of Trump showed a potential problem for Republicans. To win close elections in 2026, candidates might need to separate themselves from the president, but “Trump won’t let them.”
“Ogles definitely won’t run away from Trump,” Geer said.

We are told we face a difficult choice: protect our water or secure our energy. This is a false narrative, manufactured by a foreign corporation and its allies to disguise their illegal occupation of our Great Lakes. The real choice before us, and the urgent duty before our state officials, is between upholding the law or capitulating to corporate power.
My remarks are directed to those in Lansing with the power to act.
An orderly, planned shutdown of Line 5 is not a concession; it is an affirmation. It is how we uphold the laws that protect the Public Trust Doctrine enshrined in our state constitution. It is how we defend state sovereignty by enforcing our Governor’s valid revocation of an easement that a corporation continues to violate with impunity. It is how we honor Tribal sovereignty and treaty rights, respecting the original stewards of these waters whose survival and culture are non-negotiable.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Critically, moving forward with a shutdown is how we boost jobs and domestic energy security. Since the Snyder administration, studies have confirmed that alternatives exist, but corporate greed has blinded our decision makers. Shutting Line 5 means investing in Michigan labor to build and maintain modern, safer energy infrastructure, not relying on a 70-year-old line in the heart of our Straits to send Canadian oil to foreign markets. True energy independence is built on innovation and resilience, not on doubling down on a risky, outdated conduit.
Yet, we are trapped in a cycle of unreasonable court delays, a strategy employed by Enbridge to run out the clock and amplify their threats to our communities. Every day our state wavers in its political will to enforce its own laws is a day we normalize this illegality.
This moment sets a national precedent. If Michigan, surrounded by the world’s greatest freshwater system, cannot summon the courage to prioritize the Great Lakes over a Canadian oil giant’s profits, what state can? We are signaling to every corporation that they can defy environmental orders, manipulate legal systems, and place their infrastructure above the public interest. As a wave of data centers enters the chat, Enbridge is paving their way for lawlessness. We are telling our citizens and Tribal nations that their rights are secondary to corporate convenience.
We do not need more grandstanding. We need the bold leadership that was promised when the shutdown was ordered. We need leaders who see that enforcing the law is the pro-jobs, pro-sovereignty, and pro-American energy path.
The call is clear. Use every tool of State government to end this illegal occupation and manage a transition that protects our water and our workers. Demonstrate to the nation that when the health of the Great Lakes and the rule of law are at stake, Michigan will lead.
Our Great Lakes are not a bargaining chip. They are the foundation of our identity, economy, and future. Upholding the law to protect them isn’t a threat to our prosperity, it is its very source.
The political will to act now is the only leadership worthy of this moment and this magnificent trust.

(Photo by Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)The two candidates for next chief justice of the North Dakota Supreme Court have a vision for a better-resourced and more efficient judiciary.
Justices Lisa Fair McEvers and Jerod Tufte are vying for the role after Jon Jensen announced last month he will step down at the end of 2025.
The chief justice is selected by a vote of the Supreme Court and state district court judges. 
The court system will count the ballots and announce a winner Wednesday.
The chief justice is responsible for handling some court-related administrative duties, in addition to serving as the public face of North Dakota’s judicial system. The chief has no more voting power on the court than the other justices.
“The description that has been used over the years is, the chief justice is the leader among equals,” Jensen said.
This is Tufte’s first time running for chief justice. Fair McEvers previously sought the position in 2019.

Fair McEvers
Fair McEvers said her career in the North Dakota court system dates back to 1987, when she began working in court administration for the Northeast Judicial District.
“I kind of know the history going back a long ways,” she said of the state’s judiciary.
Fair McEvers said the job sparked her interest in the law and inspired her to become an attorney. She graduated from the University of North Dakota Law School in 1997.
She went on to serve as assistant state’s attorney for Cass County and commissioner of the North Dakota Department of Labor from 2005 to 2010. Fair McEvers then served as a judge in the East Central Judicial District in Fargo.
She became a justice in 2014 when she was appointed by former Gov. Jack Dalrymple to fill a vacancy left by former Justice Mary Muehlen Maring. Fair McEvers was then elected to the court to serve a two-year term in 2016 and a 10-year term in 2018.
North Dakota abortion ban deemed constitutional in split opinion from state Supreme Court

Fair McEvers is the fourth woman to serve on the North Dakota Supreme Court. She said one of the most gratifying parts of her job is being a role model to young people.
“I want people to see that women can do this job and do it well,” Fair McEvers said.
If elected chief justice, she said she would look for ways to increase resources for district court judges.
“I know how busy they are, and how hard it is to find time to write the opinions and do the research and do all that by yourself,” Fair McEvers said.
One of her priorities would be eliminating judicial referee positions in state courts, she said. Judicial referees are attorneys that are available to decide certain cases — including juvenile, small claims and traffic court cases — on behalf of district court judges. There are five in the state.
Fair McEvers said she thinks the court system should invest in more judge positions rather than  continuing to keep judicial referees part of the court system.
“The judicial referees are very good, don’t get me wrong, but folks have a right to have their case heard by a district judge,” she said.
She said she wouldn’t want to take anyone’s job away, but would support phasing the referee positions out gradually.

Tufte 
Before he became an attorney, Tufte was a software engineer. After graduating from Arizona State University College of Law in 2002, he worked on patent and licensing issues for tech companies, he said.
Tufte also clerked for a judge on the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals and was the state’s attorney for Kidder County and Sheridan County. He served as legal counsel for Republican Gov. Jack Dalrymple from 2011 to 2014, and went on to become a judge in the Southeast Judicial District in Valley City.
Tufte was elected to the Supreme Court in 2016.
He described himself as an admirer of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, particularly Thomas’ belief that the U.S. Constitution should be interpreted based on how its authors would have understood it at the time of its adoption. The legal theory, often referred to as “originalism,” has been invoked by Thomas and other conservative U.S. Supreme Court justices in landmark decisions like the overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022.
“He’s just got this courage to admit that maybe the court’s been wrong from time to time,” Tufte said of Thomas.
Tufte said one of his objectives is to empower the court system to experiment with artificial intelligence.
He chairs the North Dakota judiciary’s artificial intelligence task force, and said he would want to continue in that position if elected chief justice. He’s also on a task force that’s exploring ways  to address North Dakota’s shortage of lawyers.
Tufte said his experience in the governor’s office would help the court collaborate with other branches of government to achieve its policy goals.
“The chief justice needs to be able to build bridges with different factions,” he said. “That’s what I bring to the table.”
Both Fair McEvers and Tufte said they would continue many initiatives started under Jensen’s leadership, including the ongoing effort to make all clerks of court state employees. Some clerks are still county employees, a holdover from when county courts and district courts were separate. The courts merged in the 1990s.
Fair McEvers and Tufte took opposing views on the court’s recent 3-2 decision on the state’s near-total abortion ban. The majority opinion, which Fair McEvers joined, found the law unconstitutional. Tufte authored the dissenting opinion. Since it takes a vote of four justices to declare a law unconstitutional, the law was upheld.

Jensen
Jensen’s predecessors, former justices Gerald VandeWalle and Ralph Erickstad, served as chief justice for a combined 45 years. Their decades-long service was unusual, however, Jensen said. He said before their terms as chief, the position “rotated fairly frequently.”
Most of the chief’s work pertains to “day-to-day management issues,” Jensen said. The chief justice typically decides minor legal matters that don’t need to go before the full court, for instance, and is also responsible for appointments to some committees and work groups, he said.

“The role of chief justice can be as easy or hard as the chief justice wants it to be,” Jensen said. “You can take on challenges to improve the judicial system, or alternatively, you can sit in the ceremonial role.”
He noted in a letter announcing his resignation that the court system has added three new judges and 29 full-time employees under his tenure, in addition to working to increase district judge salaries.
Jensen said part of the reason he’s not seeking reelection is because he wants to spend more time with his family. He felt it was time to yield the role to someone who can commit more energy to it, he said. Jensen will continue serving as a justice.
“I really do believe that if you’re in a position of leadership, you need to use that leadership to make whatever you’re leading better,” Jensen said.

When a woman sits across from me in the exam room, she’s not thinking about politics. She’s thinking about how to survive her work day without severe cramps, how to manage her bleeding so she can attend class without mishap, or how to avoid threatening her life with another high-risk pregnancy. 
These situations are only a few of the reasons why the news about abandoned U.S.–funded contraceptives overseas is so alarming. This action blatantly reflects the same disregard for women’s health that now shapes national policy. And that disregard lands directly on women’s bodies. 
Under the Trump administration, the U.S. government ordered the destruction of nearly $10 million worth of U.S.–funded contraceptives, based on the false claim that birth control is an “abortifacient.” This claim is absolutely nonsensical. Contraception doesn’t end a pregnancy — it prevents one. Unfortunately, ideology, and not medicine, guided that decision, leaving lifesaving, taxpayer‑funded medicine stalled in warehouses instead of reaching women who need it. 
The full picture is even more disturbing. Several days ago, a new report found that the Trump administration left 20 of 24 U.S.–funded contraceptive shipments to waste away in Belgian warehouses. These were fully paid-for, taxpayer-funded supplies — IUDs, implants, pills, and other reproductive health essentials — intended for women in 13 countries. This is simply appalling. 
And if you think that kind of extremism stops at the water’s edge, think again. 
Back home, I see the fallout of the same ideology driving national attacks on contraception and women. 
Already, there are over 300,000 women of reproductive age in Wisconsin in need of contraception, and attacks are making this gap even worse. 
And these gaps carry real health risks, because contraception does more than prevent pregnancy — it treats endometriosis, PCOS, severe bleeding and anemia, and it reduces the risk of reproductive cancers. 
Rural clinics that once offered contraception and family-planning visits have declined in number, a trend worsened by federal policy shifts that weaken the reproductive-health safety net and leave too many women without reliable nearby options for care.
And now, with health-insurance costs already skyrocketing for many families — and monthly bills set to jump even higher if those tax credits expire — the ACA’s no-cost contraception guarantee slips further out of reach. Road block after road block after road block. 
Fortunately, Wisconsin has leaders who understand the stakes. 
Sen. Tammy Baldwin’s leadership on the “Right to Contraception Act” reflects a truth every OB‑GYN knows: contraception saves lives. Contraception reduces maternal deaths, prevents unintended pregnancies, treats reproductive-health conditions, and empowers women to build stable lives. Baldwin fights to protect contraception — what Wisconsin women rely on every day — not because it’s politically convenient, but because she understands it’s a medical necessity. 
U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan co-sponsored the “Saving Lives and Taxpayer Dollars Act” — legislation designed to stop exactly what we’re seeing in Belgium. The bill requires that U.S.–funded food and medical supplies – like the contraception sitting in Brussels at this moment – reach the people they were purchased for, instead of being left to rot or destroyed for ideological reasons. In Washington, where too many have decided contraception is a cultural wedge rather than essential health care, Pocan’s voice matters. 
The women I see in my exam room aren’t looking for a political fight. They’re looking for care that lets them stay healthy, stay safe, and stay in control of their lives — something contraception makes possible every day. 
Jeopardizing contraception — whether through wasteful negligence abroad or political interference here at home — is harmful, cruel and simply unjust. 
We in Wisconsin cannot afford to look the other way. We need leaders who will defend the right to contraception, not undermine it. 
The stakes are simple: either we protect access to basic health care, or we allow ideology to decide who gets care — and who doesn’t. 
For the women in my clinic — and for women everywhere — contraception is essential care that strengthens their health and safeguards their freedom.

(Getty Images)It is startling to realize the eight professions the U.S. Department of Education recently announced it wants to reclassify as nonprofessional include nurses and teachers.
If reclassified, it will reduce the amount of student loans for those seeking advanced degrees. The other professions are audiologists, speech-language pathologists, occupational therapists, social workers, public health and counseling therapy. Health care in states like Idaho will be seriously damaged.
One of the interesting things about all these professions is they all require licensing and continuing education hours, adding educational costs beyond a bachelor’s or master’s.
If approved, it means these workers will have a lifetime federal student loan cap of $200,000. This will make degrees including advanced certifications or a doctorate unavailable to thousands of people.
Many bachelor’s degrees now cost a minimum of $30,000 for public college in-state tuition, $63,000 for private colleges or out-of-state tuition. The average master’s degree costs $65,000 for public schools, $88,000 for private universities; so, a $200,000 lifetime cap places further education beyond the grasp of many Americans. This is especially true of these eight professions where continuing education is essential — even required as a condition of employment — to maintain and gain necessary skills.
Because of the proposed student loan cutback, it may mean a serious shortage of people to fill jobs in health care and education, making American less healthy and more poorly educated.
For example, in rural areas throughout America, nurses who have completed nurse practitioner certification (an advanced degree) are serving rural areas where physicians are either in short supply or nonexistent. Without these professionals, people have limited ability to receive medical care without significant travel.
This also comes at a time when there is a serious shortage of nurses in the U.S., with both Washington and Idaho facing significant shortfalls in nursing care. In Washington, there is a 26 percent shortage of nurses and a 15 percent shortage in Idaho.
However, if the current trend continues, Idaho is projected by the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration to have the most serious shortage of nurses in the country by next year with a projected 62 percent of the necessary skilled nurses working. This would be a 38 percent shortfall of nurses needed.
The same is true of education with more than 411,000 K-12 teaching positions vacant and more than 1 in 8 teaching positions currently filled by uncertified teachers across the country. The shortage is especially serious in areas of high poverty with 86 percent of the nation’s school districts struggling to fill positions. In the 2023-24 school year, the Idaho Department of Education reported serious teacher shortages in elementary grades K-8, math, science, technical and career education, visual and performing arts, family and consumer science and special education.
Who will be hurt the most by these actions? Mostly people in rural areas, but everywhere it will primarily impact children, women and the elderly. If someone has a serious health issue or they want to climb out of poverty through education, they will struggle to find resources.
As a medical example, anyone who might need a hearing aid – sure, they can get one over the counter, but one that specifically addresses their unique need if they are profoundly deaf or have tinnitus? For that, they need an audiologist.
Someone who experienced a stroke and needs to re-learn how to do daily activities needs an occupational therapist. Social workers do more than deal with families, they also help vulnerable people find assistance such as housing and mental health treatment. Public health professionals create awareness of public health issues, such as illness or the dangers of certain behaviors.
When it comes to the people driven to serve in these areas as professionals, it will be women and people of color who are the majority of all these impacted groups. Changing the ability of people to serve their communities by removing advanced scholastic opportunities makes no sense.
Overall, what this plan will most likely do is decrease the already short supply of nurses, teachers, audiologist, therapists, social workers and public health professionals hurting Americans ability to be educated and healthy.
Reportedly, the U.S. Department of Education will hold hearing next year on the topic, and concerned citizens should let their opinions on this revocation of professional status be known to the Department of Education and others.

Ken Fleming is filing legislation in 2026 that would remove body mass index from treatment standards for state qualified health insurance plans marketed through kynect. (LRC Public Information)This story discusses eating disorders. If you or someone you know is at risk for an eating disorder, the National Eating Disorders Association has resources and a free screening tool at www.nationaleatingdisorders.org The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 988. 
Kentuckians being treated for eating disorders who gain much needed weight in treatment sometimes reach a body mass index threshold that, on paper, makes them seem healthy, triggering the end of insurance coverage for treatment.  
Louisville Republican Rep. Ken Fleming wants to change that and is filing legislation in 2026 that would remove body mass index (more commonly known as BMI) from treatment standards for state qualified health insurance plans marketed through kynect. 
A Louisville eating disorder expert said such a change is needed. 
“I’ve had this happen to me too many times to count at this point now: You will have somebody who is in treatment and who needs more treatment, but they gain a little bit of weight because they’re eating regularly, because they’re in treatment, and then the insurance company says, ‘okay, well, they don’t need treatment anymore, we’re going to discharge them right then,’” explained Cheri Levinson, an associate professor with the University of Louisville and the director of Louisville’s Eating Anxiety Treatment (EAT) Lab. 
“On the opposite end of that, you might have somebody who loses half a pound, and the insurance company says, ‘Oh, well, they need a higher level of care, so they can’t stay in your treatment program anymore,’” she added. “Essentially, as a clinician or as a clinic providing this type of treatment, you end up in this situation where any sort of movement on weight causes the insurance company to discharge them from the care that they need.”   
Fleming, who has experience running a mental health agency, said his legislation initially came from a constituent a few years ago who had issues with insurance while in treatment. 
“Once an individual reaches the BMI threshold, then coverage can be stopped. But they’re missing the point in terms of treating the mental health aspect of it,” Fleming said. “And so, once you reach that threshold there’s, I guess, an approach or thought that, ‘okay, you reached it. You’re fine. Let’s move on.’ In reality, that’s not the case. You may have gotten your body into a better spot, but you still have some elements or some issues or some challenges or some triggers or whatever it might be that could (cause) them to relapse.” 
Using BMI in general is “extremely problematic,” said Levinson: “We know that BMI is supposed to be a population based measure, not an individual indicator of health.” 
Cheri Levinson is an associate professor with the university and the director of Louisville’s Eating Anxiety Treatment (EAT) Lab. (Photo provided)
“Weight gain is only one of the characteristics that’s needed for somebody to recover from an eating disorder, and usually you’ll have people who are nutritionally restored, … their BMI might look healthy, but they’re actually still extremely cognitively sick,” she said. “Their brain has not healed yet.”  
Fleming’s bill will apply only to state qualified health plans for individuals and small groups marketed on the Affordable Care Act (ACA) exchange, he said. That will still cover a substantial number of patients, Levinson said. At least a quarter of her patients getting inpatient and outpatient treatment for eating disorders belong to such plans.  
Almost 100,000 Kentuckians purchase health insurance on the ACA marketplace but that number is expected to drop next year because of premium increases and the end of enhanced federal subsidies. Congress is considering ways to hold down costs.
‘We’re creating another crisis’
During the federal government shutdown, around 600,000 Kentuckians’ food assistance was frozen after the U.S. Department of Agriculture said in late October that it wouldn’t use contingency funds to keep SNAP benefits flowing. 
Such scarcity is directly related to eating disorders, Levinson said, making such a policy change as Fleming is suggesting timely. 
“The primary trigger for eating disorders is problematic restrictions,” she said. “People who are food insecure obviously have periods of time when they don’t have enough to eat, and not even necessarily by choice. They’re restricting, but that restriction can then trigger things like binge eating, can trigger purging, which can trigger all sorts of other problematic behaviors.” 
It’s too early to know the full impact of the SNAP benefits freeze on eating disorders in Kentucky, Levinson said. 
But: “I think that we can infer that as we see more people who are food insecure in this country, we’re going to see more people with eating disorders. We’re creating another crisis,” she said. “You’re going to have more people who are on Medicaid that have eating disorders, and (there are) limited resources for people to get treatment that have that type of health care.” 
Meanwhile, Fleming believes there is appetite to pass his bill in 2026. 
“I’ve gotten a lot of good feedback from my colleagues,” he said. “Everybody’s pretty much in agreement to …. get this through. So we seem, I think, pretty optimistic and positive about it.”

(Photo by Arshia Khan for Arkansas Advocate)The city of Tulsa is challenging an Arkansas agency’s modification of a Northwest Arkansas treatment plant’s permit that discharges into the watershed that supplies the Oklahoma city’s drinking water.
The City of Decatur’s wastewater plant receives waste from Centerton and a nearby Simmons Food plant and discharges into streams that feed Lakes Eucha and Spavinaw, from which Tulsa draws its water. Decatur entered into a consent order with the Arkansas Division of Environmental Quality last year over numerous violations of its federal Clean Water Act permit. Tulsa said the violations, which have continued since the order was signed, are reason enough to reject expanding the plant until Decatur complies with its original permit.
Tulsa has additional concerns: that the modified permit could result in higher levels of pollutants discharged into the watershed that supplies its drinking water.
The modified permit increases the plant capacity by just over 1.5 million gallons per day (MGD), to 5.36 MGD, reflecting the construction of additional capacity at the plant due to “rapidly increasing” waste flows. But Tulsa says modification shouldn’t be approved until plans for unaddressed “choke points” within the treatment plant are submitted and approved, or until a survey is completed to determine what waste pretreatment, if any, should be required.
“Decatur has no plans to increase pre-treatment or reduce the amount of wastewater which it takes from sources outside of Decatur,” Tulsa wrote in public comments on the permit in October. “The increase in flow via the permit modification should be denied until such time as Decatur can increase flow while also decreasing the total amount of phosphorus which Decatur discharges into the watershed.”
Decatur and Tulsa are parties to a 2003 federal court settlement that came after Tulsa sued Decatur and six poultry companies in 2001, alleging that discharges by the companies and the city’s wastewater plant contained phosphorus that polluted Lakes Eucha and Spavinaw, where Tulsa gets its drinking water.
Tulsa argued in its request for an administrative hearing with the Arkansas Pollution Control and Ecology Commission that the modified permit violates the 2003 settlement and that the city is “directly and negatively impacted by the issuance of [Decatur’s modified permit].” Tulsa wrote the permit is unable “to address Decatur’s long history of numerous violations of the Settlement Agreement between Tulsa and Decatur,” nor was it able to address violations under the current permit and “ADEQ’s own water quality standards.”
Administrative permit appeals are an uncommon event in recent years — this is the first filed with the commission since 2023.
A spokesperson with the city of Tulsa on Friday was unable to provide further information without speaking with Tulsa’s water utility board and the lawyers representing them in the challenge.
Tulsa’s 2001 lawsuit was separate from ongoing efforts by successive Oklahoma attorneys general to hold Arkansan poultry companies responsible in court for phosphorus pollution in the Illinois River watershed.
When contacted Friday afternoon, the mayor of Decatur said he was unable to get an Advocate reporter in touch with someone from the wastewater department by the end of the day, and that he couldn’t comment until next week.
“In Tulsa’s view increased flow into the Waste Water Treatment Plant (“WWTP”) and discharge from the Decatur WWTP will only result in greater pollution to the watershed Tulsa utilizes for clean water and result in damage to the people of Oklahoma and Northwest Arkansas,” the city wrote in its Nov. 26 hearing request.
The city wrote that DEQ did not explain how any additional phosphorus that enters the watershed as a result of the higher flow would not harm water quality in the agency’s response to Tulsa’s comments on the permit modification. It asks the pollution control commission to vacate the permit changes and find that DEQ acted “arbitrarily and capriciously and contrary to law” when it granted the change.
A spokesperson for the Department of Energy and Environment, DEQ’s parent agency, did not respond to a request for comment on the permit appeal.
Decatur has a documented history of permit violations, with two consent orders with DEQ in the last ten years. Tulsa alleges in its appeal request that “Decatur is not actively working to address any of its exceedances or deficiencies.” DEQ’s 2024 consent order “came only after years of ignoring exceedances and Decatur as yet to reach compliance. Furthermore, it confounds logic to increase the flow into the plant without the existing plant coming into full compliance,” Tulsa wrote to DEQ.
According to data from the EPA, the amount of phosphorus discharged by the plant nearly tripled between 2010 and 2024. The majority of those increases have occurred since 2020. Incomplete 2025 data shows lower amounts of phosphorus compared to 2024. That data does not yet include November or December discharge data.
But Tulsa says there are still problems. Data collected by the city from Columbia Hollow Creek, where the Decatur plant discharges treated wastewater, showed “a substantial increase in the concentration of total phosphorus and the abundance of E. coli in samples” between April 2025 and September 2025 that indicate an existing, unaddressed issue at the Decatur plant. That data was not provided in the request.
In its October comments on the DEQ modification consent order, Tulsa threatened another lawsuit if Decatur’s permit modification was not overturned.
“Granting the permit as written will absolutely result in more phosphorus in the Eucha-Spavinaw watershed, a greatly enhanced risk of harm to the City Water Supply and will also result in litigation with Decatur and ADEQ,” the city wrote, asserting later that the communications from the Arkansas Department of Health amounted to concerns that “show the project is marginal on a good day, and at worst presents a potential for environmental disaster for the people of Northwest Arkansas and Northeast Oklahoma.”
Phosphorus flowing from Arkansas poultry growers into Oklahoma’s waters has remained a cause of contention throughout the 21st century — Attorney General Tim Griffin published an op-ed Friday blasting the long-running Illinois River watershed lawsuit in Talk Business and Politics.
“Arkansas will continue to oppose Oklahoma’s attempt to threaten our farmers, weaken our economy, and limit our sovereignty,” Griffin wrote in the op-ed, which was published days after Tyson said it may not enter into contracts with poultry growers in the watershed going forward unless Oklahoma backs off its demands in the long-running lawsuit.
A federal judge ruled in favor of Oklahoma in 2023, but still has not issued a final decision in the case — though he ruled earlier this year that the watershed still remained polluted, fifteen years after it went to trial. Oklahoma’s attorney general said at the time that the final decision could come by the end of 2025.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Misty-Decature-aa-6-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-12-08 05:57:09.289201

Transgender health advocates and an attorney in the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia case said the favorable decision is encouraging for the patients and the broader transgender community. But it’s only one battle won against the Trump administration’s campaign to end transgender health care.
And, they warn, the administration’s tactics could be applied to other types of politically-charged areas of health care, such as reproductive care.

“The records the Department of Justice are seeking here are the most sensitive types of medical records,” said Mimi McKenzie, legal director of the Public Interest Law Center in Philadelphia, which represented the families along with lawyers from the firm Ballard Sphar. 
“That coupled with the fact this administration has made no secret of its agenda against transgender youth means that this is a really important win for the families,” McKenzie said.
The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) sued to quash a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice in June, that purported to seek the information for an investigation of off-label uses of medications such as puberty blockers that are commonly used in medical care for transgender people. 
It was one of more than 20 similar demands made to hospitals across the country, including the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Children’s Hospital (UPMC).
“Medical professionals and organizations that mutilated children in the service of a warped ideology will be held accountable by this Department of Justice,” U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement announcing the subpoenas.
But the administration is in a position to keep pushing the issue until it gets a favorable ruling, said Michael Ulrich, associate professor at Boston University’s School of Public Health and School of Law.
“All you need is one district court that says it’s fine, or one circuit court, and you can appeal it all the way up to the Supreme Court,” Ulrich said. “If anything, this administration has shown it believes the higher it goes, the more likely it is to win.”
The DOJ declined a request for comment. CHOP also did not respond to the Capital-Star’s request for comment.
The department has filed an appeal of a September ruling by U.S. District Judge Myong J. Joun in Boston, which was the first to block a DOJ subpoena for patient information and medical records from Boston Children’s Hospital’s gender affirming care program. 
It is also appealing a Seattle federal judge’s decision to quash a subpoena issued to QueerDoc, a Washington-based medical clinic that provides gender-affirming health care to adult and adolescent patients.










What this does is entrench from the highest levels that you are different, you are strange, you are not good enough as you are.


– Michael Ulrich, associate professor at Boston University’s School of Public Health and School of Law


U.S. District Judge Mark A. Kearney, who handled the CHOP ruling, referred in his opinion to a fourth subpoena case filed “completely under seal” in which a federal judge ruled against the DOJ.
That means the indirect effects of the administration’s demands on transgender health care could quietly continue to erode access and cause transgender people to hesitate in seeking appropriate care.
“There’s certainly a strategy behind this in terms of providers constantly having to deal with and worry about it, and they eventually say … it’s not worth dealing with anything close to this because of the target it puts on us,” Ulrich said.
It could have dire consequences for the transgender population, Ulrich said, which experiences mental health issues such as suicidal ideal, self harm and substance abuse at significantly higher rates than cisgender people, according to the Williams Institute at the University of California – Los Angeles.
“What this does is entrench from the highest levels that you are different, you are strange, you are not good enough as you are,” Ulrich said, which has the potential to exacerbate mental health problems already fueled by the sense of being ostracized many transgender people experience.
While CHOP did not oppose the DOJ’s request for many of the 15 categories of records the DOJ sought, it told the department it would not compromise the privacy of its patients by providing their confidential health information.
Joined by parents of transgender children treated at the hospital, CHOP argued the DOJ lacked authority to compel the release of the contested records and that the children’s privacy interests outweighed the government’s need for the records. 
Kearney agreed, ruling in favor of the hospital and patients.
In the Nov. 21 decision, Kearney found the DOJ did not show the individual records of gender affirming care patients were relevant to its investigation and therefore lacked authority to demand them. 
Even if the information was relevant to the investigation the DOJ described, “the children’s and their families’ privacy interests in their highly sensitive and confidential medical and psychological treatment in a charged political environment, which considers their medical treatment to [be] a radicalized warped ideology, far outweigh the Department of Justice’s shifting need for the information,” Kearney wrote. 
Fights against the DOJ subpoenas are going on across the country 
In federal court in Pittsburgh, the Public Interest Law Center and Ballard Spahr are also representing four families trying to bar the DOJ’s access to their children’s records held by UPMC. The hospital itself has not challenged the subpoena, but disclosed in a filing last week that it has not disclosed to the government any of the challenged records. 
The families of 10 transgender children in Maryland last month challenged a subpoena issued for Children’s National Hospital. And in California, six families filed a proposed class action lawsuit to quash a demand for minor patients’ records from the Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles.
Corinne Goodwin, of the Eastern PA Trans Equity Project, noted the DOJ focus on transgender health care for minors has already reduced access. Penn State Hershey Medical Center and Jefferson Health are among Pennsylvania hospitals that have suspended care for transgender youth.

The Trump administration’s proposed rule that would block Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements for any services provided at hospitals that also provide pediatric gender affirming care would have an even greater chilling effect, Goodwin said. 
Jennifer Levi, senior director of transgender and queer rights at GLAD Law, which provides legal advocacy for the LGBTQ+ community, said the Trump administration’s attack on the transgender community reaches far beyond health care. She cited the elimination of the non-gender sex marker “X” in U.S. passports, as one example of the broader onslaught against trans-rights. 
As a result, families who are caught in the middle of the medical records fight are also unable to obtain or update passports to travel to continue their care abroad.
Levi said the mounting attacks and growing uncertainty make this “a really scary time and vulnerable time for parents with adolescent transgender children.”
“This is a moment when these kinds of attacks by the administration cause so many problems for families, for young adults,” she said. “And that’s why it’s so important for the courts to step up in their traditional roles to protect this community.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-1323919275-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-08 05:57:09.289201

(Photo by Teri Carter)On Nov. 3 I attended a Lawrenceburg (Anderson County) City Council meeting which opened with an alleged jurisdictional issue between the county and city fire departments.
The public sat silently and watched — for almost 40 minutes — as the county fire chief and his deputy held the floor, repeatedly berating the city fire chief. The man sitting next to me filmed a very brief portion (now deleted) of this diatribe, which the county fire chief then shared on his Facebook page, sparking public outrage all over social media.

Did the 40 minute public shaming of the city fire chief solve the problem? No. 
Did social media outrage from this incident solve the problem? No. 
But problem-solving is no longer the point. The point is the overwrought performance which supplies the viral video clip. The point is the rage bait.
Rage bait — manipulative tactics used to drive engagement online — is the Oxford University Press word of the year for 2025. If you spend any time at all online, particularly on social media, you do not need an Oxford dictionary to confirm how constant and pernicious the rage and rage baiting are.
We are entering primary election season here in Kentucky, and we have already been talking with our friends and neighbors about the hateful, hard to stomach ads to replace Mitch McConnell in the U.S. Senate. 
In one of his ads, Senate candidate Rep. Andy Barr says, “The woke left wants to neuter America, literally.” What in the world does that mean? He then shows a clip of black people standing in a circle, burning a flag, and then photos of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Chuck Schumer, fists raised, looking angry, with Barr’s voiceover, “They hate our values, they hate our history, and goodness knows they hate President Trump.” 
So much hate, and that’s just the first 20 seconds. 
A political action committee (PAC) backing Barr has released an ad which calls Nate Morris, one of Barr’s opponents in the Senate race, “Fake Nate Morris: fully woke and full of sh—.”
Do these ads inform the public about policies that will create jobs, lower grocery prices, build affordable housing or ensure that American families are not bankrupted by medical debt? 
No, because talking about these issues does not spark enough interest or outrage for politicians to get our attention in a fractured media landscape of 30-second soundbites. 
On her Dec. 4 podcast, Jessica Tarlov, one of the cohosts of Fox News’ The Five, discusses (at the 48 minute mark) how politicians cannot break through in today’s media landscape without fomenting rage online which, in turn, goes viral and keeps their names in our distracted, short-attention-span minds until election day. 
Rage baiting, Tarlov says, is “an apt word of the year.” 
Social media algorithms are the third rail running through and ruining our political discourse and relationships, and yet we have grown so accustomed to online rage that we are often numb to it. “Folks with the big platforms are the ones that are driving American society,” Tarlov says, “They’re getting hired into the biggest jobs you can have, from the secretary of war to the heads of these media companies. Everyone needs content creators and influencers, whatever you want to call them, on the landing page of their organization … and it’s a vicious cycle that keeps feeding it.”
The morning after the Nov. 3 Lawrenceburg City Council meeting, I watched the video go viral and the outraged commentary that accompanied it. At first, when I spotted a Facebook post that I knew was not wholly accurate, I commented with missing context, writing that I’d been there and witnessed the entire meeting. 
Nobody cared. Within minutes I deleted my comments, as adding facts only sparked more rage.
Rage baiting is Oxford dictionary’s word of the year for a reason. 
Online rage, cruelty, bullying, trolling and the ability to post misleading information or even outright lies are destroying our relationships and communities.
Meanwhile, tech billionaires like Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg — who built these social media companies, created the algorithms that fuel our rage and help fund the PACs responsible for some of the most heinous political ads — are smiling all the way to their big, fat banks.
The question is:  What are we — and the leaders we send to Congress — doing to stop it?",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_2078.jpeg,,,2025-12-08 05:57:09.289201

(Photo courtesy of Knox County Schools/YouTube)When the U.S. Supreme Court deadlocked this year in a case over whether charter schools can be religious, experts said it wouldn’t take long for the question to re-emerge in another lawsuit.
They were right.
In Tennessee, the nonprofit Wilberforce Academy is suing the Knox County Schools in federal court because the district refuses to allow a Christian charter school. Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti is on the school’s side. He issued an opinion last month that the state’s ban on religious charter schools likely violates the First Amendment.
“Tennessee’s public charter schools are not government entities for constitutional purposes and may assert free exercise rights,” he wrote to Rep. Michele Carringer, the Knoxville Republican who requested the opinion.
The legal challenge in Tennessee comes as a Florida-based charter school network prepares to submit an application to the Oklahoma Charter School Board for a Jewish virtual charter high school. Peter Deutsch, the former Democratic congressman who founded the Ben Gamla charter schools, began working on the idea long before the case over St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School even went to court. The U.S. Supreme Court decision means that an Oklahoma Supreme Court decision blocking the school from receiving state funds still stands.

“The prior decision shows that there’s an open question here that needs to be resolved,” said Eric Baxter, vice president and senior counsel at Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a law firm representing the National Ben Gamla Jewish Charter School Foundation. “We hope the court will get it right this time. We hope the federal courts get it right without having to go to the Supreme Court.”
Idaho also confronted the issue earlier this year. The state’s first charter, Brabeion Academy, initially promoted the school as Christian. But it was approved in August as a nonreligious school and will open as such next fall.

‘A Day to Exhale’: Supreme Court Deadlocks on Religious Charter Schools — For Now

 




Deutsch, Skrmetti and other supporters of faith-based charter schools base their argument on three earlier Supreme Court rulings allowing public funds to support sectarian schools. They say that excluding religious organizations from operating faith-based charter schools is discrimination and violates the Constitution. But leaders of the charter sector and public school advocates argue that classifying charter schools as private would threaten funding and civil rights protections for 3.7 million students nationwide.
“Unless and until the U.S. Supreme Court takes up a future case and rules otherwise, we advise all charter school associations and public charter schools to adhere to the letter and spirit of the law in their respective states,” Starlee Coleman, president and CEO of the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools, said in a statement.
‘Not on our watch’

When the Supreme Court considered St. Isidore, Deutsch, was prepared to advocate for Jewish congregations to open schools that not only teach their language, but also their faith. He called the case “a historic opportunity” to bring Jewish education to thousands of children.
To Oklahoma Attorney General Genter Drummond, the debate is settled, for now. In November, he said his office would “oppose any attempts to undermine the rule of law.”
Americans United, which advocates for maintaining church-state separation, has also issued a warning over the new school. The organization represented parents and advocates in a separate case over the school.
“Religious extremists once again are trying to undermine our country’s promise of church-state separation by forcing Oklahoma taxpayers to fund a religious public school. Not on our watch,” Rachel Laser, president and CEO, said in a press release.

The legal fight over religious charter schools began in 2023, when the Oklahoma Virtual Charter School Board voted 3-2 to approve a charter for St. Isidore, setting off a closely watched case that spanned two years. At the time, the Jewish Federation of Greater Oklahoma City, a nonreligious group, called the charter board’s decision unconstitutional. Rachel Johnson, the group’s executive director, didn’t return calls or emails requesting a comment on Ben Gamla’s proposal.
None of the members who originally voted on St. Isidore serves on the state’s new Oklahoma Charter School Board. But for one person involved with Ben Gamla’s application, this is familiar territory. Brett Farley is on the proposed school’s board, according to a letter of intent the foundation submitted to the charter board in November.
Farley once held a top position with the Oklahoma GOP and is also executive director of the Catholic Conference of Oklahoma, which focuses on public policy issues involving the church. While preparing the St. Isidore application, Farley connected with Notre Dame law Professor Nicole Stelle Garnett, whose scholarly work formed the basis of the legal argument for the school.
Garnett’s position is that nonprofits running charter schools are like private contractors, and as with other publicly funded programs, can’t be excluded just because they are religious. She’s also close friends with Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who recused herself from the St. Isidore case. Experts speculated that Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the three liberals on the court, resulting in the 4-4 tie.

‘Passion for religious freedom’
The virtual school, the intent letter says, would initially enroll about 40 students, focusing on “college readiness, while developing deep Jewish knowledge, faith and values within a supportive learning community.”
But some are surprised Deutsch isn’t making his bid for a Jewish charter school in Florida, where his existing, non-religious charter schools have thrived.
“I think Florida could be a good option given the new attorney general’s passion for religious freedom,” said Daniel Aqua, the director of special projects at Teach Coalition, a nonprofit that advocates for Jewish education.

After Contentious Vote, Hebrew Charter Founder Eyes Jewish School in Oklahoma

 




The demand for a Jewish charter school would be much higher in Florida, which has an estimated Jewish population of nearly 762,000, compared with about 9,000 in Oklahoma.
Charter founders in Florida submit their applications to local school districts first. The state recently added colleges as authorizers, but Oklahoma, where organizers can file applications directly with the state charter board, offers a more streamlined process.
‘Public Christian school’
But efforts to create publicly-funded religious schools are not limited to the charter sector. A new school in Colorado, Riverstone Academy, calls itself the state’s “first public Christian school.” Now serving 30 students in Pueblo, south of Colorado Springs, Riverstone is what is sometimes referred to as a “contract” school because districts sign agreements with private organizations to provide education services. In this case, Education reEnvisioned, one of the state’s 21 boards of cooperative educational services, or BOCES, authorized the school.
In October, the Colorado Department of Education warned Ken Witt, the BOCES’ executive director, that the school’s per-student funding is at risk because it is “not operating in a nonsectarian nature.” The letter also went to District 49, near Colorado Springs, one of Education reEnvisioned’s member districts.
In a response, Witt wrote that he was “alarmed at the threat” that the school might not receive funding. “We did not and legally cannot discriminate against this school on account of its religious affiliation,” he wrote. Examining Riverstone’s curriculum to determine if the school is truly sectarian, he said, would be “unconstitutionally entangling and discriminatory against different forms of religion.”
Witt told The 74 that funding usually doesn’t flow from the state to a new school until January, so it’s too soon to know whether officials will withhold funds.

‘Keep coming back’
“You’re going to see those within the charter sector and outside of it basically taking the same approach” — arguing that private groups delivering religious instruction can’t be denied public funds, said Preston Green, an education professor at the University of Connecticut.
To Green, Riverstone’s identity as a “contract” school calls to mind a 1982 case, one that Garnett and other proponents of religious charter schools often highlight when they say that charters are not “state actors.” In Rendell-Baker v. Kohn, the Supreme Court said a Massachusetts private school that received public funds for educating teens with behavior problems did not act under the “color of state law” when it fired six employees.
The question, experts say, is not if, but when the Supreme Court will eventually see another case about religious public schools Justice Barrett won’t have the same reason to recuse herself, Green said, and he’s not convinced that Roberts would side with the liberals a second time.
The advocates, he said, “keep coming back at this because they think that they’ll get the votes.”

(Photo Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)As George Mason University Rector Charles Stimson addressed his colleagues Thursday, he sat across from faculty members, students and campus workers holding signs plastered with images of his face, gathered in opposition to his decision to hold a second executive committee meeting with only six voting members.
Tensions have boiled over within the Northern Virginia university’s community over Stimson’s decision to meet and vote on university matters without the required quorum. Outside of GMU’s meeting on Thursday, protestors yelled “no quorum, no business,” and organizers accused the board of meeting improperly.
One of the organizing groups, the Virginia Conference of the American Association of University Professors, said in a statement that Stimson is flouting rules to push his “ideological agenda,” and claimed the board is considering a settlement by the Department of Justice to drop the four investigations against the institution similar to the University of Virginia.
UVA interim president to senators: Agreement with DOJ to pause probes was ‘best option available’

University officials told the Mercury that it has no proposed settlement agreement.
Stimson, who stated that the board is simply “following the law,” mentioned in an interview after the meeting that in the absence of a quorum, legislative actions by state lawmakers have supported the executive committee’s role in meeting and addressing the institution’s business.
“Our bylaws incorporated (those legislative actions) decades ago … because you can’t run a university from a board perspective if you don’t have an executive committee or some component of the board, and so we’re just doing what the law authorized,” said Stimson.
Stimson pointed to several policies to support the executive committee’s meetings, including Virginia Code 23.1-1502, the university’s bylaws, and the 1919 statute enacted by the General Assembly that codified the executive committee’s authority, which he says has been rooted in the traditions of university governance.
The rector said the practice of allowing the university’s executive committee to conduct regular business in the absence of a quorum has been in place since the early 1800s. The only body that can repeal rules, Stimson said, is the General Assembly.
“No high-functioning organization defenestrates an executive committee from doing the regular business of a university, which is what we were doing,” Stimson said.
Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, said he spoke with Stimson in October before the first executive committee, telling the Mercury that Senate Democrats disagree with the rector’s view and question if the decision runs afoul with the preliminary junction set in July to suspend governor appointments from serving on the governing board.
On Thursday, GMU’s executive committee approved several actions including the university’s six-year operating plan, which needed to be voted on by December to follow state statute. The committee opted to establish two new degree programs, an MS in quantum science and engineering and a PhD in cybersecurity, and to rename the College of Public Health’s Department of Health Administration to the Department of Health Administration, Policy, and Informatics. 
Members also voted on the conferral of emeritus/emerita status, and the election of new tenured faculty. Meanwhile, the board is waiting for all 10 vacant seats to be filled through a court order or legislative action.
“We have to promote faculty members, we have to give people tenure,” Stimson said. “When we hire people, we hire them in their contract with the express understanding that they’ll get tenure, and the only people that can give them tenure is the board. … None of us on this board are going to refuse to conduct our fiduciary duties and honor our obligations to the university.”
 The future

In Charlottesville, critics said the University of Virginia’s Board of Visitors has also recently convened short of the necessary number of representatives who are Virginia residents and alumni. Last Friday, campus workers and faculty members rallied in protest of the action as well as the institution continuing its search for the next president without a full board in place.
Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger recently told the Richmond Times-Dispatch that on her first day, she would fill the vacancies on three university governing boards at George Mason, UVA and the Virginia Military Institute. 
Simultaneously, eight gubernatorial appointments await a court’s decision on their future. The Senate Committee on Elections and Privileges rejected 22 appointees of Gov. Glenn Youngkin this year. 
Since the Virginia Supreme Court refused to take up the case involving Youngkin’s appointees, a status hearing has been scheduled for Dec. 8 at 9 a.m. in the Fairfax County Circuit Court.

The nonalcoholic beverage option has been growing nationwide as an alternative for people who are looking to cut back or cut out alcohol altogether. A recent Gallup poll showed the percentage of Americans drinking alcohol has fallen to 54%.  
Analysts and farmers say the hemp-based THC industry, however, could come to an abrupt halt by November of next year as Congress voted to ban most hemp-derived THC products in a last-minute addition to a government spending bill that ended the most recent government shutdown.
Joint Commission unveils changes to cannabis bill, setting stage for 2026 retail launch

The THC seltzers and other hemp-based products are a “big and growing segment of the economy,” Bingo Beer co-owner Jay Bayer told the Mercury earlier this year. 
“I don’t think the solution is to put the genie back in the bottle,” Bayer said in a recent call.  He added that offering THC products has been a “lifeline” for some in the alcoholic beverage industry to stay afloat while meeting consumers’ needs. 
But as Virginia continues to explore a legal cannabis market, Bayer is eyeing possible ways to  pivot. 
“If we were to switch over to THC from marijuana, consumers would come over with us,” he said. 
 Uncertain future

Hemp businesses nationwide are trying to map their next steps. In North Carolina, for example, hemp businesses are bracing for potential legal battles to defend their industry, like other states where cannabis isn’t legal.
“We can’t really pivot,” Dana Burham, co-owner of Otherside Hemp, told NC Newsline last month. 
But Virginia is in a “privileged” space, Pure Shenandoah co-owner Tanner Johnson said in a recent call. He runs the company with several of his siblings as their products run the gamut of industrial hemp uses, from a “hempcrete” study contract with the U.S. Air Force they were awarded in 2023, to being the supplier for Bingo Beer’s THC seltzers. 
While Congress laid the groundwork for businesses in the industry in 2018, Johnson likened the hemp-limited provision in the government spending bill as “pulling the rug” from under people. But companies like his own with diversified portfolios and Virginia businesses could have an easier time pivoting than those in states with no existing or forthcoming legal cannabis market. Still, he said, he’s keeping an eye on things nationally. 
As a representative of  the Virginia Cannabis Association, he will also lend insights and ideas to lawmakers as they craft and pass the legislation to enable the new market. 
“It’s a bad situation for a lot of hemp growers and processors and retailers,” Johnson said. “But in Virginia, we kind of feel like we’re almost threading a needle, where this industry is coming to a close right as another industry opens.”

Yates for the Virginia Mercury)In Southwest Virginia, two proposed pipeline projects would lengthen two existing pipelines and add additional compressor stations to help pump more gas through the commonwealth into North Carolina. Residents’ concerns over past violations and an expedited permitting process prompted Virginia Democratic U.S. Reps. Jennifer McClellan and Bobby Scott to demand federal regulators perform a more thorough review last week.
In a letter penned by the two members and North Carolina U.S. Rep. Valerie Foushee, the lawmakers urged the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to scrutinize the potential environmental impacts of the two projects.
“On behalf of communities in Virginia and North Carolina, we urge the Commission to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for both projects before considering them further. If FERC is unwilling to do so, we urge the Commission to deny the certification of both projects to ensure that the surrounding communities are not placed at undue risk,” the letter read.
The Mountain Valley Pipeline Southgate project would add 31 miles of pipeline from Pittsylvania County across the border to North Carolina. Concurrently, the Williams Company wants to expand the Transco pipeline by an additional 55 miles – 26 of which would be run adjacent to the pipeline in Southwest Virginia and create additional compressor stations in Pittsylvania County.
FERC did not require a new Environmental Impact Statement to be done for the new projects, which is a deeper examination of how the project may impact wetlands, pollute waterways and other possible environmental concerns. 
For the two separate expansion projects, FERC accepted the previous reports and said no risks to human health or the environment were expected with the expansions. The members of Congress took issue with that assessment and said the agency was straying from precedence of review for projects of this size.
“This massive project will have significant environmental impacts that demand a thorough review and a complete EIS,” the letter read. “Further, not conducting an EIS for SSEP would be a dramatic departure from past FERC policy and practice for projects of this magnitude. The Commission has consistently completed EISs for projects much smaller in size than SSEP.”
The members pointed to 375 alleged violations former Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring’s office in 2018 said MVP committed, including unpermitted discharges into waterways, failure to maintain erosion, and other water related issues. The company ultimately settled the issue by paying a $2.5 million civil fine. 
The letter also details local pushback to the two projects because they are so close to each other and raises residents’ concerns about the potential impact of two major pipelines nearby.
“The colocation of two high-pressure, large diameter pipelines is of significant concern for local residents. Multiple local governments and other elected officials have expressed concerns about the safety and health impacts of these proposed pipelines,” the letter said.
Twelve Democratic members of the General Assembly sent a letter to the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality and FERC asking the agencies to deny permits for the two expansion projects until cumulative impact research can be done for the area.
“We are specifically concerned about the co-location of two high-pressure pipelines on nearly identical routes through Pittsylvania County and the undue burden that would place on waterbodies crossed repeatedly by both projects, including the Banister River, Sandy River and tributaries of the Dan River,” the legislator’s letter said.
The federal permits for the two projects are expected to be issued or denied in the next few months. DEQ is also in the process of reviewing the state permits for both pipelines.

For […[...]","Red Onion State Prison in Wise County (Photo courtesy of Virginia Department of Corrections.) Over the past two years, the Virginia General Assembly approved legislation to limit the use of solitary confinement across prisons in the commonwealth. 
Legislation to this effect was passed in 2023, which was signed into law by Gov. Glenn Youngkin. Critics, however, argue that this new law lacks adequate enforcement mechanisms and protective limits. For this reason, the General Assembly passed follow-up legislation in 2024 with stronger language, which was subsequently vetoed.
The fact that the General Assembly passed legislation two years in a row to end the widespread use of solitary confinement indicates broad public support for the goal. The legislation, however, does not address the isolation of inmates in regional and city jails. As a research team of two students and a professor, we set out to determine how many people in local jails across Virginia are being held in conditions similar to solitary confinement.
Most sheriffs and jail superintendents will insist they do not use solitary confinement. We learned instead to substitute the phrase “administrative segregation,” which in most cases means the same thing: an inmate held for 20-24 hours a day in a cell about the size of a parking space, typically behind a heavy steel door with a tiny window and narrow slot that just fits a food tray. On a positive note, one jail administrator informed us that most of the administrative segregation at his facility instead has barred doors that easily allow for communication across cells, but we suspect this is the exception, rather than the rule.
Because data about the number of people held in administrative segregation is not publicly available, we sent information requests to 35 regional and city jails across Virginia asking for a “snapshot,” which would help us do a point-in-time count of the number of people held in solitary-like conditions at a local level. 
We only heard back from 11 jails, which makes our goal of producing a total population estimate unreachable. But we still learned something important: the use of isolated confinement is highly variable between jails. 
One city jail reported to us that it holds 69 out of a total 238 inmates (almost one in three persons detained in the facility) in administrative segregation behind heavy steel doors. Two jails housed more than one out of ten inmates in isolation. Others held between 4-7% of their population in solitary-like conditions. 
Importantly, three jails kept less than 3% of their inmates in administrative segregation. One regional jail in Central Virginia reported that only 1% of total inmates are held in isolation.
This variability indicates that some regional jails may be over-relying on solitary confinement to run their institutions. But, in order to encourage jails to share this information with us, we told them we would not name specific institutions in our reporting.
There is a robust literature in the social sciences on the harms associated with solitary confinement for periods longer than 14 days. We humans are innately social, maintaining our sense of self and frameworks for cognition in dialogue with others. 
Research shows that prolonged isolation can cause mental anguish and long-term psychological harm. Even short-term exposure to isolated confinement can result in a higher likelihood to reoffend and decreased rates of employment after release.
Several sheriffs and jail superintendents told us that administrative segregation is a necessary safety and disciplinary tool. Without it, they said, our local and regional jails would be more dangerous places for both inmates and jail staff. 
We are not experts in incarceration, and we do not dispute this point. But we also believe that, without protective laws and public oversight, there is the potential that administrative segregation could be used more than necessary, and that it would be a good goal for our society to use it as infrequently as possible.
Afterall, our preliminary research indicates at least a few jails in Virginia operate with minimal use of administrative segregation. This, to us, is very hopeful. Perhaps these jails could be models for other institutions across the state working to reduce the number of inmates held in isolation. 
At a minimum, we think all jails in Virginia should regularly report to the public on the number of persons held in administrative segregation. These institutions are funded by taxpayers, and taxpayers have a right to know about the conditions in which they operate, especially as they rely — even if out of necessity —  on methods of incarceration known to cause suffering and psychological harm.
We also hope the General Assembly will one day address the use of isolated confinement in city and regional jails. Currently, state code provides very minimal protections for inmates held in these local facilities.
For instance, inmates only have a right to a minimum of one hour out of their cell for recreation a week and for two weekly showers. These are only minimum standards. Local jails likely do much better, governed by their own rules and procedures. But operating standards for city and regional jails are typically not made public so we don’t know what, for instance, local policies are on the use of administrative segregation.
Sunlight, Supreme Court Justice William Brandies said, is the best disinfectant. With more sun shining into local and regional jails, we might bring more inmates out of the shadows of isolated confinement.

(Getty photo)Rhode Island’s primary care system is stressed, and the state struggles to recruit and retain new primary care physicians. To address the ongoing primary care shortage, a special legislative commission is exploring the feasibility of creating a new public medical school at the University of Rhode Island. Its report recommended that URI should develop a ‘community-based’ medical school with an emphasis on training primary care physicians. The new medical school would cost taxpayers $22.5 million annually after an initial public investment of $20 million in initial start-up funds, for a total of $245 million over the next decade. A new public medical school, however, is the wrong prescription to address the state’s ongoing shortage of primary care clinicians. Instead, policymakers need to enact broader and more comprehensive reforms to attract and retain clinicians in Rhode Island.
The closure of Anchor Medical highlights the need for fundamental reforms to improve the state’s ability to attract physicians. As Dr. Alexandra Tien has noted, the closure is the result of unsuccessful recruitment of new physicians to replace those who are retiring. This begs the question: Why is it so difficult to recruit and retain primary care physicians in Rhode Island? Wallet Hub ranked Rhode Island as the second-worst state in the nation for doctors to practice, citing low average annual wages (48th in the nation) and high malpractice award payments per capita (tied for first).
Physicians in Rhode Island earn less than their peers in Connecticut and Massachusetts. The General Assembly recently boosted primary care reimbursement for Medicaid by $40 million (including $15 million in state funding) but the NBC 10 I-Team found that commercial insurance reimbursement rates are 29% higher in nearby Massachusetts communities. The governor and General Assembly also asked the Office of the Health Insurance Commissioner to undertake a review of primary care reimbursement in 2026. Both are important steps toward improving the practice environment in Rhode Island.
The number of primary care residency openings in Rhode Island also shapes whether physicians will stay to practice in Rhode Island after completing their medical training. Upon graduating from medical school, newly minted MDs must complete a residency (and often a fellowship) before entering practice. Rather than increasing the number of medical school graduates, the U.S. needs to address a longstanding bottleneck in the number of residency positions. Between 2011 and 2017, fewer than half of the primary care doctors who completed their family medicine residency programs in Rhode Island remained in the state to practice, which underscores the difficulty of retaining physicians in the state.
The timing of the proposed medical school also occurs in a challenging fiscal environment. As the Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council noted, the Ocean State faces a growing structural budget deficit over the coming decade. Deficits are expected to increase from $304.3 million in fiscal year  2027 to more than $462.1 million by fiscal year 2030. In this context, opening a new publicly funded medical school at a cost of nearly $250 million will exacerbate an already difficult budgetary forecast.










Between 2011 and 2017, fewer than half of the primary care doctors who completed their family medicine residency programs in Rhode Island remained in the state to practice, which underscores the difficulty of retaining physicians in the state.


A recent report by the Milbank Memorial Fund and the Physicians’ Foundation noted that over time, fewer physicians are choosing careers in primary care. At the same time, roughly one in four Medicare patient visits were delivered by nurse practitioners or physician assistants. It’s time for policymakers to rethink the debate about primary care in Rhode Island. Instead of a narrow focus on the shortage of primary care physicians, we must seek to recruit, train, and retain enough primary care clinicians to live and work in Rhode Island.
Rather than investing $22.5 million per year in a new medical school, the state could provide additional scholarships and support for students attending existing nurse practitioner programs at Rhode Island College, Salve Regina University, and URI. Indeed, investing in nurse practitioners (NPs) offers a cost-effective approach to addressing the primary care shortfall in Rhode Island. 
It would take nine years before a new public medical school at the University of Rhode Island graduates its first cohort of students. Rhode Island simply can’t wait that long. Instead, the state should build upon recent initiatives to improve reimbursement for primary care clinicians and strengthen existing programs to train more nurse practitioners.

(Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)As New Hampshire’s education freedom account program swells past 10,000 student participants, legislative oversight has faltered.
A committee meant to monitor the EFA program’s performance has not met publicly in more than a year, records show, and it has failed to produce its required annual report by its Nov. 30 deadline.
The Education Freedom Savings Account Oversight Committee once met multiple times per year. But according to its public page, the last time it convened was Nov. 25, 2024, shortly before finalizing its 2024 report. 
In a statement Thursday, Sen. Ruth Ward, a Stoddard Republican and the chairwoman of the committee, said the five-person committee had attempted to meet this year but failed to find a time for all members to convene — particularly those from the House. 
“Since the end of the legislative session, we have made several attempts to schedule a meeting,” Ward said. “However, the House asked representatives to avoid travel during July and August, limiting available dates and now with the resignation of Representative (Glenn) Cordelli, we are waiting for a House replacement. 
“These factors have kept us from achieving a quorum and convening the committee,” she added, referring to the statutory requirement that the committee have three out of five members present in order to meet.
After receiving questions Thursday, Ward sent an email Friday calling on the committee to hold an organizational meeting Dec. 15, according to Rep. Peggy Balboni, a Rye Democrat and member of the committee.
But Democrats have criticized the lack of meetings and argue it highlights the need for more transparency. 
The education freedom account program allows families to access state education funds to use toward private and home-school expenses; families this year will receive an average of $4,911 per year.
In June, Gov. Kelly Ayotte signed legislation that removed the income limits for the program — previously set at 350% of the federal poverty level, or $112,525 for a family of four — but set a 10,000-student cap for its first year. Due to a series of exemptions to the cap, the program began the 2025-26 school year with 10,510 students, according to the Department of Education, nearly doubling last year’s 5,765.
Republicans, who created the program in 2021 as a mechanism to support school choice, say the increase demonstrates demand. They have argued the nonprofit organization that runs the program, the Children’s Scholarship Fund, already receives sufficient oversight from the Department of Education. 
But Democrats, who oppose the program and say the funding should go to public schools, counter the jump in participation calls for more scrutiny of who is receiving EFAs and how they are spent. 
The oversight committee is supposed to help do that, Democrats say. 
Warring reports
Created by statute, the committee consists of two members of the Senate and three members of the House, and is meant to “monitor the implementation of” the program, “including the impact of state education funding to local district schools.” It is also supposed to produce an annual report by Nov. 30 that makes any legislative recommendations.
From the beginning, the process has been fractured. Democratic and Republican committee members, disagreeing over the very existence of the program, put forward widely different concepts of acceptable practices.
In 2024, for instance, the committee produced a majority report written by Republicans and a minority report by Democrats. The Republican report gave a positive portrait. “In just four years, the Education Freedom Account program has proven itself both popular and successful,” it stated, calling it “one of the fastest start-up school choice programs in the nation.”
The majority report found that the EFA program had not reduced state funding to public schools, and pointed to legislation that has increased the per-pupil amount of state funding given to public schools despite declining enrollments. “Even as the Education Freedom Account program has grown to serve more than 5,000 New Hampshire families, per-pupil state aid to local school districts has increased by nearly 20%,” the report stated, referring to the period between 2020 and 2024. 
The Republican report concluded there was no need to amend the EFA law, nor to extend the end date “phase out” grants that pay school districts gradually smaller amounts for any of their students who leave to receive an EFA.
The Democrats’ 2024 minority report produced different conclusions. It stated that much of the EFA money is going to families that had already decided not to participate in the public school system and pursue private and home-school programs. “Those families were costing the state zero dollars and now they are being given unaudited dollars,” the minority report read. The report also argued that the process by which the Children’s Scholarship Fund selects eligible vendors that may receive the EFA funds was opaque. 
The 2024 minority report said there were “substantial” funds being diverted from the state’s Education Trust Fund that could be used to boost state support for public schools, which the state Supreme Court ruled this year is unconstitutionally low. And it concluded that the EFA law should be changed by putting the Department of Education in charge of running the program instead of the private scholarship fund; capping the program to a budgeted amount; widening state audits to survey 20% of accounts; decoupling the EFA grant amounts from the state adequacy formula, which regulates how much is sent to public schools; requiring EFA recipients to end any discriminatory admissions policies, and more. 
Before issuing the separate reports, the oversight committee had met about once a month from August to November 2024. After that, the committee stopped meeting.
Scheduling problems
In her statement explaining the lack of meetings this year, Ward pointed to an announcement by House Speaker Sherman Packard in the House calendar in spring that “in keeping with past practice to minimize travel costs, there will be no legislative activity or mileage reimbursement between July and August.” 
She also noted the resignation of Cordelli, a member of the oversight committee and a key architect of the EFA program. But Cordelli resigned in early November, meaning he could have participated in September and October. 
The committee page indicates that an organizational meeting was scheduled for Oct. 21, but was canceled. 
Ward said the committee had struggled to meet quorum, which according to the statute, requires three out of five members to be present. Sen. Suzanne Prentiss, a Lebanon Democrat and member of the committee, has questioned that reasoning, arguing the committee has met before when some lawmakers couldn’t attend. 
“I don’t know what’s behind not meeting, but it’s not the membership thing,” she said. 
Meanwhile, the status of the 2025 oversight report, which was due Nov. 30, is unclear. In her statement Thursday, Ward said “work is underway on the 2025 EFA Annual Report.”
Kate Baker Demers, the executive director of the Children’s Scholarship Fund, said in an interview that she had received an email from Senate Deputy Chief of Staff Grant Bosse in November asking for statistics on the demographics of who is using EFAs in the 2025-26 school year. The Department of Education released those figures Nov. 14. 
That email indicated to Baker Demers that the committee was intending to produce the 2025 report despite the lack of meetings, she said.  
But Democrats say if work is happening, they have not been included. Prentiss said there has been no committee-wide discussion about any work on the 2025 report.
A spokeswoman for Ward did not respond to a question about whether the EFA report was being prepared without the committee meeting.
Transparency debates
Democrats’ frustration with the oversight committee comes amid a bigger battle over transparency of the program. Democrats argue there should be more public information issued around who is signing up for EFAs and how families are spending the money. 
Currently, the public can review annual reports by the Department of Education that show how many students in each town are receiving EFAs; how much those students are receiving; how many students overall have transferred into EFAs from public schools; how many EFA recipients have been approved for additional aid because they are lower-income, are English language learners, or require special education services; the racial and gender breakdown of EFA recipients; the number of EFA recipients in each grade level; and how all those metrics compare to the public school student population. 
The Children’s Scholarship Fund submits an annual 990 form to the Internal Revenue Service as a nonprofit organization, which details top-level receipts and expenditures. The organization also commissions an annual audit of its receipts and expenditures by Grant Thornton, a New York-based accounting firm, and publishes the results; the latest 2025 audit will be published Monday, Baker Demers said.
The EFA program receives a semi-regular audit from the state Department of Education. In 2023, the department’s EFA administrator conducted a “compliance monitoring review” of 50 randomized EFA accounts, using tax return information to determine whether they had actually been eligible for the program. That review, released in 2024, flagged problems with 12 of the 50 recipients, and resulted in the Children’s Scholarship Fund returning EFA funding for two students and addressing other recommendations.
Baker Demers said that in recent months, the department has begun a second compliance monitoring review of EFAs using the same randomized process; a spokeswoman for the department declined to confirm that.
Meanwhile, the Legislative Budget Assistant, or LBA, a nonpartisan arm of the legislative branch that conducts audits on state agencies, is reviewing the Department of Education’s oversight of the EFA law; that final audit report is expected by summer 2026, LBA staff say. 
Baker Demers says the combination of those reviews indicates that the EFA program is already subject to a lot of scrutiny.
“I don’t mind it,” she said. “It’s good – great to do audits. But it’s like a perpetual audit.” 
But Democrats say there are still many areas where they would like more information. 
They note that LBA auditors were blocked by statute from reviewing the Children’s Scholarship Fund actions directly, meaning the LBA audit will focus only on the Department of Education’s oversight of the program, and not on the approval process of EFA applicants and vendors conducted by the scholarship fund.
And they have also pointed to a decision by Baker Demers this summer to remove reports detailing how much EFA money was sent to each vendor, a move first reported by the Concord Monitor. Baker Demers told the Monitor she had done so due to the potential for harassment of smaller vendors by people opposed to the EFA program. 
On Thursday, she said the Children’s Scholarship Fund would re-upload the expenditure reports for the 2021-22 and 2022-23 school years — as well as the unreleased reports for the 2023-24 and 2024-25 school years — by the end of December. Those reports would redact spending data for EFA vendors serving fewer than 10 students, Baker Demers said, citing privacy and harassment concerns.
To Balboni, those measures still fall short of the accountability she feels the EFA program deserves. Next year, she is introducing two bills intended to address that. One would require the legislative oversight committee to conduct a “review of student data, eligibility requirements, and EFA expenditures.” The other would require the Department of Education to obtain full access to EFA recipient data and to conduct more extensive audits. 
“It’s just trying to get to the heart of where this money is going,” Balboni said in an interview. 
To Ward, there is already plenty of information to review. “The process continues to be transparent: reports from the Children’s Scholarship Fund, EFA meeting minutes, and annual reports are publicly accessible,” she said in her statement.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/PB122675-EFA-oversight-committee-1024x694.jpg,,,2025-12-08 05:57:09.289201

Clarke, an ICU nurse in Asheville, North Carolina, wants to get her master’s degree to become a nurse practitioner or a certified registered nurse anesthetist — occupations in high demand — and eventually work toward a doctoral degree.
But new borrowing limits on federal student loans may hinder her from reaching that goal.
A provision in the federal One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the tax and spending law enacted this summer, overhauls the federal student loan program for graduate students in an effort to simplify the loan process and discourage colleges from raising tuition.
To comply with the new law, the U.S. Department of Education recently issued a draft rule that would impose limits on how much graduate students can borrow — up to $20,500 per year and $100,000 in total for most students, but up to $50,000 a year and $200,000 in total for students in a new “professional” category. The category includes people studying to be medical doctors, dentists, veterinarians, pharmacists and lawyers.
Students pursuing advanced nursing degrees, however, are not included in the professional category.
Advanced practice nurses, hospital associations and other health groups say the rule will make it unaffordable for many nurses to advance their careers — disproportionately affecting communities, especially rural ones, that rely on them amid physician shortages.
Advanced nurses can provide primary care, deliver babies as nurse midwives and anesthetize surgery patients where there aren’t enough physicians to go around. They can also write some prescriptions. Advanced practice nurses also serve as college faculty in community colleges and nursing schools.
Student loan caps might worsen the national doctor shortage, critics worry

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates the nation will employ an additional 134,000 nurse practitioners, nurse midwives and nurse anesthetists in the next decade, 35% more than there are now. In high demand, nurse practitioners are one of the fastest-growing occupations in the nation, the bureau says.
“We depend heavily on nurse practitioners,” said Sandy Reding, a president of the California Nurses Association and vice president of National Nurses United. “But if they don’t have access to getting further education, we’re not going to see additional nurse practitioners come into the field.”
Tuition, combined with living expenses, can far exceed $50,000 a year for many post-bachelor’s nursing programs.
“Potentially, this could devastate a whole generation of nurses getting their advanced practice degrees,” Clarke said.
Some education advocates fear that losing a pipeline of advanced nursing practitioners to serve as college faculty also could lead to fewer registered and advanced nurses and other caregivers with two- and four-year degrees, because there would be fewer people to teach them.










It’s a slap in the face to the nurses that go to work every day doing our very best to care for our patients. 


– Sandy Reding, a president of the California Nurses Association


Many advanced-degree nursing faculty are retiring. Nursing schools reported more than 2,100 full-time faculty vacancies in 2022, according to the American Nurses Association — leading to roughly 80,000 students being turned away.
States are already grappling with workforce shortfalls caused by exhausting work conditions that have led many nurses to burn out and leave the field, or leave bedside care to teach, nurses told Stateline.
In response to an uproar from nursing associations and others in health care, the Department of Education released a rebuttal last week defending its proposal, saying it is not a “value judgement about the importance of programs.”
It also said it may make changes in response to public comments. The new limits would take effect July 1, 2026.
Rural and underserved communities
Advanced practice registered nurses, known as APRNs, fill gaps in rural communities where there aren’t enough clinicians. For example, nurses needed for surgeries — nurse anesthetists, or CRNAs — make up 80% of anesthesia providers in rural counties. About a fifth of APRNs nationwide worked in rural areas in 2022, according to one survey of more than 18,800 APRNs.
“The nurse practitioners, APRNs, are a needed lifeline to help fill those gaps,” said Heidi Lucas, executive director of the Missouri Rural Health Association and former director of the state’s nurses association. “Putting barriers in the way to keep [nurses] from getting degrees — that’s just going to exacerbate the problems that we already have.”
She said Missouri will be short about 2,000 physicians next year.
The new rule cutting options for federal student loans would only worsen staffing shortages amid tenuous rural hospital budgets, said state-level observers. Hospitals already are grappling with millions of dollars in looming Medicaid cuts over the next 10 years, said Rich Rasmussen, president of the Oklahoma Hospital Association.
Nurse practitioners often serve as primary care providers, writing prescriptions and managing patient care. About 80% of them see Medicaid and Medicare patients, according to the American Association of Nurse Practitioners, citing federal data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
States hope to use rural health money to keep doctors, combat chronic disease

The proposal to deny advanced practice nurse practitioners the more generous loan options ignores the nation’s needs, said nurse practitioner Valerie Fuller, president of the association.
“At a time when America needs more health care providers, we can’t afford to put more obstacles in place for nurse practitioner students who want to go on and further their education and take care of the patients that need care,” said Fuller, former president of the Maine Nurse Practitioner Association. “We know it’s going to harm our workforce.”
‘Clipping the wings’
Rasmussen, of the Oklahoma Hospital Association, said he is concerned about the effect the rule will have on the pipeline for certified nurse midwives and the state’s already dwindling rural maternal health care options.
“We are clipping the wings of rural [obstetrics] to be able to blossom in our state if we’re going to put these types of restrictions on the borrowing capability of nurses who want to pursue obstetrical services in nursing as well,” he said. He added that the rules will force nurses to seek private sector loans — which don’t qualify for federal loan forgiveness programs that encourage clinicians to come work in rural areas.
Teshieka Curtis-Pugh, executive director of the South Carolina Nurses Association, is also concerned about nurse midwives. South Carolina is expected to see a shortage of 3,200 physicians by 2030.
“We also live in a state that has very poor maternal outcomes, especially for women of color. So think about, how does that impact them?” she said. “That means we don’t get the certified nurse midwives who are masters prepared, some of them are doctorally prepared, who are able to fill that gap for birth in that area.”
Diversity and opportunity for students from marginalized groups could also take a hit, said Curtis-Pugh, a registered nurse with a master’s of science in nursing. And for those going back to school while juggling parenting, federal loan dollars can help beyond tuition, she noted.
“They help that mom be able to supplement child care for their child, so that they can have child care while they go to school,” she said. “There’s tuition, there’s books, there’s keeping the lights on. They’re feeding the family they’re getting to and from.”
The exclusion from the higher, “professional” category of student loan options is especially galling after nurses’ work during the COVID-19 pandemic, said Reding, of National Nurses United.
“We were all heroes in 2020. Now, what are we?” Reding asked. “It’s a slap in the face to the nurses that go to work every day doing our very best to care for our patients, even under very adverse conditions and even facing deadly viruses.”

Clarke, the registered nurse considering a post-bachelor’s degree, said nurses’ pandemic-era devotion influenced her own career path.
“When I saw the nurses and the health care workers really working hard for their communities and sacrificing a lot, I was really inspired by that,” Clarke said. “And that’s why I went to school.”

LifeWise is operating in more than 260 of the state’s 607 districts. It plans to be in about 300 school districts across the state by the end of the school year. 
In January, LifeWise was in about 160 Ohio school districts, making its growth this year a 62.5% increase.

This growth comes as Ohio school districts are now required to have a religious release time policy, which has helped pave the way for an expansion of LifeWise Academy. 
The new law took effect in April. Previously, the law merely permitted a religious release time policy. 
“The new release time religious education law in Ohio clarifies the rights for schools and parents to offer release time programs like LifeWise making the path to implementing these programs more straightforward for many districts,” LifeWise said in a statement to the Ohio Capital Journal. 
LifeWise is in 31 states and is approved to launch in six more states by the end of 2026. The nonprofit hopes to reach 100,000 students nationally in 2026. 
While critics of LifeWise are not surprised by the growth because of the new Ohio law, they have concerns. 
According to Education Week, at least 12 states require school districts to offer religious release time upon a parent’s request: Florida, Hawaii, Iowa, Kentucky, Montana, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Vermont, and Wisconsin.
“It doesn’t seem like people are necessarily interested when you have to go change the laws because schools are telling you no and you’re taking that option away from them,” said Zach Parrish, a parent who had LifeWise file a lawsuit against him. “Of course, you’re going to grow.”  
Parrish now lives in Indiana, but his daughter was a student in Defiance City Schools in Northwest Ohio and she was bullied and ostracized for not attending LifeWise.
The United States Supreme Court upheld release time laws during the 1952 Zorach v. Clauson case, which allowed a school district to have students leave school for part of the day to receive religious instruction.
Religious release time instruction must meet three criteria: the courses must take place off school property, be privately funded, and students must have parental permission.
Northeast Ohio
LifeWise started a program at Vermilion Schools in Northeast Ohio this fall after the school district originally said no to LifeWise back in 2023, said Kitty Schwanitz, an organizer for the Secular Education Association.  
“If religion needs to be such a big part of their life, I think that they should take their kid to church, to Sunday school,” Schwanitz said. “I just think that local, organic religious instruction on parents time is best.”
The program in Vermilion currently only has three elementary students in it, she said. 
“It can’t be sustainable when you’re running numbers that low,” Parrish said. 
Schwanitz said some parents don’t know what they are getting into when they agree to let their children go to LifeWise. 
“A lot of (parents) aren’t looking at the fine print of what they’re signing up for,” she said. “And when they do they realize what their kids are being taught, and then they have to pull their kids, their kids are crying, and then they’re getting bullied. … It breaks my heart every time I read a story about another kid who is being bullied.” 
Schwanitz said her high school twins are not religious. 
“I really wanted my children to be raised without any pressure from any kind of religious organization at all,” she said. “A group like LifeWise would absolutely want to target my kids.”
Casey Bellis used to attend St. Mary Catholic Church in Vermilion, but was told by the pastor she was no longer welcome there after she started questioning why the pastor supported LifeWise. Now, she attends St. Peter Catholic Church in Huron. 
“Our pastor there is very much against (LifeWise),” Bellis said. 
St. Peter’s Pastor Rev. J. Douglas Garand wrote a letter to the parish in 2024 saying the church does not support LifeWise. 
“Let the local churches educate the member children of their communities of faith, in the ways of faith,” he wrote in the letter. 
Northwest Ohio
Matt Hollar’s daughters used to attend LifeWise at a Northwest Ohio school district.
“My older daughter — she was probably eight at the time, maybe nine — came home reciting Old Testament scripture, not understanding the ‘strict’ meaning, and certainly not capable at that age of interpreting a deeper meaning” Hollar said.
His daughter also told him she learned at LifeWise that the 2022 Pixar movie “Turning Red” was “against God’s teachings and should not be watched because it was focused on worshiping false idols.” 
“I didn’t agree and also thought it suggested that they were teaching my children at a very young age to question their own beliefs, and those I was trying to instill,” he said. 
“LifeWise makes it very clear in their own material that if the parents’ belief systems differ from LifeWise, the students are to assume that LifeWise is right and their parents, and anyone else, are wrong.”

(Photo by Graham Stokes for Ohio Capital Journal. Republish photo only with original article.)Lawyers with a reproductive rights initiative are asking the Ohio Supreme Court to intervene in a dispute against the Ohio Department of Health, in which they say the agency is withholding records related to the licensure of a clinic providing abortions.
Members of the Reproductive Rights Law Initiative at Case Western Reserve University joined with the ACLU of Ohio in a lawsuit filed Dec. 3 with the state’s highest court.
The groups said the department of health should be required to release public records related to the Toledo Women’s Center, after the agency “unreasonably delayed … granting their Jan. 2025 application to provide procedural abortions in addition to medication abortions,” the groups said in a press release.
“Transparency between citizens and government institutions remains a cornerstone of our democratic processes,” said Katie Corwin, legal fellow with the initiative. “Without it, we run the risk of losing trust and accountability.”
The center is regulated by the Ohio Department of Health as an ambulatory surgical facility.
According to the department’s database, a license for the center was issued June 24 of this year, and expires in June of 2026.
The center’s website notes a new service added, surgical abortions from five weeks to 17 weeks gestation.
The facility provides medication abortions up to 12 weeks, according to the center.

Corwin is listed as the plaintiff in the new complaint, in which she tells the court about nine public records request made starting in May of this year, asking for any emails and communications “sent or received that mention or refer to the Toledo Women’s Center” starting at the beginning of 2025.
The requests were made to the department’s chief of health care compliance, the bureau chief for the agency, and its bureau of regulatory operations, according to court documents.
She claims the Ohio Department of Health responded in June to the requests with “groundless objections” that the requests were “overly broad,” that Corwin requested “information rather than specific records” and that records were protected under attorney-client privilege.
One such rejection letter, dated June 5, said the request “does not identify specific records being sought with reasonable clarity and is too voluminous, vague, or indefinite to be properly acted on.”
“All of (the agency’s) objections are legally untenable,” Corwin said in her official complaint to the Ohio Supreme Court.
She asked the court to order that the agency provide her the records under Ohio’s Public Records Act.
Following the June denial, the attorney asked to meet with the department’s legal counsel, and submitted three “updated” requests.
In July, records were released to Corwin by the department from a previous records request, and the meeting was cancelled.
That same month, the Ohio Department of Health reiterated their objections to certain records requests, but legal counsel provided several email records “in the interest of transparency,” records that the legal counsel said the department “was able to identify based on the current wording of your request,” according to court documents.
After further back and forth between the agency, Corwin and another attorney from the initiative, the department’s legal counsel “declined to produce further emails … stating only that in ODH’s view (the requests) were ‘legally insufficient.'”
Corwin told the state supreme court that the Ohio Department of Health “has a clear legal duty” to provide the records under the public records law, and because the Toledo Women’s Center is regulated and licensed by the department.
Because of that oversight duty, the requests relate to the department of health’s “‘functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of the office’ and are therefore unquestionably public records.”
The Ohio Department of Health has 21 days to file a response to the complaint before the supreme court decides whether to take up the case.
If taken up by the court, the case would likely move into 2026 before further developments.
The last oral arguments of the year are scheduled for Dec. 9 and Dec. 10, and the court already has arguments scheduled through Jan. 8.

(Photo by Nick Evans, Ohio Capital Journal.)Survivors of sexual abuse at the hands of a former Ohio State University doctor protested outside the school’s Board of Trustees meeting this past Thursday.
The university has already settled cases with nearly 300 survivors of Dr. Richard Strauss to the tune of $60 million. But hundreds more survivors have so far refused to settle.
In August, the federal judge overseeing the five remaining lawsuits sent the dispute to mediation.
“It has become obvious,” Judge Michael Watson wrote, “that any litigation victory for plaintiffs may be pyrrhic.”
“The best way for plaintiffs to close this horrific chapter of their lives, and for Ohio State to move forward as a respectable institution of higher education,” he continued, “is through a mutual resolution short of trial.”
Survivors have deposed several prominent public figures in relation to the case, including Republican U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan — an assistant wrestling coach at Ohio State during Strauss’ tenure, former athletic director Andy Geiger and two-time Heisman trophy winner Archie Griffin, who served as assistant athletic director.
In new documentary, former Ohio State wrestlers say U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan knew about Strauss abuse

But they’ve so far been unable to depose Les Wexner, the former L Brands CEO, Jeffrey Epstein confidante and perhaps Ohio State’s greatest benefactor.
Wexner’s first term on the board of trustees overlapped with Strauss’ tenure and he was chairman of the board in 1996 when disciplinary proceedings against the doctor saw him barred from treating patients in the athletics department and student health services.
The doctor remained a tenured faculty member until 1998, though, and he quickly set up a private off-campus clinic where he continued to sexually abuse patients.
When he retired, Strauss was granted emeritus status.

Survivors’ protest
Outside the trustees meeting, survivors like Stephen Snyder-Hill waved signs reading “Where’s Wexner.”
Board chairman, John Zeiger, used to be Wexner’s attorney. His son and law partner Matthew Zeiger now represents Wexner.
“I think our biggest beef right now is that there’s a lot of really gross internal conflicts, in our opinion,” Snyder-Hill said.
“Because Zeiger, his kid, represents Wexner, who’s on our list to be subpoenaed, and his kid is not letting him take a subpoena, so they’re just evading the law, and he sits in there on the board.”
Thursday’s meeting was the first they’ve attended since OSU President Ted Carter assumed his office.
But Snyder-Hill didn’t sound optimistic about his impact on court-ordered mediation. He pointed to Carter’s comments to The Lantern early this year about a different lawsuit.
The school was forced to move hundreds of students after finding mold in a residential tower. But when he was asked about a lawsuit tied to the incident, Carter said “most people are going to find we don’t settle.”
Adding to survivors’ frustration is the recent hire of E. Gordon Gee. The former OSU president led the school at the time of disciplinary actions against Strauss, and the doctor twice appealed to Gee directly in hopes of having his privileges to see students on-campus reinstated.
Gee’s administration didn’t let Strauss back, but neither did it pursue the matter further.
Tom Lisy speaking to reporters. (Photo by Nick Evans, Ohio Capital Journal.)
When attorneys working on OSU’s internal investigation spoke to Gee, he couldn’t recall the correspondence from Strauss. But Gee said his staffers “would have briefed him on Strauss’ situation at the time, and that he ‘would have directed them to handle it.’”
“And then Ted Carter calls him his ‘wing man?’” Snyder-Hill said in disbelief. “I’m like, that’s a poor choice of words right now, especially if he had any knowledge of this back then, and he did.”
Tom Lisy graduated from Ohio State in 1991. As a freshman on the wrestling team, he explained, Strauss assaulted him on two occasions. Like Snyder-Hill, he isn’t expecting mediation to reach an agreement that leaves both sides feeling whole.
“I don’t think it’s possible for us to feel whole,” he said. “I mean, based on what we’ve been through as students, and based on now what we’ve been through as alumni.”
“On the front side, they had a chance to try to mend fences, in a sense, and that time has passed.” Lisy added.
He sees the university’s obstinance as a misguided exercise in brand protection. The school pursued a bid to dismiss cases under the statute limitations all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. But after the justices declined to hear Ohio State’s appeal the cases were able to go forward.
That pyrrhic victory Judge Watson talked about? That’s on school leaders, Lisy said.
“They’ve already done damage the university. They’ve done damage to the student body. They’ve done damage to the image,” he said. “When they first found out about Strauss, that was the time to do something, and they didn’t do it.”

The meeting
After an hour outside in the cold, the demonstrators filed inside to the meeting — grumbling somewhat at school officials asking them to remove their signs’ wooden handles.
They stood in the back quietly holding their signs while President Carter read his report and the board moved through its agenda. There were no outbursts and the whole thing was over in less than half an hour.
Any hopes of speaking directly to President Carter were disappointed. He left through a back door. Board chair John Zeiger declined to speak to the press.
In a written statement, university spokesman Ben Johnson noted the school has already settled with more than half of those who have come forward with claims.
“All male students who filed lawsuits have been offered the opportunity to settle,” he wrote. “In addition, the university continues to cover the cost of professionally certified counseling services and other medical treatment, including reimbursement for counseling and treatment received in the past.”
“Ohio State led the effort to investigate and expose Richard Strauss, and we express our deep regret and apologies to all who experienced Strauss’ abuse,” Johnson added.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)The Kansas Republican Party has pickled itself in a brackish brine of racism, homophobia and intolerance.
Officials can dissemble all they want, but the party can’t hope to represent everyday Kansans while tasting so sour. Poorly canned pickles can give you botulism, remember.
This distasteful metaphor suggested itself as the party staggered from embarrassment to embarrassment in recent months. You’ll recall the racist and white supremacist texts shared by young Republicans. GOP officials condemned the rhetoric. But on Nov. 28, the state party’s social media accounts posted a screed against democratic Gov. Laura Kelly from Ellis County GOP chairman Adam Peters.
Kansas Reflector readers might remember him as a central figure in our 2023 Church and State series. In recordings obtained by Kansas Reflector, Peters called for turning Kansas into a conservative sanctuary.
“If you can make it hostile to that group of people, that small sliver of society, and have them move elsewhere, that does a huge amount to shut this down,” he said of liberal Kansans.
While decrying “Antifa tactics,” Peters also told his audience: “We need to use the tools that are at our disposal. You know, if we look in scripture, there was a time when the nation of Israel had to take up arms in defense of themselves.”
He offered an offensive jumble of takes about race, suggesting all humans shared a common ancestry while saying “the main reason why Black suspects are disproportionately killed by the police is they disproportionately tried to kill the police.” He hinted that pastors who supported LGBTQ+ people had signed contracts with Satan.
The Ellis County party tried to deny that Peters had made such statements. But they were recorded for all to hear and judge.
No sane party seeking to appeal to mainstream voters would elevate someone like Peters. His apparent beliefs, as reported more than two years ago, should raise alarm bells for anyone. On the other hand, he said mean things about Kelly, so perhaps all was forgiven.
I reached out to state Republican Party Chairwoman Danedri Herbert for comment Friday evening. She didn’t respond by press time.
Meanwhile, one of the young Republicans at the center of the texting scandal made an unwelcome return to public view. The New York Times, of all outlets, elevated William Hendrix in a bewildering profile from Sabrina Tavernise and Georgia Gee. The organization’s former vice chairman used the words “n–ga” and “n–guh” and noted that “Missouri doesn’t like f–s.” I’m not sure why the Times decided to broadcast Hendrix’s self justifications across the nation. A slow news day, perhaps?
Hendrix, apparently unlike those of us who don’t text racist epithets to one another, just wants to support his family and live his life. The rest of us don’t have the opportunity to have our profiles boosted by the nation’s newspaper of record.
Regardless of my quibbles, state GOP leaders promptly exiled Hendrix and dissolved the Young Republicans after Politico exposed texts. They destroyed his future in the party. Yet just a few weeks later, they elevated Peters, whose comments were made at a public forum and shared throughout the state.
I’ve written this before and I’ll write it again: The Kansas Republican Party cannot have it both ways. It cannot claim to despise discrimination while tolerating a host of hatreds within its ranks.
Don’t believe me? Try Republican condemnation of supposedly homophobic remarks directed toward Rep. Kyler Sweely, R-Hutchison. Its detestation of homophobia lasts until the point when lawmakers are asked to support gay children. The Kansas GOP also opposes racism, until a Black Democrat calls out double standards on the House floor and gets hauled into a disciplinary hearing.
Not all Republicans behave this way or believe these things. That’s what makes it bad.
When I lived for more than a decade in New Hampshire, I knew prominent Republicans. They believed in racial equality. They supported gay rights. They supported fiscal discipline, personal moderation and loathing of income taxes. They would have unhesitatingly purged their beloved party of the kind of vile nihilism you see in Kansas.
I might not have agreed with New Hampshire Republicans’ ideology. But their lack of overt hate sure made them more appealing. I suspect swing voters liked them, too.
The First Amendment still applies, of course. Anyone should feel free to believe anything they want as long as it does not involve physically harming or threatening others. Political parties have the same freedom. However, every one of us has the choice to coddle or confront. If members of your coalition hold offensive and destructive beliefs, you can make it clear they’re not welcome. Republicans can survive and thrive without white supremacists, homophobes and Groypers.
 If the Republican brand has truly been pickled beyond palatability, voters can make their own choice. Pick a fresh cucumber and start again.

(Photo by Denis Smith)Bob Dylan got it right years ago. “You don’t need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows,” the folk music icon opined, particularly when it comes to detecting the views of Ohio school board members.
Indeed, there wasn’t a meteorologist in sight when more than 6,500 school board members, superintendents, and district treasurers gathered at the Columbus Convention Center for the annual Capital Conference of the Ohio School Boards Association.  
According to reports, attendees represented 89% of the state’s 607 school districts and provide a good sample to gauge the level of current thinking among school boards and their administrative leadership about the major issues facing public education.
Ready for a surprise? 
The top issue facing Ohio schools isn’t a shortage of bus drivers, scarce substitute teachers, or funding for aging school buses. 
It’s the expanded universal private school voucher program that is devastating the long-range viability of public education and diverting more than $1 billion annually from the state treasury to support private and religious schools.
That concern about dwindling state support for public education came through loud and clear from school board members who stopped by the Ohio Coalition for Equity & Adequacy of School Funding and Vouchers Hurt Ohio exhibit booth to offer their concerns about the expansion of vouchers and the harm they inflict on public schools. 
As a volunteer at the conference for the last fourteen years, there is no question that the response from board members I spoke with last week about the Ohio legislature’s continued bad behavior directed at public education was the strongest during this time period. 
A few examples:
“I’m a lifelong Republican,” a school board member from Southwest Ohio told me, “but the harm being done to public education by the legislature has to stop.” 
He spoke to me as we stood in front of an easel that displayed the heart of the lawsuit against educational vouchers and the legislature’s unconstitutional support for religious schools.
Another board member, also from Southwest Ohio, stopped by the Ohio E&A/Vouchers Hurt Ohio exhibit booth to express her strong feelings about the voucher expansion and its support of religious schools. 
As a board member, she related, “I’ve personally supported Catholic schools over the years, but vouchers are wrong and are harming public education.”
That board member’s words reflect the general mood of the attendees who represent a cross-section of Ohioans from rural, urban, and suburban areas. 
This year, they are more forthcoming on how they feel about vouchers. 
Here’s why.
Display seen at Ohio School Board Association Conference. (Photo by Denis Smith)
On June 24, Franklin County Common Pleas Judge Jaiza Page ruled in a 47-page decision that educational vouchers are violative of the state constitution because they create multiple school systems rather than a common system open to all children, fail to adequately fund a thorough and efficient system, and transfer public funds to religious schools in violation of Article VI, Section 2. 
The plaintiffs had argued that more than 90% of the private schools in the state are religious institutions, thus a clear constitutional violation.
The ruling supported the plaintiffs on three of the five counts in the lawsuit. 
Judge Page’s decision was appealed by the State Defendants and will be considered by the 10th District Court of Appeals. 
Ultimately, the case will be decided by the Ohio Supreme Court.
An added incentive driving more districts to join the lawsuit was the inaction of the legislature to address the Cupp-Patterson funding plan that was introduced into the state budget in 2022.  
William Phillis, a former deputy state superintendent of schools and executive director of the Ohio Coalition for Equity & Adequacy of School Funding, weighed in on the legislature’s neglect of duty in maintaining the constitution’s requirement to guarantee “a thorough and efficient system of common schools.”
“There were high hopes that the Cupp-Patterson plan would be fully phased in for FY2026 and beyond, but the legislature scuttled the plan and punished school districts in a plethora of ways. Meanwhile, the trial court judge ruled EdChoice vouchers unconstitutional. The court decision and the legislature’s failure to adopt a completely phased-in Cupp-Patterson plan turned many school district leaders toward the EdChoice voucher litigation. So interest in the litigation was at a higher level among school district leadership personnel than in previous years.”
Phillis has led the fight for adequate school funding since the landmark 1997 DeRolph v Ohio decision, where the state Supreme Court found that reliance on local property taxes to fund schools created inherently unequal educational outcomes because of the varying level of assessed value among local school districts. 
His role during the last quarter-century as a watchdog on the legislature to ensure that schools are properly funded has made him an eminent figure who inspired the formation of other groups to assist him in supporting public education.
Shortly after the conclusion of the OSBA conference, I spoke with Jeanne Melvin, President of Public Education Partners (Disclosure: I am also a PEP member) who, like me, also volunteered in the exhibit booth. She also saw a decided change in mood among board members, particularly those from rural districts, where their constituents don’t have private schools to choose from but see larger school districts that have nearby private and religious schools benefiting from this decided imbalance.
“I have had the opportunity to speak with school board members, superintendents, and school treasurers in the Vouchers Hurt Ohio booth at the Ohio School Boards Conference for a few years,” Melvin stated. 
“In the past, I was disappointed at the number of education leaders that told me school vouchers were here to stay, and there was absolutely nothing they could do about it.” 
That was then. But things have changed among board members and school leaders. 
Melvin has also seen a change in the prevailing wind direction.
“Ever since the judge ruled in June that Ohio’s EdChoice voucher program is unconstitutional, opinion has changed. School district leaders and residents finally realize that the voucher agenda was created by a legislature that seeks to privatize our system of public schools, and they are angry. The success of pro-public education board candidates and school levies this election cycle has ignited a passion to fight back.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Indeed, school boards are fighting back, and with the recent election that saw a number of school board candidates defeat conservatives who were otherwise acquiescent on the voucher imbroglio, even more districts are expected to join the anti-voucher lawsuit.
“Parents are concerned about the long-term effects of district tax money being funneled to unaccountable private schools,” Jeanne Melvin think. “ Taxpayers are speaking up and demanding that their local public schools be protected.”
As the Voucher Hurt Ohio banner at the OSBA Capital Conference proclaimed, “We are winning!”
Those who support their community’s schools, the bedrock of so many zipcodes on the map, would agree. 
Let’s hope that the Supreme Court will stand in support of defending the Ohio Constitution and its clear language in affirming that “no religious or other sect, or sects, shall ever have any exclusive right to, or control of, any parts of the school funds of this State.”
If the Supremes have trouble with comprehending these unambiguous words, they need to be enrolled in a Science of Reading class. 
The question about whether the universal voucher program is constitutional or not means that the Supreme Court must rise above politics and apply the law as it is clearly spelled out in Article VI, Sec. 2 of the Ohio Constitution.

WILMINGTON —  It’s time for the Governor’s  Volunteer Service Awards as we enters the holiday season. State leaders are urging residents to take a moment to recognize the thousands of volunteers whose time, talent and compassion fuel community programs year-round — from food banks and senior centers to youth sports, arts organizations, environmental groups and neighborhood nonprofits.
That spirit of service is at the heart of the 2026 Delaware Governor’s Volunteer Service Awards, with nominations now open through January 10, 2026. The awards, now in their 44th year, honor individuals and groups whose work strengthens communities across all three counties.
“Every day in Delaware, volunteers step forward without expecting recognition,” state officials said in announcing the launch of this year’s nomination cycle. “These awards allow us to shine a light on those who make our state stronger, kinder and more connected.”
Celebrating the People Behind Delaware’s Volunteer Network
Nonprofits and community groups across the state say the need for volunteers is never greater than during the holiday season, when food insecurity rises, seniors face greater isolation and families turn to local organizations for support.
From youth mentors and environmental stewards to medical volunteers, library helpers and neighborhood organizers, Delaware’s volunteer corps reflects a broad range of skills and passions. Past honorees have included:


Adult volunteers leading long-term mentoring and community health projects.


Youth volunteers creating school-based service programs and organizing donation drives.


Service groups and nonprofits coordinating food distribution, literacy initiatives and environmental cleanup efforts.


Lifetime achievers who have spent decades improving their communities through consistent, selfless service.


Over the past four decades, hundreds of Delawareans have been honored as role models who inspire others to give back.

A Call to Recognize Local Heroes

(Courtesy of U.S. Department of Agriculture)A parade of recent events has reminded us that a company town in Nebraska will no longer be keeping company there, vaccine “experts” recommend we relive the 1950s and, remarkedly, two U.S. senators can view the same bombing video and reach opposite conclusions. Surely, those headlines evoked some rage — a word that these days covers the gamut from snit to, well, actual rage.
Speaking of which, we also had this recently: The Oxford English Dictionary announced that “rage bait” was its Word of the Year. If you’re keeping score at home, the dictionary folks define rage bait as “online content deliberately designed to elicit anger or outrage by being frustrating, provocative or offensive, typically posted in order to increase traffic to or engagement with a particular webpage or social media account.” Chuffing for clicks, if you will.
No word on whether any lexicographer among the judges had cast a vote for “waste, fraud and abuse,” a tried and true bit of tedious phraseology too often used to slash and burn valuable government programs, which help millions. Babies and bathwater, that sort of thing.
Food as a ‘bargaining chip’
Any thought on “waste, fraud, and abuse” also lent itself to this space revisiting the current administration’s continued occupation of the moral lowground, a place it found to its liking during an extended government shutdown. Withholding food became a cruel negotiating strategy during those dark days.
The White House is back … and food is once again a bargaining chip.
Since last summer, the U.S. Department of Agriculture — citing efforts to eliminate the aforementioned “waste, fraud and abuse” — has demanded that states forward the names, dates of birth, home addresses, Social Security numbers and benefit totals of those enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP. About 42 million Americans, including 150,000 Nebraskans, depend on SNAP to put food on their tables.
Twenty-eight states with Republican governors — including Nebraska — have forwarded the data. The others have resisted, backed by a federal judge’s October decision barring the feds from collecting the information. Now, USDA has given the recalcitrants until this week to send the particulars or it would start withholding SNAP payments in those states, which happen to have Democratic governors. Go figure. 
Fraud does happen
To be clear: We have waste, fraud and abuse in government. SNAP is no exception. No one is arguing otherwise. USDA hasn’t released verifiable numbers but has thrown out figures gleaned from the states that have reported data to the feds to make its case for the rest of the data. Running those amounts rounded out to about 3% of recipients misusing funds. 
Also, the Government Accounting Office reports that EBT benefit cards, which lack chip technology, are prime targets for theft through cloning, skimming and other schemes. How obtaining states’ recipients data addresses those problems remains unclear.
Nor does the latest full frontal federal foray into combatting real or imagined financial inefficiencies inspire much confidence. The now-defunct Department of Government Efficiency, unaffectionately known as DOGE, promised taxpayers $1 trillion in savings by ferreting out “waste, fraud and abuse.” By the time the coders-doing-the-work-of-auditors logged out, however, the net gain wasn’t in the ballpark. DOGE itself estimated the number was $180 billion, but others, including NPR, could verify only a $2.3 billion savings.
Think about impacts
The cuts come with human costs, too. A Boston University epidemiologist and infectious disease researcher estimated that after DOGE shuttered the U.S. Agency for International Development, USAID, in July, more than 600,000 people had already died as a result of the cut.
Finally, wide and polychromatic is the palette of those who benefit from government programs through direct benefits, tax breaks, health insurance programs, subsidies, bailouts and forgivable loans. All those programs mean our tax dollars benefit people from the most vulnerable, who live paycheck to paycheck or homeless shelter to homeless shelter, to those inC-suites noodling how to use tax laws and regulatory processes to increase their bottom lines, to the millions of us in between. Surely we need all their data, too?
But that’s not really the question or the point. This is: Somehow, under the guise of finding the wasteful, the fraudulent and the abusive allegedly fleecing the USDA, our best idea is to threaten the food security of millions of Americans? 
We can’t do any better administratively? Morally? If that’s the bait that ignites rage, perhaps more of us should take it, insisting as we do that those with the power to find solutions to modern problems do so without the cruelty.
